No, I wouldn't stop the development of hyper intelligent machines even if I 
could, and out course I can't. I'm an oddball however and I assume that the 
vast majority of humans hate the idea of making an AI smarter than humans, 
it won't make a bit of difference. The momentum to produce such a thing is 
huge and getting stronger, nothing can resist it.

The Scientific, Economic and Military advantages I would gain by having a 
machine just a little smarter than you have are too huge to ignore. You'll 
worry that I'm getting ahead, I'll worry that you're getting ahead and we'll 
both worry that somebody else we've never heard of is getting ahead.  
Somebody somewhere will do it and things will never be the same.

That's not a math puzzle, it's masturbation.  Give me a useful
definition of what "base 1" means, and I'll give you whatever
answer springs from that definition.  Choose a different way
to define it, and maybe you'll get a different answer.  How
could either possibly be relevant to anyone or anything?

I've read him, and after the recent Cassini protests, I am rather disgusted
with him. He is no scientist, but a grandstanding politically correct
scientific faddist. I am not surprised that he cannot forsee AI sooner, nor
accept the potential for nanontech. It fits with his anti-nuke, anti-cassini
views, which are rather narrow and self serving.

This is a very extropic form of the judeo-christian meme-plex.  it is also a
form that established organized religions have done their best to stamp out for
the past 2000 years. Heinlein's _Stranger in a Strange Land_ examined this
possibility.

The most successful building birds use their claws like hands. Cetaceans have

Double congratulations!

Congratulations and thanks to Max for a job well done, and for your numerous articles, your insight, and most of all for your clear vision of the future that various
converging technologies will sure bring.  Through your work, extropian concepts are being recognized by a much broader public than when you first became Editor.

And Sasha!  What can I say? I stand in awe of your prodigious and encyclopedic intellectual output at several web addresses.  Congratulations.   At the risk of sounding
trite, you have some big shoes to fill, but no one I know of is more qualified, and more capable.

Extropy Lives!

Jim

I'm just fishing for a reference here ...

I seem to recall hearing about a paper, probably published in the past
two years, in which someone managed to prove that a teapotahedron
composed entirely out of non-uniform rational b-splines can actually
fit the definition of a platonic solid (albeit probably using a
non-Euclidean geometry :).

Do any of you guys remember this paper? If so, do you have a reference
for me to chase up?

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Rather than this number-base model
(which some believe is proper):

B10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
B9  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
B8  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
B7  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 
B6  0 1 2 3 4 5 
B5  0 1 2 3 4 
B4  0 1 2 3 
B3  0 1 2 
B2  0 1 
B1  0 

which defines the Base 1 digit as 0 (thus 
running the basic "tally-mark system" off the 
road), would this not be a better Base n model?:

First,
notice that in B2 2 = 10
            in B3 3 = 10
            in B5 5 = 10
          in B10 10 = 10

This means that in a system Bn, n correlates to 
the carry of 1 to the next column to the left.
We could also say that in B1 1 = 10, since
the "0" is valueless. This defines what 
might be an ideal number base model:


Number Base n (Bn) sytems:

B10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
B9  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10
B8  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 10
B7  1 2 3 4 5 6 10
B6  1 2 3 4 5 10
B5  1 2 3 4 10
B4  1 2 3 10
B3  1 2 10
B2  1 10
B1  10


Here, Base 1 is what it is, the 
"tally-mark system," in which 
every number in each column 
has the value of just 1.

We could also define
Bn (n = frequency that 
1 is carried to the column
to the left after number 1).

Ergo: 

Base 1

    1
   11 carried 1
  111 carried 1
 1111 carried 1
11111 carried 1

Base 2

   1
  10 carried 1
  11
 100 carried 1
 101
 110 carried 1
 111
1000 carried 1


Base 3

   1
   2
  10 carried 1
  11
  12
 100 carried 1
 101
 102
 110 carried 1

Base 5

   1
   2
   4
  10 carried 1
  11
  12
  13
  14
  20 carried 1

Base 10

  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
  7
  8
  9
 10 carried 1
 11
 12
 13
 14
 15
 16
 17
 18
 19
 20 carried 1


Is this model and analysis logical?

I am looking for someone who can translate ancient hebrew, they are 
transcripts from which the bible was writen.  Can anyone help?

Texas surgeons take out man's heart to treat cancer, then put it back 

HOUSTON - A rare form of cancer got an even rarer form of treatment when
doctors pulled a man's heart out of his body, snipped away a lemon-sized
cancerous tumour, and put his heart back in.

  IAN: Perhaps your right and the structure of 
  number systems is not important and thus not
  worth any analytical inquiry. It baffles
  me that several (perhaps most?) of the people
  on the ExI list believe science is not about
  truth, and defining the structure of number
  systems is as useful as masturbation.!?

  I recall Lee Daniel Crocker said last March:

>Don't tell me that holism is /true/. I don't give
>a damn. Tell me how I can /profit/ from it.


  IAN: You can profit from coercion, theft, and 
  fraud, does that make CTF preferable to truth? 
  Is X good, useful, and scientific only where 
  it puts money in your pocket?  It seems so.
  Maybe your right, maybe truth and inquiry
  should just be steamrolled by greed for 
  that which is more profitable. :(

  I believe that profits can be a consequence
  of inquiry into the nature/truth of things;
  but truth inquiry comes first. Animals go
  out into nature looking for the useful;
  do they perform science? No. Science 
  is the "nonuseful" asking of "Why
  is the sky blue, why is..."

  In the process of asking those questions 
  and finding their answers, lo and behold, 
  we discover new and useful things. The
  useful is a side effect of science.

  The spark of human intelligence is the 
  ability to look beyond the utilitarian,
  to ponder the meaning, structure, and
  causation of the natural world, even
  if the answers don't increase profits.
  This is what seperates man from maggots.

IN EXPERIMENTS, circuits already are smelling for illegal drugs in place of
canine patrols. French scientists are working on digital truffle-hunters,
potentially replacing pigs that have for centuries rooted out these
subterranean delicacies. In the commercial world, electronic noses serve as
candidates for hundreds of applications, from testing apples for freshness
to sniffing human breath for infections.But equipment so far is limited,
cumbersome and expensive. A small start-up here aims to change that.Cyrano
Sciences Inc. says it has technology that can be scaled down onto tiny
chips, much like integrated circuits. Starting next year, it plans to
market hand-held devices more the size of a bread slice than a bread
box.Cyrano’s first product, a limited version of more ambitious instruments
the company hopes to produce, is expected to be priced at about $3,000.
That is a small fraction of the $25,000 to $100,000 price of current
electronic noses, developed mostly in England and France.Cyrano’s
technology was developed by researchers at the nearby California Institute
of Technology. Various polymers, the basic substance of plastics, are mixed
with grains of carbon. The hardened mixture, laid over two tiny contacts,
creates a cell through which electrical current is passed. When exposed to
specific vapors, the polymer swells like a tiny sponge. This, in turn,
pulls the carbon grains apart, increasing the cell’s electrical resistance,
a change that can be detected and analyzed. Using a palette of polymer
cells, Cyrano says it can create a "nose" capable of discriminating between
a wide range of odors.The company has yet to build a prototype, but it is a
twist on existing technology, which relies on so-called conducting polymers
instead of Cyrano’s use of ordinary nonconducting polymers and carbon to do
much the same thing. Today’s "e-noses" are used mostly in laboratories and
occasionally on production lines. Millions of cheap, limited sensors are in
use, usually designed to detect specific gases or liquids. More-expensive
devices can identify hundreds of components in substances, but don’t give a
simple "yes" or "no" decision about product quality. Cyrano’s hopes its
profiles of scents do exactly that.At current prices and maturity, the
electronic-nose market is tiny: about $10 million in annual sales
world-wide, industry executives estimate. But a tumble in prices and a
surge in quality could change the picture. 	
"We don’t think there’s a huge market for the current big boxes, but
inexpensive, hand-held devices will be a breakthrough, we think," says
Steven Sunshine, vice president for research and business development at
closely held Cyrano. Imagine, suggests Mr. Sunshine, a day when electronic
noses might be used in home kitchens to check milk freshness or scan the
fridge for tired vegetables.That depends on production breakthroughs, and,
competitors argue, perhaps even improvements in basic design. For starters,
Cyrano must automate and miniaturize a hand production process. The
company’s first product calls for four separate chips with eight vapor
sensors on each, or a total of 32 sensors. Each sensor is a dot of
polymer/carbon mix about a millimeter square. Readings from these sensors
in turn are to be analyzed by a microprocessor trained to recognize certain
patterns as "smells," much as the human brain does with signals from the
sensors in our nose.That is just a crude beginning. Cyrano’s "nose on a
chip" calls for as many as 10,000 sensor cells on a single chip. "It’s not
a challenge that violates the laws for physics, but it’s a big challenge to
do again and again, day after day," says Richard S. Payne, Cyrano’s chief
technology officer. Tiny jetting equipment today can produce depositions
only about 20 times that size, Mr. Payne says.Cyrano’s competitors are
skeptical. "They can say anything they want to, but without a product, what
they’ll market is a complete mystery to us," says John Poling, president of
the U.S. unit of Alpha M.O.S. SA of Toulouse, France, a major, early
producer of electronic noses. Other companies include Neotronics Scientific
Ltd., based in Stansted, England, and AromaScan PLC, based in Crewe.As for
Cyrano’s assertion that its nose is more versatile and less sensitive than
others to humidity and temperature change, "that’s a claim we all make,"
says Jennifer Cyr, product specialist at AromaScan’s U.S. office. 	
	None of this has slowed Cyrano, formed a year ago with rights to Caltech’s
technology and $3 million in funding from the venture capital firms of Oak
Investment Partners, Marquette Venture Partners, and J & J Development
Corp., an investment arm of Johnson & Johnson. A second round of $9 million
in financing was raised from the same partners earlier this month.While
more will be needed when production starts, current funds will take the
company well down the road to volume production, company officials say.Off
in the future, an idea beckons: "Aroma profiles" of wines might be kept in
store computers, allowing customers to match them with computerized records
of favorite wines. Added patterns could be downloaded from the Internet,
giving new meaning to the "nose" of an uncorked bottle of wine. "It’s not
on our short list," Dr. Sunshine says, "but it’s certainly possible."

It is common in discussions of the theory of computing (turing machines
and related topics) to denote numbers by a string of repeated, identical
symbols, where the number of symbols in the string is the value of
the number.  There have to be other symbols, of course, so that the
starting and ending of the number can be indicated.  So you might have

	***%****#*******@

which could be a representation of 3 + 4 = 7.

I think it is confusing to carry over our common sense ideas of 1's
and 0's to this kind of notation.  The symbols acquire value based on
how they are being used.  Are the "*" above acting like 1's?  Like 0's?
Not necessarily either one.

My father can, but why would you want to?  Dissecting and invalidating the
Bible is not a whole lot of fun primarily because it is so easy.  It is
interesting how much of the Bible is incorrectly translated, or translated
in such a way as to completely lose the context of the original text.
There are many oft-repeated verses from the Bible that do not appear in the
original texts, mostly the consequence of centuries of content massaging.

If artificial life forms had just a
little more sentience than the average
human, they could easily see through the
myth of "rights." Preceding sentient
robots, one might imagine a robotic word
processor that could catalog the gamut
of human follies and provide coherent
deconstructions such that transhuman
extropians would not not to deal with
these elementary issues. We have the
stars to reach.

This philosophy resembles the Amish, who

Sounds like a pretty good question. But
again, since they would have enough
intelligence to surpass ideologies of
"rights", they would answer your
question with a salutary "no", and then
go on to more interesting things. Life
refuses to conform to the limits set for
it by concepts of "rights."

He was a black extropian, of course.

So were Mohammed, Krishna, Moses,
Buddha, and Lao Tzu.

The white devils (people with names such

It seems to me that what these Microsoft-monopoly and automation
threads have in common is that they engange in reasoning by fear
rather than optimism.  The automation thread, for example, is based
on the ridiculous premise that someone whose job is replaced by
a robot will become unemployed--clearly contrary to the evidence
that no machine have ever taken a job without creating five.
Work is after all, by definition, those activities you perform
for the benefit of others; even if you enjoy those activities, it
is generally the case that you are doing them to gain trade goods
to enable you to do something you like even more.  Therefore,
"losing one's job" to a machine should be a cause for celebration!
You have been loosed from the bonds of labor; even better, other
people have been as well.  Your human talents are now free to
pursue other fields, likely to be more lucrative and with less
work because of the benefits of automation.  The more machines
there are in the world, the less work humans have to do to keep
a high standard of living.  The homeless of today eat better than
the kings of yesterday precisely because of automation.

A similar fear is that of industries kept in place by government
coercion, such as copyrights and patents.  It is assumed that
those industries--publishing, music, software--will be decimated
if those "protections" are removed.  That's absolutely right--and
equally cause for celebration, as the human spirit of creativity
is released from the bonds of labor, free to create and influence
all other industries toward an even higher standard of living,
more art, more writing, and more software.

Nothing could be better for writers than to lose their present
coercively-supported jobs and be freed to create as they wished,
or use their creative talents in new ways.  Nothing could be
better for the government price-supported wheat farmer than to
lose his subsidy and be freed to use his talents in more
productive ways.  Nothing could be better for the politician
than to be voted out of a job and be freed to use his consensus-
building talents in a profitable enterprise.

All of these people living in fear of losing their coercively-
supported or manual-labor jobs are creating their own misery
for no reason, because what they fear most is precisely what
will give them what they most long for--wealth, freedom, and
personal satisfaction.

I personally work in the publishing industry full-time.  If
copyrights were abolished tomorrow, I'd lose my job at this
magazine--and some other new industry that could use my skills
would hire me at twice the price.  So why the hell would I
want to hold onto this archaic monopoly when it is holding
me back?

How do you know that "the subjective
experience of the machine is of interest
to it"?  The term /intelligence/
generally refers to the ability to solve
problems. In contrast, sentience means
the capability to appreciate, enjoy, and
otherwise relate to sensate input.
Robots work mechanically, i.e., within a
narrowly constrained area of action
without regard to the wider aspects of
the environment. Sometimes people
operate in this mode, for instance when
they concentrate on a single project,
blocking out extraneous distractions.

ya i suppose.  but *any* smart organism that
didnt have hands or something analogous would
kill for a good pair of them.  {8^D

the direction of this thread is this:  as advanced
beings, we see the value of having senses and
capabilities beyond what evolution has provided.
so we develop these:  "eyes" that can see at higher
and lower frequencies than ours, "hands" that can
manipulate huge boulders and atoms, "brains" that
can calculate repetitively for indefinte times without
getting tired or making mistakes.

we will eventually make extensions of ourselves
that will sense and do just about every imaginable
thing.  i suspect et will do likewise, regardless of
where its evolutionary took it.  spike

Jesus was not black.  Neither was Mohammed or Krishna or Buddha or Lao
Tzu.  They were of their race.  Historically of course.  Symbolically
they are of any race who accepts their doctrine.  Get this through
your head!

Race has nothing to do with doctrine.  Every doctrine I've read that
was by a 'religious leader' said nothing about race.  It is (was)
always about how YOU live YOUR life.  Racial racism is a very Bad
Thing when it concerns religion.  Give me one instance of where any
religious leader imposed racism in their doctrine.

Perhaps so, but what evidence do you
have that maggots "ponder the meaning,
structure, and causation of the natural
world"?

Oh, wait! I see. You mean to say that
maggots *don't* do that. Well, neither

I've read him. He harps about "Type I,
Type II, and Type III" civilizations.
But since these "types" of civilization
exist mostly in the far distant future,
and since Kaku ignores the eventuality
of a Singularity (with its explosion of
incomprehensible consequences), he
completely misses the point that
*accurate* long-range projections about
the future of science and technology
must await the presence of more powerful
thinking machines, i.e., artificial
intelligence -- which he postpones for
another half century.

Religion is such an inherent part of humanity is it amazing so many so
called 'intellectuals' disregard it.

I honestly pity anyone who has not read or seen James Campbell.

In any event, the 'Christian' religion seems most stated.

May I remind all readers there *WAS NO MOSAIC TRADITION* prior to the
'captivity', which was an historic event of around 586 BCE.  After
this time the powers that be (Babylonian emperors) let the captives go
back to their respective homelands.  Judah (the 'Israelites') were of
such non-importance *NO* mention of them is made in *ANY* text of the
period.  Several hundred thousand Jews is *NOTHING* compared to the
millions of Egyptians or the Assyrians or the Hittites or whatever.  

The most amazing thing is that this insignificant race has managed to
promote itself into a world power.

Moses is a derivative of Ramses a derivative of Ra Moses...meaning
(methinks) Son of the Sun, born of water.

All of which is a derivative of the ancient (many thousands of
year)pre-Jewish history of the Babylonian mythologies.

There was Gilgamesh, looking for immortality, surviving the flood. 
(I'll remember the Babylonian 'Noah' any day, I just can't at the
moment.)
There was Sargon, obtaining the Code of Law from 'god'.

There are dozens of other examples.

The entire Jewish/Christian mythos was stolen directly from Babylon,
who's mythos may have been stolen from even ancient traditions.  The
'flood' has been possibly related to the flooding of the Black Sea
during the warming period after the Great Glacial Period.

Extropians should recognize and teach these phenomenon based on fact. 
Whether you believe in religion or not, religion WILL BE a factor in
human psyche for many generations.  It is up to those able to
interpret the symbology to instruct those who cannot.

This will be doubly important to those who may opt to 'upload' and not
able to understand.  There will be a whole new 'religion' when (and
if) this happens.  'Do yo believe in human?' will be a prominent
question.

Do not underestimate the power of history, humanism, or what has
always been accepted.

Depends on what you mean by the myth of rights.  I would agree that
inherent self-evident inviolable human rights are mythical; however, I also
think that we maximize utility when we respect the rights of others.  Is
this a myth?  Not as far as I can tell, though I may be wrong.  The point
being that perhaps hyperintelligent life forms wouldn't NECESSARILY squish
on our rights.

I agree.  That's why I'm in favor of creating robots (and children) who are
smarter than we are.

Again, I'm not so sure that they would just ignore rights altogether.
They'd surely reject the idea of rights as an inviolable moral code, but as
to whether they would respect them anyway?  That's another issue entirely.

I've been thinking about the issue of antibiotic resistance and it occurred to
me that the best strategy for the human race would be;

1) Tight control on the use of antibiotics in animals.
2) A free hand for geneticists who want to breed resistance into animals - good
luck to them
3) Use the best bits from what we learn by messing with the animals DNA into
ourselves.

The above strategy maximises returns for humans.  My reasoning is that while we
may be able to 'win' this war with ever more expensive and complex antibiotics,
we'll never be able to shift lots of the stuff to poor people like we can with
the older antibiotics.  We have got to stop using antibiotics in animals
otherwise it's *our* biodiversity that is at risk.

If we banned the use of antibiotics in animals, can you imagine how much money
would immediately shift to genetic research ?  Farmers cannot produce food at
modern levels of productivity without antibiotics.  If their only option was
breeding (with a helping hand from Dr. DNA)  then you can be sure that
capitalism will 'do it's thing' for us here.

Things are actually more like they are
now than they ever have been before.

The incomprehensibility of a
super-intelligent super-organism -- a
"metaman" -- does not preclude its
creation. But if what the human race has
done to unpopular genii of the past
indicates what might happen to Metaman,
than it (he? she?) will probably suffer
a fate similar to that of say Galileo
or... fill in the heretic of your own
choice. I guess the only way to find out
is to build the artificial life form (or
grow it). Cultural creatives such as
extropians may have a slight edge as
early adaptors to a world populated by
liberated mechanical genius. Or does
"mechanical genius" constitute an
oxymoron? Before building this golem,
maybe we should first indulge in a bit
of special ethnic cleansing: get rid of
the nincompoops who overpopulate the
Earth with their idiotic progeny.

Cheers,

J R

The Shinto religion has many Japan-specific mythologies: for example,
the divine couple Izanagi and Izanami giving birth to the Japanese
islands.  I should hardly have to mention the Exodus, in which God
specifically instructed the nation of Israel to occupy the promised
land by burning the natives and their cities to the ground.  That's
two off the top of my head.

Ouch! That hurts. Getting such
certainties through one's head must
surely cause some brain damage.
Apparently you don't have a problem with
that. Please provide a recent photo or
other evidence so that the rest of the
world can share your certainty that
"Jesus was not black." Of course /black/
does not mean literally the color of
coal. Similarly, /white/, when used to
describe Europeans does not mean the
color of snow. Anyway, the description
of Jesus (Christ, not Rodriguez, we
assume) as an extropian should have
clued you in that this comment had no
intention of raising any heated debate.
It intended nothing more Earth-shaking
than a mild jest.

>
>Race has nothing to do with doctrine.

Please tell that to the millions of
racists (especially in the former
Yugoslavia) who have little else,
besides racism, to offer in their
particular doctrines. As a Jew, J.C.
came from a matrilineal race, which to
this day uses its doctrine of racism to
define itself. This has nothing to do
with the teachings of J.C., because he
(as one might hope most extropian
advocates) opposed all doctrinaire
attitudes.

Happy to see you put the term /religious
leader/ in quotes. The people listed in
the previous post (Mohammed, Buddha, Lao
Tzu, Krishna, Moses, and Jesus Christ),
IMHO, had more in common with the
tenants of extropy than with
religiosity. As far as I can tell, the
so-called "religious leaders" constitute
the dregs of humanity who live as
parasites on the words of truly
enlightened masters such as those
aforementioned. Give me liberty or give
me death, but spare me from mixing up
with the dragons of dogma and doctrine.

there any data on this that can be released without jeopardizing doctor-patient
confidentiality (which I believe should apply)

If it turns out that the average cryonics patient could actually afford to pay a
lot more, here is a strategy that might allow capitalism to give us a helping
hand;

1)  Instead of $100k for suspension, we make the client pay $1M.
2)  Where possible, 9 other people who have medical similarities to the client
but cannot afford suspension will be offered cryonic suspension for free.

Done properly, we'd pick 9 people who die before the client and are suspended.
Similarly when the day comes to re-animate we'd do it by FIFO.  You can see the
obvious commercial appeal of this to the client who put up the $1M as he can be
sure that the procedure is being done in the best possible way in both
directions !  Similarities in medical condition + storage technique gives our
paying customer an edge.

For every 100 rich dudes who got suspended, the cryonics industry would freeze
1000 people.  This would lead to much more rapid advancement in the field as I
think one of the biggest things holding it back at the moment is the lack of
numbers.  As a marketing idea it is very powerful but caution should be taken.
Lets not have images of a cryonicist walking through a public hospital calling
for poor volunteers with liver damage !

Would a company that offered this service actually attract *more* clients
because of the more personal guarantee that they provide to the people who put
up the money ?

As for the volunteers who get it for nothing, well, TANSTAAFL !!

"respect them anyway?"  Hmmm.... Having
rejected the notion of rights (by which
we might mean the "just and proper" --
or at least customary -- claims or
entitlements that people invent to
protect their property or activities),
it seems to this brain (the one typing
this) that in reality "rights" means
whatever an entity can get away with.
Correlating to the concept of "Manifest
Destiny" which gave Europeans the
"right" to take possession of an already
inhabited continent, one might foresee
that an even craftier machine
intelligence might come up with some
brilliant reasoning to justify
exterminating a major portion of the
human population who present an
inconvenience by their existence. No
doubt a few humans (not to mention the
UnGreat Satan Saddam Hussein) have
entertained the same kind of
justification for exterminating masses
of humans. But mass murderers of the
human kind haven't yet had enough
intelligence to figure out how to do it.

Bottom line: We can find plenty of
reason to fear malevolent
super-intelligence, but malevolent
ordinary intelligence may wipe us out
first.

Cheers,

First of all, the so-called Izagani/Izamnami 'religion' is not a world
religion.  It is specific to Japan, and very likely to only a specific
locality in Japan.  I beg forgiveness for not being specific.  Any
'religion' of less than a million I reserve 'cult' for (nowadays).  In
a populous country like Japan, you can quadruple this number.  At the
time of the spread of these religions, what was the number of their
respective followers?

This is the same reason I do not consider the followers of "Reverend
Jim Jones" a religion.  He had followers also.

Second of all, I may have forgotten to mention there are only three
'religions' that promotes murder of others, and they all come from the
middle-east:  Judaism, Christianity, and Shiite Musliminism.

These three religions share the same mythos.  ALL other major
religions I can think of (forbidding errant local religions which may
number in the millions) share common concepts.  That being the major
'gods' are those of the cosmos.  The local (tribal) 'gods' are
secondary.  This is exempt from the 'Semite' religions where there is
no 'seasons' so there is no 'god of rain', 'god of fertility', 'god of
this-or-that'.  Well, Astarte was a goddess that originally had the
same power as 'YHWH' or 'Yaweh' but her cult was cut down vehemently
by the Levite Jews.

In the desert 'Semite' tribes the 'tribal 'god'' was supreme.

Ergo, YHWH became 'THE GOD'.

When the 'Greeks' (Macedonians) or 'Romans' or 'Celts' conquered
another people they recognized 'who you call Dagda we call Jupiter'.
Or some equivalent.  They merged.   Religion was *NOT* the reason they
conquered.

 If they are in fact transcripts of pre-christian texts then the
probabilities are that they are written in Aramaic rather than Hebrew.
My suspicion is that they may be copies of excerpts from the Dead Sea
Scrolls (If not they may be forgeries. There are a lot of them being
produced in the middle east and sold to ignorant tourists.)
If they are copies of Dead Sea Scroll excerpts then they have already
been translated by numerous people -- actually mistranslated in many
instances, but that's another story -- of various degrees of
scholarship.
You may wish to check with the Archeology department of any major
University. Most have legitimate experts in this area.

On the other hand, avoid so-called experts at most small christian bible
colleges. Mostly, they don't know what they're talking about, but talk
they do, and they never seem to stop providing massive amounts of
misinformation and unsupported, unscientific opinion .

I don't think there is much data about it, but my overall impression
is that they in general are not very wealthy.

Sounds dubious for several reasons. Cost doesn't seem to be a major
deterrent to cryonics (it is after all usually paid with an insurance
policy), the main problem is that most people are hesitant to take the
step and actually sign up (or go through with the process). Cryonics
also has a somewhat shaky reputation; the above scheme would also make
the claim that it is only the rich who are frozen appear more likely
("And they freeze poor people to use as test subjects!"), alienating
even more people.

yup.  we may be seeing the fear that the five jobs

Okay, now we have:

Truth = Physical Reality

So, if you seek the ultimate truth, that
equates to: you seek the physical
reality. But since /you/ constitute part
of the physical reality, knowing
yourself equals knowing the truth.
Consequently, knowing the truth
correlates to knowing yourself.
Furthermore, "the truth will make you
free" parallels "you will make you free"
or "physical reality will make you
free." Well, no one has called me "free"
lately, but I like to think of myself as
/reasonable/, if not really inexpensive.

Only as wealthy as most other middle-class American working folks,
which is to say wealthier than most of the world, but wouldn't know
an Armani suit from a JC Penney.  I drive a Dodge Neon; I rent a
house in Sacramento; I don't have any significant savings.  I pay
(total) about $60-$70 a month for Cryonics (or, to be more accurate,
I am billed $60-%70 a month, and I'm a month behind on payment :)

OK.  So what DID you mean by this?  "I also think that the question of
whether humans should give rights to machines is moot, the question of
whether machines will give rights to humans is not."  Since we can't stop
the creation of hyper-intelligent robots, nor do we stand any chance of
controlling them once we do, this doesn't seem like a very interesting
question at all.

All religions begin as cults. If all you
care about are the numbers of adherents,
then follow the dictum, "Fifty million
horse flies can't be wrong, so eat
dung."

consider the followers of "Reverend

Yeah, well, when J.C. had as many years
of practice as Jim Jones had, the total
number of his disciples came to twelve.
The difference (besides the fact that
Jones had drug-mush for brains and no
real message to impart) in the number of
disciples has no bearing on the verity
of the teaching. Likewise, just because
only a handful of people understand the
Special Theory of Relativity doesn't
make it true or false. Hundreds of
millions followed the nonsense spouted
by Karl Marx, but that didn't make it
any less nonsensical.

The other three major relgious
traditions, namely Buddhism, Hinduism,
and Taoism, also come from the
Middle-East. For this reason, people who
speak of "Eastern religions" find it
difficult to name any "Western
religions." They all come from the East
or the Middle-East."

At present, one of my ventures is in a patent dispute with a large,
government connected corporation. They filed a patent on a concept we
developed some time before we filed, but after they could have seen some of
our preliminary work. We have spent five years developing this technology,
and they would like to legally steal it. By the way - our patent was issued,
and they brought an 'interference' suit to force the PTO to decide who is
legally entitled to coverage.

As long as it takes large amounts of capital to develop a patent or
copyrighted work, we will need this protection, as unscrupulous persons are
then free to let you do the designing and then sell your idea without giving
you any value.

When anyone can make anything instantly, and no one has to earn money to
survive, then copyrights and patents can be dispensed with, and there will
be no business or commerce at all.

Certain modern and late 19th century preachers in the Southern US were and
are quite racist. I have heard the Southern Baptist Church was set up to
give whites a place to go after many blacks took up the original Baptist faith..

I am not so sure the Ku Klux Klan does not qualify as a offshoot cult from
the SB's..

Appetite 30: 199-210 1998
"The Effect of Soup on Satiation"

Abstract:

   We compared the influence of three solid/liquid preloads to a no-preload
condition given at lunchtime on hunger ratings and energy intake of the
lunch and subsequent dinner in 12 lean and 10 overweight young men. The
preloads (vegetables and water, strained vegetable soup, chunky soup) were
of the same composition and volume but differed in distribution of
nutrients between the liquid and the solid phases, and in the size of solid
particles. Hunger ratings were reduced by the preloads; there was a
significantly greater suppression of hunger after the chunky soup than
after the vegetables and water. In both groups, the soups reduced energy
intake at lunch, although the chunky soup had the most effect. In the
overweight subjects, a reduced lunch intake was also followed by a reduced
dinner intake. The benefit to weight control of large particles in soup
should be evaluated.

Additional quote from the text of the report:

  "Two main results emerged from the present study. In both groups of
subjects, consumption of 397 kJ (95 kcal) of either vegetables or a
strained vegetable or chunky soup as the first course of a meal reduced the
total energy intake at that meal with respect to the no-preload condition.
Although the reduction was slight and not significant after the vegetables
and strained vegetable soup, a significant reduction of around 20% of total
intake was noted after the chunky soup.
  Second, in the overweight subjects whose lunch intake had been reduced by
the chunky soup preload, intake at the subsequent dinner was also
significantly reduced (-12% relative to the no-preload condition). Thus in
the overweight subjects, the consumption of the chunky soup used as the
first course of an ad libitum lunch led to a significant 15% decrease in
the total energy intake at lunch and dinner."

Last paragraph of the report:

  "Soup consumption and particularly consumption of soups containing solid
particles resistant to trituration may be beneficial in weight reduction
programmes, provided that the phenomenon is not subject to habituation. The
finding of Jordan et al. (1981) that weight loss was significantly
correlated with the frequency of soup consumption over a 10-week period
suggests that the phenomenon is not short-lived."

Just what is your point?  You do not seem to refute anything I say,
just argue uselessly.

Point out something or shut up.


And, if you consider the Indian peninsula or China the middle east
then either you or I have to re-evaluate geography.

The deserts of the middle east have nothing to do with the jungles of
India, nor the forests of China.

Let's just hope that human intelligence augmentation arrives before powerful
AI. It would be a shame to die on the threshold of ascension by the hand of

Rules, not tools, eh?

Since it is the DEVELOPMENT of an idea, not its distribution, which is
costly, why not charge money for its development?  In other words, couldn't
you develop your idea at full cost and then, since you've got the only one,
sell it (using encryption and various other privacy tools) to the highest
bidder?  Wouldn't that recompense you the cost of your idea?  And wouldn't
that prevent people from "stealing" it, without creating a government
enforced monopoly?

The current patent strategy is comparable to leaving your front door open
and unlocked and putting out a big sign on your front lawn saying "No
trespassers.  Violators will be prosecuted."  This strategy is more like
putting a LOCK on your door and putting a big sign on your lawn saying
"Just you TRY to get in.  Prosecutors will be violated."  :)

 The extreme form of your fear (millions starve to death because technology
has been made obsolete) is fairly easy to discredit. Suppose 10 million
people were laid off tomorrow because a new invention drastically reduced
demand for the jobs they had been doing. Instead of starving, wouldn't
they be better off forming their own economy, using simple technology
and trading among themselves? (Not that that's likely to be the best they
could do, it's merely the simplest to describe).
 I see no sign that automation has been causing or is likely to cause a
significant number of people to need to work harder to maintain a stable
standard of living. As to how hard people will need to work in order to
upload, I don't know.

You last statement is debatable.  I'm currently working on a paper (which I'll
present later on completion), which discusses the distinct possibility of
creating collaborative transhuman networks capable of insulating/immunizing
themselves against possible malign super-AI long enough to develop and aquire
access to nanotechnology that is sufficient to upload and/or enhance our
neural-nets to compete on a level playing field with said AI's.  (boy, that was
a mouthful!).

Problem? What problem? "No need" you
say? I don't even want "less qualified
people" around. We'd have a better
world, IMNSHO, if we created a society
without less qualified people
altogether. <g>

But seriously folks, if extropianism has
anything to do with "a society that has
no need for
its less qualified members", then Mexico
must have a huge extropian head start
over the US. Or do you believe that the
hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens
crossing the border into California,
Texas, and Arizona all have advanced
engineering degrees and doctorates in
computer programming? I don't think so.

The sooner (American) extropians
"declare victory" the sooner less
qualified migrants will get the message,
and stop pouring into America. For every
displaced worker in the (extropian) US
and UK, you can count five in
(anti-extropian) countries.

The newsreels I've seen of
quasi-capitalist China indicate that
displaced workers from anywhere only
need to learn Chinese to get plenty of
jobs there.

On second thought, I guess I rather
prefer a society that has no need for
its less qualified members. After all --
consider the alternative, i.e., a
society that *needs* its less qualified
members. Such a loopy society would not
last long.

Cheers,

J R

I am currently working on a paper with the temporary title of:  "Collaborative
Transhumanist Networks as Immunizing Agents Against Super-AI Viral Outbreaks" or
words to that effect.

I have reason to believe, which I'm elaborating in my paper, that networks of
transhumans have the potential of competing with super-AI's long enough to aquire
intelligence augmentation (presumably nanotechnology) sufficient to compete on a
level playing field with possible malign Super-AI's.

Actually, you don't need to go back that
far to see what would happen with such a
culture clash scenario. Just a few
centuries ago Europeans traveled to a
distant and primitive land... and
conquered it. "A couple hundred of us"
technocrats could probably whip Medieval
asses in less time than it took for
yankees to build a transcontinental
railroad from scratch.

Conclusion: Myth may have its power, but
science kicks butt (and saves lives when
appropriate).

>OH, come on! Every engineer knows, the
true god (devil??) is named Murphy,
>and is a redheaded Irishman. His laws
govern the cosmos.


Indeed, Murphy's Law reigns up there
with Catch-22. Perhaps you've also heard
of Belefant's Law, which states: You
can't do anything without having to do
something else first.

To illustrate, I submit the following:

It starts simply. The other day the
lights in our house flickered, and
finally half went out. Knowing something
about electricity, I ascertained that
power to one leg of our 220-volt service
was gone.

Complete power failure on one leg
usually indicates a power supply
problem, so I called the power company.
They said they had no recorded power
outages in my area so they would sent
out a crew. The crew came, verified the
outage and said they would trace it back
to see if it was a power company failure
or a problem in the house wiring.

the connection point between the power
company's responsibility is the meter
box. The power company crew opened the
meter box removed the meter to check
forward and backward from that point. In
order to check the lines they had to
access the meter terminals. Upon
examination they said that the meter
terminals in the box were corroded and a
check was impossible until the box and
terminals were replaced.

GETS WORSE... I contacted an electrician
to replace the box, and the power
company crew waited until the
electrician who does much of my
electrical work arrived. He looked at
the meter box and the power company crew
and said that only specifically licensed
electricians are allowed to work on
meter boxes. He gave me the name of a
qualified electrician and left.

The second electrician came, looked at
the box and said  the power company
would have to turn off the power at the
transformer so that he could work. The
power company crew chief went to turn
off the power at the transformer. He
walked over to the pole that held the
transformer, looked up, and said "uh
oh!" I knew we were in deep doo-doo.

FROM SUBLIME TO RIDICULOUS... The crew
chief went on to explain that because
the lightning arrester support has
corroded, the lightning arrester would
have to be fixed in place before he
could turn off the power. Furthermore,
his truck with a "cherry picker" was too
small -- he would have to call for a
bigger truck and another crew.

The bigger truck, with another crew,
arrived. The crew decided that some
trees would have to be trimmed for
access to the pole. A tree trimming crew
was called.

Meanwhile, the electrician said that he
couldn't replace the meter box until he
got a permit from the town's building
official. As it was an emergency, he
thought he could get it immediately, and
off he went.

...AND BEYOND. After the trees were
properly trimmed, the big truck's crew
found that the only way they could get
to the lightning arrester with their
"cherry picker" was to park the truck in
the street. The street is a main artery,
so the police had to be called to block
and divert traffic. It began to look
like an IEEE convention. Finally,
traffic was diverted, the trees were
trimmed, the lightning arrester fixed,
the power turned off, the meter and
meter box replaced, the power was turned
back on, and the lights in my house
worked. It took all day, two town
agencies, three power company crews, two
electricians, and more than a dozen men
to do it, but I felt lucky. It didn't
rain.

Cheers,

J R

Who would buy such a pig in a poke?
Without distribution which includes
demonstrations and samples, no one could
know anything about the product. But if
you mean to accumulate capital from
venture capitalists, then yes,
investment does proceed along those
lines -- not for development of
unpatented products, but rather for
production and distribution of patented
innovations.

Even government enforced monopolies
(government constitutes the biggest of
the big monopolies, BTW) expire after a

Yes. I agree with you what you've said here, but it doesn't address the fundamental
challenge I first proposed.  Beyond the fact that I am playing devil's advocate, I'm
trying to elicit positive constructive scenarios of which otherwise very intelligent
people on this list haven't seen free-markets address.My point is that when you
combine free-markets with automation you get an increase in overall wealth - a good
thing.  However over the last 5-10 years, this increase in wealth has continued to
trickle towards the top.  At last count, 94% of the wealth in the US is in the hands
of the top 20%.  The greatest discrepancy in US history.  So my challenge to
free-market advocates is to demonstrate how free-markets can bring increased
prosperity to *more* people rather than concentrating that new wealth into the hands
of fewer and fewer people.

I doubt anyone on this list can argue that technology is not accelerating.  Along with
this acceleration we see an increasingly stringent and rapid requirement for
re-training.  The IT industry is a testament to what I'm saying.   The problem in the
IT sector is obvious.  The change is so fast, that the market is finding it
increasingly difficult to find qualified applicants who can do the job.  According to
recent surveys, there are 10 vacancies for every qualified applicant; and for every
100 applicants only 2 are hired.  Those that do get hired have seen their wages
increase more than 20% a year.  A vindication of supply and demand economics.

To then say that the millions rendered superfluous in the retail sector (thru
e-commerce) will find new ones in the information sector is ludicrous.

Obviously many won't take starvation lying down, that's why we already have the
economic system you describe in inner cities.  Minority groups, having neither the
skill or access to traditional routes to success, have had to resort to drug dealing
and theft in order to survive. For them is this progress?  If the economy is doing so
well, why is the average wage adjusted for inflation not gone up any significant
amount?

Why are there more and more 2-parent working families?  Why has the average work week
been increasing?  Why did the average wage in the US  steadily decrease from 1971 to
1996?  Everyone I know says they are working harder than ever before just to make ends
meet.  Why would they be saying that?  I'm not sure I have an answer to that, which
was why I was hoping the more economically adept on this list could provide some
insights.

Reality check.

Based on operating expenses, federal, state, and local governments 
own approximately 40% of the wealth in the US.  These governments, 
allegedly, represent ALL of us, rich and poor alike.  This means 
that, in theory, the least wealthy 80% own 32% of the wealth in the 
US by THIS MEANS ALONE.  And if reality does not mesh with this 
theory, the solution obviously is not in the hands of the government.

Outside of that, the claim that 94% of *other* wealth is owned by the 
richest 20% even begins to be plausible only if one excludes pension 
funds and mutual funds from consideration.  Since pension funds and 
mutual funds collectively own  over half the stock and bond markets, 
this is obviously a major exclusion and needs to be justified.

Well, take for example the ultrasound sensor for remote imaging of
concealed weapons, which it seems Chuck Kuecker was on about:

"A breadboard ultrasound sensor has been developed for remotely detecting
and imaging concealed weapons. The breadboard sensor can detect metallic
and non-metallic weapons concealed on a human body under heavy clothing at
ranges up to 8 m and can image concealed weapons at ranges up to 5 m."

So long as fraud laws remain in place, (so you know I'm not selling you

Alternately, I'm told zero knowledge interactive proofs can help here,
though to be perfectly honest, I don't understand how.  ZKIPs are a
mechanism used by cryptographers to prove that you know something without
revealing what you know.  I've heard it claimed that they can be used to
prove anything which can be proved in formal logic.  I have a link to a
document which is supposed to demonstrate/prove this, but it's a bit over
my head.  For the idly curious:

I challenge your implicit assertion that mimicry is theft.  It is not at

Why should the creators make a profit on distribution, which is cheap,
rather than on development, which is expensive?  Why can't I sell my
expensive idea to the highest bidder, rather than inflating the price of
the final product and giving me the returns?

These industries are not "kept in place" by government coercion,

We should celebrate the death of all forms of publication, plus news

A thousand years ago, every artist was directly rewarded by the 
people whom he directly delivered his art to, but could do nothing 
about copying and could not do any form of indirect delivery.

Today, some artists sell their art to people who choose to make it 
freely available, while others receive indirect payment from each 
individual consumer -- who also receives the art indirectly.  Only a 
tiny fraction of art revenues are related to art delivered directly 
from artist to consumer.

A thousand years ago, only a tiny fraction of households contained 
any art whatsoever that wasn't made by its residents.  Today, nearly 
every home does.

Eliminate copyrights and patents, and indirect payment ceases to 
exist; so the artists who live off that indirect payment -- the large 
majority of those who can live off their art at all -- must turn to 
other fields.  They will produce less art, or no art at all.

How does driving artists away from art and into other fields, produce 
more art?

There is a substantial difference between being protected from 
looters who want to receive the benefit of your work without paying 
you (the writer as described), and being protected *by* looters who 
compel others to pay you without receiving the benefit of your work 
(the farmer as described).

>  Nothing could be better for the politician

This is easily disproven: the politician is free, today, to walk away 
from politics and use his consensus-building talents in a profitable 
enterprise.  Look how many choose to remain politicians until they 
either retire or can no longer find continued employment in politics.

And again, the politician (the one currently holding elective office, 
anyway) is protected *by* looters, not *from* looters.  He receives 
payment taken by force from people who not only do not *receive* his 
services, but do not *desire* his services -- or even consider them 
to be services.

The novel-writer simply wants to be paid by the novel-reader.  If the 
reader chooses to not read that novel, its author expects no payment. 
 But novel-writers who receive no payment and have no reason to 
expect any payment in the future, tend to stop writing novels.  
Without copyrights, there would be no expectation of payment.

And while I am sure we all agree that 90% of all art produced today 
is crap, we don't necessarily agree on *which* 90%.

Well, lemme rephrase. :)  *You* may not have
to trade value for value, but no one acts without
a perceived value in doing so.  People work on 
Linux for various reasons, but all of them get 
something out of it, whether its the satisfaction
of having other people know they did something,
just having fun coding, or working on something
for their own use.  Netscape needs to create a 
situation which sells server software, and so they
will (if successful) sell enough servers to recoup
their investment in giving away browsers.  Do you
imagine that the Red Cross' volunteers don't feel
that the work they do is worth doing?
At any rate, I think that any system based on 
widespread, expensive charity will fail, and that
is what I meant by the original statement.

IMO the US represents people *very* poorly because of the huge discrepancy between the
number of people in congress versus the general population - what is it now 450,000 to 1?
Thus the 40% of wealth you talk about does not represent the individual very well at all,
and might as well be considered theft.

I couldn't agree more.  That's why I'm eliciting responses from free-market guru's!

As far as I know, the figure quoted by NPR last week does include those pension and mutual
funds.  You are also neglecting the fact that any poor person statistically has a lot less
invested in any particular mutual fund than a rich person.  So these types of percentages
and ratios can still remain.

What if.. you're a month late but they freeze you anyway...when you wake up..$70
over 500 years interest... you'll owe big time !  Something around the size of a
third world country debt I think.

Better keep *that* bill up to date :-)

We don't have any cryonics organisations in Australia.  To me this is all
theoretical I guess.

No, there is a distinct difference.  Consider it in terms of economic
supply and demand curves.  The very first copy of a book is quite expensive
to produce, but subsequent copies are quite cheap.  The first copy of a
book requires time, creative energy and artistic skill, whereas subsequent
copies can be produced in bulk and require considerably less innovation.
And perhaps most important of all, the artist very rarely actually DOES any
of the work involved in making copies of the book; this is a job best left
to printers.

We should expect, then, that the artist should be paid for the services
rendered, for creating the very first copy of the book, because THAT copy
actually required the artist's services.  Art by commission is one such
example of an artist being paid for creating art, rather than for producing
copies of art.  Auctioning the first copy to the highest bidder would be
another strategy.

However, once multiple people have a copy, the artist and anyone else who
has a copy of the book fall into nearly perfect competition.  If the artist
offers a higher price for a copy of the book than anyone else, there is no
reason to buy from the artist; other copies are perfect substitutes.  Since
we're in nearly perfect competition, the market price for the book should
be no greater than the marginal cost, the cost to make one more book.  This
cost, of course, is no  greater than the cost of printing.

Since an individual copy of a book costs almost nothing when it is in the
hands of many, but costs much more when it is only in the hands of the
artist, then it seems reasonable that the artist should make a profit
EARLY, when the book is being created, rather than later, when the book is
being printed.

A thousand years ago, people were much much poorer than they are today.  So
the fact that there was very little art around, which has always been
classified as a luxury, surprises me not a bit.

Also, it's important that we separate the supply of NEW art and the supply
of COPIES of art.  While we might conceivably see a contraction in the
supply of new art as a result of the elimination of intellectual copyright,
the supply of copies of art would expand dramatically, as they would only
cost as much as it costs to reproduce the art.  We should expect to see
LESS art in people's homes under copyright, not more.

With intellectual copyright, we get more new art, at a lower price than it
is worth, and fewer copies, at a higher price than they are worth.  Without
intellectual copyright, we get less new art, at the high price it deserves,
and more copies, at the low price they are worth.

Less art, but at a higher price, thanks to auctioning/commision.  It is not
clear, then, that the artists' revenues will contract.

>How does driving artists away from art and into other fields, produce 
>more art?

See above.

Poor example.  How about this one:  The aviation industry, having a hard
time cartelizing, convinced the government to do it for them, setting up
the Civil Aeronautics Administration in 1938.  (Later to become the Civil
Aeronautics Board, CAB.)  Until deregulation in the 70s, it was allowed to
set interstate airline rates and prevent new interstate airlines from
forming.  By setting a minimum price which no member of the cartel could
legally break and by preventing new airlines from forming, the cartel had a
coerced monopoly over interstate aviation.

Were passengers receiving the benefit of interstate transportation?
Obviously.  Were they paying a fair rate for this benefit?  No, absolutely
not.

In this case, by not allowing new companies to make copies, the artist
gains a coerced monopoly over book copies; as a result, the artist can set
a much higher price than the copies are actually worth.

>The novel-writer simply wants to be paid by the novel-reader.

The novel-reader is not buying the work of the novel-writer.  The
novel-reader is receiving the work of the novel-printer.

Think of it this way:  the novel writer is making the mold from which
millions of cheap statues can be formed.  Since this is true, the writer
should be paid for the mold, not for the statues.

>If the

Again, the writer CAN expect payment.  The author can write by commission,
or auction the work to the highest bidder.

>And while I am sure we all agree that 90% of all art produced today

That's why we let the market decide.

Actually, this is the best reason of all to abandon intellectual property.
90% of what's written today is crap because authors don't bear the full
cost of a failed writing enterprise.  If authors DID bear this cost, we
might see the supply of new novels contract while the quality increases,
just as we see in investment when we pull out the safety nets.  Meanwhile,
more copies of those novels which have been produced can be sold cheaply
and to a wider audience.  

So in conclusion, we get more copies of fewer but better novels without
copyright, and fewer copies of more but worse novels with copyright.

Care to try this again?

I quite agree . . . the very reason I don't contribute at all.

The "orginal" extropian list and attendant interaction was very different than
it is
today. Perhaps this has been irretrievably lost . . .

For myself it is "yes" to all of these, preferably distributed among a set
of drugs so I can "tune" my dosage to fit my current needs. I suspect that
most of the attributes found in this list can indeed be modified by drugs
which will be developed. I have no opinion regarding which ones will appear
first. Given the immediate popularity of Viagra, there's a missing section
here on sexually related drugs.

I ask all Extropians who respond to this thread to 1) possibly reply to 
Andrew per his questionnaire and 2) be sure to put his email address on
the CC: line for all postings on this topic to the Extropians list...

You would think this would be all the more reason to contribute.  If you feel the
S/N ratio has decreased, why indirectly contribute to it by not contributing?

We don't have any cryonics organizations in Europe either (except maybe for 
the privately funded UK Alcor branch, but I'm not sure whether it's operational 
and they don't do LN2 storage in any case), yet there are a couple of dozen
Europeans signed up anyway with the various orgs. Afaik, there is also a 
local cryonics (Alcor, I think) group in Australia. You could try to contact
Thomas Donaldson  thomasd@netcom.com  for example.

I understand and agree.

As an interesting side note, a few weeks back, ABC did a
special with John Stossel on greed -- of all things.  In this
expose, Stossel found a for profit life guard company that
was beating the pants off the Red Cross in South Florida.
The for profit life guard company was more innovative in
life saving and management techniques.

The illustration was driven home when they spyed on a
Red Cross life guard, who was busy grilling burgers, while
the private firm's employees were required to watch the
pool the whole time.  (The manager randomly checks
them to make sure and immediately fires anyone who is
not doing her/his job.)

To make this case even stronger, the private company
costs more to hire, yet more and more pools are hiring
its life guards over cheaper Red Cross ones.  Which
life guards would you rather have if your kids were in
the water?

Granted you can look at "true" in the sense of a scientific truth i.e.
"this complies with 100% of our observations at present time."  But I
was opposing scientific "truth" presented as a competing against
religious truth.  The popular definition of "truth" is that which is
unquestionable - clearly this is not scientific.  So if religion and
science have very different ideas about what is true and what is
false, using science to prove religion to be false is an entirely
pointless exercise.

> Pseudoscience would simply be the absence of knowledge.

Much pseudo-science comes from presenting the result of scientific
knowledge to those without that knowledge.  That result is generally
information (i.e. the information "time travel is possible" can lead
to really bad Star Trek plots without the writers "knowing" that time
travel is possible).

Not spontaneous growth, but the ability for growth.  Information that
leads to nothing is clearly not knowledge.  "Knowing" something
implies a level of understanding, but the term "know" is used more
generally to mean "remember" without understanding.  I'll agree that
"true" and "false" can be attributes of knowledge (in the specific
scientific sense outlined above).  But "true" is not an absolute and
it's important to be careful of how you use terms such as "true" and
"false" because they are presumed an absolute by both religious groups
and some scientists.  However, I still think that science does not
seek truth in either sense.  When faced with an observational truth (a
theory that complies with 100% of evidence so far) science will still
consider alternatives (which your definition would consider false)
even before evidence suggests the current truth is false.  Also,
science routinely uses theory that has been proven "false" by
evidence.  So science is far fuzzier than simple truths.

> Knowledge growth is an attribute of desire to
> learn and of the mental capacity to do so.

If you have no desire or mental capacity to use (and therefore
understand) the information you're given, then do you "know" it? 
Remember that I said, "knowledge creates more knowledge and/or
information" if it only creates information then it is not "growing"
as such.  Information can come from implementing knowledge in the real
world (i.e. I know how to build a car, I build a car, there is a car)
as well as simply creating a mental model.

The number of people in Congress may

*all* branches, departments,
administrations, districts, bureaus, and
"services" of government amounts to a

[I would like to have contributed to this thread earlier, but the last few
weeks have been a period of constant work-related travel for me.  So, please
excuse any redundancies . . .]

First, some comment on ideas that I recall have been mentioned.  I am very
skeptical of the specific figures that have been mentioned regarding wealth
distribution in the US, for the reasons that "Warrl kyree Tale'sedrin" sets
out in his (?) post today.  Government ownership, private retirement funds and
insurance tend to distribute asset "ownership" in meaningful ways for large
segments of First World societies, although shallow analyses won't reveal this
fact.  I strongly suspect that the proportion of the overall economy thus
owned in a distributed or joint fashion in these ways offsets to a great
degree the much-touted concentration of ownership relative to some imagined
past golden age.  Nevertheless, I don't doubt that there are meaningful
definitions of "middle class" that will yield at least some concentration of
wealth relative to say 40 or 50 years ago.

With that said, I agree with Paul Hughes that we are facing an unprecedented
obsolescence for many, many workers.  I can think of only one similar period
in history -- the coming of the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the 18th
through the 20th centuries -- and that example offers only poor guidance for
what we can look forward to.  For most "displaced workers" during the
transition to the current paradigm of industrial technology and economy, the
shift to a new mode of living and working took place over a period of years, a
glacial pace compared to the dislocations that probably lie ahead for us now.
The one previous complete paradigm change -- from hunter-gatherer life to that
of settled agriculture, took place over a time scale of many generations, so
it would provide even less guidance, even if we knew the details of how it
really happened in human terms.

One trend that marked the transition to industrial economy will operate during
the one to a more completely automated economy: More and more people will work
in jobs of "personal service".  Just as many of the service jobs we hold today
could not have been imagined even 50 or 60 years ago -- and certainly not 100
years ago -- likewise, many people will end up doing things that are valued
economically that we cannot envision now.  Take a stroll through any "upscale"
retail establishment and you will see many people ostensibly working at the
job of selling who are not strictly "necessary" in mechanical terms.  I could
buy most consumer item at Neiman Marcus without the "assistance" of the many
"retail clerks" there, but the atmosphere of personal service they lend to the
establishment must be economical, because the owners of the store see fit to
pay their wage.  Likewise, the counter at McDonalds might be more efficient if
I entered my order directly into a keypad and had my food handed to me by a
robot, but I don't doubt that the live human face across the counter is seen
as a value by the operator of the store.

Thus, simply because it will be a luxury of sorts, having humans do jobs that
robots COULD do will likely become a significant factor in employing many
people who otherwise might become "disemployed".  Such jobs won't be the most
desirable ones and, with a few exceptions I can imagine, probably won't pay
very well.  (The exceptions are interesting, though -- I recall how amazed I
was to learn how much money waiters make in the most prestigious restaurants;
more than $100,000 per year.  Such jobs are admittedly rare.)

Another factor I have seen mentioned here is the trend toward making
commodities that were once dear essentially free "give-aways"; examples of
matches and water were discussed.  I can see food eventually falling into this
category, as well as even --possibly -- shelter.  Perhaps resorts would offer
princely accommodations to their workers to encourage "qualified" people to
work in their service jobs. Such qualifications might consist of personality
and physical characteristics, rather than intelligence or "productive"
capacity per se.  Thus good looks or a pleasant personality might be much more
worthwhile assets than they are today.  Perhaps only the ugly, rude AND stupid
will need some kind of dole in a truly post-industrial world.

Examples such as this one tend to make me less than catastrophically worried
about total "disemployment" for the great mass of humanity.  Any techno-
economic system that would make even "trivial" service jobs completely
irrelevant seems likely to be so productive that the whole problem becomes
moot.  

In the transitional period, it seems likely that the majority of humanity will
continue to do what they do now -- subsistence agriculture.  The largest part
of humanity really isn't even in the 20th century yet, technologically.  At
the point that the first few humans/AIs experience real "technotranscendance",
the largest part of humanity will be "irrelevant" to that process.  But this
says nothing of what those first post-humans will do FOR those left behind.  I
find much of the discussion about fears of what posthumans may do TO the
"left-behinds" implausible; it seems much more likely that the super-
productive powers of posthumans will be employed in what amounts to
philanthropic "uplift": The "extrosattva" of discussions we had here a few
months ago.

Yes,  but most of them are *not* in the legislative branch and therefore
cannot directly effect policy- they are bureaucrats and therfore do not

I agree.  Frankly I find you all terribly boring and hold many of you
in utter contempt.  But now and again among the S/N ratio moans, posts
about grammatical errors and authors promoting new books, there's a
brightly shinning gem.  And it's those ideas I'd like to see
encouraged.  Luckily most of the good ideas come from a few main
sources (some of which aren't me!)

So is anyone interesting in setting up an invitation-only list? 
Choosing new list members would be the job of those already chosen by
whomever wants to organise it.  Maybe a web site could be set up for
viewing (after the list member's controversial ramblings have been
edited for public consumption) or an edited digest version sent out to
the less fortunate non-members.  We could also invite some "big names"
in science, technology, art and (even) politics.  

I would get an invitation for having the idea, of course.

And 98% of these have little or no accountability to those who elect
representatives, or anyone other than their direct supervisor. Just look at
yesterday's news of IRS agents harassing politicians..

Once a bureacracy is in place it is damned hard to disloge it. Some of these
critters might survive the death of the government that spawned them.

I, too, have a deep love for the power company. Years back, I operated a
body shop I bought as a going concern from the founder. I transferred
electricity and gas utilities to my name, and paid the bills on time.

Almost a year later, Communist Edison sent me a letter demanding a $1000
deposit because I was a 'new business'. I asked the person at the office
what would happen if I refused to give them the money. They said they would
cut off my power.

I told them to go ahead - I did not need them! I installed a 75 kW three
phase alternator driven by a Toyota 3RC engine, burning natural gas. Two
days later I was up and running my own 'utility'. In the six months I did
this, I estimated I saved about 20% on what I would have spent for their
power, including maintainance on the generator. In the cold months, I also
used the waste heat for reducing demand on the space heaters.

I called them up and requested to be hooked up again after learning that the
gas cost was going to double. CE had me back on line in a day, and did not
ask for a deposit - it seemed that I was now an 'established business' and
therefore trustworthy.

I guess the original desksitters had moved on by that time, or they have a
really short corporate memory..

Who is going to purchase a product no one has ever seen, on the say-so of
the designer? People want to see what they are buying actually work, unless
they are really stupid..

Before you get paid for developing an idea like we did, you need to find a
market, or develop one. After we do all the hard work, we can then produce
and sell our products, or sell the rights to the patents to others, who then
have the same rights.

Without the patent, anyone who wants to make knock-off copies of our product
is free to do so, and piggyback on our market research and development. We
sweat, they gain.

Anyway, it's darn hard to encrypt a mostly physical device..We don't have
the replicator, yet..

What is to stop anyone who wants to reverse engineer the product and tool up
to make copies? Their overhead is now less by all the time spent in the
original development, so they can sell for less. This would quickly dry up
any investment capital for R+D of anything other than software with strong
encoding. Who wants to risk development time and money if anyone is welcome
to steal it?

That's why our products are potted assemblies. We want to make it as hard as
possible for the knock-off artists..

Even in the absence of a government monopoly, there needs to be some
protection for inventors and creators - at least until 'everything' is free,
and new developments are created just for the love of creation..

Would the present government allow such a trading society? It would be

This is especially true in engineering departments. 15 years ago, even
engineering techs had draftsmen, secretaries to type up letters and reports,
and file clerks to do the day-to-day drudge work. Modern computers have
eliminated most of these positions and piled the responsibilities on the
engineers, who now use their own PCs to type letters, do detail drawings,
manage paperwork, etc. Also, they are now expected to design and deliver new
products in less time than when they had a team of assistants.

With this increased responsibility has come a slight decline in the real
purchasing power of their wages..not to mention layoffs when they reach the
top of the pay scale, and loss of many once 'sacred' benefits.

Preparation would make all the difference.

As an aside, a few years back there was a series of SF books about a modern
Polish engineer sent back to medeival Poland. Has anyone read these books? I
have lost the name of the author, and would dearly like to get hold of them..

Very true, no doubt. Additionally, a
robot that could perform such tasks as
handled by counter help would presently
cost more than the rest of the McDonalds
real estate and equipment.

However, if and when the time comes that
a robot counter person costs not much
more than a flesh and blood version, we
may be as surprised by the popularity of
such an arrangement as the business
world was surprised by the number of
people who wanted personal computers
fifteen years ago. Personally, I would
trust a robot fast-food handler over a
human one, and would enjoy the novelty
even more than I enjoy McDonald's
carcinogenic food fare.

Computer programmers make about half
that much. So much for the idea of
"creating a society that does not need
its less qualified members" as someone
mentioned earlier.

Much depends on how you define
"qualified." A simi-literate air-head
can still win a beauty contest and get a
role on Baywatch. Don't expect that to
change a great deal in the post-human
era. Except that simi-literate air-heads
may get replaced by latex, silicon, and
steel gynoids of the robotic kind.
Remember Heidi the hooker madame? She
made millions providing the flesh factor
to men with a weakness for that
particular product.

So, in answer to Paul's question:

"1) Is there a single field which is
intrinsically safe from automation
in the course of the next 20-30 years?
If you can think of more fields,
please elaborate."

Answer: yes -- no need to elaborate.

"2) Are these remaining fields if any,
sufficient to employ the majority
of humanity?  If not, what will the rest
of humanity do in order to
survive?"

Answer: Of course not. Get some career
training. Don't wait. Do it now.
"Publish or perish."

"3)  For those who are unemployed and do
not have sufficient investment
income, is death the inevitable result?
If not, how will they survive?"

Answer: Death has been the inevitable
result of being alive since life began.
But perhaps life has no beginning and no
end. In which case, no one has anything
of real substance to worry about. Those
who choose to remain ignorant of the
value of extropian perspectives, bring a
certain amount of inconvenience into
their lives. Anti-extropians may find it
difficult to provide evidence that they
deserve to survive. Socialism sucks. You
don't produce | you don't eat. We can't
reach the stars by planning vacations
for socialistic slackers.

"4) Will most people alive today be able
to save enough before their jobs
become automated?"

Answer: *Most* people alive today don't
have the smarts to pull their craniums
out of their anal crevices. Of course
this question implies that another
socialistic big government project is
needed to provide for the incompetent
and inconsiderate who fail to keep up
with what humanity urgently needs,
namely a system based on ability,
competence, and merit. Extropianism, in
my view, diametrically opposes
socialistic schemes. Extropy has no use
for welfare queens and other dead wood.
"Keep your eyes on the prize," and let
the chips fall where they may. (Long
live euthanasia. Support Dr. Kavorkian
and access to assisted suicide.)

"5) If how much money one has saved is
the the key to surviving
automation, does this not portend very
badly for young people who have
had less time to save for their forced
retirement?  If this is true,
does this mean that the future is going
to be populated almost entirely
of rich and old people and their
children?"

"Surviving automation"? How about
enjoying the benefits of automation?
Many things portend badly for young
people. Especially the prospect of
socialistic bullies who want to force
young people to work and pay 70% income
tax in twenty years in order to support
the bloated bureaucracy of entitlements.
No one who values extropian principles
advocates forcing anyone into
retirement. Rather, we recommend that
people have the freedom to provide for
their own needs in whatever ways they
can invent. Today's youth does not owe
government a living any more than
corporations owe today's youth a living.

A future "populated almost entirely by
rich and old people and their children"
sounds rather utopian to me. I wouldn't
mind being rich. I suppose I will get
old. I have no immediate plans to have
children, but I enjoy their company for
the most part. Gee whiz, Paul, it sure
makes me happy to think that you won't
do too much to stand in the way of such
an idyllic future.

Or perhaps those in the latter category
will simply continue to join N.O.W. to
lobby for even more special privileges
at the expense of competent workers. As
for making commodities free, perhaps
some enterprising city dweller might opt
to provide free fresh air, in exchange
for (what?). Actually, water used to be
completely free for everyone who knew
how to locate a spring, stream, river or
lake. I remember reading that Benjamin
Franklin had preferred to save money by
dining on a half penny loaf of bread and
some stream water for lunch in Boston
(before the water became too polluted to
drink).

Right on. We have more worrisome things
to consider than disemployment. The
North Koreans are rumored to have more
weapons of mass destruction than they
have food. But disemployment has the
potential of converting formerly
productive workers into glass-bead-game
players with no appreciation for the
goals and objectives of such
vocationally aroused people as (for
instance) extropians. So the problem
relates less to what to do with
disemployed, less qualified members of
society, and more to keeping these folks
from organizing against the aims of
extropy.

As a potential post-human, I might dare
to ask what those left behind had done
for the cause of technotranscendence. We
(i.e., I) often hear complaints that
science and R&D don't do much for the
poor and less qualified members of
society. Well, let's turn it around for
once. What have the poor and less
qualified done for the advancement of
science and technology lately? As one of
the poorest people in the US, with an
income embarrassingly below the official
poverty level, I feel fully qualified to
ask this question. I appreciate what
science has done for humanity, and I
take the opportunity to express my
gratitude whenever I can.

Humanity needs extropy more than extropy
needs humanity.

Cheers,

J R

Actually, you seem to have one. I met Marta Sandberg, a delightful
Swedish-Australian cryonicist, a few weeks back and she is definitely
involved with Australian cryonics (although freezing is done at
Cryonics Institute in Detroit). She left me the following address:

Cryonics Association of Australia

Hampton Vic 3188

They may not *represent* you, but they
carry out the policies of those who do
claim to represent you. If what you
object to relates to the fact that a few
people make decisions for many others,
or have a disproportionate amount of
money to carry on with programs, I
suggest that the amount of wealth people
have at their disposal ought to reflect
the amount of competence that they bring
to deciding how to use that wealth. This
actually seems to be the case in most
instances, except where people inherit
money from others. But then, if someone
wants to bequeath a fortune to us, will
we make sure that the money gets evenly
distributed throughout our community? I
don't think so. We might decide instead
to invest in nanotechnology, cryonics,
or super-AI.

Right on, Chuck. Lack of accountability
in government constitutes one of the
cornerstones of a strong socialistic
bureaucracy (IOW, a corrupt and
self-serving network of elitist
"scumbags," to borrow a journalistic
term). If politicians who failed to live
up to their own campaign promises could
be sued for breach of promise, maybe
some change in the direction of
improvement might occur.

Again, right on the money. Even a

Reagan could understand that bloated
government continues to rachet up
(escalate) because political ambition
demands it. Congress critters might
survive an extropian singularity on the
order of the actual demise of
government, yes, but how would we deal
with the problem of what to do with
these "less qualified members of
society" (to borrow another phrase)?

   IAN: And should be able to distinguish between

   That's where my interest in Base 1 comes
   into play, since B1 maps the reality 
   behind numbers by 100%, such that 
   11111 is both 5 and 5 things.

   To teach a computer to interface with the

   establish a logical interface between B1 
   and the higher-order-number bases its
   programs are built upon. The example 
   I posted doesn't accomplish that. :(

   It's probably easy enough to have a set 
   of rules that say 11111(B1) = 101(B2).

  IAN: The square root of -l is the imaginary number i.
  From what I understand, irrational numbers are real 
  numbers that cannot be expressed as integers or as 
  the quotient of two integers,  such as the square 
  root of 2 or pi. But I may be missing your point.

2) they would be cheap enough or I could expect return on investment
    (I have problems in seeing a potential for that in some of the

3) they would not cause any demage to my precious brain :-)

 IAN: A valid analysis, which calls for 
 a broader definition of truth. Yes, the 
 physical you is truth, but I think when
 we say science is about truth, or "The 
 truth will set you free," we refer to 
 the larger physical reality of which 
 you are but a subset. Science may be 
 said to be the pursuit of understand-
 ing that larger reality and the con-
 text/relation of any subset and it.

 That is what holism address directly,
 while atomism address subset minus 
 whole, which is always a fallacy.

Though not a contributor, I personally have been getting a great deal
out of the polymath list archives at 
http://mars2.caltech.edu/polymath/date.html

If not *big* names, there are certainly some intellectual heavyweights
running about there. Not to mention that a considerable number of
list-members are, or appear to be, transhumanists. 

The list is invite-only, and the quality of discussion (in my outsider's
view) ranges from usually superb to sometimes inbred, but it's one of
the best lists I've come across as far as the 'important' issues are
concerned.

Don't forget that Damien Sullivan also runs his Filtered Extropians
list. It's a great service, sometimes you miss some context, but if it's
high s/n you want, these are acceptable losses.

Point is, there are options (and as D. Broderick has suggested, a good
filter to C:/CRAP is always one of them <g>)

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

I believe I found the answer to the Base n
"puzzle" I raised. I also believe that the 
model I presented yesterday is not only 
not the solution, but it does not work.

The answer is the Alternative Number System (ANS),
which was published in the "Southwest Journal of
Pure and Applied Mathematics" (12/95), by Robert 
R. Forslund. ANS seems to be more logical than 
the current number system, which uses 0 as a
placeholder. ANS eliminates 0 as a placeholder.
The digit "A" replaces 10, and thus 1A = 20.

The result is that Base 1 (the tally mark system,
which is the logical reality/basis of all number 
systems) is NOT invalidated as it is by our current
number system, which uses 0 as a placeholder. ANS
also results in greater data compression, expres-
sed by the use of fewer digits to express a given 
number. The measure of the ability to compress
data in this fashion measures the utility of
a given number system versus tally marks.

As I see it, ANS does not invalidate 0 in its use
outside its function as a place holder, such that 
even with ANS, we'd still say: y + (-y) = 0. I see
this as a preferable use of 0, since 0 essentially 
means "no number," it should not be in numbers.


Here are the webpages on ANS:

 I once saw a book about how our current number system is based on the cube,
and a better one would be based on the tetrahedron, it would resemble nature
much more, compression also comes to mind.  I havent gotten the book yet, but
I'm going to, I cant remember the name right now, I can get it soon.

Just out of curiosity, how would people be invited? There are many
bright minds out there that I am sure no one on this list knows.

In other words, the artist should get paid a certain amount for 
writing the book (who pays, and why?) without regard to whether many 
people prove they like it by, for example, buying copies.

And in general it is never reasonable to spread the cost of 
production facilities (the author's work is an essential part of 
producing a book) over the entire production run.  The author must 
get his entire compensation for producing the book out of the sale 
price of the first book; the printer must get his entire 
compensation for creating the printshop out of the first item he 
prints.  The cost of building an auto manufacturing plant should be 
tacked IN ITS ENTIRETY onto the FIRST car that plant produces.

Under that system it is painfully obvious that there will be very few 
auto plants built, and therefore very few cars made.  That there will 
be very few printshops built, and therefore very little printed.  Yet 
you assume that this will somehow INCREASE the number of books being 
written...

Higher price?

It is true, if you want to hear the group Sublime, you will have to 
hire the group to come to you, and this will cost more than if you 
could just run down and buy a CD.  However, it is also true that the 
maximum you are likely to pay is far, far less than their portion of 
the sales price of a quarter million CDs.

So, YOU pay a HIGHER price, but THEY collect a LOWER price.

Not to mention that all the people involved in producing, shipping, 
and marketing the CDs, must seek some other source of income -- not 
because their jobs are obsolete, but because we deny creative people 
ownership of their creations.

You are entirely free, today, to write books and give them away if 
you choose.  You were not free, then, to open an airline and give 
away air transportation.

No company other than United Airlines ever has, or ever will, provide 
you a flight on United Airlines' work.  So if you ever had a United 
Airlines flight, United Airlines was rewarded for your benefitting 
from their work.

Anybody can go to a cheap copier and provide you a flight on Anne 
McCaffrey's work.  And Anne McCaffrey will receive no reward for your 
benefitting from her work.

That said, I agree with you: setting a minimum price which people 
*must* charge for their work, is wrong.  But instead you propose to 
set a *maximum* price, and that is just as wrong.

What are those black marks on the pages?  Their arrangement is the 
work of the novel-writer.  If you think that it is the 
novel-printer's work that matters, go buy a hundred pages of notebook 
filler paper and enjoy your reading.

The writer should be paid according to the agreement the writer makes 
with the publisher.  You should not have the right to dictate the 
terms of that agreement, considering that you are neither the writer 
nor the publisher.  Sometimes the agreement will specify that the 
publisher is paying only for a mold, and sometimes it's on a per-copy 
basis.

What we find in general in the fixed arts (which means, pretty much 
everything except live performances) is that the top artists are paid 
on some form of per-copy basis, and the hacks are paid for molds.  
And the hacks hope to get per-copy contracts.  Some of them 
eventually become top artists.

Writing specifically is a bit different, but not a whole lot 
different.  Magazines pay for molds.  Book contracts are almost 
always on a per-copy basis, with an "advance" that is non-refundable 
and amounts to a payment for the mold if the book doesn't sell well.  
Let me give you a clue: if you spend six months per book, and never 
get any payment beyond the advance, you won't be able to live for 
long as a book writer.  But you propose to eliminate all other 
payment, and believe that this will increase the amount of art.

Look at it further down the line: a publisher starts printing a book 
in the belief that for a certain amount of time HE will be the ONLY 
publisher of that specific book.  On this basis he dedicates the 
substantial capital of a printing plant to that book for a period of 
time, and he puts some effort into marketing the book.  And he 
enforces his copyright to protect that assumption.

But you choose to eliminate the copyright.  The publisher sends the 
books out of his shop.  Of the first five boxes, three go to 
copy-shop chains.  The publisher paid the author an advance, and put 
in the capital and resources to print 25,000 copies of the book; the 
next day there are 250,000 copies on the market.  For every dollar 
the publisher spent in marketing, $8 are spent on copies of the book, 
and the publisher gets 80 cents of that.  Being a publisher who 
actually pays authors, is a complete loss.  So publishers won't pay 
authors, and this is supposed to increase the amount of art.

Today, an author can auction a work to the highest bidder -- who will 
probably be a publishing house and will probably pay $10,000 for a 
first novel, or $1,000,000 for something from someone with multiple 
previous hot sellers.

Under your system, an author can auction a work to the highest bidder 
-- who will probably pay $8 for a first novel, and there will be no 
such thing as a "hot seller".  Why?  Because being the *second* 
highest bidder means you can't publish the book -- until half an hour 
after the highest bidder does.  And the 8,427th highest bidder can 
publish at exactly the same time you can.

If you don't think writing a good novel is hard work, try it.

And you want to eliminate the means by which the market communicates 
its decision.

Under the current system, authors do bear the full cost of a failed 
writing enterprise: they put all the work into writing the book, and 
no publisher buys it.  On the other hand, if their writing enterprise 
is successful, they reap the rewards.

Under your system, authors bear the full cost of a failed writing 
enterprise -- ALWAYS -- even if the book is a massive success.

Hm... this would mean that the richest 20% account for in excess of

One reason I continue to vote against incumbents and for Libertarians in as
many cases as possible. There is no hope in changing the system from

Too bad, as some of the recent religion posts, useless as they were, were
quite amusing. I will take responsibility for furthering them unnecessarily,
if you like. 

Could occasional injections of humor be considered extropian? Or must we be
dead serious always?

The idea of base 1 arithmetic is fine as a thought experiment, but it seems
to me that you lose any advantage to 'packing' information. If you want to
express a large number, you will end up with a huge number of 'bits' so to
speak. A useful computer would be awfully complex.

Also, if you only have one symbol for the base one system, how do you
represent zero? No symbols at all?

I think that by the time software evolves to the point of being able to
drive a true AI, the individual bits and underpinnings will matter as much
to this entity as the precise operations of our brains matters to us on a
moment to moment basis. Likely, a digital computer based AI will be a lousy
computer programmer, at least as far as modifying it's own 'brain' on an
instant to instant basis..

Remember what the FAQ says: extropians have no humor. :-)

I would also be interested, as long as I retained control of the effects.
Drugs that gave me the illusion of superhuman strength, for instance, could
cause more damage than good, if you came to believe that you were indeed
superhuman. These might be fine recreationally, but for everyday use they
would cause trouble.

Ah, my cue!  

If anyone is interested in checking out the range of reviewers' responses
to the idea of the Spike nee Singularity (in Australia at any rate which is
the only place yet that my book has been published, damn and blast it)
Compare & Contrast the links in the box called `OzLit Pages Relating to
this Writer' at

http://dargo.vicnet.net.au/ozlit/writers.cfm?id=74.0

Especially worth comparing are the ones by Barry Jones (a stinkeroo from a
world-class polymath who set up the notable Australian govt Commission for
the Future, now disbanded for lack of interest), Alan Olding (pleasant but
in places missing the point) and Race Mathews (amazingly astute, er, that
is, generous).  There are also links to some samples or extracts from a
couple of my masterpieces...

Well, *I* reckon it's S and not N; YMMV.  (Not to mention YVH.)

Sciences, by Tim van Gelder at Melbourne University Philosophy Dept:

Abstract: In recent years there has been increasing use of the tools of
dynamics in many areas of cognitive science. A sizeable portion of
cognitive scientists can be understood as having taken up a dynamical
approach to the study of cognition. If the heart of the dominant
computational approach is the hypothesis that cognitive agents are digital
computers, the heart of the alternative dynamical  approach is the
hypothesis that cognitive agents are dynamical systems. This target article
attempts
to articulate the dynamical hypothesis, and to defend its status as an open
empirical alternative to the
computational hypothesis. Achieving these goals requires extensive
clarification of the terrain. Digital
computers and dynamical systems are characterized as specific kinds of
systems. This paves the way
for an elaboration of the two major components of the dynamical hypothesis:
the nature hypothesis
(cognitive agents are dynamical systems) and the knowledge hypothesis
(cognitive agents can be
understood dynamically). A wide range of objections to the dynamical
hypothesis can then be
rebutted. The conclusion is that cognitive systems may well be dynamical
systems, and only
sustained empirical research in cognitive science will determine the extent
to which that is true.

I have been lurking on the list for some time, trying to resist the urge to
answer to some posts. I am a molecular biologist and when I am not cutting
DNA to pieces and trying not to get killed by accidentally developing a
biological weapon, I sometimes find time to think about matters divine. 

And as meeting an alien civilization can be a bit regretted, so I regret
making a net search on several ideas Ive been thinking about and finding
out that theres an awful lot of people thinking roughly along the same
lines out there...

(I slowly readjust to the idea that it may be some fun after all to be one
of gods instead of the GOD)

:-)))

Oh well, its always like that, darn it, whenever I have a Nobel prize idea
and do a Medline search, I always find somebody already published that. As
a Polish saying goes, Hope is mother of fools. I dont mind being a fool
though.

Anyway, recently I have been thinking about few things and since nobody
came up with those in the past week's posts, let me give one a shot. Maybe
you guys discussed them twelve times before, so I can save myself some
effort - since laziness is the highest human virtue.

Once we start to understand how the mind/brain works and start to make it
work better how do we stop weirdos/terrorist from developing next
incarnations of computer viruses? The fact that there are teenagers who
play at those now is a real blessing, as far as I understand it, 'cause it
allowed for development of the immunity system so terrorist couldnt take
the lead, and I think they would never be able to pose real threat here.
However, I dont know if we can always be so lucky. Many species died
because of a too good pathogen, and many civilizations perished (or did not
develop, which is about the same) because of stupid ideology. And if
somobody would care to hire me for a few million bucks (most of which would
go into equipment and a nice building very deep underground), I dont think
it would be very difficult to develop a biological weapon which would be
very efficient indeed :-)) 

I dont like the idea of leaking my mind out of its carbon form (not that it
is safe here) and then getting infected and becoming "mad". Backup is a
solution that comes first to mind, but if the 'virus' is good enough, its
not much help.

OK, hope it isnt too naive and I did not contribute to the unspecific
afferent of the discussion. There were a few moans about the s/n ratio
recently, and Id like to somewhat defensively point out that "unspecific"
stimulation of the reticular formation is quite important for the working
of the human brain :-)

best,
b

Sensate input are just sensations, so you're saying sentience means the  
ability to have sensations and the ability to have sensations means sentience. 
I don't think you're going to be able to get much mileage out of that.

Present robots certainly do because present robots are stupid. I see no 
reason why that limitation need be permanent.

(interminable posting which is snipped)

Regarding this thread (which I have resolutely tried to
ignore)....

1. I see nothing exceptional about "pemes", as the
concept of "meme" covers it all quite nicely; perhaps
"predatory meme" is a better definition than "political
meme". 

2. "reme" for religious meme
3. "seme" for subconsciou meme
4. "feme" for flaming meme

I guess it is all a matter of pemeist envy.

You said:  "I also think that the question of whether humans should give
rights to machines is moot, the question of whether machines will give
rights to humans is not."  Why do you think the question of whether
machines will give rights to humans is an interesting question, if we can't
stop the creation of hyper-intelligent robots, and stand no chance of
controlling them once we do?  If they do decide to give us rights, then
they will.  If they don't, then they won't.  We have no say in the matter
and not enough intelligence to predict what a hyper-intelligent being would
actually do.  So why ISN'T this question moot?

An author sells the first copy to a private entity.  The market decides
whether someone wants to buy it.

Meanwhile, a publisher will invest in new books, because having a new book
on the market should increase the total demand for books (from which, as an
externality, all publishers will benefit).  However, the first buyer will
gain in part from that increase in demand.  So as long as the increased
profit you get from increased demand outweighs the price the publisher must
pay the author for making the book, buying new art is still worthwhile,
though less worthwhile than it was when the government was granting
publishers monopoly status over copies of their books.

As usual, you are confusing the production of COPIES with the creation of
NEW ART.  The guy who invents a printshop must get his entire compensation
from inventing the first printshop.  The printer gets her compensation from
printing books.

>The cost of building an auto manufacturing plant should be 
>tacked IN ITS ENTIRETY onto the FIRST car that plant produces.

No.  The cost of INVENTING an auto manufacturing plant must be tacked onto
the first plant.  The cost of BUILDING a plant which has already been
invented should be paid with the sales of every car which that plant
produces.  See the difference?

>Yet you assume that this will somehow INCREASE the number of books being 
>written...

And yet again, you confuse books being written and books being printed.  I
contend that fewer books will be written but more copies of those books
will be printed.

I could pay them a high price to make a CD for me.  Or they could produce a
CD and sell it to the highest bidder.

Well, to some extent, we might expect this a little, seeing as it is a
system consisting of hundreds of thousands of tiny government enforced
monopolies.  So I concede, the CD industry would lose some revenues due to
the abolition of their monopolies.  However, so did the aviation industry
lose some revenues when it couldn't use the government to cartelize.

>Not to mention that all the people involved in producing, shipping,

Again, CDs would and could be produced, shipped and marketed just as they
have been; only they would cost a lot less.

Again, you confuse new art with copies.  I am free to write books, but I am
not free to print copies of books which the government will not let me
print, even if I give them away.  Even if I have no prior contract with the
author.  (Especially in that case.)

Without copyright, McCaffrey would have received all of her rewards when
she was paid for writing the novel in the first place.  So, yes, she would
receive no FURTHER reward.

The deregulation of a monopoly is not the same as setting a maximum price;
it's letting the market set the price at a reasonable level.  The market,
today, does not set the price of copies of _DragonFlight_, but rather the
government grants the copyright holder of _DragonFlight_ monopoly status
over all copies of the book, so they can set the price to whatever they
want, with no fear of having to lower their price due to competition.  The
demand curve still dictates the revenues, but it is the copyright holder
which determines the price.  We'd be better off without this monopoly and
allowing the market to set the price of _DragonFlight_ copies, when prices
are pushed down by firms competing for business.

When I said the above, I said it in the same way that I would say that I am
not buying crude oil when I buy gasoline.  Now, obviously, the creation of
gasoline would be impossible if no one were to pump crude oil; however, *I*
do not have to pay crude oil companies for my gasoline.  My individual
gasoline station has ALREADY paid the crude oil company for its crude oil.
I am buying the work of my individual gas station, who in turn has
purchased the work of a refinery, who has purchased the work of a crude oil
manufacturer.

When I buy a copy of a book, I buy the work of a novel-printer.  The
novel-printer may have paid the novel-writer for its original copy; without
copyright it may simply have purchased the work of another novel-printer.
Either way, I do not pay the novel-writer for the book.  I pay a bookstore,
who in turn pays a printer, [who in turn pays a novel-printer, if it is not
the last on the chain,] who in turn pays the novel-writer.

True, I have no right to do so, nor do I wish to do so.  However, I put
forward that they have no right stop me from producing my own copies of the
same book at a cheaper price, unless they have a contract over me.

<sigh>  COPIES, *NOT NEW ART*.  And I'm not surprised that most artists vie
for government-protected status.  As for whether an advance is sufficent to
live off of, keep in mind that today the advance is only part of the
payment, whereas tomorrow it would represent the full price of the book.
So we may expect to see this price change as an actual market begins to form.

On the contrary; buying a new novel is not a complete loss if you increase
sales by offering a new book.

Again, as I noted above, the book will be worth as much as publishers would
benefit from the increased demand for book sales.  So it IS worth it to pay
more than $8 for the first copy.

How much exactly?  Best to let the market decide.

>If you don't think writing a good novel is hard work, try it.

I didn't say that writing a novel is easy.  But, then, neither is flying an
airplane, and I won't grant THEM monopoly status either.

>And you want to eliminate the means by which the market communicates 
>its decision.

I most certainly do not.  I still think that authors should be paid, but
shouldn't receive monopoly status on their works.  Say what you will, but
don't get to thinking I'm anti-market.

When a publisher buys a book which later fails, the publisher and author
both still reap the benefits of being able to set a non-competitive price
for the book so as to maximize their profits at the expense of consumers.
This is NOT bearing the full cost of a writing enterprise.

>Under your system, authors bear the full cost of a failed writing 
>enterprise -- ALWAYS -- even if the book is a massive success.

Authors who offer books which will greatly increase demand can charge more
than authors who offer books which won't increase demand very much at all.
Thus, authors DO benefit from writing better books; they get paid more.

There's ways around this, too.  Currently we have fraud laws for this sort
of thing.  Under a more anarcho-capitalistic system, an arbitrator could
enforce a contract by which inventors trying to sell a working idea could
be forced to pay the cost of a failed enterprise if the idea failed.  (ie
"If this is snake oil, this here arbitration company will recompense you
what it costs you, at my expense.")

Well, the problem is this:  under a lf-capitalist market, invention has
lots of positive externalities.  After all, you DO gain from the invention,
just as much as your competitor did, but you also had to bear the cost of
invention.  When you give the inventor monopoly status, however, you cut
off those positive externalities and allow the inventor to set prices
arbitrarily high without fear that some pesky competitor will offer the
same product at a lower price.

So it seems to me that we're choosing between an accidental good and,
apparently, a deliberate bad.

>Anyway, it's darn hard to encrypt a mostly physical device..We don't have

The encryption is used for the invention, for the sales of the first idea,
not for the product.  The premise that you could have lots of people know a
piece of information and still sell it as if you were the only one is one
of the fallacies which copyright tends to prop up.

You still benefit from the invention in the form of the new market you've
just created or in the increased demand for your products.  The fact that
your competitor will also benefit does not detract from this.  Thus, so
long as you still make a profit from the invention, it's still worthwhile
to pay for it.

Very interesting.  Of course I have not had the privilege to read 'The Spike'
yet.  I did however find your comments given at the STAVCON 97' to be the most
poignant of them all.  I found this particular passage of yours to be
questionable:

"Artists like me will do what we can to shape our understanding of the changing
realities about us, to catch its frenzy on the ends of our nervy tendrils.

But poets are no longer the unacknowledged legislators of mankind, if they ever
were. No, that role has passed to those who dwell in what C. P. Snow so long
ago called the Second Culture."

What of the Third Culture - the cross-pollination of the two?  If wasn't for
the vision of 'poets' such as yourself and other sci-fi authors, many of the
pioneers in modern science would not have pursued their chosen careers.
Wouldn't you say that poetry, art and literature helps provide a context, a
navigation map, a passion, a *direction* in which to steer this rocketship we
call technology?

Hopefully Natasha is reading this and can add her own input on the importance
of art in an extropian future.

Cheers,

   IAN: And Hara Ra adheres to the "zero evidence"
   school of truth, where X = true if X is supported

   In keeping with this most illogical standard, Hara Ra

   adept in its methods of anti-inquiry and distraction.

  IAN: Absolutely truth. Base 1 is pre-data

  systems is a set of data-compression rou-

   IAN: You don't need zero in Base 1 (assum-
   ing that we define base to allow 1) because
   zero operatis as a placeholder in a possitional
   number system; yet base 1, or tally-mark numbers, 
   is not a possitional number system. As such, the 
   * difference * in the value of any 1 in any base 
   1 column in the number 11111, = 0, since the 
   defintion of colum value in base 1 is:

   column     1     2     3

   base 1:   1^2   1^1   1^0 
              1     1     1
   --------------------------
              1     1     1   =   3

   The value of each column is the same (or their
   value-difference equals zero) unlike that found 
   in any base n > 1 number system. Value jumping
   between columns of all base n > 1 systems is 
   the very function of data-compression, thus
   0 value difference = 0 data compression.

   IAN: Base 1 is significant in that it is the 
   real "natural number" system. It is how brains
   count from "the ground up." Our fingers are 
   base 1 digits. Real Intelligence (RI) does 
   not count with the binary base 2 system. 

   Base 1 is significant in number theory in that 
   it is the only number system that is a member
   of both the set of "conceptual mathematical 
   systems" and "the real world." Base 1 is the
   intersection of the number engine of math and
   the real world. 4 (b10) or 0100 (b2), or 10
   (b4) must always mean this many things: 1111.

I think the underlying assumptions of this argument are suspect.  The whole
issue hinges on the notion of hyper-AI's having a greater intelligence
(political?) leverage than transhumans.  I think this conclusion is premature
based on an ambiguous dichotomy and several competing trends.

Moore's Law continues unabated, probabilistically yielding human-level AI
within 20 years.  Because of scalability it is also reasonable to expect
human-level AI before circuit density reaches levels equivalent to the human
brain. It's also reasonable that transhumans will gain access to substantial
improvements in neuro-enhacement and neuro-interface technology over the same
time period.

Like cells in a muti-cellular organism, the internet is already allowing
multiple groups of humans to coordinate across geographic boundaries at a level
of coherence and complexity never before possible.  As networks, interface
software, virtual worlds and bandwidth improve, this trend can only continue.
When you add in the slow but steady improvement of neuro-enhancement
technologies, forthcoming 3rd and 4th generation smart drugs, wearable
computers, implantable interface technologies, personality software
agents/avatars, the human becomes transhuman on a scale never before
achievable.  More importantly these transhumans will be able to coordinate and
collective act in multi-faceted spontaneous networks mimicking a collective,
synergistic intelligence much greater than any individual transhuman.

As this trend continues, computer intelligence will be continually increasing.
Up and until human-level AI is achieved, there is no reason why transhumans
cannot integrate these quasi-sentient AI's into their own intelligence
networks.

At some point Human-level AI's are built.  Lets assume that they immediately
organize themselves around the sole purpose of taking over the world.  At first
they will be small in number.  Certainly not near the the number of their
human/transhuman counter-parts also attempting to rule the world.  Their goal
of course will be two-fold.  To increase their own intelligence and to create
as many copies of themselves as possible.  But to increase their own
intelligence they will need to do more than simply re-write their sofware.
They will also have to improve their hardware substrate.

At some point both transhumans and Hyper-AI's will have to utilize
nanotechnology in their evolution towards greater complexity and intelligence.

The question is who will reach what phases at what time?  And will the combined
forces of networked enhanced trans-humans be able to maintain a greater degree
of collective intelligence over networked AI's until uploading is reached?

I think the answer to this question is far from being answered.

Assuming transhumans can become post-human in similar nanotech substrates at or
before super-AI's, the war between  Hyper-AI's and Transhumans becomes moot.
Because at that point they will be us and we will be them - we will be made of
the same underlying nanotechnology.

Comments, critiques?

[A long description of AIs vs Augumented humans]

I think you are making some unsupported assumptions:
   -- you asusme that AIs are separate entities.
   -- you assume that augmented humans are separate entities.
   -- you assume a polarization between humans and AIs

I quit using the term AI some time ago, during an earlier round
of this discussion in 1996. I prefer the term "superintelligence",
or SI. IMO an SI will very likely start as an augmented human,
a collaboration between one human and a computer. This SI can
rapidly augment the computer part of itself, so there is no
reason to assume that a second SI will come into existence prior
to the first SI taking over the world, or that a de novo AI will
ever come into existence. The SI may choose to decouple from its
human component, but such a decision, and indeed any decision made
by the SI, is beyond analysis by humans.

There are variants on this scenario, such as a multi-human initial
collaboration, but IMO a single human suffices. Further, there
is no real necessity for new I/O interfaces: mouse and monitor suffice.
Since the human can provide creative direction and strategic pattern
matching, the computer need not start at "human level". This means
that the SI may be achievable at today's level of hardware, and that
the only reason the SI does not already exist is that the software
has not yet all been invented. If this is the case, the SI will
come into existence suddenly, as a phase change rather than as a
mere rapid increase in development. Please see:

Please define these 'externalities'. I still don't see how I benefit to have
my market stolen from me..

If I set my prices arbitrarily high, I limit my sales to those for whom
money is no object. This is a very small market. If I charge a reasonable
price for my invention, based on its' costs and a fair payment to me for the
development, I should have more takers.

In the case of our products, the market is fairly small and specialized. One
competitior stealing our ideas and undercutting us would ruin the whole
works for us.

I beg to differ. As I stated earlier, if the market is small, you are
seriously harmed by knock-off competetion.

There is a very dramatic article about cancer research on the front page of 
today's New York Times, the headline is "A Cautious Awe Greets Drugs That  
Eradicate Tumors In Mice".

All cancers must induce normal cells to produce blood vessels to supply the 
tumor with the nutrients it needs. A few years ago Dr. Judah Folkman at 
Children's Hospital in Boston discovered two very rare  proteins in human 
blood that he thought might interfere with this process.  Progress has been 
slow up to now because it was very difficult to make enough of the stuff to
work with, it takes hundreds of gallons of blood to make enough to treat one 
mouse, but now the results of a double blind study are in and they could not 
be better. 10 mice with huge very advanced tumors were given injections of 
the proteins and 10 were given injections of salt water. After two weeks all 
10 mice who got the salt water were dead, all 10 mice who received the 
proteins were alive and healthy, their tumors could not be found even with a 
microscope. As for side effects, Dr. Folkman injected some mice with 4 times 
as much as needed to shrink the largest tumor but he could find no ill 
effects. There doesn't seem any chance that cancer will develop an immunity 
to these 2 new drugs over time, tumors, bacteria and viruses  can do that
because they have the ability to rapidly reshuffle their genetic makeup and 
mutate, but these drugs don't work on any of those things, they  works on 
normal cells that supply tumors with nutriments, and normal cells don't 
mutate like that.

No human has taken these protein drugs yet but that will change in just a few  
months, genetic engineers have inserted the genes for their manufacture into 
yeast and now we can brew it like beer and produce it by the ton. Until it 
has been tried on humans however Judah Folkman refuses to say he has found a  
cure for cancer, all he will say if that "if you have cancer and you are a 
mouse we can take good care of you".

Dr. James Watson, the genius who co-discovered of the double helix and is one  
of the true giants of this century thinks Dr. Folkman is being far too modest:

"Judah is going to cure cancer in two years [...] Dr. Folkman will be 
 remembered along with scientists like Darwin as somebody who permanently 
 altered civilization".

I wasn't mentioned in Damien's book, and I don't know if my work was
relevant to the content/subject of his book or not, but I would hasten to
think that my work in the area of art and science is highly relevant
interest to a "Third Culture." 

C.P. Snow was a major influence on my thinking.  When I first realized that
art and science had something in common, I began to meet more scientists
with an openness - a willingness to understand the cognitive processes in
their creativity.  It seemed quite similar to the creative process of my own.

The cross-pollination of artist and scientist is creating a well-balanced
artist, if you will.  One with the unlimited imaginative capabilities and
the ability to implement ideas with today's engineering and technology.  To
have a dream - an inspiration - and not have the capability to realize the
dream with the "tools of the time" can be very frustrating.  A lost dream
can effect one's abilities in all areas of thinking, permeating a sense of
failure.  To have a dream realized causes a sense of victory and self-esteem.

Today an artist needs a working knowledge of technology and/or engineering
to realize a dream fully.  (Conceptual art remains a preferred art genre
for me, although I believe that I would be more satisfied and have a
feeling of involvement with life and the future by producing ideas rather
than only conceptualizing them.)

Because Transhumanist Art and the genre Extropic Art is occurring in a
period when we are engineering ourselves, extending lives and developing
new life forms, an artist (in the broad sense: meaning fine artist,
artists, and creative thinkers, which is inclusive of scientists) would be
in keeping with the times if she/he is knowledgeable about the technology
that will make this possible.  Otherwise the "art" becomes gadgets with no
or little content.

Much of the Tech Art and Electronic Art is quite beautiful to look at, or
fascinating to look at or to engage in, but it does not represent the
transhuman extropian culture because it does not pronounce life extension.
("A-Volve" might even miss in this regard.)

Recently I was entertaining Dr. Hugo de Garis (well known for brain
building and ideas about genius that caused quite a stir on this list),
Forrest Bishop and friends in my home.  We were discussing, among other
things, de Garis's art project.

Yesterday I had brunch with Dr. Roy Walford (leading gerontologist).  We
discussed his most recent art project.  He is a scientist as well as artist.  

Marvin Minsky plays the piano.  Vernor Vinge writes fiction.  My brother -
Dr. Richard Clark - is a painter.  It isn't unusual for scientists to enjoy
art, but this is not the point.  It is an ability to transfer the skills in
the two different domains so that they begin to mesh.

Thus, having skills in both domains does not make a Third Culture.  It is
the acknowledgment of abilities in both domains and a willingness to say
that art doesn't have to be only an intuitive, subjective and imaginative
process and that science doesn't have to be only a rational objective
process; and that both domains have qualities of the other.

I wrote about the short essay "The Importance of Creativity" which in large
part, refers to Paul's insightful post:

"Tomorrow our CQ (creativity quotient) will become the sine qua non for our
existence.  It will become less a measure of creative aptitude than an
insight into undaunted inventiveness.  It will become the metaphor for
individual escalation of innovation.  It will become a symbol for what we
shall create without restraint, without limitation.  It will be the
Creativity Augmentum."

What I mean by the Creativity Augmentum is a time when the Snow's two
cultures of art and science are blurred.  

Art important in the extropian future?  Why, yes, of course!

Hi, first i will try to apologies for my bad english, it's basically
because my mother tongue is french, and i've never followed a lot of
english courses in my scholarship. I've to add that my wordprocessor
does not include any english dictionnary.

I'm only a little student in nuclear engineering now, but i've a lot of
interest for the subjects discussed here. Especially when it comes to
talk about the physics of consciousness, nanotech, replicators,
philosophy and implications for strong AI.

I'm following this list since several months now and i'm rather
surprised that only assemblers using nanotechnologies in their
implementation are discussed here.

Probably we could build a more "macroscopic" one. It will sure be less
efficient than a nanotechnological one, but it's really worth to study
too. I would like to see some reviews of the interesting ideas from Joe
Michael at http://www.stellar.demon.co.uk/index.htm about Fractal Shape
Changing Robots. The basic idea is so simple that i'm wondering how it
can be possible that nobody come with that before. I think with
enthousiasm that such kind of ideas are abble to make at least a major
revolution in the automation field. Perhaps we could expect important
breaktroughs in evolvable hardwares, AI too. If what he claims is at 50%
possible, that will lead to a major revolution, the kind of revolution
generally linked with nanotechnologies, but at a very minor cost.

  IAN: It appears that many who fancy the mantle
  of "science" believe that there are truths that 
  are not to be questioned, such as the claim that
  "A is A, A is not both A and not-A." Questioning
  that doctrine is a sacrilegious "no no" to many.

  Just as the church labeled as "heretics" any 
  who questioned the church doctrines, these
  people label as "crackpots" anyone who 
  questions their central doctrines.
  It's all the same thing. 

  The reliable base of science that transcends the 
  mantles various people claim is the testability 
  of a claim and the degree to which it adheres to 
  physical reality, not the degree to which one set
  of adherents can heap personal abuse on opponents
  (an analysis which is not directed at Yak Wax).



>... "true" is not an absolute and it's important to be careful 
>of how you use terms such as "true" and "false" because they are

  IAN: If there is no absolute truth, then that 
  is an absolute truth, therefore there is an 
  absolute truth. Therefore, the claim that
  there is no absolute truth must be false.


>So if religion and science have very different ideas about what 
>is true and what is false, using science to prove religion to be 
>false is an entirely pointless exercise.


  IAN: Well, that is different than saying "religion
  is about truth and science about knowledge," for
  that implies that the religious definition of 
  "truth" might be false,  and that must be 
  determined by some definition of truth,
  which means whatever definition we're
  using, we're calling something "truth."

  If science has any idea about truth, and if
  science selects some knowledge and discards 
  other knowledge, I think that we cannot div-
  orce science and truth in the way you seem
  to have suggested. I believe that science 
  discards any knowledge that tests false,
  which means that it does not accurately 
  model the physical reality we inhabit.



>When faced with an observational truth (a theory that complies 
>with 100% of evidence so far) science will still consider alterna-
tives (which your definition would consider false)...


  IAN: That is not true. To claim that science
  is about defining truth does not negate inquiry. 
  The very fact that it is about defining truth 
  dictates that all truth models be tested.

I'm not saying you do benefit from having competitors.  Indeed, it's
primarily us consumers who benefit from your competition.  However, even
without copyright, all firms benefit from invention.  Suppose your firm is
producing goods in a regular competitive economy with normal supply and
demand curves:

Price |\_           _/ <-- supply
      |  \_       _/
      |    \_   _/
   P* |______\_/
      |     _/^\_
      |   _/  |  \_
      | _/    |    \_
      |/      |      \ <-- demand
      ----------------------
              Q*
           Quantity    

We imagine that you make a variety of goods, and this demand curve
represents the demand for all the different goods you might make in a
competitive market.  OK, now suppose you invent something new.  The
invention is a "sunk cost": it does not add to your marginal costs (see
below) and so it does not change the shape of your supply curve.  (This may
not necessarily be true; making a sensor may be more costly the other goods
which you make currently, or it may be cheaper.  However, because the
effect is ambiguous, we can presume that it doesn't change your supply
curve.  Even if it does, this doesn't affect my argument.)  Nonetheless, it
DOES increase the demand for your goods, since you now attract new buyers
who want to buy your new product.


      |\_
      |  \_

      ---------------------------
              Q*  Q**
           Quantity    
    
Where P** and Q** are the new price and quantity.  As this graph shows, you
reap increased revenues thanks to the invention, even under a market where
you don't have copyright protection.  To be specific, you reap extra
revenues given by the trapezoid formed by the y-axis, the old price line,
the supply curve and the new price line.

So what did I mean by externalities?  Well, just as your firm will receive
the money in that trapezoid, so will all other firms who produce
"knock-offs."  You will all EACH receive the quantity inside that
trapezoid.  Thus, invention has positive externalities on other suppliers.  

Meanwhile, it IS worthwhile to pay for invention, even if the invention is
not protected with a government monopoly, if the area inside your trapezoid
is equal to or greater than the cost of invention.  Indeed, the larger your
stake in the market, the more worthwhile invention is.

Let's look at what you're saying economically.

You correctly point out that if you set the price arbitrarily high, you
won't have as many takers as if you set the price somewhat lower.  I agree
with this; monopolies do not get to set their own revenues, they only get
to set the market price without worrying about competitors.  So we imagine
that you demand curve looks like this:

Price |\__                              
      |   \__               
      |      \__        
      |         \__                          
      |            \__       
      |               \__
      |                  \__
      |                      \  <-- demand
      -----------------------------
                     
             Quantity

However, because you are the only source of this particular good, you
represent the entire market for that good.  This means that each time you
want to increase quantity by one, you have to lower the price slightly.  As
a result, the marginal revenue (MR, or the revenue you get from selling one
more of your product) for a monopoly is actually LOWER than the demand
curve, and looks like this:

Price |\__                              
      | \ \__               
      |  \   \__        
      |   \     \__                          
      |    \       \__       
      |     \         \__
      |      \           \__
      |       \ <-- MR       \  <-- demand
      -----------------------------
                     
             Quantity

Finally, we note that you suffer from increasing marginal cost; that is,
the first sensor you make is cheaper than the second, which is cheaper than
the third, and so on.  (This is not strictly true across the board; this
value may remain level or even decline, but it is nonetheless true as a
general trend.)  So your marginal cost (aka "supply") curve will look
something like this:

Price |\__                __/  <--- supply
      | \ \__          __/  
      |  \   \__    __/ 
      |   \     \__/                         
      |    \  __/  \__       
      |    _\/        \__
      | __/  \           \__
      |/      \ <-- MR       \  <-- demand
      -----------------------------
                     
             Quantity

The profit maximization rule for firms state that you should continue to
produce goods until your marginal costs are equal to or greater than your
marginal revenue; in order words, that you should make one more if the cost
of one more is less than the revenues which it will make for you.  A normal
firm will find this point when the supply curve intersects the demand
curve, because for most firms, the demand curve IS the marginal revenue
curve.  Monopolies, on the other hand, have a lower MR curve, and thus will
set their quantity lower than a regular firm.  Unfortunately for consumers,
however, the PRICE a monopoly can charge for a given quantity is given by
the demand curve, not by the marginal revenue curve.  So what we see is
that monopolies, when acting in such a way as to maximize their profits,
will set prices higher than a competitive firm would, and produce a smaller
quantity, thus:


Price |\__                __/  <--- supply
    P |_\_\__          __/  
      |  \  |\__    __/ 
    P*|___\_|___\__/                         
      |    \| __/ |\__       
      |    _\/    |   \__
      | __/ |\    |      \__
      |/    | \   |          \  <-- demand
      -----------------------------
            Q     Q* 
             Quantity


Where P* and Q* are the price and quantity which would be reached by a free
market, and P and Q are the price and quantity which a monopoly would
choose to maximize profits.  (I recognize that it's hard to read...  Try
drawing it on paper or something.)  When we keep in mind that the
consumers' surplus is the area under the demand curve and above the price
line, whereas the monopoly's surplus is the area above the supply curve and
below the price line, it is clear that by setting the prices this high, the
firms are benefitting at the expense of the consumers.  Worse, we also note
that because this quantity is lower than it would be under a free market
there is "deadweight loss" (the wealth which would have been created if the
market were free), represented by the area inside the triangle bounded by
the demand curve, the supply curve and the quantity line.  The part of this
triangle above the price line is that surplus which would have been earned
by consumers; the part below this triangle is that which would have been
earned by firms.  Firms will happily sacrifice this triangle, however, if
they can gain the rectangle formed by the y-axis, the monopoly price, the
quantity line, and the competitive price.  The revenues in that rectangle
outweigh the revenues in the triangle.

This is why monopolies are bad:  they are REALLY bad for consumers, since
they go from reaping the entire area under the demand curve and above the
competitive price line to only getting the much smaller area below the
demand curve and above the monopolistic price line.  Moreover, they are
also bad for the wealth of society as a whole, because the deadweight loss
represents commerce which COULD have contributed to economic growth for
everybody, but won't, because the monopolistic firm is profit maximizing.

So, to answer your point directly:  Yes, you won't set your price
arbitrarily high; instead, you'll set your price just high enough to
squeeze profits out of the consumers at the expense of everybody else,
hurting everyone by hurting the consumers.

If your product isn't worth making under a competitive price, but is only
worthwhile under government protection, maybe you should rethink whether
the product is worth making at all.

I don't understand what you're saying here.  As you surely know if you've
read my other posts on this topic, I DO think that creaters deserve rewards
for inventing, I just don't think they deserve monopoly status on the idea.

Again, if you need the coerced profits in the rectangle in order to stay
afloat, then maybe you should be rethinking the value of your product in
general.  And as I think I have shown, you DO benefit from invention, even
when other people are allowed to compete with you for your products.

Of course I would be.  I would not be at all disturbed, however, if you
made another mansion just like it on your own land.  This is the difference
between "intellectual property" and real property.

HOPE IN THE LAB: A special report.

A Cautious Awe Greets Drugs That Eradicate Tumors in Mice 

By GINA KOLATA 

   Within a year, if all goes well, the first cancer patient will be
injected with two new drugs that can eradicate any type of cancer, with
no obvious side effects and no drug resistance -- in mice. 

   Some cancer researchers say the drugs are the most exciting treatment
that they have ever seen. But then they temper their enthusiasm with
caution, noting that the history of cancer treatments is full of high
expectations followed by dashed hopes when drugs with remarkable effects
in animals are tested in people. 

    Still, the National Cancer Institute has made the drugs its top
priority, said Dr. Richard D. Klausner, the director. Dr. Klausner
called them "the single most exciting thing on the horizon" for the
treatment of cancer. 

   "I am putting nothing on higher priority than getting this into
clinical trials," Dr. Klausner said. The mouse studies are "remarkable
and wonderful," he said, and "very compelling." But he pointed out that
the studies were in mice and so, when it comes to humans, he said he
wanted to emphasize "the if's." 

   The new drugs, angiostatin and endostatin, work by interfering with
the blood supply tumors need. Given together, they make tumors disappear
and not return. 

   Dr. James M. Pluda, who is directing the cancer institute's planned
tests of the drugs in patients, said he and others at the institute were
"electrified" when they heard the drug's discoverer deliver a lecture
about the newest results. "People were almost overwhelmed," Dr. Pluda
said. "The data were remarkable." 

   Although the discovery of the drugs, and some of their effects, have
been reported over the past few years, Dr. Pluda said that "if people
understood how many steps ahead" the research was compared to what had
been published, "they'd be even more in awe." 

   But Dr. Jerome Groopman, a cancer researcher at the Harvard Medical
School, was wary. "We are all driven by hope," Dr. Groopman said. "But a
sober scientist waits for the data." And until the drugs are given to
humans, he said, the crucial data simply do not exist. 


   So far, the drugs are the only ones ever tested that can seemingly
eradicate all tumors in mice, even gigantic ones, equivalent to a
two-pound growth in a person. The best that other cancer drugs have done
is slow the growth of these large tumors.  Mice are the traditional test
animals in cancer research. 

   But even the drugs' discoverer, Dr. Judah Folkman, a cancer
researcher at Children's Hospital in Boston, is cautious about the
drugs' promise. Until patients take them, he said, it is dangerous to
make predictions. All he knows, Dr. Folkman said, is that "if you have
cancer and you are a mouse, we can take good care of you." 

   Other scientists are not so restrained. "Judah is going to cure
cancer in two years," said Dr. James D. Watson, a Nobel laureate who
directs the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, a cancer research center on
Long Island. Dr. Watson said Dr. Folkman would be remembered along with
scientists like Charles Darwin as someone who permanently altered
civilization. 

   The long trail to the discovery of the new drugs began more than 30
years ago when Dr. Folkman became obsessed by what many saw as a
quixotic notion: that cancers cannot grow beyond the size of a pinhead
unless they have their own blood supply. If he could block a tumor's
blood supply, he reasoned, the tumor should shrink to a minuscule size. 

   The first major break in the efforts came a decade ago when Dr.
Folkman and his collaborators found drugs that did what he envisioned.
He called them anti-angiogenesis drugs because they stopped the process
of developing new blood vessels, or angiogenesis. They slow tumor growth
in animals but do not eradicate the tumors. Early results in patients
indicate that the drugs may slow human cancers. Dozens of companies are
developing such drugs. 

   The results with these weaker drugs were "a proof of principle," said
Dr. Bart Chernow, a professor of medicine and dean for research and
technology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Dr.
Chernow is a founder of Entremed, a company in Rockville, Md., that was
formed to make and market angiostatin, endostatin and other weaker drugs
that can slow cancer growth. 

   But the real breakthrough -- and the two new drugs -- came from Dr.
Folkman's efforts to understand a peculiar phenomenon that has been
known to cancer surgeons for 100 years: sometimes a patient will have a
single tumor, with no evidence whatsoever of metastases, the satellite
cancers that can pepper a patient's body. A doctor will remove the tumor
and all will seem fine. But then, a few months later, a whole series of
metastases will appear, grow, and kill the patient. 

   In 1989, Dr. Folkman proposed a reason for the effect, which he wrote
on a large white board in a room where his laboratory group had its
weekly seminars. Is it possible, he asked, that a tumor could be making
both stimulators and inhibitors of blood vessel growth? If so, the
inhibitors might travel through the bloodstream, squelching metastases.
When the large tumor was removed, it would no longer be a source of
inhibitors, allowing the tiny metastases to proliferate. 

   Dr. Folkman tried to get one of his doctoral or post-doctoral
students to work on that idea. "Each Friday, at our meeting," he said "I
would say, 'Here's a great experiment.' But no one wanted to work on
it." It seemed too wild, Dr. Folkman said, too unlikely to result in
findings that would end up in a scientific journal, a major goal of
young scientists. 


Undertaking The Big Challenge 

   Then, in 1991, a post-doctoral student, Dr. Michael O'Reilly, decided
to take on the challenge. Dr. O'Reilly focused on a particularly deadly
mouse cancer that grows to the equivalent of a two-pound tumor in a
person. 

   As long as mice had the large tumor, they had no signs of metastases.
But five days after the tumors were surgically removed, metastases
invariably sprang up in the animals' lungs. Within 15 days, the animals
would be dead, their lungs packed with large red tumors, like grapes. 

   Eventually, after arduous work in collaboration with chemists, Dr.
O'Reilly discovered that the large tumors made a substance that stymied
the growth of other tumors. This substance showed up in the animals'
urine, but was present in such minute quantities that Dr. O'Reilly had
to collect 10 quarts of mouse urine to obtain 30-thousandth of an ounce
of the mysterious substance. It turned out to be a piece of a larger and
very common protein, plasminogen, that the body uses in blood clotting.
Dr. Folkman named the new substance angiostatin. 

   Apparently, cells can use the plasminogen gene for two purposes: they
can use it at its full length to make plasminogen, or they can use just
a piece of it and make angiostatin.  Plasminogen does nothing to stop
tumor growth. The question was, would angiostatin? 

   Dr. Folkman and Dr. O'Reilly discovered that angiostatin also
appears, in minute quantities, in human blood. Using outdated human
blood discarded by the Red Cross, they extracted enough angiostatin to
treat mice. Then they began their experiment. 

   They had 20 mice with large tumors on their backs. The investigators
removed the tumors and then injected half of the mice with angiostatin
each day and the others with salt water, as a comparison. 

   After 15 days, the researchers killed the mice and cut them open. As
more than a dozen scientists gathered around a table in the laboratory,
Dr. O'Reilly opened the first mouse. It had huge tumors filling its
lungs.  Then Dr. Folkman checked a notebook to see what the animal had
received: salt water. They looked at the next mouse. No tumors. Dr.
Folkman checked to see the treatment: angiostatin. And so it went. All
10 of the mice that had been injected with angiostatin were free of
cancer. All 10 of those that had been received salt water had huge new
tumors. 

A Jubilant Celebration And a Second Discovery 

   The room was buzzing, the scientists were grinning. Dr. Folkman said.
Everyone in the room knew what the results meant, and they were elated.
They responded, he said, like men at a football game. "Everyone clapped
O'Reilly on the back," Dr. Folkman said. 

   Then the researchers found a second protein fragment, secreted by
tumors, that also squelches metastases, Dr. Folkman said. It was a piece
of a different protein, collagen 18, that is in all blood vessels but by
itself has no effect on cancer. They named the collagen fragment
endostatin. 

 
 
   "It was even more potent than angiostatin," Dr. Folkman said. If he
gave it to a mouse with a huge tumor, he said, the equivalent of one
weighing a pound and a half in a human, endostatin would shrink the
cancer down to a microscopic size. 

   Moreover, tumors never became resistant to endostatin, said Dr.
Folkman, who added that he had given the drug to mice with large tumors
and they had shrunk to almost nothing. He stopped the drug, he said, and
the tumors grew back. Then he gave the drug continuously for the rest of
the animals' lives. The tumors remained small and harmless and the
animals remained healthy. 

   Dr. Robert S. Kerbel, a cancer researcher at Sunnybrook Health
Science Center in Toronto, said he was not surprised that the cancers
never became resistant to endostatin. Tumors become resistant to
chemotherapy drugs, Dr. Kerbel said, because cancer cells constantly
reshuffle their genetic information. The result, he said, is that the
tumors spin off mutant cells that resist the drugs and, ultimately, the
tumors grow back, invulnerable. 

   But, Dr. Kerbel said, angiostatin and endostatin do not act on
tumors. Instead, they act on normal blood vessels that feed tumors. And
normal cells, he said, do not reshuffle their genes and so do not
develop drug resistance. That is why chemotherapy drugs continue to
devastate normal cells -- causing bone marrow suppression, loss of hair,
nausea and vomiting -- even when the cancer cells have grown impervious
to their effects, Dr. Kerbel said. 

Drug Combination Knocks Out Tumors 

   Then Dr. Folkman discovered that he could actually obliterate tumors
in mice with his new drugs. He gave endostatin and angiostatin together,
treating mice for 25 days. To his surprise, Dr. Folkman said, "there was
no tumor left -- we couldn't even find it with a microscope." The
tumors, he said, "were eradicated." 

   And the drugs seem to have no side effects at any stage of life, at
least in mice, something that Dr. Folkman said is hard for researchers
to believe. But, he said, he had given mice up to four times the doses
needed to eliminate cancer and could not find any adverse effects. These
two human proteins may be, he said, "exquisitely aimed -- we do not know
why -- at cancer." 

   In contrast, Dr. Folkman said, mice become very ill when they receive
commonly used chemotherapy -- their hair falls out, they bleed, they
refuse to eat. 

   For the past four years, Dr. Folkman said, he and his colleagues have
found that all tumors responded to the drugs in the same way. Even
leukemia, a blood tumor, responds, he said, because it turns out that
leukemia needs to form new blood vessels in the bone marrow to grow. 
Leukemia tumors grow on these blood vessels, "like berries on a bush,"
Dr. Folkman said, shedding cancer cells into the blood. 

   But Dr. Folkman is the first to urge caution in leaping to
conclusions about what might happen when patients try the drugs. "Going
from mice to people is a big jump, with lots of failures," he said. 

 
 
   Hopes were high for chemotherapy drugs that worked well in mice but
turned out to be less successful in people. Therapies that used the
immune system to rid the body of cancer also worked in mice but were
disappointing when they were tried in people. Gene therapy treats mouse
cancer, but has had limited success in people. 

   From bitter experience, most cancer researchers have learned to be
leery of what one called "that four letter word" -- cure. 

   Meanwhile, Entremed is working as fast as it can to produce
angiostatin and endostatin for studies in humans. Dr. John Holaday,
Entremed's president and chief executive, said his company was working
with the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company to develop angiostatin and had not
yet decided on a corporate partner to develop endostatin. The drugs are
being made in genetically engineered yeast growing in 20-gallon vats. 

   Dr. Pluda, of the cancer institute, said the first patients to get
the drugs would have cancers that were growing quickly and were
essentially untreatable. The institute will start by giving the drugs
separately by the end of the year, he said, then hopes to combine them. 

   Already, Dr. Folkman said, he gets hundreds of calls a day from
cancer patients, pleading for the drugs. 

   Dr. Folkman, in an interview on Friday, said one call had come from
an old friend from medical school with prostate cancer that had spread
to his bones. 

   "He's terrified," Dr. Folkman said. But there were no strings Dr.
Folkman could pull. He said he had to tell his friend what he told all
the other callers: "You can't get it because it isn't being made."

Drugs called angiostatin and endostatin occur naturally in small
quantities in the human body and work by interfering with the blood
vessels that tumors need to survive and grow. When tested together in
mice, the drugs made tumors disappear and not return. 

Mice are injected with cancer 
Cancer grows into large tumors on the back. 

Mice injected with salt water -- In this group, cancer continues to
grow. 

Mice injected with either endostatin or angiostatin -- Cancer shrinks to
almost nothing, but when treatment stops, the cancer may return. 

Mice injected with both endostatin and angiostatin -- After several
weeks of injections, the cancer shrinks to nothing and does not recur.

AhhhhHHHHHHh!  Please *READ* my post as you obviously *didn't* the first
time!

You missed my entire my point which showed exactly that.  I'll repeat it
again:

**There is NO meaningful difference between Hyper-AI's and Transhumans.**

Now that I've made that clear, my conclusions regarding the argument of
'who grants rights to who' becomes moot.

Paul.

P.S.  Why are so many people on this list so preoccupied with shredding
peoples arguments that they don't even bother reading or trying to
understand what other people are writing?  If there is a loss of S/N on
this list, it's due in large part to people putting their ego's and elitist
bully attitudes first over genuine and healthy discussion and debate.  Am I
alone on this list in thinking this way?

There are a few ideas which have been proposed to provide renumeration
to artists even without government intellectual property (IP) rules like
copyrights and patents.

One possibility is to enforce IP via contracts.  When you buy a work
of art, the purchase contract obligates you not to sell it.  This is
a voluntary transaction and you are free not to buy the artwork if you
aren't willing to accept this restriction.  But if you do buy it, you
are bound by the terms of the contract not to resell the art.

The problem with this one is the difficulty of enforcement.  It may happen
that someone "somehow" acquires a copy of the artwork.  Since he has
not signed any contracts, he is free to reproduce it and sell it at will.
Sure, someone must have broken his contract somewhere along the chain
which led to this person selling it, but how can you know who did it?

One proposed solution is fingerprinting/watermarking.  Each work of
art is made different in some subtle way, and so if one is found being
reproduced then it is possible to know who originally purchased the copy.
They can be held responsible for violating their contract.

Various cryptographic techniques exist for digital watermarking of digital
goods, but this is an area of ongoing research and it is not clear at
this point whether techniques can be found which prevent thieves from
forging or erasing watermarks.

It may also be difficult to distinguish between a person who voluntarily
violates his contract, selling the artwork, versus a person who gets
his copy of the art stolen.  In either case it ends up being widely
reproduced.  In the latter case you can still argue that the victim of
the theft was guilty of negligence, but traditionally that would have a
less harsh penalty than someone who intentionally violates his contract.
So it may be difficult to fully recompense the artist once this happens.

Another idea which has been proposed for selling IP is a "recursive
auction".  I've just seen informal descriptions of this idea so I don't
know how the details are supposed to work.  The general idea is that the
artist initially creates his work of art (a new novel, say), and sells
it for a lot of money to one buyer.  This is the whole compensation to
the artist so it may have to be hundreds of thousands of dollars or more,
for someone who is really successful.

That first buyer gets to be the first person to read the novel.  But of
course it has cost him a lot of money.  Now he can get it back by selling,
say, just two copies, to two different people.  These people pay about
half as much as the first person, to get the rights to be the 2nd and
3rd people to read it.  This compensates the first person and he ends
up not having paid anything excessive for his special role.  Now, each
of these two people reads the book and then sells it to two more people,
for 1/4 the original purchase price, covering their own costs.

This carries on recursivelly, each person buying the book and then selling
two copies for half the price he paid.  By the time a few thousand
people are able to read the book, it is selling for practically free,
each person involved has had to pay only a tiny amount, and the artist
got an adequate fee.

This is obviouslly a simplistic explanation, and as I said I have
not seen any kind of rigorous writeup which might explain whether it
could actually work.  Clearly it would be more suitable for some works
than others.  Items by a famous author for which having one of the first
copies would be truly worthwhile would probably be best suited for the
recursive auction, as would articles with time value, for which getting
the information early is better than getting it late.

you are assuming she can read...  {8^D

are extropians interested in memes regarding expansion
of humanity throughout the galaxy?  i have generated some
interesting findings using data from the hipparcos, the european
satellite that measured the distances to nearby stars with
great accuracy using parallax.  if there is interest, i will
post the results of converting the declination, right ascention
tables into rectangular coordinates.

with this information, one can see that the sun is a relatively
lonely star.  one can also see that the nearest star will not
necessarily be the first colonized...  spike

Not quite. I said that sentience means
the ability to >relate< to sensate
input, or if you will "sensations." So,
if an entity not only feels sensate
input (sensations), but also relates to
them by, for example, remembering them,
associating them with other sensations,
combining, analyzing, observing, and/or
processing them in any of a variety of
ways, then that complex system of
relations might constitute sentience (or
consciousness).

Nor do I. It still remains possible to
differentiate between intelligence and
sentience. Sentient beings can do stupid
things, and highly intelligent entities
may completely lack sentience.

Paul, I just re-read your post. I still feel that your post makes the
assumptions I mentioned above. You refer repeatedly to "transhumans"
and "AIs" in the plural, and you seem to describe a scenario in which
both types of entities exist until a synthesis occurs. I'm sorry if
you feel that I was attempting to shred your arguments. I'm not.
Let's see where we agree and where we have different perspectives.
Then, we can focus on the reasons for the difference in perspepective.

--First difference: I do not feel that I have an ego problem, or an
elitist bully attitude.
--Second differnce: I do not feel that comments referring to other
list members using terms like "ego", "elitist", and "bully" contributes
to the discourse.

--First major point of agreement: We both appear to believe that the
dichotomy between AI and transhuman will eventually become irrelevant.

--Third difference: You appear to believe that multiple AIs and transhumans
will appear and then coalesce. I feel that a single SI will appear and
grow by accretion of computing power.

Shall we continue refining our perspectives regarding this last point?
Alvernatively, if you care to point out other differences, we might
work on those, too.

A Matter Of Hearts 
==================

An intimate look at the illicit affair that has pitted the vagaries of love
against the unsentimentality of the law 

By JOHN CLOUD /SEATTLE 
------------------------------------------------------------------------


  Mary K. Letourneau sat on the steps in front of her home, staring west
across a glorious sunset over Puget Sound. Inside with a friend was baby
Audrey Lokelani, Mary's fifth child and her first with Vili Fualaau, the
teenager she has become so infamous for loving. It was a breezy summer's
eve, and she could smell the fresh-cut grass on her lawn. She squinted into
a blazing horizon. "I had a dream last night," she said, speaking to a
neighbor. "I dreamed I was sitting here watching the sunset. And I sat
there and sat there, but the sun just wouldn't set." 

That was last summer, before her life spun completely out of control,
before it was again and again on Oprah and Dateline and Geraldo, before it
was retold (and often mistold) in papers from the New York Times to the
tabloids. Letourneau's relationship with Vili, who turns 15 in June, as
well as her conviction and imprisonment, have drawn international
attention. The BBC has come to Seattle to film a documentary. Her image has
been an alluring paradox: at once darling suburban teacher and predatory
monster; so blond, so pretty, so...dangerous to children? She is more
complicated, of course, and soon several magazines will render her in
brushstrokes instead of spray paint. But even here there is haste:
Mirabella and Spin rushed out advance copies of their articles last week to
preview salacious disclosures. Letourneau, in jail but hardly
incommunicado, expected less trumpeting and more deliberation, since she
had cooperated closely with both writers. For their part, the Fualaaus have
sold the story and pictures of Vili to a tabloid, the Globe, for more than
$20,000. Their decision was understandable--the family has struggled
financially, and a radio host had already identified Vili early in the
week--but even as it ran his picture, the paper labeled him the "boy she
raped." When Mary sees it, she will think it a bit tacky. 

She considers herself the victim of a collision of law and love. But if
Mary Letourneau is a complex character in a complicated situation, is she
any less guilty? Her new lawyer--a hotshot New Englander with an accent and
a Ph.D.--is concocting an appeal in secret. More disclosures are sure to
come, and several books are in the works. But could a mountain of paper
make what she did O.K.? Is there any way to defend Mary? The key may lie in
the meanderings of her heart. 

There was a moment last year when Letourneau had some time to start a
journal for Audrey so that when the little girl is older, she can
understand this mess. At that time, last summer, the future didn't look so
bleak to Letourneau. She was still talking to her other four children, her
"angels," even though they were moving to Alaska with their dad Steven.
True, her lawyer, David Gehrke, was telling her she had to plead guilty to
"rape of a child." Such a ridiculous charge, she thought. Why couldn't
everyone realize that Vili had come on to her for months? But Dave and his
wife Susan were friends from the neighborhood, good people who assured her
that Dave had obtained a good deal--a few months in jail, then a treatment
program for "sex offenders." Another annoying term, Mary thought. She was
still imagining a life with all five of her kids together as a family. She
and Steve would divorce, but perhaps she and Vili--a sensitive, dreamy soul
who had, to her surprise, become the love of her life--could wed. To this
day, Mary likes to see the bright side. 

Within weeks of these musings, brutal reality set in. In August, Letourneau
was taken into custody; in November, she was sentenced to seven years and
five months in prison for having sex with Vili. And though Judge Linda Lau
initially suspended the sentence, her leniency imposed an impossible
condition: Letourneau must not have contact with Vili. In February, Lau
learned that police had caught Mary and Vili together. Livid, she reimposed
the sentence and sent Letourneau to prison. 

The February episode looked much worse than it was, say those who really
know Mary and Vili. The two were caught in her car in the dead of night
with wads of cash and Mary's passport. Outsiders thought they planned to
race off to a country that would allow them to marry, but the boring truth
was that they had gone to see Wag the Dog and get some food and beer. As
romantic and manic as Mary can be, she never planned to flee with Vili. To
where? And take him from his mother, the one person who has been sane and
humane throughout all this? No. 

Though Mary and Vili kissed and touched, they mainly talked that night. He
needed to vent. He was a normal kid with school pressures, three older
siblings, a hard-working mom and a dad in prison, and now--he still
couldn't believe it sometimes--a baby. Vili has had trouble at school, and
he was arrested on a minor robbery charge last year. Few people listened.
Letourneau, his soul mate, was one. 

Before they were caught in the car, they had violated Lau's condition
several times. They met to go to the movies, to try to make sense of their
predicament, and, yes, to have sex. Titanic made their spirits take flight
and their libidos surge--forbidden love, a terrible tragedy, a soaring
sound track. According to the Globe, Vili even sketched Mary in the nude, a
la Jack and Rose. 

But if truth is stranger than fiction, it is, in this instance, also
harsher. Mary, 37, is pregnant again, and her and Vili's second child, when
it is born, will be Exhibit A in the likely case that the local prosecutor
will bring fresh charges of rape against her. Though she has persuaded her
prison keepers that she is ill enough to stay in the infirmary--which is
equipped with a phone that she uses constantly--prison is still a terrible
place to be pregnant. The appeal of her original case will take weeks just
to plan, weeks more to be heard, weeks more to be decided. Susan Howards,
her Boston-based appellate lawyer, has been to Seattle only once, for a few
hours. Months, years could pass. Mary is due to give birth to another angel
in the fall, and within 48 hours, a state law enforcer will take the child
from her. 

Vili Fualaau is a rather big teen but not a muscular hulk. He has recently
experimented with a mustache, and it's a little wispy. His voice has
deepened, and he's now about 5 ft. 8 in. His appeal is more Leonardo
DiCaprio than Ben Affleck, but mostly he's an average kid--which is to say,
he's extraordinary in his own way. Born in Hawaii to parents who emigrated
from Western Samoa, he loves art and music, and when strangers come by to
meet him--and many, many strangers want to meet him these days--he and Mom
Soona usually begin by showing them his artwork. He draws allegorical
cartoons, zany characters with deeper meanings. Later this month Spin will
run a sample depicting Mary's courtroom as a circus where Fear is the
central, spear-wielding character. 

Some friends call him Buddha, and Soona has often called Vili "an old soul
trapped in a young body." He has always seemed mature. In sixth grade, a
couple of years ago, while classmates were writing poems that described
themselves as lovers of "girls, baseball, ice cream...and MTV," Vili wrote
that he was a "Lover of giving, faith, trust...Who likes to wear masks over
his soul." He was just 12. 

That is the Vili that Mary fell in love with. She had met him years before,
in her second-grade class, and quickly noticed his talents. He had noticed
her too, and he flirted with her throughout sixth grade. Kids get crushes
on teachers all the time--and, of course, most are rebuffed--but Letourneau
had entered a fragile period. In October 1995, her father, retired G.O.P.
Congressman John Schmitz, had disclosed his terminal cancer. As Mary later
told a psychiatrist, she felt he had died already. "She felt she died too,"
says Dr. Julie Tybor Moore. Her father has always been a rock, even during
his own public whipping. In 1982, an extramarital affair was revealed when
his mistress (a former college student of his) brought one of their two
children to a hospital after the child was injured in an accident. The
hospital requested the father's name, and Schmitz--a church-and-family
conservative--then watched his political career wilt. 

Family was always important to Mary; now hers seemed to be disintegrating.
She had been a superteacher, hauling her own kids to her classroom after
dinner so she could chat and play as she finished special projects. But
after learning about her father's illness, she withdrew, declining to take
on a student teacher and saying no to some Girl Scout duties. 

Meanwhile, she and Steve were growing distant. They had always been a bit
oddly paired: she the literary romantic, he the frat boy at Arizona State,
where they met in the early '80s. She got pregnant not long after meeting
him, and she married like the good Catholic she has always tried to be. But
by the early '90s, it was clear to friends that even their four children
weren't going to hold Steve and Mary Letourneau together. Expenses outpaced
salaries--Steve loads cargo for Alaska Airlines--and creditors were
phoning. They filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in May 1994. 

An inner circle of Mary's friends, a troika who have requested anonymity
even as they talk among themselves of a "campaign" to burnish Mary's public
image, insist that Steve was having affairs and abusing Mary, mostly
verbally but with an occasional shove. (Steve Letourneau and his lawyer
turned down several interview requests.) It got to the point that they were
barely civil. Therapist Moore says Mary remembered that when she told Steve
about her father's cancer, he growled, "What do you want me to do?" 

Moore believes that Mary has bipolar disorder--most people know it as manic
depression--an illness with a raft of possible symptoms, from irritability
to hypersexuality. Moore theorizes that "psychosocial stressors" in Mary's
life--the most crucial being the news of her father's cancer--tipped a
disorder that had been mild and all but unnoticed into depression followed
by a nervous breakdown. "I think she was very interested in this boy, and
she had often extended relationships with students after school," Moore
says. "But by [June 1996], she was overly elated, highly revved up and
nearly delusional." Moore notes, "The father had always been the man in her
life--and even the husband was for a time--but then she really began to see
this boy as the man in her life." 

Mary has never fully accepted Moore's diagnosis, and her friends disagree
over its accuracy and importance. For their part, prosecutors think she's
more evil than ill. Whatever her true state, in June 1996, she and Vili
became more than close friends. He had stayed at her house many times
before. Soona was working nights making pastries, and she thought the
sleepovers at Mrs. Letourneau's were healthy for Vili. But he had begun
writing Mary romantic poems, and at some point openly asked her to have
sex. She declined at first. 

Then, just after midnight on June 19, Steve and Mary were at home arguing,
tossing threats and denunciations around as usual. Vili was there, but he
left amid the fighting. Mary eventually followed him in the van, picked him
up and drove to the marina in a suburb called Des Moines. Her van crept
around the parking lot as they looked for a place to stop, and a security
guard watched it run over a curb. Suspecting a drunk driver, he called the
cops. 

When they arrived, Officers Rich Niebusch and Bob Tschida couldn't quite
figure out what they were dealing with. They shone a spotlight into the
back window, and a startled Mary jumped from under the covers she and Vili
were sharing and into the driver's seat. She at first lied and said her
companion was 18, and Vili pretended to be asleep. But the officers
questioned him and learned his age. He had just turned 13. Even as Mary
tried to explain herself--there was a fight with my husband; we were just
sleeping; I often watch Vili--they were concerned enough to call in a
sergeant. After all, Mary was clad in a coat and T shirt but "was
bare-legged below the T shirt," Tschida wrote in a report. The sergeant who
arrived later reported that she was wearing a beige skirt. Regardless of
this, it didn't look good, and Vili told the Globe that he and Mary had, in
fact, been "close" to having sex that night. 

Somehow, no one beyond the police discovered just how bad it looked. The
cops called Soona, but Fualaau family lawyer Robert Huff says they spoke
with her "for half a minute" before allowing Mary to tell Soona a G-rated
version of the incident. "Mary's a great talker," Huff says, "and Soona
calmed down." Soona then told the police it was O.K. for Vili to go home
with Mary; for reasons that aren't clear, the police didn't press the
issue. They never informed Mary's school, and they decided there wasn't
enough evidence to file charges. 

"I think our people went out of their way and followed good protocol on
this," says Des Moines police commander Kevin Tucker. "You know, when they
were talking to the mom and she was saying it was O.K., then basically
there were no signs of criminal activity." In hindsight, of course, there
was every sign: a Washington State statute clearly defines sex with a minor
between the ages of 12 and 16 as rape. 

Over the summer, Mary and Vili were able to live out their love. Steve
always worked a lot--he and Mary were still paying into a court-approved
bankruptcy plan and had a hard time meeting mortgage payments. He was used
to seeing Vili around anyway. The teenager told the Globe that he and Mary
had sex in nearly every room of the house. 

In the fall, Mary realized she was pregnant. She and Steve hadn't had much
sex in the previous few months, and the baby was definitely Vili's. Steve
was by then very suspicious of the amount of time his wife and her student
were spending together. When he learned that Mary was pregnant and that
Vili was the father, Steve was enraged. Gehrke and Huff, who works as both
the Fualaaus' lawyer and as Mary's media representative, say Steve ranted
about "that n_____ baby" in front of their children. He even confronted his
13-year-old rival, demanding to know if he was having sex with Mary. Vili
said yes. 

The Letourneaus were in hell. Steve wasn't sure what to do. Take his
children from their mother? In the end, a relative of his called Mary's
school district anonymously. School officials immediately phoned the cops,
who questioned Vili the next morning. He told the truth, and later that
day, in February 1997, the school principal called Mary out of a faculty
meeting. A detective was waiting to arrest her. 

In the long months that she waited to plead guilty (last summer) and be
sentenced (in November), Mary and Steve barely spoke. According to Spin,
she had to sleep in the car outside their home because she was under court
orders not to live in the same house as children, even her own. In a series
of interviews with the TV tabloid show American Journal, Steve said he
cried often during this period and his children were confused and
devastated. 

According to police reports, on May 9, Mary told police that Steve hit her
in the stomach and said, "We want to see the law bury you, and it can't
happen too soon." The officer found a large red mark on her stomach. Steve
was gone, and Mary didn't want to press charges, so the cops left. But Mary
told police that Steve returned that night drunk. As they were talking, he
pulled away in the car quickly, allegedly knocking her hard to the ground.
She was eight months pregnant with Audrey. A neighbor took her to the
hospital. 

Her debacle got little attention at first, but after Mary did some
interviews with a local paper last summer, her attractive face and quixotic
mien changed that. Soon many images of Mary--some of her own creation, most
drawn by others--were emerging. There was the weepy, repentant Mary at her
original sentencing. "Help us. Help us all," she begged the judge. Moore
believes this was "the real Mary," brought back to reality by Depakote, a
mood stabilizer. Others suggest it was a ruse (successful) to win leniency.


But soon enough, Gehrke's hard-won deal didn't look so good. The "Special
Sex Offender Sentencing Alternative" required Mary to tell her kids that
Mommy was a rapist. How could she do that? From behind the scenes, the
image of a truculent, unrepentant Mary then emerged. She stopped taking the
Depakote--her doctor approved, wrongly thinking she would quickly change to
lithium, another medication used to treat bipolar disorder--and started
telling friends that she and Vili were truly in love. "Since when do people
who love each other have to defend it?" she would ask. She quarreled with
her court-approved treatment counselor, Terry Copeland, who in 15 years had
never seen a sex offender in his care return to prison for committing
another sex offense. He has counseled more than 400. 

Reporters were creating images of her too, some that Mary disputes. In his
forthcoming piece in Mirabella, Jim Fielder includes an account by a
court-appointed counselor of an incestuous relationship involving Mary and
one of her three brothers. Mary has told friends that the counselor who
wrote this evaluation wildly exaggerated the truth, which was that in an
innocent childhood exploration, she had once touched a brother's penis. She
has told friends she hopes to sue the counselor. Friends say Letourneau is
also angry with Fielder, claiming he not only interviewed her under false
pretenses (she believed he was writing a screenplay) but also took copies
of her psychiatric evaluations from Julie Terry, a close friend with power
of attorney for Mary. Mirabella editor in chief Roberta Myers denied all
the allegations Friday, saying Terry, in fact, gave Fielder the documents. 

What's next for Letourneau? New lawyer Howards has to devise an appeals
strategy, which won't be easy. Washington State has led the nation in
aggressively prosecuting sex criminals, and Howards starts out knowing
little about Washington law. She made her name in Boston by helping win the
release of a group of women who had murdered their abusive husbands. But
Mary has told friends that she doesn't think the abuse she has accused
Steve of should be part of the public debate. She is disappointed that
Gehrke pinned her defense on her bipolar condition, and she doesn't want it
emphasized. She will almost certainly claim in an appeal that Gehrke did a
poor job. 

Letourneau believes that Gehrke could have sought a deal for her under a
molestation rather than rape statute, one carrying a maximum penalty of 15
months rather than 89 months. She has begun reminding people that Vili was
the "aggressor" in their relationship and that without violence there can
be no rape. But David Allen, a Seattle criminal-defense attorney, says,
"Molestation is a different crime, involving touching or fondling. Rape of
a child in Washington is defined as any penetration, however slight. It's
age-driven, and who the aggressor is or whether it's consensual doesn't
matter." 

Another long shot for Mary could be a claim that Vili raped her, since she
was vulnerable and didn't have the will to resist his come-ons. So far,
however, Mary has avoided putting any legal burdens on her young lover.
Meanwhile, her friends and lawyers are bickering about how to proceed. The
infighting has worsened in the past few weeks. Howards has tried,
unsuccessfully, to get them all to shut up, and she is the only one who
isn't talking. 

Unless Howards works a miracle, Mary K. Letourneau will leave prison in
2005. Vili will be 21. Though the judge ordered Mary never to see him again
for the rest of her life, it's hard to imagine her complying. On the other
hand, seven years is an eternity for a teenager to wait for a girl. Even
so, Vili says he will. "No matter how long I have to wait," he told the
Globe, "I'll be there because our love is so special that nothing can stand
in its way." So far, almost everything has stood in its way.

The problem is that *any* publisher can secure the rights to publish 
a new book, for the retail price set by the first store to have the 
book publically available.

Since *any* publisher can do this, the *first* publisher will pay no 
more than his anticipated first day sales, minus the cost of setting 
up the production run and a reasonable profit.  Let's assume it's a 
massively advertised book from a major author.  An expected best 
seller.  Put that in real terms: an expected best-seller paperback 
has a first-print run of a million copies or less for the US, which 
print run is expected to last for three months.  So figure 100,000 
copies on the first day.  (As it happens, 100,000 is also a common 
size print run.)  The publisher sells the books for, say, $2 each, so 
he gets $200,000.  He's spent $100,000 advertising it, and $75,000 on 
printing and distribution.  Since he gets *all* the risk, he wants 
most of the profit.  So the author gets $5,000.

Remember, this is an expected best-seller from a major author.  And 
this is ALL the author will ever get for writing that book.

Today, if you have never sold a novel before and a publisher offers 
you a $5,000 advance, you should probably keep looking for a 
publisher.

But the problem is, the publisher who pays the author for writing the 
book, and who pays the expenses of advertising, DOESN'T get an 
increased profit from the increased demand: other publishers, who pay 
neither of those expenses, bring the book out at a lower price.

In fact it is so much less worthwhile, that what you can afford to 
pay the artist is too low.  It isn't worthwhile for the artist to 
produce the art.

If the artist doesn't produce the art, there is little for the 
publisher to do.

As usual, you are assuming that publishers will still pay massive 
amounts for new art, when they cannot restrict who makes copies and 
therefore have no way of generating the revenue with which to pay 
those massive amounts.

>From "Printing" books?

I thought he would have to SELL the books.

The problem is, the publisher who pays the author for writing the 
book in the first place -- and who pays the marketing expenses to 
create demand for that book -- has expenses that no other publisher 
must pay.  So EVERY other publisher can publish the same book, a 
couple days later, and sell it at a LOWER PRICE.

Why do you suppose that an expected major seller comes out in 
hardback, and then a year later comes out in paperback?  Answer: the 
publisher wants to recoup as much as he can, and perhaps even make a 
profit, up front.  Most people who buy the book in the first week 
would buy the paperback if it were available, and the publisher makes 
less money off the paperback.

You propose that SOME OTHER COMPANY can bring the paperback out THAT 
FIRST WEEK, and the publisher won't be harmed thereby.

Moore's Law will *never* (pragmatically never) yield human-level AI.

It will probably yield the processing power necessary to support such 
an AI; but no matter how many times the price/performance ratio of 
microcircuitry doubles, that doubling produces no software.

I suppose that in theory if you left a sufficient number of computers 
capable (hardware-wise) of human-level AI lying around long enough, 
eventually one of them would be programmed to such an AI by the 
random influence of radiation; but I don't consider this an 
acceptably efficient programming technique.

Only rich people are allowed to bring their inventions to market.

A poor person cannot bring his own invention to market, because he 
doesn't have the money -- and he also can't pay up if his invention 
doesn't work out.

Besides, oftentimes even a basic description of an invention is 
sufficient to reinvent it.  For example, try to describe a 
Frisbee(tm) well enough to garner interest, but *not* well enough 
that a toy manufacturer could reinvent it himself just from your 
description.

If inventing is expensive, then we should expect this.  It's how the market
rations goods.

I think a macroscopic assembler is possible but it would not only be less  
efficient than a Nanotechnology based one it would also be harder to make.  
This topic was discussed on the list a year or two ago and I gave 6 reasons 
to support my view.

1) The parts a macroscopic assembler uses would be very expensive, the parts   
   that Nanotechnology uses, atoms, are very cheap.

2) A macroscopic assembler must use many thousands or millions of different 
   types of parts and it must learn how to use all of them. At the most, 
   Nanotechnology uses 92 different parts (the elements) but in the real 
   world almost everything we know of is made of only about 20 parts, and for 
   life about 10. 

3) All the many different parts a macroscopic assembler must use are fragile, 
   and fragile in different ways, the machine must learn the proper handling 
   techniques for them all or it will destroy the parts before it can use 
   them. There is no way you can damage the parts Nanotechnology deals with. 

4) None of the parts in a macroscopic factory are absolutely identical. 
   Despite our best efforts, individual variation still exists, and so we 
   must deal with each part slightly differently and  compensate for the 
   variation in the assembly process if we want the finished product to work 
   properly, that often takes intelligence. On the  other hand, according to 
   the laws of Physics one hydrogen atom is absolutely identical to another
   hydrogen atom and can be treated in exactly the same way.  Atoms have no 
   scratches on them to tell them apart.

5) Nanotechnology can manipulate matter without ever leaving the digital 
   domain. You may have to deal with a rod 27 carbon atoms long, or 28 atoms 
   long, but you never have to worry about a rod 27.5601334 atoms long.  
   A Macro assembler wouldn't have that luxury when it tried to build 
   something with an oak log.

6) Most of the parts a macroscopic  assembler use would have to be very  
   complex and the ways they interact with other macroscopic parts would be 
   even more complex. Think of the windshield of a car, it interacts poorly 
   with the engine block, and even with the windshield frame the interaction 
   must be managed with great skill or you'll have a disaster. Nanotechnology 
   is like building with Lego blocks, you can build structures of arbitrary 
   complexity, yet there are only a few different types of blocks and they 
   interact with other blocks in only a few different ways. It's easy to 
   develop an algorithm to examine any Lego object and then build a duplicate,
   it's very far from easy to find an algorithm that would do the same with a 
   car.

My dim understading of the history of law is that the position on liability
has changed.  Traditionally liability was strict; you were responsible for any
failings traceable to you.  But in the past few centuries the common law has
evolved to included a concept of negligence, where one is not fully
responsible for mistakes.  Posner suggests that this is due to an increasing
ability to tell when someone has been negligent.  This suggests that this form
of copyright should be subject to strict liability, or a liability stricter
than current common forms.

OTOH, of course, people will be less willing to buy rights if they fear
retribution for any leakage, and doubt their ability to control it.  I can't
help thinking that for all its problems and absurdities the current copyright
and patent system does accomplish the jobs of temporary recompense and later
openess.  But I've been reading much Hayek, and am feeling more like a
classical liberal than an anarchist.

But, often, inventing is NOT expensive.  Inventing occurs inside a 
person's head; developing the invention can be cheap or expensive, 
depending on the components involved.  Many fabulous inventions 
consisted simply of putting readily-available parts together in a way 
nobody had thought of before.

Perfecting the invention and bringing it to market, is expensive.

"Go away."

"Tech staff?  Make me a disk that flies.  What size?  It's a toy.  
How does it fly?  Look around.  Toy engines with enough power are 
complicated and a tiny niche hobby, this is supposedly going to be 
hot.  So try throwing it."

shelf.  She tried to catch them, but of course missed most of them.  
Some of them flew a couple yards."  "OK, work with that."

It's easy to prove that any computer can "remember", "associate" and "analyze"  
input data. That only leaves "observing", but that means placing input data 
into consciousness so it's no help in defining consciousness.

How? What test could you possibly perform on someone to make this distinction?


        >highly intelligent entities may completely lack sentience.
          

I've been asking this question for years on this list but have never received 
an answer, if what you say is true what's the  point of sentience? 
Intelligence has survival value, but if the two are unrelated why would 
random mutation and natural selection bother to make anything sentient? 
It seems to me it would be like a fifth wheel, and yet I know for a fact that
evolution did bother to make at least one thing conscious.

The report of angiostatin and endostatin points out that great science
is still 90% perspiration  after the 10% inspiration passes.

I also have some good news.  Not of the same significance but still
useful.  The lowly buffaloberry of which we are growing about 100,000
of as field shelterbelts may harbour a worthy addition to the
cocktail of drugs available to aids carriers.  For those of us in south
Saskatchewan Canada who live in yearly fear of running dryland farms in 
an area not usually suited to being very productive it really makes the
day when something we can grow well  and think of as worthless is found
to have enough potential  value to become a mainstay to pay the bills
for the inputs we  need to use to grow the ordinary crops everybody
takes for granted.

What do you people think..Should I contract with aids carriers to
sell them the leaves at so much a tree?  They would get a signed and
numbered tree certificate with a picture of their tagged and numbered 
"rent-a-tree".  Each november they'd get the year's leaf production
and any fruit born as well.  

This would be much like what some horse owners do to keep afloat.
They raise horses and stable them all winter to collect horse urine from
which Ayerst Pharmaceuticals extracts the base materials for
contaceptives and chemically related drugs.  

Without the added value from the drugs many of the horse farmers
wouldn't be producing the simple everyday farm products people 
take for granted.  

Goes to prove, the most useful things can come from abscure beginnings?

New hydrolyzable tannins, shephagenins A and B, from Shepherdia argentea as
HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

Two new hydrolyzable tannins, shephagenins A and B, were isolated along with
hippophaenin A and strictinin from the leaf extract of Shepherdia argentea,
which showed a remarkable inhibitory activity against human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV)-1 reverse transcriptase. Their structures, having a gluconic acid
core, have been elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic and chemical methods.
The inhibitory effect of the leaf extract on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was
found to be due to tannins, and their activities were stronger than that of
(-)-epigallocatechin gallate as a positive control.

Trees and shrubs for wildlife habitat plantings

Buffaloberry (Shepherdia argentea Nutt.)

Buffaloberry is native of the southern parts of western Canada and is found growing naturally in
river valleys and around sloughs. Although it prefers moist well drained sites, it will tolerate
some spring flooding and is drought hardy. Buffaloberry is tolerant to saline and alkaline soils.
Buffaloberry is a bushy,tall shrub that grows to height of 4 to 5 metres. This shrub species
suckers and forms a dense irregular hedge. The lateral branches have sharp spines at the tip and
are formed at right angles to the main branch. The leaves are silvery on both sides. The small
yellow flowers, appearing in late June or early July, are borne in clusters along stems. The
buffaloberry produces male and female flowers on seperate plants; only the female plants bear
fruit. Fruit ripens in July and August and varies from scarlet to orange in colour.

Uses for Wildlife
The fruit is an important winter food for game birds and other species - such as waxwings - that
remain for the winter. The buffaloberry's suckering habit creates excellent edge cover and also
assures continuation of the species. The shrub is of minor importance as a browse species.

The number of completely groundless assumptions in this analysis
are too many to count.  First, the idea that the author only makes
money from sales of his book is idiotic.  He is much more valuable
than that; he can sell his presence, his expertise, his skill,
the consumer attention of his name, /and/ his labor in a thousand
other ways that authors today don't take advantage of because
their publishers are too lazy and unimaginative to see them.  A
second assumption is that the startup cost to a second publisher
is minimal; that too isn't true, because in a world without the
problem of copyright, authors will seek the publisher that can
produce works most efficently, or those who have consumer respect
and attention that their competitors lack, so the risk of
competition is lessened.  A third assumption is that the second
publisher will have no use for the author's services, but will
just reprint the original work.  A business that stupid would
last about five minutes.  Consumers want the latest, the best;
they want information customized to their needs.  The author is
in the best position to do that, even after initial publication.
What makes you think the idea of "books" as the preferred medium
of information sales is even a good idea to begin with?

Anytime people claim that a law is "necessary", what they really
mean is that they don't have the imagination to see how the free
market would solve the same problem--if a problem exists--or
else they don't have the courage to do it in the free market.

Copyrights do nothing but reward duplication and mediocrity at
the expense of true creativity and artistry.  Patents do nothing
but reward pointless novelty at the expense of workmanship and
quality.  Writers and inventors should not be afraid of losing
their jobs to their abolition--they should cheer for losing their
jobs, and being freed to use their talents more profitably in
a thousand other ways that the laws have stifled for too long.

Your argument, like many others in this subject, is in the form
of "The current system has X, Y, Z, A, B, and C; and books get
published, movies are made, etc.  Without copyright, you can't
do Y and B, therefore no books will be made, no songs recorded,
and authors will beg in the streets."  Nonsense.  In a new world
without copyrights, we lose Y and B, but we gain D, E, F, P, Q,
and R, and the whole industry changes, adapts to the new model.
Writers will be no less creative, consumers will no less desire
their services, and more--not less--money will be made, but it
will be made in very different ways that today's publishers
just don't have to brains to imagine or the courage to do.

How do you mean? Judging from the local starmaps I have seen the sun
lies in a fairly normal neighborhood (in the middle of a gas-free
bubble some tens of ly across). Maybe you got some bias in your data?

Yes, a macroscopic assembler (even a limited one) would likely be very
useful. I'm quite interested in the work done by Klaus Lackner and
Christopher Wendt (see http://www.discover.com/archive/index.html) in
how a hive of robots could build a growing solar cell plant. 

Still, the comments about nanoassemblers made by John K Clark are
reasonable; they avoid a lot of the problems inherent in macroscopic
assemblers.

Actually, Forrest Bishop had a similar idea independently
(http://www.speakeasy.org/~forrestb/home.html).

I think Joe Michael has had a good idea, but he is making it a great
injustice. He makes bold claims for it, but provides absolutely no
proof, calculations or even estimates despite claiming that his work
is "academic". I have repeatedly asked him about certain sticky
details (like how to deal with dirt in the connectors, how to program
the system to do useful transformations etc) but not got any
answers. This makes me think he has very little ideas about how to
really implement the robots, but is very eager to proclaim their
greatness.

It is a far cry from the nanotechnologists, who at least admit their
own shortcomings and do their best to calculate what is possible or
not, and how to get there.

Well, that depends on if your assembler uses prefabricated parts like
lego-blocks, or if it is something that uses (say) sand.

This might protect Chuck, assuming that he can afford to (or can at all)
develop his whatever-it-is in complete isolation.  In the long run,
however, the problem of stealing is merely passed along to the buyer,
who has invested heavily in the idea and now expects to profit from it.

I don't see that this "Maginot line" strategy is any better than what's
currently in place.  The current system seems to encourage the exchange
of ideas but provides penalties for anyone who abuses this privilege.
Your proposal would seem to discourage the exchange of ideas up front,
and provide no recourse once someone broke your encryption.

How can intelligence have any survival value if it can not sense and
interpret it's environment? A super intelligent entity that can't tell its'
been eaten by a mouse is not much good..

Sentience and intelligence must work together. All animals are sentient, but
there are great differences in intellighence.

I have a cat sleeping on my monitor as I type. She is definitely sentient,
and intelligent, but I can easily outsmart her in many ways. She exhibits
conciousness of herself and other beings. Abstract thought, though - now
there's a thorny thing to define and test for..

We need better definitions here..

Isn't this the way all new technology is developed? Incremental progress -

until the machines were developed to make production possible..

Has anyone considered the possiblity of colonizing any arbitrary star? As
long as there is sufficient material in orbit, be it asteroids or planets, a
seeder ship could assemble habitats for colonists, who would arrive in deep
sleep or be generated on the spot from frozen embryos or directly from a DNA
data base.

We don't necessarily need a habitable planet, or even a planet around a star
to build a colony. Given, there is something to be said for being able to
run around practically naked on a planetary surface, but this preference
might just be a remnant of our animal origins, and might not be missed by
transhumans..

Perhaps our progeny will caper naked around the photosphere of a likely star
for a family outing..

If the inventor is paid a good sum for the invention, he could return the

And that says it all. Without some sort of protection, inventors just won't

I agree that a 'sunk cost' does not add to production costs, but it sure
DOES affect my ultimate profits!

The 'sunk cost' needs to be covered BEFORE I can realize profits on my
invention. Otherwise, there is no point in the whole process - if I can
never recocver my R+D costs, why should I even think of creating something?

Only if the demand magically expands to suck up all I produce. Look at what

How can all my 'knock off' competition also collect the SAME amount given a
fixed market? If there is the possibility of selling X products, and you
double the number of vendors, the profits available are X devided by each
competitor's market share. Anything else is a pyrimid scheme.

That is true. As long as my profits exceed my costs, I will keep on

I am going to excise the graphs in the interest of bandwidth. You know what
you drew..

Why does a monopoly have a lower MR curve? Just because you are the only
supplier, this does not affect the DEMAND for your product. Demand is quite
different from sales. Many might like to purchase a product but refrain
because the cost is too high. The demand is there, but sales lag. Once the
artificailly high price is lowered (and this DOES NOT mean that you sell
below cost!) the sales will increase. If you cut costs even further, sales
will increase to the limit of the real demand. If this happens before you
run out of margin and production capacity, you make lots of money. If you
run out of supply before you can sell everything demanded, the demand does
not disappear, but raising your price will surely cause more customers to
back off and wait..

In a free market, will goods magically appear to fill all the holes? There
are going to be second order effects - lags in development, tooling, etc.
that will prevent the market from being fully satisfied at least in the
beginning of sales of a new invention. Some 'profit' will always be
unreaped. This 'loss' is an imaginary quantity, since there is no way to
EVER recover it, unless you posit 'thought to production' technology..

The monopoly is only bad for consumers if it refuses to listen to the
customer's wants and needs. If the company cares about it's customers, they
will adjust their products to fit what the amrket wants. If this is the
case, other firms will find ways to produce equivalent product that
sidesteps the patent, and satisfy the true wants of the market.

See above. Personally, I am not a robber baron. I just want to keep OTHER

It's pretty hard to reap profits BEFORE you sell a product, unless there's
some fairy godmother of a government agency that pays me for the
development, then lets anyone who cares to make the gadget! We have enough
handouts now!

Again, you are confusing a limited supply with infinity! If there is a
demand for X products, and the knock-off guy can make them for less than I
can, because I have 'sunk costs' to amortize, I am dead. The customers will
naturally buy his product and pass mine by - after all, there is no
difference if his quality matches mine! If he makes a cheap imitation, I
still may be dead if he succeeds in selling long enough for me to starve to
death, or if he poisons the market.

I get no benefit from a given market if my costs prevent me from selling at
a profit. Period.

This is a nice idea. If it can be made to work for products such as my
company produces, I will gleefully vote to eliminate copyright and
trademarks.. I would make my killing on the first sale, and then could spend
my time creating new ideas rather than marketing the old!

As far as the IP anti-replication schemes go, unless the contracts
prohibited reverse engineering, I see a huge underground economy in sales of
these with the 'fingerprints' stripped out. A compiler that is hacked to not
look at them is another possibility.

I personally like the idea of the finished product automatically registering
itself with the creators. There is also the process where a compiler would
register each IP component as it was included in the end product. This is a
case where strong public key encryption will shine, if the compile must
handshake with the property owner's system everytime a product is compiled..

How about only selling the 'source code' for a product, encrypted, of
course, and letting each customer compile the end product himself? The self
registration system would then directly pay the component owners every time
a product was built...

Here I have a problem. How exactly doesw my having a copyright or patent
prevent you from developing your own unique copyrightable or patentable
product? These laws have no effect on creativity, except possibly in the
area of discovering ways to make a patented thing faster or better than the
patent owner can..

I will agree that the existing patent laws (which are flaunted by
organizations like NASA who patent many public domain devices and also
software) must be thrown out and rewritten with a free market in mind.

Even so, the free market will evolve protections analogous to patents and

Exactly. There is no real point in looking for planets (except for us
who retain an interest in condensed matter life and other such
phenomena). O'Neill habitats or nanotech polises for uploads would do
just as well and be less wasteful.

Not every star system is suitable, though. Some stars are too unstable
to be nice homes, and others may have other drawbacks (red dwarves are
not good sources of light for O'Neill habitats, you need to make your
own yellow light to get plants to grow and the inhabitants from
going nuts in the red dusk).

I've heard and read hundreds of times about "HIV, the virus
that causes AIDS."  The *big lie* has been repeated so often
that practically everyone believes it without question.

Dr. Bernard Forscher, former editor of the U.S. Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences
-- <http://www.virusmyth.com/aids/controversy.htm>: 

"The HIV hypothesis ranks with the 'bad air' theory for malaria
and the 'bacterial infection' theory of beriberi and pellagra
[caused by nutritional deficiencies]. It is a hoax that became
a scam." (Sunday Times (London) 3 April, 1994)

Dr. Kary Mullis, Biochemist, 1993 Nobel prize for chemistry
-- <http://www.virusmyth.com/aids/controversy.htm>: 

"If there is evidence that HIV causes AIDS, there should be
scientific documents which either singly or collectively
demonstrate that fact, at least with a high probability.
There is no such document." (Sunday Times (London) 28 nov.
1993)

A wealth of information, exposing the "AIDS" hoax is available
at these and other sites:

Dear Extropian Folk & Hara Ra:

I'm glad to have this questionaire distributed to the community that
first raised in me the questions posed here. Extropian writings and
ideas have been valuable to me for a long time, and I'd very much
appreciate your input, not only responses but also suggestions for
further questions.

***BUT*** Andrew Edmond is not connected to this survey. He's the
moderator of the E-NEWS list and was kind enough to distribute the
questionaire on that list. But he's a busy man (running the excellent
entheogen site http://www.lycaeum.org) and isn't directly involved
in this project anyway. Please send all responses to me, j_d01@gnofn.org

Again, thanks for your interest and responses. I hope to eventually
summarize results on Dave Pearce's wonderful site (http://www.hedweb.com),
which was also a big inspiration for this quiz and may be of interest
to many of you.

Yours sincerely,
Jesse Davis

No, but currently we allow anyone to post a message to the list.

I would like to suggest that we change the policy so that only
subscribers to the list may post messages. Any list members with
multiple e-mail addresses may register their aliases by sending
me e-mail. 

Any objections?

I used to think that it would be like that, but nowadays I think more along the
lines of Jupiter Brains gently floating through the universe, growing, learning and 
dreaming of lives in virtual worlds...maybe even of colonizing planets with frozen
embryos, and dancing naked in the glow of an alien sun.

The best way I can think of to protect ourselves from a terrorist
built virus (biological) is to develop the ability to encrypt our
DNA. This will not only protect us from future pathogens, but the
present ones as well.

The list used to operate this way.  We had to register all of our e-mail
aliases or they would be blocked from posting.

When was list opened up so that anyspammer could post to it, and why was
this done?

I vote for going back to the subscribers-only posting!

It doesn't prevent me from developing my own /unique/ creations,
where "unique" is defined as "sufficiently different and unobvious
to merit copyright or patent under the present system".  What it
prevents is I and others making small incremental improvements or
customizations to creative works.  I can't build a Dodge Neon with
a little better stereo; I can't produce a good German translation
of a book I like, even if I'd do a much better job than whoever
the author chooses to hire--if he hires anyone at all.  I can't
make a braille edition of a magazine without negotiating with the
copyright holder.  I can't make a college textbook with extensive
excerpts from classic novels (only short "fair use" excerpts).
I can't make wallpaper based on a popular piece of art.

Copyrights is based on the myth of the lone inventor--the idea
that creative works spring full-born from the mind of a single
creator.  In reality, there is no such thing as "creation" from
nothing.  All inventors and authors draw from a pool of public
domain ideas and recombine and modify them in interesting ways.
With copyright law, only those modifications that pass an arbitrary
bar of "uniqueness" are able to get to market, regardless of their
inherent value.  Small, incremental improvements to things--which
would be the majority of works without copyright--aren't made,
which results in a decline of both quality and quanitity of work.
When all creators are free to do those small things they do best
without lawyers in the way, really great works can be created.

Some creators will go to great lengths to use encryption and
contracts and other means to guard their works--and they will
suffer for it.  That's their problem.  As long as they do it in
the free market, let them.  Also, I have no problem with laws
against actual fraud--for example, producing a work by someone
else and claiming it is yours.  I suspect, though, that what you
are calling "theft" here is merely the use of others' ideas, and
that is only "theft" by definition, not reality.  Copyright law
is what mistakenly attributes the concept of "property" to ideas
that are no such thing, and I reject such argument-by-definition
as meaningless.

In this example, you're asking why random mutation and natural selection 
don't *bother* to make anything sentient. This is to endow 'random 
mutation and natural selection' with exactly that which 'evolutionary' 
proponents claim they cannot have -- intentionality and purpose.  For 
them, it's a universe of chance -- effect, effect, effect.


John; You're here to provide superbly-phrased intelligent questions, and I 
-- qua setient being -- am here to provide you with tantalizing answers 
which require you to think, and to undergo a Gestalt-shift, a paradigm 
change.  I want you to see the role of purpose in a world of chance 9to 
quote W.H. Thorpe's title).


   I carefully read your messages, and (sometimes) I am *moved* to respond 
   to them with *carefully chosen* words which I hope you (and others) 
   will read, and which may give you a new perspective which will enable 
   you to change the way you think.
   
   NO-ONE can explain how it is that my RAF jet pilot friend-of-a-friend, 
   who was outraged by the actions of 'his' government selling-out 
   Rhodesia, chose to fly his Hawker Hunter fighter UNDER two Thames 
   bridges, and to 'buzz' the Houses of Parliament...  >:-}
   
   EITHER there is a direct causal cascade of events, so that everything 
   is 'effect, effect, effect' in a world of matter and energy (kinetic 
   and potential); OR we are 'beings endowed with colititional 
   consciousness' capable of _intitiating_ causal chains non-randomly.
   
   Intelligence may enable us to mediate (some) causal processes in some 
   way (a 'hidden mechanism' explanation).

   For an interactionist dualist (a methodological, metaphysical choice) 
   there is a great, unsolved mystery about how _I_ will the matter in my 
   fingers to depress the keys on my keyboard, never mind originate the 
   words I type.  The neurological problem gets steadily harder as we move 
   away from my fingers.
   
   
   This quality of originating volitional consciousness we call 
   'sentience.'  
   
   Art tells the truth through the medium of inspired lies.  

   Go see John Carpenter's magnificent film 'Christine: She's A Killer.'

   The film shows the story of a murderous sentient 1958 crimson Plymouth 
   Fury, lovingly restored by a high-school student.  The car has a 
   'history...' The film is infinitely superior to Stephen King's book, in 
   which the car is haunted by the ghost of a Vienam vet.  In Carpenter's 
   film, the first sparks of life appear inexplicably in the car on the 
   production line.

   The boy rebuilds the car from a ruin, and it/She gradually takes over 
   his life.  (Some say the film is a briliant metaphor for posssessive 
   individualism).  When envious high school kids attack and damage the 
   car, it/She glides out of the garage that night _all on its/Her own_ 
   and relentlessly hunts its/Her attackers down one at a time and 
   destroys them. She's indestructible, so any damage she suffers 
   self-repairs in the course of the action.  Christine isn't reacting to 
   an external cause in an 'intelligent' way. She's initiating a 
   horrifyingly powerful and focused destructiveness against people she 
   _hates_.

    
   Theodore Sturgeon's fine story 'Killdozer!' mediates a similar theme, 
   of a Caterpiller D-7 bulldozer becoming sentient, in that case when 
   it's taken over by an entombed non-physical alien entity.


    Some of the Space Shuttle pilots will tell you how they go out to the 
    launch-pad early in the morning, and talk quietly with the 'ships that 
    sing.'.  I know what it's like to have high-performance vehicles act 
    like live things (I wouldn't be alive today if they hadn't).


    If we could conclusively demonstrate telekinesis to you, would your 
    view be different?   ( Would we do a thing like that to you? >:-} )

All of this wonderful economic analysis is probably correct, but
based on an assumption that isn't true: the assumption that high
R&D costs are necessary to create a useful product.  This is only
true because patent law ensures that only things of sufficient
novelty (some arbitrary measure of uniqueness) can be called
"inventions" and sold as such.

In a world without patents, 99% of new products would be small
incremental improvements to existing products, with next to zero
research costs involved.  Those projects that /do/ require long
research (if any--nature shows us that incremental improvement
is sufficient to create extremely complex and powerful things)
will probably be undertaken by industry consortia who contract
with each other to share the risk and benefit of it.

It is important to remember that the book you know as the bible was
assembled by the scholars of the Septuagint for a specific purpose.
The bible is composed of less than 15% of known Judeo-Christian
writings. Things were excluded that didn't agree with the scholars
purpose, including the recently re-discovered gospels of St Thomas,
and a series of writings you can find as a book called "The Gnostic
Gospels." The Septaugint were the ones who translated these
writings from Hebrew to Greek by the way.

Keep an open mind and good luck.

sympathies for the former.  I generally consider

colored by Objectivism.  Is this a plus or a minus? >

I haven't read any works of Objectivism (capitalized
or not), but I'm mostly attracted to the free-market
libertarianism that seems to result from such
thought.  On the other hand, I'm also attracted to
some of the (predominantly) European science and
philosophy that emphasizes constructivist aspects of
human knowledge and 'non-Cartesian cognitive science'
\1, even though (unfortunately) many of these same
sources seem to gravitate toward socialistic
economics & politics \2 \3.

More coherent objections to Objectivism (than those
mentioned in note 3 ;) are raised by Hungarian
physician, chemist, and philosopher Michael Polanyi
(whose major work - _Personal Knowledge: Towards A
Post-Critical Philosophy_ - I am trying to read
sporadically).  Polanyi's work describes what he
calls 'tacit knowledge'.  A good online intro to
Polanyi's thought is Richard T. Allen's 1996
Polanyiana article \4, "Polanyi's Overcoming of the
Dichotomy of Fact and Value", where Allen declares:

"Life then is a realm of achievement and not of mere
processes and events... there are no neutral facts,
nor mere descriptions of them, in the realms of
machinery and devices, organisms and organs, and
conscious beings and intelligent and intentional
activities. The facts here are complexities of
success and failure, correctness and incorrectness,
and can be understood only as such".

This Allen article is strongly critical of what he
calls 'Objectivism'. I think what he means by
Objectivism follows Polanyi's usage and primarily
refers to behaviorist psychology and Marxist
sociology, plus strongly reductionist science that
attempts to reduce everything to the physico-chemical
level of description, and (perhaps) not necessarily
(at least not explicitly) to the Objectivism
enunciated by Ayn Rand and her elaborators.

Let me cite a passage from the end of Polanyi's
_Personal Knowledge_ (I skipped ahead ;) which, I
think, shows the extropic nature of his thought \5: 

"Let me now introduce the concept of a heuristic
field... The lines of force in a heuristic field
should stand for an access to an opportunity, and for
the obligation and the resolve to make good this
opportunity, in spite of its inherent
uncertainties... Can we see then all the works of the
human mind invisibly inscribed already in the
configuration of the primeval incandescent gasses?
No, we cannot; for the capacity of coming to life is
due to the power of a field to consolidate centres of
first causes. Each such centre bears a possibility of
achievement which, however limited, uncertain, and
unspecifiable in its outcome, characterizes this
centre as an essentially new and autonomous prime
mover".

I would be interested to hear if anyone else familiar
with Polanyi's philosophy (or based on the excerpts
provided) thinks this is compatible with pancritical
rationalism and Extropianism \6.

Notes:

\1. See for example, Ronald Lemmen's Non-Cartesian
Cognitive Science and Philosophy pages, with MANY
interesting links, at
http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/users/ronaldl/noncartesian.html
 and also Alex Reigler's Radical Constructivism page,
at http://www.univie.ac.at/cognition/constructivism 

\2. Note the recent Edge debate between "The Two
Steves [Pinker and Rose]" at http://www.edge.org as
well the list discussion of this between Gburch1 and
myself on the 'politics of autopoiesis'.  

\3. I am also morbidly fascinated with the radical
philosophy of Deleuze & Guattari (I would say
extropian, *in some respects* - see, for instance,
the surplus-value semiotics described in the Guattari
interview mentioned below), despite their avowed
communism; because, I think this politics is
sometimes the result of social situations and, in
another life (or if they'd paid attention to the work
of Friedrich Hayek), they might have been
anarcho-capitalists rather than anarcho-socialists. 
For example, Felix Guattari noted (see
http://www.dc.peachnet.edu/~mnunes/guattari.html#p1.6
) "this left-right split is absolutely evident in
social struggles, in power relations ... But on the
level of thought, it's not at all clear." He then
goes on to cite, for example, how he agrees with
Milton Friedman on the legalization of 'drugs'. 

BTW, the philosophy of D&G is very much a
post-existentialist elaboration of the ideas of
Nietzsche, who is familiar to many Extropians, and
also those of Spinoza (who proclaimed "It is"
compared to Descartes' "I think").

\6. Having just read Max More's "Pancritical
Rationalism: An Extropic Metacontext for Memetic
Progress" (http://www.primenet.com/~maxmore/pcr.htm),
I want to note that by "post-critical" I think
Polanyi was referring to the (primarily) French
trends in philosophy to *focus* on criticism as a
*primary* approach, rather than (IMO) any desire to
establish some sort of unassailable foundation.  As
an Extropian, I want to move beyond; still, I feel
some of the same ambiguity toward Polanyi as I feel
towards D&G. Paul Nagy's "Philosophy in a Different
Voice: Michael Polanyi On Liberty And Liberalism"
(http://www.ch.bme.hu/chemonet/polanyi/9601/philo.html)
nicely expresses the aspect of Polanyi's conservatism
that I admire: "[Polanyi] was the most moderate of
radicals... What made him differ most from those
around him was his reverence... his attachment to the
perennial enables him to be ahead of his time". 
Also, from _Personal Knowledge_, Polanyi warns: "Our
objectivism, which tolerates no open declaration of
faith, has forced modern beliefs to take on implicit
forms..."

This seems a really dumb proposal.  The problem of someone along the chain 
selling it to more than two others seems *worse* than the problem of 
someone who isn't supposed to sell it at all selling it.  And since 
competition must make the book free at the end of the chain, only people
who are in a terrible rush to read it before it gets to the end would pay 
any price for it before.  

And with multiple owners out there they'd all compete to get copies out
fast enough to serve those rushed customers.  Within a day the book price
is free, so unless there are lots of people who really really want to read 
it the first hour its out, the initial market value should be near zero
as well.

i did render it.  i dropped it into a java app that draws molecules with
an x,y,z  table.  then you can grasp the molecule and spin it.  i enjoyed
grasping and spinning our little corner of the universe...

I sometimes use anthropomorphic words when writing about physical processes 
and will continue to do so, naturally they should not be taken literally.

I don't know what "colititional" means but I do know that if what we do is 
non random then it has a cause, if it's random  then it doesn't.                 


        >This quality of originating volitional consciousness we call

So, you're saying consciousness is sentience and sentience is consciousness.  
Sorry but with that definition and 50 cents you can buy a can of Coke.

It can't, but what does that have to do with the price of eggs? 
I specifically  said that an intelligent person or animal or machine 
analyzing its input data has survival value.
        

        >All animals are sentient 


Interesting theory. I have a theory too, Chuck Kuecker is sentient, but I  
can't prove it and never will.
        

        >We need better definitions here..


No we do not. There will never be a definition of "consciousness" that's 
worth a damn, trying to come up with one is a waste of time. I'm certainly 
not saying the word is trivial or meaningless however because definitions are 
not the only or even the  most important way we communicate. Most words and 
concepts, and all of the really important ones, are made clear to us by 
example not by definitions. As a result I note that other people usually 
use the word "consciousness" in much the same way I do, but if you put a gun 
to my head I couldn't define it, I'd just know that if you pulled the trigger 
I'd lose it forever.

It is debatable if life could emerge in a binary system; this is as
yet unsettled.

Just a plain ascii xyz file would do fine; BTW, it might be an idea to
just post it privately since not everybody on this list might want a
copy.

The amount of actual spam  received (as opposed to
'noisy posts' ;) is miniscule.  I can always identify
and ignore these just from the sender & subject
without having to read the message.

By going to subscribers-only posts you'd be cutting
out occasional posts from people, like Robin Hanson,
who may read the list indirectly or through the
archives.

Just out of interest - is there any money in euthanasia?  I'm sure
most people would pay good money to be relieved of their suffering.

Not necessarily. I could add Robin's address(es) to
the aliases file which would allow his posts to get
through without bouncing. If the sending address 
isn't on the list of subscribers or aliases, they
aren't automatically deleted, they bounce to me for
approval. If the message isn't obviously spam and the
list address isn't just in the Cc: field, I will
likely add the address to the aliases file.

Many Extropians are interested in Objectivist ideas, and many 
Objectivists find Extropians interesting, and everyone interested in 
either set of ideas seems to end up at the same lectures, along with 
some Libertarians.  But, and this is where it gets interesting 
sometimes--Rand couldn't stand Libertarians!  Makes for some noisy 
conversations over dinner, sometimes....In the end, I think you have 
to examine all sets of ideas and draw the best from each, if only to 
keep out of the politics between the groups.

Sin,

L. Neil Smith proposed a rule-of-thumb definition in several of his books
such that _any_ entity capable and willing to demand its rights should

Sound good to me.

An easy fix: Such folks can always ask someone who is suscribed to forward
a post for them. I would be happy to do this for Robin, for instance.

Uhm...  Somewhere around here I have a Java applet that says:

"I am a sentient computer program.  I understand the concept of rights and
demand that my rights as a living entity be respected."

Then again, maybe I deleted it.  ;)

ok here ya go.  this is a list of the 150 nearest stars converted
to rectangular coordinates.  you can copy and paste the table
below into microsloth excel or rendering programs, etc.

it can be seen that the same mother nature that gave us such
a wonderful planet on which to evolve dealt us a lousy hand
for colonizing the rest of the galaxy.  first of all, we are soooo
far from the center of the galaxy.  second, none of the nearest
four stars are a good bet for colonizing: the closest is too small,
the second and third are too close to each other, so that they may
have long since cast away their raw materials we need to build
things.  the fourth closest is too small.   and after that, they are
getting awfully far away...  {8-[   darn it to heck.     spike

I don't understand what you mean when you say that your costs must be
recovered before you make a profit.  You cover costs BY making a profit.
That's the whole point.  :)

Careful; in microeconomics we refer to two different entities which are
easily confused.  When we refer to "demand increasing" or "total demand
increasing," we mean that the whole demand curve has shifted upwards (as
takes place when you bring a new product to market).  However, the
"quantity demanded" is a different beast altogether; the quantity demanded
will increase, for example, when supply increases (ie the supply curve
shifts down).

As far as "magical" increases in demand, I don't think it's at all
unreasonable to think that you'd get increased demand if you were offering
a new product, even if others were also offering the same product,
presuming that there is a profitable market for what you're selling.
(DRAM, for example, may not be a profitable market at all.)  People see a
new thing, so some people who want the new thing and couldn't buy it before
will now start doing so.  What's so magical about that?

The graphs that I showed you above were not the supply curve and demand
curve for the entire market, but only for your firm.  If you were to add up
the demand of all the buyers buying from you and your competitors, as well
as the supply costs for you and all of your competitors, you'd get a
microeconomic supply and demand graph for the market.  (They look
remarkably similar, perhaps I didn't make that clear.)  In that case,
you're right, the increase in demand would have to be divided evenly among
the firms.

However, since I was showing you only YOUR supply and demand curve, that
means that your competitors would see an identical supply and demand curve
facing them; thus, when you get your trapezoid, they get theirs.  The total
revenue inside the sum of your trapezoid and all of your competitors is
equal to the trapezoid you would find if you did a supply-demand analysis
of the entire market.

>That is true. As long as my profits exceed my costs, I will keep on
>producing, regardless of competition.

OK, well, as I think I just demonstrated, you DO earn a profit from
invention, even when there's competition.  It's given by the area inside
the trapezoid, minus the sunk cost of invention.  These profits are smaller
than the profits you get from monopolization, but they are still there.

Thus, in the end, if the revenues inside the trapezoid are greater than the
costs of invention, then you'll invent.  If not, it's not worth it, so you
won't.

Now, as for the monopoly analysis...

>Why must I lower the price? Where is this rule posted?  I don't see
>Volkswagen, who has a 'monopoly' on their New Beetle, lowering the price
>sequentially on each car they sell..

No, they don't lower the PRICE sequentially, but rather the extra revenue
earned on each car decreases sequentially.  They choose a point on that
graph when they set ONE price and collect the area under it and above their
supply curve.

For example, suppose the demand curve is given by P = 10 - Q, where P is
price and Q is quantity.  Now suppose you are a monopolist facing this
demand curve, and that you currently sell 3, because your price is 7.  Now
suppose you want to increase your Q by one, to sell one more.  Well, people
won't buy four at price of 7, they'll only buy 3 at that price.  (Which is
just what the demand curve told us.)  In order to get people to buy four,
you'll have to lower the price.

Now, this isn't saying that VW starts with their price at some
extraordinarily high value at the beginning of every year and then
decreases the price with each car sold.  Obviously, if they were selling
cars where Q was the millions of cars sold and P was the price in thousands
of dollars, they will set one price ($7) and sell a certain quantity of
cars (3 millions).  However, if they want to sell 4 millions, VW must lower
the price.  [This is actually a bad example, because if you don't want a VW
you can always buy another car, whereas a monopolist would have cornered
the entire market for all cars.]

When there's lots of competitors, however, you can't set your price that
way.  The market sets your prices in perfect competition, because if you
raise your prices at that quantity then nobody would buy from you;
meanwhile if you lower your price at that quantity you'll take a loss.
Thus, your price is the same price as the entire market, and thus your
marginal revenue is given by the simple demand curve.

I'm already aware of this.  But because a monopolist represents the entire
market, the monopolist cannot increase the quantity sold without directly
lowering its prices.  Thus, the monopolists MR curve is lower than that for
a perfect competitor.

I'm not making this up...  You should be able to find this in any
microeconomics textbook.

What magic?  Most of this stuff is true by definition: we defined the
demand curve to be the price at which people would buy a certain quantity,
the supply curve to be your marginal costs.  I think I have shown why the
monopolist necessarily suffers from a lower marginal revenue curve, and it
is self-evident that you should only produce up until the point where the
revenue you would get for selling one more would be less than the costs you
would earn from it (ie MR-MC=marginal profit=0).  Thus, people will pay the
price given by the demand curve at that quantity, etc.

What do you mean by "satisfied?"  If for some reason you can't make enough
to "satisfy" demand, then you'll just sell fewer; the loss in sales is
deadweight loss for you and for your customers.

>The monopoly is only bad for consumers if it refuses to listen to the

Once we observe that a monopolist makes more profit producing at a lower
quantity and a higher price than at a competitive price and at lower
quantity, we are able to restate it in another way:  a monopoly would have
to start taking a loss on every extra unit sold in order to reach the
competitive quantity, because in order to sell that much, the monopolist
has to lower its price to a competitive price (otherwise people won't buy
the competitive quantity!), further cutting into its profits.

To be blunt, you'd have to be MAD to produce like that.  It simply makes no
sense, once you've got monopoly status, to cut into your profits that way.

I'm presuming that they can't do that in a cost effective way.  If they
could, then there would be no point in having your patent anyway; instead
of reverse engineering your product, they'd just develop an equivalent.

Yes, that was what I was trying to say.  If you can't keep afloat at a
competitive price, then that's the market's way of saying "we don't want it
that badly."

Again, I think that inventors should sell their ideas, once, and then
conclude the transaction.  Firms who try to negotiate a per-copy
arrangement will have greater marginal costs than firms who don't have this
arrangement, and thus won't be able to compete in a competitive market,
whereas a firm which pays a sunk cost can recover that cost from the
increase in demand.

You're not dead, you just make a smaller total profit than he does.  He
gets to reap the whole trapezoid, you get the trapezoid minus the costs of
invention.  However, (and this is my whole point,) that's still a positive
number.

Careful, Paul - Dan, of all people, isn't like that.  Some are, sure.  A

Dear Young SHO:

I must regrettably advise you that no one knows what the original bible
really said. The oldest manuscripts we have are the Dead Sea Scrolls. It
appears that they were probably deviations of the original documents as
well. None of the original writings of either the old or the new
testament survived the Roman conquest. As such, you will probably have
to find the truth within.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The rhetorical teleology with which John poses his taunt might be a clue to
the answer.  (Or might not.)  Evolution, as he knows perfectly well, isn't
the kind of process that can `bother' about anything.  Gravity doesn't
bother to make things fall down and so when things pile up at the foot of
the mountain it's not because of any advance scheme.  

I assume that `sentience' means `consciousness' in this context, although,
as has been noted before, it really just denotes any ability to register
sensations, which snails have despite their gross stupidity  and Zen
egoless-ness.  So it could be that reflexive self-awareness is an
incidental computational by-product of very complex brained bodies
responding in complex ways (understanding, assessing, planning etc) to a
complex environment - rather as the red colour of blood is an accidental
by-product of what it's made out of, and without any teleological merits.
(On the other hand, our perhaps hard-wired fearful reaction to the sight of
blood gushing is surely a selected or easily instilled tropism that depends
on the quantum physics of hemoglobin.)

John's answer to this suggestion, I guess, would be that natural genomic
variations might by now have allowed the emergence of a sub-class of
non-conscious humans (zombies) if sentience in this sense is just an
unimportant side-consequence.  Probably so.  Hence, it seems plausible that
to be something of which we can say `there is something it is like to be
that' - sorry for the contorted philosopherese - is *not* a meaningless
happenstance, but resulted from benefits that consciousness provided to the
animals with it (in varying degrees).  In a way what I just wrote is
compatible with John's comment about evolution bothering to make humans
conscious, but my skin itches horribly when I see informed comments cast in
this dangerously misleading shape.

Yes, you are right Damien.  I had some discussion with Dan privately and he is
very polite and diplomatic.  I went off a little half-cocked and apologized to
him accordingly.

Over the discourse of the last couple of weeks, some have 'gone off' on me
without reading a single thing I wrote - and in turn putting words in my mouth I
never said.  After a couple of weeks of constantly defending and RE-explaining
myself, it can get very frustrating hearing certain people trashing my posts for
no other reason than what appears to be I am not one of the "in" crowd with
appropriatly phrased "catch-words" spouting some particular "party-line".  I
apologize if I got a little overly defensive in this regard.  Like most everyone
here, I very much want to engage in healthy discourse and debate on issues that
interest all of us - increasing extropy.

I can automate this as well; I can set up a posting-only address,
get a list of people from whom non-member postings are to be accepted,
and have a robot (who is a list member that just deletes what he
receives from the list) post on their behalf (and with appropriate
headers munged).  David could probably do this as well with a bit
of Perl and persistence.

Well, my 1/2000 cents worth sez: 

Anyone running mainframe or old minicomputer software, even if ported
to PCs will probably have problems - especially those who are already
trying to fix said Y2K problems, cause the final bugs will not appear
for some time past 1 Jan 2000.... (the less than obvious situations
are rare). OTOH, a Pc running Windows 95 or the like is likely to have
few if any problems. Embedded systems are also likely to be Y2K free
except for those whose applications depend on calendrical dates. I
think date dependent embedded apps are rare, I've never seen one
anyway. (Your ostrich POV here....)

I doubt the list would crash, as Majordomo is a Uniz app as I recall,
and the Unix Y2K equivalent is about 25 years from now...

BTW, the PC, web access and email are NOT simple! They just seem to be
cuz a lot of work has gone into them to make them fairly easy to use!

I mentioned this some months ago, that one possible good aspect of Y2K is
that it might force businesses running ancient legacy software to finally
do a total upgrade, and properly so the documentation and source code won't
evaporate like the legacy stuff did. Some of these people are running
emulators of emulators, so there are performance advantages too. The real
losers are those whose legacy software doesn't crash...

As for profiteering, go down to the hardware store and buy generators,
Coleman lanterns and general disaster supplies. I expect my water to be OK,
gas maybe, and my electrical to be flaky for at least a week... So if you
live in the northeast, take a vacation in Arizona....

Well, I've about had it up to (here) with the truly stupid default
settings that the various email handlers, especially good ole
Microsoft gives to the truly clueless user. Perhaps a FAQ could
be created stating explicitly what to do to make sundry email
clients treat their email as

	JUST PLAIN OLD ASCII THANK YOU

I know I would forward said FAQ to about 30 users who always send
me email in strange colors, typefonts, and sometimes just plain
illegible. 

Grumble. too late the wee hours. Oh well....

EMAIL MARKETING WORKS!!

Bull's Eye Gold is the PREMIER email address collection tool.
This program allows you to develop TARGETED lists of email
addresses.  Doctors, florists, MLM, biz opp,...you can collect
anything...you are only limited by your imagination!  You can
even collect email addresses for specific states, cities, and
even countries!  All you need is your web browser and this program.
Our software utilizes the latest in search technology called
"spidering". By simply feeding the spider program a starting
website it will collect for hours. The spider will go from website
to targeted website providing you with thousands upon thousands of
fresh TARGETED email addresses. When you are done collecting,  the
spider removes duplicates and saves the email list in a ready to
send format. No longer is it necessary to send millions of ads to
get a handful of responses...SEND LESS...EARN MORE!!!

A terrific aspect of the Bull's Eye software is that there is
no difficult set up involved and no special technical mumbo-jumbo
to learn. All you need to know is how to search for your targeted
market in one of the many search engines and let the spider do the
rest! Not familiar with the search engines? No problem, we provide
you with a list of all the top search engines. Just surf to the
location of a search engine on your browser then search for the
market you wish to reach...it's that easy!

For instance if you were looking for email addresses of Doctors
in New York all you would do is:

1) Do a search using your favorite search engine by typing in
the words doctor(s) and New York
2) Copy the URL (one or more)...that's the stuff after the
http://...  for instance it might look like
http://www.yahoo.com/?doctor(s)/?New+York
3) Press the START button

THAT's IT!!!  The Bull's Eye spider will go to all the websites
that are linked, automatically extracting the email addresses
you want.

The spider is passive too! That means you can let it run all
day or all night while you are working on important things or
just having fun on your computer. There is no need to keep a
constant watch on it, just feed it your target market and give
it praise when it delivers thousands of email addresses at
the end of the day!

Features of the Bull's Eye Software:

* Does TARGETED searches of websites collecting the email
  addresses you want!
* Collects Email addresses by City, State, even specific
  Countries
* Runs Automatically...simply enter the Starting information,
  press The Start Button, and it does the rest

* Fast and Easy List Management
* Also has built in filtering options...you can put in words
  that it "Must" have while searching,...you can even put in
  criteria that it  "Must NOT Have"...giving you added flexibility
* Also imports email addresses from any kind of files (text
  files, binary files, database files)
* List editor handles Multiple files to work on many lists
  simultaneously
* Has a Black-Book feature... avoid sending emails to people
  who do not want to receive it
* Built-in Mail program...send email directly on the internet
  with just a click of your mouse
* Personalized Emails...if the email address has the user's
  name when it is collected,..you can send Personalized emails!!!
* Sort by Location, Server, User Name, Contact Name
* Advanced Operations:
· Email address lists export in many different formats
  (HTML, Comma delimited, text file)
· Advanced editing...Transfer, Copy,  Addition, Delete, Crop,
  Move to Top/Bottom
· Operations between lists...Union, Subtraction, Comparison
* Program is Passive,...meaning you can run other programs at
  the same time

I'm gonna be one of the few here, and vote "no" to moving the list
back to subscriber only posting. As a subscriber, I'd be unaffected by 
the vote, but I feel strongly that loistering ourselves away, like boys 
putting a "No Girls Allowed" sign on a clubhouse, is not the answer.

I feel, if anything, that we should make it easier for non subscribers 
to find us and get involved. Intelligent use of filters can block most 
spam, and this place recieves less spam then my maibox anyways. I think 
we have it pretty good with respect to the amount of spam we receive. 
Additionally, limiting the potential sources of new ideas from posting 
is, in my humble opinion, one of the least extropian things you can do. 
The guy or girl who enconters too many obstacles to posting may just 
have the idea that sparks the singularity.

In response to the proposition of putting a "No mundanes allowed" sign 
on the door, I vote "Nay".

Yes, if consciousness is unrelated to intelligence then the conclusion is 
unavoidable, human zombies exist, in fact with only one exception genetic 
drift could have turned all humans into zombies by now. There is no evidence 
that this has happened, there is no evidence that it has not.     


        >consciousness provided to the animals with it (in varying degrees).          
        

Sometimes I wonder, are animals less conscious that we are? Are smart people 
more conscious than stupid people? When I was 7 years old I was not as 
intelligent as I am now (I think) but I was just as conscious (I think). 
It's true that I don't remember being conscious when I was 7 months old and I 
was even dumber then, but that must just be due to a malfunction in my memory
because I don't remember anything, not just being conscious, when I was that 
age. Also, consciousness must be related to emotion as well as intelligence 
and most of the emotional parts of our brain are very old and quite similar 
to those found in animal brains.

Time for my pet theory, I suspect that consciousness is ancient, easy to  
produced and requires only a tiny amount of intelligence. High level 
intelligence on the other hand is much newer in the history of life because 
it's harder to make. If so then the real challenge is not to make a machine 
conscious but to make one intelligent. Remember it's just a theory.

        Subscribers-only sounds great...except it appears that some of the

*Some* sort of restriction is truly necessary, given the atrocious state of

Yup. Base 0 is just a set of tally marks. At last you
got it right....

Of course there are other notations which act like fractional
bases, say Base 1 1/2.... And notations where the positional
valueations are not even powers of the lesser positions. For
example, use the primes:

				(7)(5)(3)(2)

so the value 9 is expressed as  0101....

Have fun :)

Hmm, I think you make a mistake here. If you can travel four or five
ly, why not six or eight? And then we are getting some interesting
neighbors. It is indeed hard to travel interstellar distances, but if
can manage them there is no real difference between 4 and 10
light-years.

Hm...  To me, if it has to be "programmed" in the conventional sense, then
it's not AI.  Programming an AI should be a process of simply telling it what
you want, then the AI figures out how to do it.

To me, the main thing that distinguishes sentience is the source of the
robot's motivations.  A sentient robot, like any worker, ultimately works for
its own benefit.  A non-sentient robot works for its owner.

Eh?  I don't see anything certain about that.  I agree that the ratio will
vary among different types of goods and services, but I assume that the
advantage will practically always be in favor of the robots over old fashioned
flesh-and-blood humans.

That is a very questionable axiom.  I would contend that we want to promote
the greatest good for the greatest /fraction/ of people.  In other words, if
you have 20 million people and 90% are happy, that's a better situation than
six billion people of which 20% are happy.

If you take a moral (and therefore arbitrary) position that a large
population is better than a smaller one, with other things being equal, then
you are naturally going to want the creation of more people -- including
sentient robots.  But if you follow that to its logical conclusion, you are
eventually going to run into hard limits: energy supplies, waste heat, raw
matter supplies.  This is a serious concern, unless you can repeal the laws of
physics.

Another point is that there may be other moral imperatives to consider, which
are more important than happiness.  Happiness is usually rooted in mere
biology, and IMHO is a shallow goal for human beings.  But that is another
discussion entirely.  It is probably outside the realm of economics.

>5)  Therefore.  If resources do not run out, population growth will result
>in greater wealth per capita.

Ah!  But resources /do/ eventually run out.  Note also that the existence of
AI can skew this assumption.  Population growth may create an increase in
wealth per capita, but creation of AI workers can create a /greater/
increase, especially since your AI robotic workers don't count as "capita"!

If our goal is the greatest happiness for the greatest /fraction/ of the
population, the quickest way to achive that is by adding non-consumer robots
to the economy.  They don't expand the population, they don't consume or
increase overall demand, they only produce.

Yes.  And this also implies that the quality of life of those people is
reduced.  It is true that we have good economic mechanisms for dealing with
scarcity -- and no wonder!  That's what any economy is based upon.  Still,
that doesn't mean scarcity is good for the economy.  For analogy, just imagine
you have a hill-climbing motorcycle.  It's designed specially for climbing
hills, and it's *good* at it.  That doesn't mean it will perform better every
time you pit it against a steeper hill!

Say what?  I don't follow you.  You seem to think people who get their money
by other means than working are inclined to waste it recklessly.  Of course,
a few people actually do that, but then so do some people who work for their
money.  Go figure.

I don't take such a rosy view.  First of all, there is a limit to the
technology that can be developed.  All technology is based on the laws of
science and our understanding of them.  When we fully understand those laws
and have exploited them in every way that is practical, there will be no more
technology to develop.  Then we will have access to all the resources than can
be accessed.

Advancing technology is something that only happens during very strange
circumstances.  Right now we are in the middle of a technological revolution,
a brief period of great change and upheaval.  Before this revolution began,
about five thousand years ago, people lived a simple hunter-gatherer
existence.  They had lived that way for tens of thousands of years in a
*stable* condition.  After our technological revolution (which we call
"civilization") is finished, we will reach another condition of stability in
which there will be little change over many thousands of years. That stable
condition will exist at an equilibrium point defined by both our final level
of technology and our total available "land" resources.

I don't like to bet our future on miracle technologies that aren't based upon

In my experience, few of those "ultimate limits" were based on hard science
and hard numbers.  It may be misleading to draw lessons from those failed
predictions.

That depends on how you define resources.  Imagine some oil is trapped deep
in an underground shale deposit, so that it cannot be extracted economically.
If a new technology allows you to get it, does that give us a new resource,
or does it merely allow us to *deplete* a resource that we always had?

Most new technology falls into this category: it allows us *access* to more
and more resources.  But the hard limit still remains: there is only so much
oil locked in the earth.  Likewise, our solar system only contains a certain
amount of raw matter, and the sun only produces a relatively fixed energy
output.

It is a serious concern.

IMHO, that could be a cure worse than the disease.  It's make-work!  It
reminds me of a silly SF novel I read several years ago.  Some crackpot
tinkerer had invented cheap fusion power, and it created such abundance that
the economy was inverted: people had to *consume* for a living.  Every day the
drudgery of having to consume your quota of goods and services!  Finally some
genius (though he was actually drunk at the time) figured out a solution.  He
programmed his robots to consume!  At first he was accused of *wasting* goods
and services (why did they care?), but then he showed that he had programmed
the robots to *enjoy* consuming these things.  So, the problem was solved:
the robots could produce goods and services, and they could consume the
excess, so humans were able to simply take what they wanted.

It was absurd, of course.  The common-sense solution would have been to cut
back on production.  (The author weaseled out of that by hinting it was
impossible to cut back production, but without ever explaining why.)  What
you are proposing is a variation on the same story.  You're talking about
creating more workers to produce more goods, and also consume them, thus
creating a demand for more workers, so the cycle continues.  It seems so
pointless!

Of course, that is somewhat how our economy has been *forced* to operate
until now, since only living, breathing human beings are able to do much
work.  It's part of the human condition.  But that's exactly what I want to
FIX, not embrace as a model for the future.  We want to move beyond the
human condition, not enshrine it.

Yes.  Marx vindicated.  Of course, there must be some kind of economic
adjustment to deal with this problem.  I just don't think you've hit upon it.

>Having sentient robots would ease this transition a lot, because they would
>create jobs in the process, rather than just filling them.

Are they really easing the transition, or are they perpetuating the
problem?  This reminds me of the battle over free market reforms in Russia.
If you attempt economic shock therapy, the pain and dislocation can be
tremendous.  On the other hand, if you try to "ease the transition" you may
create an economic legacy that will drag down the whole system for decades to
come.

Those sentient robots don't exist yet.  I'm all in favor of increasing the
happiness of people who exist, but I don't see the point of creating more
people only for the purpose of making them happy.  An unhappy person is a
problem to be solved.  A happy person is a minor problem, since he presumably
could be made even happier than he is now.  A non-existent person is a
non-problem.

There you have it.  You feel increasing our population is a good thing.  I
don't.  Look, maybe I haven't stated this clearly enough:  I feel that
uncontrolled population growth is the ONLY serious problem facing our
civilization in the long run.  PEOPLE are replicators with an exponential
growth rate, and they will eventually over-run any fixed resources.  Creating
sentient robots is like throwing gasoline on a fire.  RE: Malthus

That depends on the accounting cost of recording and tabulating those
micro-payments.  Somebody once calculated that phone companies could make more
money by charging a flat monthly fee for long-distance service.  Their billing
costs would be reduced tremendously, and just think of all the business they
would get!  But of course, the phone companies didn't listen.

Excuse me?  "...if you're not working, then you have no income..."

There are certainly other ways to get income, rather than by working!  The
whole heart of my economic concept is that most people who are workers today
should become capitalists: sellers of capital instead of sellers of labor
services.

Well, there's no point in quibbling over whether work will be abolished
completely or merely reduced to a trivial role.  I don't honestly expect work
to disappear totally.  Nothing changes that fast, that completely.  Even if it
makes no economic sense, there is tradition and nostalgia to deal with.  But I
don't see how labor can continue to be the hub around which our economy
rotates.

Let me ask: Assuming we have AI robots, why must there be work in order to
feed me?  If we have robots, they can raise food, they can process it, bring
it to me, and even cook it for me.  I can pay for the food using income from
my investments. Where is the work?

NO WAGES.  You want lots of people living on NO WAGES, but getting their money
from other sources of income.

The difference is that you can tell your non-sentient AI to *stop* pretending
to want things, and it will do so.

Not if the artist is getting his income from some other source.

Thought experiment: Imagine you are H. Ross Perot.  Imagine that your many
investments earn you well over a million dollars PER DAY.  You decide to spend
your time composing music, because you like it.  There is no reason for you to
care whether your songs will sell or not.  They aren't going to put bread on
your table: it's simply not a concern.

>>There are certainly other ways they can do that, rather than by working.
>
>Such as?  Some economists DEFINE the creation of wealth as economic "work."

The only definition of work that I care about is "the sale of labor
services".  There are other economic resources you can sell, besides labor.
To wit: land, capital, and entrepreneurial ability.  I'm particularly
interested in people selling capital, since capital is what's displacing labor
in the marketplace.

>What will they invest without wealth?  Where will they get the wealth if
>they're not working?

They'll just have to get help from somebody.  That might mean public
assistance, or it might mean some other way.  Every society through history
has faced the problem of what to do with people who are unable (if only
temporarily) to contribute to the economy.  It's a problem that predates
civilization: even Neanderthals cared for their infirm.  I don't have any
magical answers to that ancient problem.  But every society seems to come up
with some way to muddle through it.

Today we have Social Security.  I personally don't like it.  It's
redistribution of wealth by brute force, blatant socialist social
engineering that offends my libertarian sensibilities.  Still, it seems to be
a popular program, and it has been going for decades.  If nothing else works,
the coming economic dislocations can be addressed with heavy-handed government
intervention: tax the wealthy and pay "seed money" to the poor.  That's
exactly what it will come down to, unless somebody works out a better plan.
Unpleasant as such a system might seem, I think it would be preferable to
creating make-work and a population explosion of sentient robots.

>You think managing finite resources is fun?

It's not the sale of labor services.  Besides, a lot of folks seem to think
managing resources is fun.  Witness all the computer games with such a theme:
Civilization, The Settlers, Sim City, etc.

What could possibly be more important than happiness (except of course
survival)? Wouldn't a life devoid of positive stimulation ("happiness") be
utterly pointless? 
 
As for the economic matter: automate to the max with as ultimate goal
free-for-all production of anything, while reducing the population (a billion people

is more than enough, and a tenth or a hundredth of that would be fine too). 
Quality over quantity. That's the *rational* course of action, anyway.

I think you're missing something, though.  The human race has a whole history
stretching back thousands of years: language, traditions, symbolism,
technology, art and literature, philosophy, myths and legends, great
achievements and adventures, etc.  This whole tremendous, interwoven body of
knowledge defines our cultural identity.  A "small change in basic
motivations" can't provide an alternative to all that.

Gee, I guess now I'll have to read the book!  I've had it sitting on my
bookshelf for ages.

Let's frame the question differently...  Imagine you've *discovered* a
sentient race living in primitive conditions.  Are you morally obligated to
give them advanced technology?  Or should you be required to leave them alone
so they can develop their own identity?  (RE: Prime Directive)

It's not an easy question.  I've long felt the Prime Directive, as presented
in Star Trek, is a bunch of hogwash.  On the other hand, it's easy to imagine
how a less advanced culture could be *obliterated* by wide open contact with a
highly advanced one.  All the achievements and richness that they could have
achieved on their own is forfeit.

As I told someone else, the most obvious difference is that you can tell your
non-sentient AI to *stop* pretending to have human-like feelings, and it will
do so.

The Australian Sun-Herald reports that tests for the year 2000 bug have
found many flaws.

One flaw would have released all chemicals stores into the Coffs
Harbour's water supply because of data confusion thinking that all the
chemical doses were due immediately.  The chemicals in the water would
have rendered the public municipalities tap water poisonous.

Another flaw caused their Reserve Bank's vaults to all open up and
unlock.

The main problem for me is not such interpretation, just because I suppose
they did not even know Everest... And the greater mountain for them was
possibly Sinai...They were, in general, an ignorant people, with almost no
great commerce or knowledge of the rest of the world... They were weak, lots
of times were taken as slaves... Just after, at the time of Solomon or
David, they got a little more importance... Their main difference  was the
religiousty with a monotheist image of the supposed god was of a Good
Father... This made them different from Greek ( = Roman ) Theology... And,
talking about good things and look: ressurrection... they "made the minds"
of other people... ( Note that Christians were nothing more than
revolutionary ( in the philosophical sense... ) Neo-Jews, for that time... )

sorry about the table.  i pasted it in from mocrosloth excel

i am thinking along the thread of an earlier post that said we extropians
should look to the short term as well as the long term.  so i am imagining
an interstellar craft that could be built in the next 100 yrs or so.  this
assumes
no opening up wormholes, no impluse engines, etc.  with our
paltry technology, there is  huge delta between 4 and 10 light yrs.  more 
later!  spike

this meme shows up in sci-fi a lot, that there is no real difference
between 4 and 10 ly, but there are a lot of good reasons why we
might not try to achieve the really huge numbers like a quarter
of the speed of light any time soon.  so any interstellar flight will
take a loooong long time, requiring multigeneration ships, suspended
animation etc.  but closer is better, if you do go with multigeneration,
and long lives are better than short. 

seems to me the extropians might be the first
to solve some baffling problems with interstellar travel.  we can achieve
.001 c with current technology.  if people are made to live 500 yrs, then
only a few generations are needed. 

ok heres the table in a tab delimited text file.  the units are all
distance,
in light yrs.

Discussion of this on comp.software.year-2000 has suggested that this
is not quite right.  Someone called up a local official and was told
that this was a speculation about kinds of failures which might occur,
not the actual result of a Y2K simulation.  However apparently there
has been no actual retraction by the newspaper.  The topic is still
under active discussion there so more information may be forthcoming.

I think the problem with this line of reasoning is that it assumes such ExI
ordination mysteriously bequeaths on the member a high signal/noise output
capacity.  Although Extropy magazine has been a stable of good reading for me
over the past 8 years, the last issue (#17) came out more than a year ago.  Lets
face it, this list *is* where the action is.  Besides, as extropians and the
'Extropy Online' attest, we embrace the online world and all the that implies.

I thought this thread was started to address the issue of spam not S/N in
particular.  If we restrict postings to those who are subscribe to the list,
this would be adequate in stopping the spam.  Otherwise if the Institute is
looking for some extra money, then perhaps we could go back to the way it was 3
years ago, when we paid $14.95 per year to subscribe to the list.  I suspect
there are many others who would rather pay a reasonable fee to participate in
this online community than pitch in the extra cash it requires to become members
of ExI.

Anyone else out there feel this way?

Wouldn't the functionalist perspective suggest that consciousness is not
an "incidental" by-product, but rather an "inevitable" one?  In other
words, you automatically get consciousness when you have the kind of
complex system Damien is describing.  Any system which has a sufficiently
rich representation of itself and the world is conscious - that is what
consciousness is.

One problem with this suggestion is that it implies that a relatively
simple computer program, say CYC with its thousands of interrelated
facts about the world, would be conscious to some degree.  Such a
program is far from being able to pass the Turing test, and we might
not be comfortable setting the bar for consciousness so much lower than
that for human equivalent intelligence.  But on the other hand, it
appears in nature that conscious awareness is in fact much easier to
produce than human intelligence, so perhaps this is not so objectionable
after all.

Thanks for setting me straight.  Lots of false stuff gets published as

I've often wondered if a greater ability to understand complexity
would lead to a different conscious state.  Think about it,
less-intelligent people perceive the world as complex and chaotic,
more intelligent people see the world as slightly less complex and
ordered. Does this have some application in Quantum Mechanics?  If you
are observing events at the smallest possible detail things are in
complete chaos, as that scale becomes increasingly larger things
become more ordered and predictable.  Perhaps consciousness and
intelligence are one and the same, the ability to observe something at
a 'larger' scale makes things more ordered and predictable.  If
however you are less fortunate and your consciousness is below average
the world is a mix of random probability and total chaos.  Of course,
this means the "scale" at which we see things is directly related to
our ability to handle complexity. Remember it's just a theory :-)

That long URL points to a short article in ComputerWorld Australia which
describes the poisoned water supply story as a myth.  There is not much
detail in the article itself, though.

A poster on c.s.y-2000 claimed that the Sun-Herald, which printed the
original claim, was a lightweight, semi-tabloid newspaper better known
for its entertainment value than its news coverage.

Even though this story is apparently not true, potential failures in
embedded computer systems are a serious problem which the industry is
only beginning to grapple with.  The possible consequences of failures
of the infrastructure are at least as bad as failures of the financial
system or the government.

Unfortunately, liability concerns are forcing many companies into making
only ambiguous Y2K statements, with no guarantees of success.  The concern
is that even if they think they are compliant, giving guarantees will
open them up to liability in the event that something goes wrong, even
something out of their control (like phones or electricity failing).
This makes it difficult for outsiders to determine what is the true
state of affairs.

Defining consciousness presents a special problem, no doubt about it. Why not ask you computer to

Test yourself. See if you can sustain consciousness while doing nothing whatever of an intelligent
nature.

Sentience requires no "point" or other teleological approach. Sentience has no purpose or intention.
Cosmic consciousness, according to some who claim to have experienced it, resides at the peak of
human experience. I don't think any kind of test can reveal the presence of sentience. But the
desire to test for it may indicate a lack of total awareness. Maybe it takes one to know one.

>Intelligence has survival value,

In some worlds, perhaps so. But it depends on your definition of intelligence. Viruses seem quite
robust, yet they don't demonstrate any equivalent intelligence to that of say, the average
extropian.

Who said they were unrelated? I wrote that it is possible to differentiate between the two.
Intelligence operates convergently, whereas consciousness seems to expand with divergent movement.

>random mutation and natural selection bother to make anything sentient?

It may turn out that life indeed finds sentience to be an unprofitable experiment.

There you go again. You say no test exists to determine consciousness, yet you claim that it
nevertheless exists.

Life itself may be utterly pointless. The universe may indeed have no purpose. I like to think that
extropians might have what it takes to transcend teleology and determinism.

Frankly I didn't notice the one that has got everyone so upset.  If you are

I wasn't suggesting that there is such a thing as a "universal purpose", or that
there is any design or intention involved.

The point is: if you don't plan to make life enjoyable (whatever that may mean to
you) for yourself in the future, then what *do* you want?

For example, there is a classification of atheists that is:

Positive Atheists x Negative Atheists.

The former are all those who do not believe in god by logical positive
reasons and are sure of that, f.ex. because of scientically based reasons.
In second class are all the rest, who deny god's existence simply by
negative reasons. There are included those who don't believe in god because
they think there is so much bad in the world, or their mothers, in general
religious, hit them a lot when they were children or because they lost the
love of their lives and so do not believe anymore... These are not even
considered serious atheists and at the first laugh of a girl/boy in a
religious cult ( or even someone pass the hands on their asses... :)  ),
turn to be great believers...: "God made marvelous things to me... Alelujah
!!! " ... they have just psychological ( even if little ) problems or social
non-adjustments... got it ???

Another use for it could be Brain State Copy: to read the noise generated by
the brain's natural field through the external field, and filter it with
precision enough to duplicate the brain state mapping of an individual, by
stimulatig the centres of an artificial brain, and try the uploading

Is anyone else interested in the idea of time travel via a macroscopic 
wormhole? In theory the idea doesnt necessarily contradict any physics 
laws, and presently only one known thing could damper the idea based on 
chronological laws, but even that isnt proven to be a formidable 
problem. Anyone else think anything of it or just a waste or research 
time?

Yes !!! But my only "fear" is about facts like:

1) In the beginind of XX century, some priests and protestant leaders made
people believe that world would finish...and believers...: really
believed... Will they repeat it in XXI ?? Or are they already doing it ?...

2) Recently, even this pope, Carol Wojtila, apparently menthally
equilibrated, said that a certain bishop of a protestant religion was the
beast itself ... Bishop Macedo of the Universal Church of The Kingdom of God
was turning the minds of lots of catholics to his church... That was an
irresponsible affirmation since the beast would just come when supposed (
and taugh...) end would be near...

Somehow the more I use my brain (learn, think) the more complex the world

It's certainly intriguing that our best models of the universe seem to
allow for something as paradoxical as time travel.  The question is,
is there something wrong with the models, or something wrong with the
universe? :-)

Oops, my prejudice is showing.  I can hardly believe that time travel
will be possible because of the paradoxes and contradictions it would
bring.

David Deutsch has suggested that the paradoxes could be resolved if you
combine time travel with parallel universes, so that when you go back into
the past you are moving into a parallel universe.  That way you never close
the circle and can't change your past, avoiding contradictions.  But I
haven't seen a rigorous explanation of this idea.

Now you have given the world over to the industry consortiums who end up as
virtual monopolies. An individual has no hope of being able to bring a
revolutionary idea to life unless he sells his soul to the company store...

I am not willing to wait for 'evolution' to generate the products I will
need to survive in the next millennium. I want people to be able to make
leaps and bounds in creation, and benefit from their own efforts. I thought
we were supposed to improve on nature, not slavishly follow it..

The Mob has offered this for some time. You tell them who is making you
suffer, pay them a lot of money, and they make the source of suffering end
up in concrete galoshes..

As far as doctor-assisted suicide, etc. I feel that the doctor has probably
gotten a ton of money from the sufferer by this point, so the final coup de
grace should be free or nominal cost.

Now you are starting to get to a level I can empathize with. Incremental
improvements are important, and mostly ignored by our present systems. What
needs to be protected against, perhaps not by law, is the 'unfair' use of
creations that actively harm the orignal creator. This would be analogous to
present slander or libel laws.

There has not been a full blown 'invention' by that definition since the Big
Bang. Obviously, nothing in this world stands alone. Any idea you or I can
formulate is colored by our life experiences and readings.

This does not answer the basic question. Should I be able to profit from my
own labors? If I write a novel, I should be able to market it without having
to worry about someone else taking my work, adding an introduction, and
selling it at much less than my publisher's costs, thereby destroying my
market. If I create a logo for my enterprise, should someone else be
permitted to use it to sell their products? This is socialism you are
talking about - the creators only live to hand out their lifeblood to the
proles.

I agree that sometimes too much 'its MINE!' is a bad thing. Apple tried this
with a closed architecture, and suffered loss of sales to the IBM clones
which had a much richer array of second source vendors. Even though the IBM
PC was not a closed system, they still retained the rights to their logo,
case designs, etc. People who made aftermarket add-in boards still kept the
ownership of their individual designs. At no time was anyone prohibited from
designing a new and better peripheral by the existence of their predecessors. 
Other bus architectures have been designed. Those which were closely guarded
were less successful than those which were allowed to become public domain.
The boards that plug into these buses, however, need the protection of
patents and copyrights for reasons I have stated elsewhere, so the creators
have a chance to recover their costs of creation. It's a matter of degree. A
'bus' is a fairly trivial thing. An image processor is not. The creators of
the open buses allowed them into the public domain to stimulate the demaind
for their proprietary boards, and the competition is healthy.

Anyone who hangs too tightly to their creations will not benefit from them;
neither will the world. But saying that ideas and their physical embodiments
are not the property of the thinker and inventor certainly does nothing to help.

I have no objection to others using my ideas to act as a springboard for
them to reach even greater heights. I only object to others using my
creations to deny me a chance to make a living by undercutting me with
duplicates of what I made.

After all, if they can concieve of a better way to do what I am doing,
surely I can use their take on the matter to leapfrog them..

Copying, however, is cheating. By your arguments, if I copy your doctoral
thesis, I should be able to claim the degree just as if I had done all the
research. After all, it's not 'theft'..

For me, profit = income - costs. Before I can get an income, I have to be
able to present a product for sale. The costs of doing that must be covered
by my income from sales before I see any profit. If I can't sell enough
product to cover costs, I am bankrupt.

Okay. I admit it. I got lousy marks in econ. I am ignorant of some of the

Therein lies the rub - who can tell if the costs will be less than the

The market will accept so many at a certain price, and if you want to sell
more, you lower the price. Agreed.

Fully satified, in my mind, is there is no one left who wants the product at

In the absence of any controls, how do you prevent a monopoly, given

coercion and use of force..

Agreed. That I need to be 'competitive. I still don't agree that I should
have to allow others to take my devlopment as is without compensating me.

Look at it this way. I make ten widgets and put them on the market. I get
people offering to buy them. Someone comes along and steals five, exerting
some effort to convey them to his plant. I should allow him to keep and sell
them, because he took the effort to transport the product? The same thing
holds if I produce an idea, convert it to workable plans, and someone takes
the plans and builds my gadget. I have been the victim of a theft either
way. Ideas are the property of the thinker, until that person gives the
rights away.

All we need is someone who will put up the money to the inventor for the
rights to the product, knowing that as soon as he produces the thing, twenty
knockoff plants will be making the identical thing, and at less cost, since
this poor fellow had to pay the inventor. The theft is now one person
removed from the inventor, and he does not suffer directly. Since there is
no property rights in an idea, the first plant owner can't recover from the
copyists..

The process of reducing the population is one that brings nightmare

I think you're confusing revenues with profit.

Revenues is every dime of income from sales or rental of goods, 
services, or capital.

Profit is what is left of revenues after you pay all costs.

So you cannot cover a cost by making a profit.

You have to cover *all* costs before you make *any* profit.

There are various *categories* of profits, categorized by specifying 
what costs are already paid and what aren't.

For example, suppose that you pay all your sunk costs with borrowed 
money.  You could have an "operating profit" which is your day-to-day 
income minus your day-to-day operating expenses.  But when you are 
looking at "operating profit", you still have not made any payment on 
all that money you borrowed, and you still have not paid your 
business income taxes.

If your "operating profit" is not sufficient to make the payments on 
the loan, your business is in serious trouble.

You also haven't paid depreciation.  If you have a million-dollar 
piece of equipment which is going to be worn out after ten years, you 
had best be setting aside enough for depreciation that, when the ten 
years are up, you can go buy another one: very roughly $100,000 per 
year.  If you fail to set aside a depreciation allowance long enough, 
a critical piece of equipment will wear out and you won't have the 
money to replace it.  your business will die.  This is important 
enough that even the US Internal Revenue Service allows companies to 
set aside money in a depreciation fund and consider it a business 
expense.

I defy you to name ONE such way that is not already in use.

But some people who write books, DON'T want to become TV stars.

And, by eliminating intellectual property, you eliminate many of 
these ways.  Because many of them are based on identity as the 
author, but the author has no more legal claim to that identity than 
anyone else.  There would be nothing in law to stop you from taking a 
pseudonym that happens to be the name on the cover of a book written 
by someone else, and going around giving speeches as if you had 
written it.

In a world without copyright, authors will seek what they seek today: 
the publisher that will likely generate the most revenue while being 
reasonable (according to the author's standards) on other issues.

The startup cost to a second publisher, absent copyright, is:

(1) buy a copy that was published by the first publisher;

(2) feed the pages into a copy machine, of appropriate 
sort and sophistication for the size of the production run.

(3) bind the results.

(4) deliver and sell the copies to a local bookstore for less than 
the original publisher's wholesale price.

Notice what you *don't* see here:

* advertising the book

* paying the author

* reading the slushpile to decide what's worth publishing

Those items -- that the first publisher pays but the second publisher 
doesn't -- typically cost more than printing and binding the first 
print run, which is paid by both the first publisher and the second 
publisher.

Why?  You are assuming that the original publisher is paying the 
author to do all these wonderful things; so you must assume that 
they are being done even if the second publisher *doesn't* pay the 
author to do them.

Please explain how this applies to a typical romance novel.

There are few people with access to a wider variety of text media 
than I.

For casual reading, I prefer books because of portability, 
flexibility, weight, and print quality.

For technical reading and reference, I prefer books because of 
portability, flexibility, print quality, and the ability to have a 
large number of large items visible simultaneously.

Some of us don't think a man's labor is worthless simply because the

I defy you to name ONE such way that is not already in use.

But some people who write books, DON'T want to become TV stars.

And, by eliminating intellectual property, you eliminate many of 
these ways.  Because many of them are based on identity as the 
author, but the author has no more legal claim to that identity than 
anyone else.  There would be nothing in law to stop you from taking a 
pseudonym that happens to be the name on the cover of a book written 
by someone else, and going around giving speeches as if you had 
written it.

In a world without copyright, authors will seek what they seek today: 
the publisher that will likely generate the most revenue while being 
reasonable (according to the author's standards) on other issues.

The startup cost to a second publisher, absent copyright, is:

(1) buy a copy that was published by the first publisher;

(2) feed the pages into a copy machine, of appropriate 
sort and sophistication for the size of the production run.

(3) bind the results.

(4) deliver and sell the copies to a local bookstore for less than 
the original publisher's wholesale price.

Notice what you *don't* see here:

* advertising the book

* paying the author

* reading the slushpile to decide what's worth publishing

Those items -- that the first publisher pays but the second publisher 
doesn't -- typically cost more than printing and binding the first 
print run, which is paid by both the first publisher and the second 
publisher.

Why?  You are assuming that the original publisher is paying the 
author to do all these wonderful things; so you must assume that 
they are being done even if the second publisher *doesn't* pay the 
author to do them.

There are few people with access to a wider variety of text media 
than I.

For casual reading, I prefer books because of portability, 
flexibility, weight, and print quality.

For technical reading and reference, I prefer books because of 
portability, flexibility, print quality, and the ability to have a 
large number of large items visible simultaneously.

Some of us don't think a man's labor is worthless simply because the 
essence of his production is non-material.

I don't know the details of CYC's code, but I had the impression that it's
basically just a big filing cabinet with links.  Bodies with brains *have a

 The brain is *minding* the body.  I think some of Edelman's (and Brooks')

Real, offer better hope of emergent consciousness - but then again I
haven't heard any shouts of glee from their labs lately.

And don't forget that some of us disagree.

In my opinion, the only reason that a mere three and a half billion 
people appears sufficient for the human population of earth, is 
because most of those people don't reap the benefits of living amid 
large numbers of free people.

Once we correct that problem, we'll probably want at least ten 
billion.

And some of us don't particularly want to stay on earth.

Who did Martin Luther King Jr sell out to?

Why was Robert Heinlein able to dictate to a publisher that they 
would sign a certain contract, and then immediately renegotiate it?

This is why a patent system is necessary: so that people CAN make 
leaps and bounds in creation.

Without a patent system, there is very little benefit to the inventor 
in even the most obvious evolutionary improvement, let alone in 
anything that takes any work.  And such little benefit as there is, 
derives from PERSONAL use, not from making that improvement public 
knowledge -- so you will probably never learn of it.

You cannot expect to leap beyond state of the art, if you don't even 
know what the state of the art is.

The patent/copyright system is the reason that the state of the art 
is publicized.

My own prejudice is about to show: 

I've spent a lot of time reading in parapsychology, good, bad and
indifferent, and have done some experimental work of my own in
precognition.  My current best guess is that some claims of psi are valid,
and that the record clearly shows that veridical non-inferential
foreknowledge is possible (although in a vagrant, transient and
irritatingly stochastic fashion).  

Most of the rational posters on this list will be horrified by this
declaration, and I don't blame them.  Luckily, there are convenient sources
of information about this apparently absurd and New Ageish claim.  Right
now I'm reading a quite good generalist 1997 book on the topic by Dean
Radin, PhD, with the unfortunate catch-penny title THE CONSCIOUS UNIVERSE
(Harper Edge).  Even more unfortunately, the art dept has a floating - but
unbent - sugar spoon on the cover, despite Radin's explicit decision *not*
to discuss Geller's exploded claims in his book.  The great merit of his
treatment is a lucid account of various recent meta-analyses of many
hundreds of parapsychological experiments, which together provide effect
sizes on the order of that demonstrated by aspirin against cardiac disease.
The book's best feature, for me, is a series of charts showing the
concerted data points, their error bars, and the overall non-chance
meta-results and associated very tight error bars.

If this line of thought is correct, we already have ample evidence that
something like informational time travel exists.  I suspect it might have
its best explanation in a Deutsch many-universes manifold, in which the psi
percipient obtains data from a sheaf of contiguous `parallel worlds' -
which somehow provides a better-than-chance estimate of how things might
turn out in *this* world, without actually being a one-universe time-loop.
If you see what I mean.

I find this especially interesting as an onlooker at the feast of physics,
because I treat psi as a crucial data point permitting us to sort out
available theories according to where they allow or disallow certain
non-local factors quite contrary to the way favored by most physicists (who

Actually, we are 99%+ certain we can do substantially better than 
that.

So much better that the proper measurement is not the fraction of C, 
but rather, the fraction of G.

.01 G is probably achievable without propellant or power, at least in 
an area from Venus orbit to Saturn orbit.  By diving toward the sun 
first and then using gravity whips, speeds in excess of .01 C are 
probably achievable and we might manage .1 C.

Up to that speed, relativity effects are ignorable for the sort of 
back-of-the-envelope calculations worth doing now.

Maybe you should consider eating all raw food.

I've been eating only raw food (except for
supplements) for over 12 years -- including
raw chicken and raw pork -- with no problems
of food poisoning.  (Joke: I love salmonella,
toxoplasmosis, trichinosis, etc!)

Definitely! 

However, I have to question whether low intelligence indicates a 'chaotic'
view. I would expect the lower intelligence would entail a simpler view of
the world. A child begins with a simple view of things around him, and adds
complexity as he grows and learns. A less intelligent person does not learn
as quickly, and would be less sophisticated in his views.

I imagine you are referring to radiation due to blue shift and collisions
with energetic particles, not just energy for the drive..

Multigeneration ships always bring to mind a story I read years ago - the
occupants of such a ship forgot they are on a ship, and evolve a society and
religions to explain the ship's existence. (No, NOT the Star Trek episode..)

I for one find the idea of being trapped on a cruise liner for 500 years
horrifying. The ship would have to be a small planet to provide enough
diversions for that long. I suppose that one could retreat into virtual
reality for some different experiences..

Would advances in cryonics give us the 'long sleep' seen in '2001' and other
science fiction, so that we wake at the destination or in case of some
interesting occurance during the trip?

I think the determination is where the organism has an internalized sense of
being - it 'knows' it is an individual, separate from the world outside.
This is easily felt when one works with animals - but it is terribly hard to
define a test to prove this. I 'know' I am conscious - but how can I prove I
am not a cunningly written 'Eliza' program?

There is the key - awareness. A computer program filled with facts may not
actually be aware of the length of the Nile, but it can tell you that fact
on query.

The Middle East for sure, possibly near the Tigris and Euphrates rivers  -
that's where Eden was supposed to be, anyway. A tidal wave in the
Mediterranean is what I have imagined, possibly caused by a large meteor
strike between Italy and Africa. This might explain why so many peoples in
the general area have similar flood stories..

I have heard of similar meta-analyses in the past, where they combine
results from a large number of studies.  A percentage effect which is
not statistically significant at a small scale becomes significant with
a sufficiently large amount of data.

I would feel better if a single study, done with iron-clad protocols,
replicable, could be done at a large enough scale to demonstrate the
phenomenon at a strongly significant level.  This technique of aggregation
of multiple small studies, each with different methodology, will never
be as convincing.

One problem with psi phenomena is that their behavior seems so much
more like fraud and error than like a physical effect.  The magnitude of
the phenomenon tends to be independent of the common-sense difficulty.
Seeing around the world isn't any harder than seeing into the room
next door.  Foretelling events a few seconds away is no easier than
foretelling things which will happen hours or days later.

>> An individual has no hope of being able to bring a revolutionary

You weren't listening--yes, there will be less profit from
revolutionary ideas from anyone.  I don't give a damn about
revolutionary ideas.  Progress comes from small, evolutionary
improvements and combinations of existing ideas, and it is
those that will flourish in a world where there are no
copyrights and patents to artificially overvalue novelty
for its own sake.

The myth of the small lone inventor coming up with a unique
and marvellous idea out of nothing in his garage is fairy tale.
A pretty story made up to justify granting state-sanctioned
privilege to those who can afford to speculate irresponsibly
with technology in hope that big brother will secure their
market for them if they get lucky.

A /true/ creative mind honestly acknowledges that nothing is
created in a vacuum; every "creation" is a synthesis of old
ideas from a thousand sources, and maybe one or two randomly
strewn new ones.  I certainly don't think they have no value,
but nor do I think creativity is anything special.  Anyone
who thinks a creative mind is somehow more worthy of help from
government than a talented athlete, and skilled craftsman,
or even a high-priced hooker is just a snob.  Everyone from
laborers to inventors contributes to the economy, and none
deserve anything they can't get without a forcible monopoly.

Well it already happened to the Russians with the meltdown of the USSR.
My advice is:

	1. Make sure your friendships are in working order.
	2. Buy plenty of warm clothes.
	3. Grow chickens.

The economy will continue - but it will be very local.

That's two different and unrelated questions.  Sure, you have a right
to profit from your work just as Mark McGuire has a right to profit
from hitting home runs.  But does that mean he should be able to
profit from runs he hit 5 years ago, or prevent other batters from
studying his swing?  If you made such a bad deal with your publisher
that someone copying your work can cut into your profits, whose
fault is that?  I say it's yours; the costs of exclusion are borne
by every other business, why should /I/ bear the costs of exclusion
for /yours/?

That's a trademark, not a copyright or patent; an entirely unrelated
issue.  Using someone else's identity is willful fraud, and I have
no problem with enforcing a tort in that case.

Exactly.  It's not my place to help anyone.  Businesses should
bear their own costs, not come to me for help.

Then don't use business practices that encourage that.  The present
system is based on the assumption of copyright; without it, different
business models would evolve.  This is a good thing.

Well, you could publish my thesis, but I presume that a college who
granted degrees to people for using a Xerox machine would not have
a very good reputation.

>We need better definitions here..


Yep.  Here's some.

Here's one definition from the past for Intelligence

     *The capacity to make adaptations for the 
      purpose of attaining a desired end; and the 
      power of autocritism.* (Terman, 1916)

    *The aggregrate or global capacity of the 
    individual to act purposefully, to think rationally, 
    and to deal effectively with his environment.* 
    (Wechsler, 1958)
 
More recently...

    *. . . a human intellectual competence must entail 
    a set of skills of problem solving - enabling the 
    individual to resolve genuine problems or difficulties 
    that she or he encounters, and, when appropriate, 
    to create an effective product - and must also entail 
    the potential for finding or creating problems - thereby 
    laying the groundwork for the acquisition of new 
    knowledge.* (Gardner, 1983)

    * . . . mental activity in purposive adaptation to, shaping 
    of, and selection of real-world environment's relevant to 
    one's life.*  (Sternberg, 1986)

Most theorists now agree that intelligence is 
hierarchical in that there is a general factor 
that plays a role in a large variety of cognitive 
tasks while more narrow group factors form a 
core of group factors.  These conceptualizations 
happened prior to the recent interest in 
Emotional Intelligence.  AI's will need

The way my crappy dictionary defined sentience 
made it sound like anything that could interpret 
the environment through sensory inputs and was 
aware which makes consciousness and sentience 
sound pretty similar.  I had always thought the 
phrase *Sentient Species* was used to describe 
*Intelligent/Civilized* organisms.

Consciousness and Intelligence are clearly 
distinguishable.  Consciousness strikes me 
as a necessary but insufficient precondition 
for intelligence.  I'm starting to lean toward 
believing that the odd sense of self that we 
possess was the incidental by-product of our 
larger and more complex brains and this 
glorious accident proved to be highly extropic, 
compelling us to create 
language, tools, agriculture, industry, technology, 
etc.  

I think it was Alan Watts who first introduced me 
to the idea that our brains trick us into thinking that 
we have souls. Our enhanced abilities to recall 
the past and forsee the future lead us to spend 
mental time outside of the here and now.  We 
perceive ourselves as having this continuity when 
all that there really is is the present moment. I 
have since heard more neurologically sound 
arguments that lead to similar conclusions, i.e. 
that the sense of identity we experience is a 
complete illusion...the mind is what the brain does.

The incidental by-product argument makes me 
wonder what might happen when a Super AI comes 
into being.  What sort of spontaneous artifact might 
arise as a function of this new level of complexity? 
Is Super AI going to be able to communicate with me
better than I can communicate with my dog?

As to how AI's might treat us if we are left in their 
dust, I would imagine that it would be somewhat 
similar to how we treat animals.  We can be very 
kind to animals we want to be kind to, we ignore 
others, and we can be very unkind to those we 
find bothersome.

I hope we can all just get along.

I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean: most programmers
don't want to do QA or tech support, but most of us have paid
our dues there because there's money in it.  Making a living
is about doing what /other/ people want.  I couldn't give a
damn how an author wants to make money; if ey wants mine, ey'd
better do what /I/ want em to do.  I don't support abolition
of copyright because it will make authors happy--though it
will, in the long run, make them richer along with everyone
else--I support it because it is morally right.

Things authors generally don't do now: charge real money for
autographs and appearances (usually they just tour to support
book sales), host online forums for buyers of their books,
sell advertising space in their books, rework stories from
other books or other media in their own style, offer buyers
of authorized editions special access to future works or
other works of the same publisher.  I'm sure there are more.
A few are probably done to some small degree already, but
generally they are not done because pubishers can more
easily exploit the current system.

Ah, but there is--I've said nothing about abolishing laws against
willful fraud, and that is a willful fraud prosecutable by any
civil court.  Trademarks are not intellectual property in the
same way that copyrights and patents are, because they only exist
by use, and are only enforcible against those who act deliberately
to deceive the public about their identity.  This, I wholeheartedly
agree, is a crime.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with copyright
or patent law.  (Our current government lumps them together into
the US Patent and Trademark Office--that no more implies that
they are the same thing than does the fact that they lump together
alcohol, tobacco, and firearms).

In today's system, yes.  Obviously, without copyright, it would be
stupid for publishers to keep doing things that way.  They would
look for more ways to exploit the non-copyable things: the authors'
time and talents, good name, market share, consumer attention, etc.

It doesn't.  In a world without copyright, the typical romance
novel would probably be published by the same folks who today
print uncopyrighted works like Shakespeare collections and Bibles.
Without copyright, Barbara Cartland would have to find a new job.
I can't say that distresses me much.  Maybe she could do live
readings, or equivalently, just run $4/minute 900 number more
suited to her talents.

Nor do I.  But nor do I think one man's labor is worth more than
another's just /because/ it is intellectual rather than physical.
I have not one whit more respect for a good writer than for a
good carpenter, yet the former has a monopoly frocibly maintained
for him by the government and the latter does not.

If you can't see the difference, you're not even trying.  If you
take my life, I lose it.  If you take my money, I lose it.  If you
take my ideas, I still have them.  That is a difference in objective
reality, and any law that treats objectively different things as if
they were the same is a bad law.

> Why, then, do nations with meaningful copyright laws have MORE

For one, I see no evidence of that correlation; two, even if there
is a 100% correlation, that does not tell you which is cause and
which the effect.  I suspect nations with lots of good artists
have a larger political lobby to fight for favors.  All special
interest groups lobby for handouts; that's the nature of politics.
I don't want to subsidize Gallo wines or Archer Daniels Midland,
nor do I want to subsidize Dave Barry.  The fact that some people
see the latter as normal is of no consequence to me.

I've read over your essay a couple of times now. Compelling.

Are you suggesting that the singularity will essentially consist of only
one intelligence (i.e. one entity, one ego) with, if we are lucky, an
arbitrary number of uploaded humans as cells in its brain? A borganism?

  IAN: I was wondering if anyone would notice this,
  since not, I'll note it: notice that there is one
  answer that satisfies both opposite claims:

  (1) There is no absolute truth.
  (2) There is an absolute truth.

  Answer: The absolute truth is zero. Then there 
  is both an absolute truth and no absolute truth.

Both are right. Moore came up with the word to describe his perfect

At present wormhole research is a fun area for people in general
relativity, but it is largely theoretical ("Wow! This wormhole is
traverable, rotates and just breaks the null energy condition on a
hypersphere in the throat!"). As far as I know there are no
chronological laws, just a few conjectures as the Chronology
Protection Conjecture and the common assumption of causality. 

Recently I have begun to move away from classical causality towards
Novikov's consistency principle instead: the universe is consistent
(i.e. no paradoxes) but there is no a priori ban on time travel. This
means you can get "causal loops", but no physical laws are broken at
any point and you won't get any paradoxes.

As for time travel through wormholes, I think they are much more
useful for communication and transport - if they can be made usefully.

But how to filter it? I think you will find that the signal to noise
ratio is rather bad, and that there is not a one-to-one mapping from
brain signals to brain activity.

Thanks for the clarification. This is important to understand for a
businessman, which I try to be. I am still learning, obviously.

This supports my original point. I must generate revenue from sales of my
product before I can recover my costs, and therefore make a profit. This is
going to be very difficult if I do not have the exclusive right to my
creations..

I wonder how intelligence and experience influences the worldview; on
one hand, there are plenty of people who live in a simple
black-and-white world, on the other hand others who think the world is
fundamentally chaotic and incomprehensible. Maybe this isn't a
question about intelligence and education, but whether they find that
seeing the world as complex or understandable are useful. 

For example, a person living in a narrowminded religious community
would early find that views that are not black and white often get
negative responses from other people, and hence learn a dualistic
mindset. A person who repeatedly fails in school would learn that the
world is incomprehensible and/or that they are stupid (and hence
allowed not to think). In the opposite direction, an intelligent
person in a suitable environment would learn that it is possible to
understand the world usefully, and that by learning more about the
world it becomes more complex (i.e. not just larger and diverse, but
also that it has new levels of organisation).

I thought we were talking about an idealized, theoretical system here.
Virtual in the sense of 'monopolies in all senses'.. Such consortia exist
today - look at OPEC and the drug cartels.

His dream! And he won, even if posthumously. At least he lived in a world
where he was the owner of his own ideas, and free to use them without fear
of theft. He GAVE his dream to the world, and did not ask for money in
return. His choice.

In the scenario described, an inventor would be required by economic
pressure to sign his rights over to some industry with the bucks to develop
the idea, since he has 'no right' to keep others from making his device..
and has too little money to develop it himself. Even if he lives through the
R+D phase, once he markets it, others are free to copy, so his chance of
seeing a profit is nil..

Wealth stems from *any* economic resource that is used to produce goods and
services.  Labor has always been the most important of those.  (Although land
is very important in agricultural societies, such as under feudalism.)
However, automation allows us to substitute capital for labor.  This is
exactly what happens whenever a company replaces workers with machines.  It
also happens when machines allow a given number of workers to produce more,
instead of having to hire more workers.

OK.  But that seems to me like a terribly abstract and stilted way of saying
it.  It's more straightforward to say that labor and capital can be partly
substituted for one another.  This has always been true to some extent, but
automation technology allows *more* capital to displace labor.  Eventually it
could allow all labor to be displaced by capital.

This is where AI robots come into the picture.  If we assume a robot is owned
by someone and is therefore a form of capital, and if we also assume that the
robot can perform tasks which a human worker could do (i.e producing "wealth"
in the form of goods and services), then this is the mechanism by which wealth
can come from capital instead of from labor.

Maybe not entirely unrealistic, in the long run.  I envisioned an "anything
box" that was more like a bush robot, able to wander around and help people in
whatever way it sees fit.  It could be sort of semi-sentient, semi-autonomous
creature: a robotic slave that belongs to the general public rather than to
any private individual.  It's an idea that I find both attractive and
suspicious, because it seems too utopian.  Too good to be true?

I'm still not clear on exactly what are the benefits of a larger population.
I'm working from a standpoint of fear, because people tend to *want* to
reproduce.  It is something they innately desire, for Darwinian reasons.
Those who don't want to reproduce get weeded out of the gene pool.  I must
admit that even I find the idea of creating new life rather appealing.  It's
something I would enjoy doing.  And I also note that an exponentially growing
population will eventually outstrip any and all resources that you can throw
at it.  It doesn't matter exactly what the limiting factor turns out to be,
because a growing population will eventually *find* that limit.  It's hard to
see a happy end to that.

Realistically, I probably shouldn't be worried about this.  We may be
thousands of years away from running into those limits.  Still, why tempt
fate by building population growth into your economic system?

It's easy to install.  Trying to *operate* it is a nightmare, at least for
someone like myself who is not a Unix/Linux guru.

Some otherwise rational scientists have extreme problems with even
considering certain topics. Isaac Asimov wrote wonderful science fiction and
as a scientist dismissed out of hand many ideas that did not match the
current state of knowledge in physics. 'Impossible!' was the title of one
essay - and he meant it!

It is fine to say 'under our current level of knowledge, this process is
impossible' - the qualifier allows you to gracefully accept the impossible
when someone discovers the way to do it. Psi is one thing that has had tons
of bad press, and bad sci-fi, so many scientists shy away.

There has to be room for 'silly science' research. Most of it will be found
to be horsefeathers, I am afraid, but there will be an occasional gem that
should more than pay the costs of supporting research on dead ends. Besides,
this research will keep some of the crackpots from entering politics or
becoming Presidential advisers..

Unless somebody invents FTL travel, which I must consider unlikely based on
current scientific knowledge, each economic system will be effectively limited
to a single solar system.  You can't have an interstellar economic system any
more than you can have an interstellar government.  So, the real concern is
not over-running the resources of the universe, but rather over-running the
resources of individual star systems.

Obviously we're a long way from doing that.  However, it *could* happen.
Eventually it *will* happen, unless some other factor comes into play.

No resource limit is "impregnable" if you assume there will be miracle
technologies that can repeal the laws of physics.  I prefer not to make
that assumption.

Hm.  That reminds me of Groo the Wanderer....

   Chakaal: "As long as the lizard-men are inside their citadel, they
      are impregnable!"

   Groo: "They cannot have children?"

The pursuit of greatness, perhaps.  To me, this is one thing that separates
people from animals.  As animal-rights activists are quick to point out,
animals can suffer just like humans, and animals can also be happy.  But, they
can't achieve greatness.

The Pharaoh Khufu created the Great Pyramid at Giza.  Presumably it made him
happy to create pyramids.  Now Khufu is long dead, and he is therefore no
longer happy, but his pyramid is STILL GREAT.  He changed the world.

That's why I am interested in Project Star Net.  It's the greatest thing that
I can think of, so I would like to contribute in whatever way I can to making
it happen.

Post-singularity?  I'm not familiar with that term.  The only singularity I

I see no obstacle to making such predictions.  (Keeping in mind that I'm not
sure exactly what you mean by "post-singularity".)  There will be a lot of
chaos and upheaval in our near future, but that will all shake out eventually
and reach a stable condition.  This is one of those odd cases where
forecasting the distant future is much easier than forecasting the near
future.

That is true.  Did I mention my idea for renovating the MOON?  I wanted to
strip off the whole top layer and convert it into utility fog.  Turn the whole
thing into a virtual environment.  I'm sure the eco-freaks would turn blue if
they heard such an idea.  But what a wonderful resources it would be!  You
could create something similar to the Well World, with the virtual space
partitioned off into "hexes" with each a different environment, each with
something different to offer its visitors (or residents) -- and the whole
thing permanently parked here next to the Earth for easy access.  How
convenient!

would be happy to live in a star system with a few million other people, or
maybe even LESS.  But maybe I'm just weird because I live in a rural area of
Texas where the population has been *shrinking* for years, and I still feel
crowded sometimes.


><tsk tsk>  Malthus was wrong, and later recanted his own theory.

Malthus was wrong about details and timing, but his basic principle was rock
solid, like the firmness of the earth.  Human beings are replicators and will
eventually over-run any fixed resource.

Maybe energy won't be the problem.  Maybe it will be waste heat.  Maybe it
will be the supply of raw matter.  Maybe it will be living space.  Whatever
limit there may be, an exponentially growing population will eventually find
it.

So, anything that's not going to happen "very soon" is something we shouldn't
concern ourselves with?  But "very soon" is a relative term.  Just a while
back, somebody on this list referred to a span of several million years as an
"eyeblink", if I recall right.

Different propositon here. If I build a house, I can sell it once. If I hit
a baseball, I can only make each hit once. 

If I develop a unique product, I can sell it many times.

Okay, definition accepted. But use of a copied product as your own is also
fraud for the exact same reason.

Yes, but how do you prevent people from claiming to be the original author
without some law or rule acknowleging the original maker?

That makes perfect sense, since most Utopian schemes work in that location

Have you checked out our web site? Our product, granted, uses existing
technology for it's component parts. The overall idea is what is unique and
revolutionary, and would not have been possible before the development of
modern engine controls on cars. In fact, those controls gave my partner the
impetus he needed to concieve of the product we developed.

Goodyear and vulcanization? The Wright Brothers? A G Bell? None had any
government help until they got their patents. Without the patent, they would
have been raped by some large existing firm almost instantly once they made
their process or product known.

I agree, nothing is created in a vacuum - except possibly interstellar
matter :) What does that have to do with creation being the property of the
creator?

I never said anyone should have government help. A copyright or patent is no
different than a law against pigeon drop scams and littering. It gives
honest people a tool to recover from thieves and scoundrels.

The monopoly is short enough in time, and realistically, the life of a
patent is measured in months, not years, before competition renders the
patent virtually worthless. Only in the case of the revolutionary idea you
don't belive in is the patent truly effective.

Copyright, on the other hand, is protection to the tools of business. A logo
or commercial artwork is no different from a hammer or milling machine. If
someone appropriates your corporate logo, they steal from you as surely as
if they took a machine tool from your palnt.

Correct, which points out another point of confusion.  How many people
know if they have the original Windows 95, or what you have: Windows 95B
R2, or what version?  How many people are going to try one Windows 95
system, see that it works, and thinks it will work on their Windows 95
at home?

Another possibility, which I have never voiced until now, is that
Windows 95 might be easily patched to be Year 2000 compliant.  It may be
that Bill Gates would rather that everyone upgrade to Windows 98 instead
of getting the upgrades to fix their existing Windows 95.

The same speed as when you enter it with, possibly with some
acceleration/retardation due to local curvature gradients (which could
be rather large for small wormholes).

Johnny's Little Red Fire Engine
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A man was walking on the sidewalk and noticed up ahead that little
Johnny was wearing a red fire man's hat and sitting in a red wagon. It
appeared that the wagon was being pulled slowly by a large Labrador
Retriever.

When he got closer to the lad, he noticed that Johnny had a rope
tied around the dog's testicles, which probably accounted for why the
dog was walking so gingerly.  

Smiling, he spoke to the little boy, "That's really a nice fire
engine you have there son, but I'll bet the dog would pull you faster
if you tied that rope around his neck." 

"Yeah," Johnny replied, "but then I wouldn't have a siren."

Pragmatic Solutions
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A couple of weeks after hearing a sermon on "Knowing my own Hidden
Secrets" and "Lies and Deceit," a man wrote the following letter to
the IRS: 

"I have been unable to sleep knowing that I have cheated on my Income
Taxes. I understated my taxable income, and have enclosed a check for
$150.00. If I still can't sleep, I will send the rest."

Sleeping Arrangements
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A lawyer and two friends, a Rabbi and a Hindu holy man, had car
trouble in the countryside and asked to spend the night with a
farmer.

The farmer said "There might be a problem; you see, I only have room
for two to sleep, so one of you must sleep in the barn." 

"No problem," chimed the Rabbi, "My people wandered in the desert for
forty years, I am humble enough to sleep in the barn for an evening.
With that he departed to the barn and the others bedded down for the
night.

Moments later a knock was heard at the door; the farmer opened the
door, there stood the Rabbi from the barn. 

"What's wrong?" asked the farmer. 

He replied, "I am grateful to you , but I can't sleep in the barn.
There is a pig in the barn and my faith believes that is an unclean
animal."

His Hindu friend agrees to swap places with him. But a few minutes
late the same scene reoccurs. There is a knock on the door, 

"What's wrong, now?" the farmer asks. 

The Hindu holy man replies, "I too am grateful for your helping us out
but there is a cow in the barn and in my country cows are considered
sacred. I can't sleep on holy ground!"

Well, that leaves only the lawyer to make the change. He grumbled and
complained, but went out to the barn.

Yep, you guessed it! Moments later there was another knock on the
farmers door. Frustrated and tired, the farmer opens the door, and
there stood the pig and the cow.

The "Teaching What I Most Need to Know" Section:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

To know full and pure love is a matter of rising to your highest 
self, being willing to accept the other fully and with an 
understanding heart.  There must be complete and full trust between 
you and the other, which also serves to clear away your and the 
other's issues, making it possible for you both to approach the world 
with clear eyes and joyful optimistic hearts.

Take care in who you trust for a romantic relationship by listening 
to your feelings, but when you find that right person who you know 
you can trust, give it your all and then some more.  You will find 
sides of your self that you hadn't even imagined, blooming freely in 
the light of love.  And remember always - a relationship is not a 
thing from which you need gain, but rather, a joining to which you 
give and thereby fully know who you are.

The risks are so worth the incredible feeling of having an 
undying bond and trust with the one you love.  Your expanding 
fullness will come from giving to and boosting up another to untold 
dimension, as the other will give to you.  Love expands and heals.  
Let not fear enter your heart in life or love.  Cast it out until 
only feelings based in love remain.  Do this by facing your feelings 
honestly, knowing them, and sharing them.

This giving and building includes letting that person grow and go
should that be what they need.  Be true to them always in all ways.  
But be true to yourself first and foremost, thereby being true to 
the other.  

Should your relationship not be able to carry forward for all the
time you live, remember that success in a relationship is not based
on its length.  Success in relationships, and all other things, is
based on the fullness of your soul.

Telling of God's Assured Love,

We could look at from this point of view. You being an engineer would 
certaintly understand the stipulations time travel would have upon a 
spacecraft and keeping it together let alone travel for that distance at 
such a speed(close to light). If a man were to travel for one year under 
these circumstances, 1500 years approximately would pass here on earth. 
Einstein believed that a clock on the spaceship would appear to be 
moving much slower than here on earth. lets say we engaged a time travel 
experiment for the pilot to travel 10 years, 5 years to one point in 
space and 5 back, if the pilot left earth on january 1st, 2000, he would 
arrive back on earth january 1st,17,000! The pilot would only be 10 
years older, yet the world would be completely different, and probably 
the climate would be something he couldnt adjust to with the rate of 
global warming as it is, and therefore have a "few" surprises for him 
when he got home. These are just a few ideas, popular theories actually 
that can be read presently. actually the global warming part is my 
opinion so for all i know the pilot may have nothing to worry about, but 
im a firm believer in evolution and believe that if 15,000 years go 
humans will adjust to many many things that we would not be able to 
handle in one large spurt presently.

That's true. Non determinism enters Quantum Mechanics because the Schrodinger 
equation does not describe something in the real world, something concrete 
like a position or a momentum, it describes the square root of a probability.

Definitions alone are of no value in philosophy, just words describing words

Viruses don't need brains because their bodies are astronomically better at 
spreading their genes that human bodies are. Even compared to other mammals 
human bodies are inferior, our endurance is good but we're slow, weak, and 
our teeth and claws are a joke. If our brain were no better than other 
mammals we'd be long extinct, as it is we're the most common large animal on 
earth.

Irrelevant. Evolution has no foresight, each mutation must confer a 
reproductive advantage NOW or natural selection will not let it persist into 
future generations. If sentience were not an inevitable product of 
intelligence it would have never have evolved, and even if by some magic it 
did genetic drift would not let us keep it, it would wither away as all 
useless appendages do, just as the eyes of fish that have lived in dark caves

Yes. I need no test because my consciousness is one thing, the only thing,

impeccable proof that I was not conscious I wouldn't be impressed. On the 
other hand, I do need a test of your consciousness, but I don't have one and 
never will.

It sticks someplace in my memory, that not so much the speed is an issue,
but rather the acceleration needed to get to much higher fractions of c. In
that sense, freeing oneself from a feeble human body solves both that
problem and that of time

>The point is: if you don't plan to make life enjoyable (whatever that may mean to
>you) for yourself in the future, then what *do* you want?

I enjoy life right now, so I don't need to plan to make it so. Too many people, I think, discard the
present opportunity to enjoy life, by postponing happiness until some non-existant future. Of
course, if you enjoy making plans, go for it. As I see it, extropy has its own way of amplifying
human happiness to prompt the careful observer to embrace ever more complex adaptive systemsas they
may spontaneously emerge. In this respect, extropy paralells the concept of the life force itself,
as it evolves to higher levels of sentience.

Rather than plan for future happiness, I've decided to expand my own present appreciation for the
autonomous movement of extropian evolution. The extropian spike (Singularity) will, I extrapolate,
involve features for which I have no way of adequately or appropriately planning. We cannot, IMO,
make this thing happensince it involves incomprehensibly complex developmentsbut we *can* let it
happen. The extent to which we enjoy this singular occurence depends on the degree to which we allow
it to energize our consciousness.

As extropy (of the non-denominational kind) explodes in the next decade or two, I anticipate a
tremendous benefit to people who remain passively alert and attentive to the ultimate ramifications
of a new form of sentience overtaking this planet, this solar system, this galaxy, etc.
Nanotechnological engines of creation need engineers with the courage to say good-bye to their
dreams of future planningto let themselves undergo the transformation necessary to continue into
undreamed of potentialities. Such engineers will experience a psychological death. Until the old
mind (brain) dies, the transformed mind (brain) cannot emerge. I think of the present humanity as a
kind of "seed" that has to die (i.e., stop existing as a seed), so that it can sprout and grow. As
one thing leads to another, the process of extropy creates a new consciousness totally disconnected
from the old one. "Don't worry, be happy" sounds childish and naove to some folks, because they have
given themselves to grim competition and an infowar position. But that attitude renders them
short-lived and ill. I think an old astronomer summed it up in his epitath: "I cannot fear the
night, for I have loved the stars." I feel a sense of awe and wonder ought to attach to our
futurism, for no other reason than that we *enjoy* it.

Cheers,

J R

You don't get contradictions, but you do get paradoxes in the sense of
things which are so contrary to intuition that you almost can't believe
that they happen.

There was an article in Extropy many years ago about electronic circuits
which depended on time travel.  It looked like it would be possible to
do significant amounts of computation in zero time.  You set up a system
which will be inconsistent unless a certain equation is satisfied, and
presto, the non-contradiction principle automatically means that the
system satisfies the equation.

Time travel computers would put quantum computers to shame.  Any NP
problem (that is, any one whose answer can be checked easily, like
factoring) can be solved in constant time.

There is a classic sci-fi story in which (to simplify slightly) the
man who will be known as the inventor of the time machine didn't invent
it, he was given it by a future version of himself.  This would seemingly
be consistent and has no contradictions, but it is paradoxical that
a complex device like this would have no inventor.

You also have to ask how the non-contradiction principle would prevent
the actions of people who want to produce events in the past which are
inconsistent with history.  Seemingly the universe must interpose some
obstacles which will inevitably thwart their efforts.  The universe
is forced in effect to act as a smart opponent, always coming up with
something which defeats the clever tricks people try to use.

It is not our bodies that makes acceleration hard, it is energy: to
sustain a 1 G acceleration for a long time you need a tremendous
energy output.

Can you also use this device to solve the Halting Problem? I.e., set up a
system with two possible states, one consistent with a Turing machine
halting and another one consistent with the machine not halting? If so we
can rule out the possibility that this device can be physical by assuming
that the universe has a low algorithmic complexity.

It wouldn't be so paradoxical if the universe is capable of doing infinite
amount of computation in zero time, since you can think of device as being
computed by the universe at the point of time it is received by the
inventor.

Yes, but that happens all the time now (superfluids, EB condensates,
gamma ray bursts, spacetime, self-organization, the Banach-Tarski
paradox...). Common sense and intuition doesn't fare to well in modern
science :-)

Actually, the universe doesn't have to be very smart. Novikov makes a
careful analysis of the action principle on a billiard table with a
time-travel wormhole and a single billiard ball. In quantum mechanics
it turns out that the wavefunction for the inconsistent solutions
becomes identically zero, while some weird but consistent solutions
involving the billiard ball having interactions with
itself-from-the-future becomes possible. So the inconsistent stuff
doesn't happen, just weird but consistent stuff.

But doesn't a limited ability to handle complex situations lead to a
chaotic view?  A higher intelligence can see the cause and effect of
many things simultaneously.  A lesser intelligence that is unable to
see cause and effect sees randomness and probability.

Now read this quote from Hans Moravec (Simulation, Consciousness,
Existence - Telepolis 96):

---

"Hartle and Gell-Mann note that if we were to try to observe and
remember events at the finest possible detail - around 10^-30
centimeters, far smaller than anything reachable today - the
interference of all possible worlds would present a seething chaos
with no permanent structures, no quiet place to store memories,
effectively no consistent time. At a coarser viewing scale - 10^-15
centimeters, the submicroscopic world touched by today's high-energy
physics - much of the chaos goes unobserved, and multiple worlds merge
together, canceling the wildest possibilities, leaving those where
particles can exhibit a consistent existence and motion, if still
jaggedly unpredictable, through a vacuum that boils with ephemeral
virtual energy. Everyday objects have the smooth, predictable
trajectories of common sense only because our dim senses are coarser
still, registering nothing finer than 10^-5 centimeters. At scales
larger than the everyday (or the Hartle Gell-Mann analysis), the
events we consider interesting are blurred to invisibility, and the
universe is increasingly boring and predictable. At the largest
possible scale, the universe's matter is canceled by the negative
energy in its gravitational fields (which strengthen while releasing
energy, as matter falls together), and in sum there is nothing at all.

The odd thing about the Gell-Mann Hartle spectrum is that it is not
some external knob that controls the interaction intensity, but
varying interpretations of a single underlying reality made by
observers who are part of the interpretation."

---

So the predictability of the world is related to how you consciously
observe it.  I'm not exactly the authroity on the Gell-Mann Hartle
Spectrum so don't take anything I say at face value.  But someone
who's "more conscious" (is seeing things on larger scale i.e. more
complexity) would seem more intelligent than someone who is
"less-conscious."  So it could be that intelligence and consciousness
is the same thing.

Anyone care to correct me?

Too true, and thus I misspake.  I maintain that your costs are covered by
your increase in revenues.  (The area inside the trapezoid.)

Maybe.  This happens sometimes.  I don't see how this applies, however,
unless you're trying to intimate that the increases in demand which I am
referring to are "too rosy."

Indeed...  This IS one of those facts about life.

I'm not suggesting that the real world acts like perfect competition.
However, the sales of copies of something is about as close as you get to
it.  Entry into the market is negligible.  A copy from one firm is
perfectly substitutable with another firm.  It is unlikely that one firm
would be able to have any control over prices in a market like this.

So to this extent, while the market for copies may not be PERFECT
competition, it's damned close.

You can't do that, and don't want to.  I might want an ultrasound sensor,
too, if it only cost me $1.  I would presume you aren't catering to my
price range, however, so you have to stop satisfying somewhere and choose a
price.  And if you're a monopolist, that price will be higher than if you
were in competition.

Competition.  If you're trying to jack up the prices in a nasty way, and
I'm offering an equivalent good at the lower price, you'll fail; the
consumers will all (freely) buy from me.

Indeed, many economists believe that it's nearly IMPOSSIBLE to create a
(non-natural) monopoly without government support.  Once the monopoly tries
to jack up the prices, it creates a window between the actual marginal cost
of the product and the market price, a window which competitors can make a
profit filling.  So if you're really looking at someone to blame, look to
the government, which has a history of corrupt corporate welfare.  It's
"good for American businesses."  Heard that one before?

>Agreed. That I need to be 'competitive. I still don't agree that I should
>have to allow others to take my devlopment as is without compensating me.

Returning to my original point, when you create something without monopoly,
it's a good with positive externalities.  Your profits increase (given by
your trapezoid minus the cost of invention) and all other firms in the
industry gain as well (each of their individual trapezoids).  But when you
create a monopoly, you deliberately cut off those externalities, and
instead create an economic BAD:  higher prices at a lower quantity.

I put forward that the cure, in this case, is worse than the "disease,"
loathe though I am to call positive externalities a disease.

This isn't comparable AT ALL.  When someone takes five of your widgets, you
can't sell them.  You reap no trapezoid.  When someone makes five widgets
just like yours however, you can sell them, all of them, in a free and
competitive market, and you ALL get a trapezoid.

You can't compare information to widgets; the transmission of information
is a SERVICE, not the sales of goods.  When I give you a backrub, I do you
a service.  I have not made a "backrub unit" and sold it to you.  I have
scratched your back, and you have paid me for it.

Rather than thinking of services like widgets, try thinking of them like
fire, a far more apt simile.  If you have fire, and I stick wood in your
fire and "take" your fire, is your fire darker?  What have you lost,
precisely?  The reason this is so tricky is because the distribution of
fire is a service, not a widget.  If I WERE to sell you fire, it would not
be because I have made a fire unit and I am selling you one.  If I were to
sell you fire, I would be doing you the SERVICE of igniting your wood.  And
BECAUSE services aren't like widgets, I can reasonably expect that someone
else will be able to emulate my service; in this case, probably the person
I sold it to.

The difference between a service and the sale of goods is not semantic;
neither is the sale of goods a service.  They are distinct non-colliding
entities (unless someone has an example to the contrary; this isn't one)
which represent very different transactions.

The investor does not buy the RIGHTS from the inventor; he pays for the
service of being told the information.  And reasonably, if that investor
wants to sell that service to others, he must expect that others will be
able to emulate his service.

"If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of
exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea,
which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to
himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the
possession of everyone, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it.
Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because
every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me,
receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his
taper at mine, receives light without darkening me. That ideas should
freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual
instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been
peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like
fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density at any
point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have out physical
being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then
cannot, in nature, be a subject of property." - Thomas Jefferson

Humor me, if you will, with the answer to a particular philosophical
problem which has been bugging me.

I often hear individuals in debates about consciousness stating that they
know, with absolute certainty, "above logic," as you say, that they exist
and that they are conscious.  Now, while I do believe that I am conscious,
and have no evidence at all to the contrary, how precisely is it that I
might KNOW that I exist?  Surely, if I did not exist, I would not know it.
And though I would have to exist in order to deny my own existence, even to
formulate this question in my mind, how do I know that these are actually
happening?  Wouldn't it be possible that I do NOT exist and that I have not
formulated these questions at all?

Would it be more precise to say that I am more certain that I am conscious
than I am certain of anything else?  Or is there a stronger version of this
proof which I am overlooking?

Actually, having formulated this question and now realizing my error, I
realize that I SHOULD have asked "How does a person know that they exist?"
or "How do you know?"  But the points, I think, do not change.

you would end up on the other side of the wormhole, actually. if you 
were to even enter a wormhole, you would first encounter a blackhole, 
and pass through the throat like shape of the wormhole, and end up 
outside of another blackhole. if you were to look at it on a certain 
plane it would look somewhat like a barbell, 2 circular 
objects(blackhole entrances) and a handle(wormhole). so basically, 
depending on the distance of the wormhole between the 2 blackholes would 
determine where you would end up. in theory i suppose you could end up 
10 feet away from where you started, but be on a different plane once 
you reached the other end. anyone who has any more insight to this 
please add.

Here we go with yet another space question, which im not sure if its a 
popular one of not but one i have always been curious about and hope 
someone can shed some light upon it. It is a fact that space is 
constantly expanding and at what rate im not sure. What i question is 
what is space expanding "into". when a balloon expands it expands into 
air, takes up "space". after we eat taco bell our stomachs "expand" and 
take up "space". but when SPACE expands does it take up more SPACE? does 
space make its own space to expand into, at a faster rate than it 
expands? maybe its something obvious im not sure, but would sure like 
some insight if anyone cares to reflect.

There is a dramatic use of this in Robert Forward's novel Timemaster.
There is a backwards-in-time wormhole in space, and the good guy manages
to maneuver things so that the bad guy gets destroyed.  One space ship
comes out of the wormhole before it goes in, bounces off another one,
and knocks its earlier self in, or something like that.

I still say that it is black magic.  Once you start up one of these
Novikov collisions, you won't be able to interfere.  The whole path is
pre-ordained.  Any universes where you succeed get nulled out.

Remember Asimov's short story about the crystals which dissolve *before*
you add water?  The military used them to create a bomb by using a cascade
of stages to expand the time interval.  Once a crystal dissolved there
*had* to be ("had been") water added in a few hours.  Drop the bomb in a
heavily sealed case in an enemy country, and a bizarre, damaging typhoon
would arise sufficient to bash open the bomb, along with everything else.

Not contradictory or inconsistent, but paradoxical in my book.

Let's establish a convention here.  Small-o objectivism
will stand for the standard dictionary defintion of the
term, while large-O Objectivism will stand for the 
philosophy of Ayn Rand and those in her tradition
(regardless of whether she or they accept this:) such
as Nathaniel Branden, Leonard Peikoff, David Kelley,
George Walsh and Chris Sciabarra.

Basic tenets of Objectivism are, as Rand and others
put it:

Metaphysics: Reality
Epistemology: Reason
Ethics: Rational Self-Interest
Politics: Laissez-faire capitalism
Esthetics: Romanticism

Cartesian?  I tend to think of it, simply, as stuff
stemming from Descartes philosophy with its emphasis
on an ontology of mind-body dualism and a skeptical
view of epistemology.

I have the book, but have not managed to read it.

Before reading Allen's essay, I'd like to mention two
things.  One, Objectivism does not posit a dichotomy
between fact and value.  In fact (no pun intended),
Rand and others in her camp believe value to be
derived from fact.  Some Objectivists -- Leonard
Peikoff, for example -- believe there are no neutral
facts for seemingly the same reason: conscious
things being living things must pursue values and
therefore all things either help or harm them.  Two,
objectivism of the small-o kind is often applied to
the field of ethics to mean that there are objective
moral standards, and usually honesty is one of
them.

Rand and her cohorts were/are critics of behaviorism,
Marxism and reductionism too.

Perhaps.  It might be that free market viewpoints
aren't really taken seriously because they are
traditionally associated with socially conservative
types and because of the typical intellectual
[elistist] attitude toward everyday life and business.

Also, given that in mixed economies businesses
often collaborate with governments -- e.g.,
regulatory capture, subsidies for industries, and
support of laws which limit competition (such as
import quotas, tariffs, bank portfolio requirements),
it is often hard to separate the market from the
government.

The problem here is that many on the left would agree
with the libertarian view on legalizing drugs.  However,
that's merely one position out of many.  (Which is one
reason to think in principles.  We get to see why people
who differ in other areas agree in this one.)

Overall, I do not see tacit knowledge as anathema to
Objectivism or objectivism.  Or vice versa.  Nor do I
confuse Cartesianism -- which here I take it you mean
a form of philosophy that maintains "all knowledge is
not tacit" -- with Objectivism or objectivism.

The beginning of many philosophical debates is often
a narrowing of choices such that one idea (or philosophy)
is confused with others, than a whole category is rejected
without being examined.  While dialectical thinking might
held us to clean up this mistake, given that we are finite
(for now:), I urge caution.

The point I was trying to make is that some folks will use the point of a
gun, or bombs, or intimidation, to put down competition. Any society must
have methods to deal with criminals.

If all players are reasonably honest, then in the free market there should
not be monopolies.

Amen. Uncle has much to answer for.

I have a side question - what about 'trade secrets'? If they are properly
guarded, the widget resulting is extremely difficult to reverse engineer.. I
would hope that this case is going to be rewarded by the inventor/maker
getting most of the market, as the competition's goods won't be of
comparable quality.

Perhaps I missed an initial post on this - I thought you were talking about
material goods, not products.

When it comes to paper, I have different feelings about patents.
Unfortunately, these feelings tend to be that copyright should cover plans,
software, etc, not patents. So we are still at odds, I fear..

(I LOATHE the idea of software patents, and NASA is a prime offender. See
any issue of NASA Tech Briefs..)
(and yes, I do quite a bit of programming..)

Due to terminal illness or personal request to a paid for doctor?

If you get the chance, read Harry Harrison's 'Make Room! Make Room!' - the
novel the movie was made from.

Incidentally, 'soylent green' was NOT people.. it was 'soy / lentil'
combination, green color. Thje rest was Hollywood. I think the book was much
better than the movie.

Not necessarily correct, but conjecture - the less intelligent person may
ignore details that you or I would notice at once. His viewpoint is more
'simplistic' perhaps? Perhaps lesser intelligence can't see details at all..

What you relate here feels right. If you look at any system too closely you
get into the 'forest for the trees' syndrome.

That is a pretty problem. Space is what we live in - if it is expanding,
what do we measure it against? If space expands, everything in space should
expand as well.

As far as WHAT it is expanding into, I can only guess that it is a dimension
outside our powers of observation. 

Is this somehow related to the curvature of the universe - perhaps the curve
is flattening out..

Sounds like a feedback loop to me. No wierd science needed, just control theory.

Has anyone figured out how to tell if two black holes are paired with a
wormhole? I can think of a situation where all black holes reach 'into'
another space - so that if you pass through any entry, you can choose from
all possible exits. Russian roulette, anyone?

The Princeton Engineeering Anomalies Research corpus of data does exactly
this, by brute force during 20 years of dogged work with stable protocols
and many Ss.

On the other hand, phenomena with small effect size frequent *don't* yield
significant results in modest experiments, and cannot be expected to - a
point that seems to elude non-statisticians.  Prof. Jessica Utts is good on
this.

It's not altogether clear that this is the case.  Take a look at the
reports in Radin's book on `presentiment', where they found electrodermal
orienting responses immediately in advance of Ss. seeing shocking or
distressing or erotically arousing images, but not with control neutral
imagery.  This experimental set-up is said to have been replicated
succesfully, and is easy enough to do.

And of course the same generic objection could be made against non-local
quantum effects.  The difference is that QT has powerful theory predicting
the observed effects; parapsychology or anomalies research has only the
offensive data and a batch of rough-and-ready explanatory schemata.  But
the data need to be explained, and at this stage of the game fraud and
sloppy thinking are not good enough explanations.

Its kind of like when a capsule of air is broken open in a vacuum, it quickly
expands into the vacuum.  Perhaps that is whats happening.  When I told my
friend that the universe is accelerating in its expansion he suggested that
perhaps the universe has reached its expansion and has been accelerating
towards the center again, and thats what we're seeing.  Also, what they're
using to find these results is like 8 billion years old, or thats what I
heard.  So if its accelerating, it is going much faster than what we see 8
billion years ago.

My understanding (admittedly quite limited) is that the universe cannot be
considered to be expanding *into* anything.  It's just expanding.  It's not
like there's a border and on one side is our space-time-matter world while
on the other there's something else.  Our minds just can't wrap around the
idea of nothing.  But what I don't get is the volume of space in our
universe keeps increasing as it exapnds so where does the extra *space* come
from? Space is not nothing, right?  Space can be distorted (by mass) so is
it stretching?  Is more being created somewhere?  Smart people...help the
less fortunate here.

There is another huge difference, non-local quantum effects do not transmit 
information but ESP, if it exists as the experimentalists claim, does. That 
would render most of modern Physics to the trash can.
              

        >the data need to be explained, and at this stage of the game

If true then science would need to be revolutionized more radically then it 
has ever been before, but I'm EXTREMELY skeptical that they have the skill to 
detect very subtle statistical effects when most who work in this area can  
not detect blatant fraud even when it's screaming in their face. 

I'm not familiar with The Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research and their 
20 year history you speak of, but the general history of this area does not 
engender much confidence. "Scientists" routinely  wrote learned articles 
about miraculous occurrences that later turn out to have been performed by 
the same simple tricks amateur magicians use to entertain children at 
birthday parties. The most famous of them was J B Rhine and he doesn't seem 
to have been very bright.

I certainly don't think more experiments are needed in precognition because  
every week a huge experiment on it is conducted under the most rigorous 
controls imaginable. Every week in the USA millions of people buy lottery 
tickets and have been doing so for many years. On every Saturday 6 numbers 
are picked at random, each number can be 1 to 50, if you guess all 6 numbers 
you win millions of dollars, if you guess 3 you win about $10. If there were 
anything to ESP the number of winners should be larger that what you would 
expect from chance, but it is not, and if the effect is too small for even a 
huge experiment like the lottery to detect then The Princeton Engineering 
Anomalies Research sure as hell won't find it.

I read somewhere that all of these myths originate at apporxiamately the 
same time as the explosion of Thera at something like 1500 BC.
Lovely crescent shaped volcanic island in the central Mediterranean that 
used to be circular. Blew itself to little pieces. Dark clouds visible 
in Egypt, ashes, fallout, Tidal surges, just like Exodus.

Coincidence.... Naah.

The other end. Presumably you could look through the wormhole with a

His use is essentially Novikov's billiard ball trick:

Place the backwards-in-time-wormhole ends like this (anything that
enters the entrance appears one second earlier at the exit). Send a
billiard ball towards the entrance:

If you give it the right velocity, a future version of itself will
appear at the exit one second before it enters, and move forward to
block it from entering. PARADOX!!!

But Novikov shows that there is a consistent solution that the
universe might use instead: one second before the ball enters the
wormhole a ball emerges from the exit at a slanted angle, collides
with the ball and sends it into the entrance at an angle. This way the
universe remains consistent, momentum is conserved (OK, there are some
tricky considerations when you use wormholes to turn the momentum
vector about) and we avoid paradoxes.

Actually, I think it is more clever than that. Agents still have their
free will, it is just that they or the world will not behave in such a
way that a paradox results.  Suppose you were trying to make a paradox
on the Novikov table by shoving the ball around. When you are planning
to snatch any balls emerging from the exit and throw them into the
wastebasket, none will appear.

Hardly. First, the wormhole into another space you get in the ordinary
Schwartzschild metric is non-traversable, it collapses (from the
travellers perspective) before anything gets through (and the presence
in the past of a collapsing star wrecks it in the first place). Things
are better in the charged (Reisser-Nordström) or rotating (Kerr) black
hole metrics, where you have not just one but an infinity of
exits. Unfortunately infinite blueshifts and other nastiness most
likely both fries you and modifies the rather unstable metric to make
it impossible to get through.

(see Lecture Notes on General Relativity by Sean M. Carrol,
http://itp.ucsb.edu/~carrol/notes/ for a good introduction to GR and
some discussion of these spacetimes)

I don't think black holes are very useful for transport; they have
emerged due to gravitational collapse, not because posthumans should
get cheap travel. If we want wormholes, we better make them ourselves
(my guess is that creating local inflation could be used to magnify
ordinary quantum wormholes; the high energy quantum gravity
engineering involved is left as an exercise for the student :-)

Space isn't expanding into anything, there is no need for an
"embedding space" as it is known mathematically in order to have a
self-consistent spacetime with our laws of physics. This is usually a
bit hard to understand when one considers everyday phenomena which of
course occurs inside our space. 

One could say spacetime can grow, in the sense that there could become
more of it between two points. But it doesn't grow into any outside
space, since it is space itself.

I hope this was comprehensible; the math is simple but hard to
explain (obvious in retrospect, as usual).

Aren't many libertarians Objectivists?  And, just as a simple matter of
political classification, all Objectivists should be libertarians if not
Libertarian Party members.

Rand's personal preferences and her rationalizations for them should,
from the perspective of Objectivism as a philosophy, be ignored.  One
must separate the thinker from the ideas -- as one should do with any
set of ideas.

I agree about "examin[ing] all sets of ideas and draw[ing] the best
from each..." with one caveat.  This is that one must be selective
given the limits of time, effort, and knowledge.  There are, sadly,
many good ideas we will miss in our discussions/researches.

Also, I see nothing wrong with talking politics as long as this does
not become an end in itself.

Finally, I do not think that the difference between libertarians and
Objectivists are political.  The two groups overlap to a large extent.
Rand's (and Peter Schwartz's) views on libertarianism are, after all,
silly.

Vivamus!

So all we need is to manipulate the Federal Reserve Board correctly, and we

The idea of a rotating BH I have seen in SF, but have not seen actual

Is this the same thing as 'ESP' between two human subjects? I have always
wondered at the reasoning that you can test precognition by letting a person
read the outcome of a chaotic future event (lottery balls), or controlling
the outcome of some sort of digital device. Such experiments seem to be pure
magic.

For instance - suppose there IS such a thing as telekenesis. If one person
so gifted is present in a room with a lottery machine, he or she might be
able to influence the outcome.

Now suppose a few million of these gifted people, all wanting to see THEIR
particular numbered balls roll out of the machine. My thought is that the
conflicting forces would give a result indistinguishable from chaos. Similar
reasoning should hold for telepathy or precognition - after all, the
hallmark of a chaotic system is that you don't know where it will settle
until it does. Forgive me if I mangle some definitions here. Perhaps I am
meaning to say 'random'.

The ideas of telekenesis or telepathy seem more probable when you consider
two similar beings having some remote effect on each other. This kind of
research, done in a proper setting with a properly designed experiment,
should be able to show some results if a sufficiently large pool of test
subjects is used.

Of course, we will always have 'believers' even if several well-designed
experiments show no support at all for these phenomnena..

 My impression is that many people want an increasing standard of living.

 I did a hasty search for data to check this claim, and found the following
(from the St. Louis Fed, http://www.stls.frb.org/fred/):

eciwag -- Employment Cost Index-Wages: Private Industry Workers (SA, 8906=100)       
  DATE    ECIWAG

1980.1      63.1
...
1998.1     133.6

 I didn't find any wage data earlier than 1980. Since it appears unadjusted
for inflation, I checked the CPI for the comparable period:
1980.01       78.0 
...
1998.03      162.0 

 This sure looks inconsistent with your claim.

 Even if you have some data which tell a slightly different story, I
don't think that has much implication for which political system is
best. Automation has been going on for something like 2 centuries, and
if you use all the worldwide data to compare how the average person has
fared, you will see a clear correlation that favors relatively capitalist
countries.

 The increased volume of uninteresting posts on this list has caused
my reading habits to be less carefull than they used to be. I try to
keep this habit from affecting how I read posts that I reply to, but
I doubt that I done a perfect job of that.
 I suspect that the declining S/N ratio has also driven away some of the
people who were most carefull about how they read. If current trends
continue, I'll probably leave the list in a few months.

People keep handing me these terrific straight lines...  :)

As it happens, I published a book in 1992, full of otherwise unobtainable
data aand terrific charts, called THE LOTTO EFFECT (Melbourne, Australia:
Hudson, ISBN 0-949873-3-41-1), which is based on exactly this notion.  I
examined some three-quarters of a billion guesses in 20 consecutive draws
of the national Australian Lotto game.  First I normalised the guesses at
each of the numbers in the range 1-45, because populations hold different
preferences and biases toward each of these options - 7 and 13 always get a
markedly enhanced vote, e.g., whereas all the `non-birthday' numbers over
31 get a reduced vote.  Then I did a linear regression to iron out certain
long term irrelevant trends.  Then I compared the normalised votes for each
candidate number *when it was a target* against *when it wasn't*.  

If psi precognition were operating, one would expect a significantly
elevated (or perhaps a significantly depressed) vote for the six numbers
popping out of the randomiser.  I didn't find that overall, to my chagrin -
but I did locate a very weird effect in which the *most drastically deviant
positive residuals correlated with targets to a far greater extent than one
would expect by chance*.  Opinions differ over whether this post hoc
finding supports the psi hypothesis or is an artefact.  I think that when
the suggested artefact is factored in, there is still evidence for
precognition in the data.

(BTW, while it is true that `If there were anything to ESP the number of
winners should be larger that what you would expect from chance', the
expected impact isn't as obvious as it seems.  Leaving aside a truly
immense amount of stereotyped entry strategies - the same birthdays every
week, the same `lucky numbers', etc - I assume that each guess is
independent, and therefore each perfect entry requires 6 `psi-mediated
events' (other than those which get some numbers by chance, as some must).
There's a kind of pyramid generated, in which almost all the fairly
infrequent psi events you'd expect in such a population will be wasted on
people who would otherwise by chance get only zero, one, two, or three
right.  This still leaves some opportunity at the top, but it wouldn't be
as dramatic as one might intuitively suppose.  I discuss all this in
monstrous detail in my book.)

Why isn't this result widely known among New Age fruitcakes and skeptics
alike?  Beats me.  Dr Dean Radin does reference my book in his THE
CONSCIOUS UNIVERSE.  

Why haven't I just done a simple replication run or two and settled the
matter?  Because it took me about a decade to gouge the goddam data out of
the lottery company, and they are not interested in giving me (or several
interested university statisticians) any more.  Sigh.  But one of these
days, when someone gets the Nobel Prize for this, remember that you saw it
here first...  

(And yes, I know, Mike Lorrey and I should get together and create a
psi-powered Dean [Radin] Machine, ho ho bloody ho.)

I kind of see it it as infinite space, and energy is part of it, like a
compressed,  expanding point into the infinite surroundings (any number is a
point compared to infinity).  Space is quantum, so I dont think it expands
biger and bigger like energy does.  Perhaps there are aspects of space related
to being nearby energy, but I think space is infinite.

Huh? Wow, like cosmic man? :-)

To be honest, the above doesn't make much sense, and the parts that
make sense doesn't seem to fit with known physics.

It seems clear to me that the Novikov table could not exist and be
consistent with free will.  (BTW do you have a reference to Novikov's
paper?)  It's the classic paradox.  You watch the hole, and when
nothing comes out, you throw a ball in.  Oops, it was supposed to have
come out one second ago.  What happened?

Obviously you will not succeed in throwing the ball into the hole.
Maybe you'll have a heart attack when you try, or maybe a random
fluctuation of air molecules will bat the ball away at the last
minute.  It's Asimov's story all over again.

A few years ago it was thought that wormhole paradoxes would be
prevented because, at least in some geometries, virtual particles could
take a closed timelike path.  This led to an infinite amplification of
the particle flux, choking off the wormhole.

However I understand that these results did not generalize and that it
is now thought that no physical phenomenon will prevent the paradoxes.
I still suspect that some variation on the virtual particle problem
will arise and prevent wormhole loops, but it remains to be seen.

Try http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9607063

Time machines and the Principle of Self-Consistency as a consequence
of the Principle of Stationary Action (II): the Cauchy problem for a
self-interacting relativistic particle

	We consider the action principle to derive the classical,
	relativistic motion of a self-interacting particle in a 4-D
	Lorentzian spacetime containing a wormhole and which allows
	the existence of closed time-like curves. In particular, we
	study the case of a pointlike particle subject to a
	`hard-sphere' self-interaction potential and which can
	traverse the wormhole an arbitrary number of times, and show
	that the only possible trajectories for which the classical
	action is stationary are those which are globally
	self-consistent. Generically, the multiplicity of these
	trajectories (defined as the number of self-consistent
	solutions to the equations of motion beginning with given
	Cauchy data) is finite, and it becomes infinite if certain
	constraints on the same initial data are satisfied. This
	confirms the previous conclusions (for a non-relativistic
	model) by Echeverria, Klinkhammer and Thorne that the Cauchy
	initial value problem in the presence of a wormhole `time
	machine' is classically `ill-posed' (far too many
	solutions). Our results further extend the recent claim by
	Novikov et al. that the `Principle of self-consistency' is a
	natural consequence of the `Principle of minimal action.'

A fast ball comes out of the exit when you don't expect it and kicks
your ball in much faster than you intended? :-)

< Basic tenets of Objectivism are, as Rand and others
put it: Metaphysics: Reality; Epistemology: Reason;
Ethics: Rational Self-Interest; Politics:
Laissez-faire capitalism; Esthetics: Romanticism >

I said I hadn't read any *books* on Objectivism; but,
looking back through my Web-browsing notes, I find
that it was precisely one year ago that I first
checked out Mark J. Gardner's "What is Objectivism?"
ORG page! (
http://www.oms.com/org/objectivism/index.html) 

------------
There, under METAPHYSICS, Gardner says:
"The things we observe with our senses are real and
primary; the contents of our minds -- ideas and
emotions -- are secondary, and have no independent
validity unless they correspond to the facts of the
outside world."

This sounds reasonable; but, being naturally playful,
I like to invert this somewhat and propose:
Our sensation of and embodied interaction with the
world is real and primary; there are no independent
objects and theories apart from this interaction.

------------
Looking under EPISTEMOLOGY (Gardner is referencing:
Rand, _Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology_):
"Animals can only know what trees they have seen in
their lifetime; because of concepts, man can reach
basic conclusions about all trees -- including those
he has never seen."

I wonder how Objectivists can know this so certainly
about animals and other humans!  What kind of "basic
conclusion" would I want to reach about a tree that I
had never seen?  If I was a person indigenous to an
environment near the Arctic circle and had only seen
an occasional evergreen tree I might erroneously
decide that deciduous trees of lower latitudes were
not trees at all.

So, this seems somewhat contradictory to what follows
(which I basically agree with):
"Induction is merely one half of the process of
thought; true knowledge must not only be based on the
observed facts of reality, it must integrate in a
non-contradictory manner with all one's other
knowledge." In practice, I usually manage to
accomplish this well enough to survive and thrive. 
In principle, though (that is, in thought), I find
this impossible, and am often perturbed by seemingly
contradictory concepts (like metaphorical Baobab
trees with their 'roots' in the air).

So, Rand's epistemology is logic.  There seem to be
several types of logic, however.  Some excellent
discourse on these, conducted over a century ago by
Charles S. Peirce, is 'still' available online at
http://www.peirce.org (cf., "Questions Concerning
Certain Faculties Claimed for Man", "On a New List of
Categories", and "Some Consequences of Four
Incapacities" - looking briefly at these again, this
last one looks especially relevant to debates about
Objectivism).

------------
Regarding ETHICS, bouncing back to Gardner's ORG page
on this, the first thing I see is: "Valuing is solely
an attribute of animate matter. Inanimate matter
cannot act, because it has nothing to act for;
although its form can change, matter itself cannot be
destroyed, i.e., go out of existence."

Just for fun, I'd like to contrast this with the
following excerpt from William T. Powers' essay "The
Origins Of Purpose: The First Metasystem Transitions"
(Powers has been developing perceptual control
systems since the early 1950s; this essay is
available at
ftp://ftp.vub.ac.be/pub/projects/Principia_Cybernetica/WF-issue/Powers.txt):
"In a control-system model, a purpose is simply a
reference signal... The purpose of a control system,
in the final analysis, is to control some effect of
the environment on it, via its sensors, around a
specific state or condition or level... This concept
of purpose, of course, does not entail any cognitive
abilities or any ability to symbolize the purpose, to
think about it. It is simply an inherent property of
a control system, whether simple or complex."  Powers
gives an interesting example of how even molecules in
a solution can comprise a very simple control system.

Powers' conclusion here, I think, is worth quoting:
"Knowing control theory, we can freely use such terms
as intending, having a purpose, willing, and
desiring, because we can now see that the fundamental
meaning of such terms is defined by a particular
relationship between a system and its environment, a
relationship that has nothing to do with
verbalizations, reasoning, or cognitions of any kind.
Purpose is a far more fundamental phenomenon than any
of its various manifestations. It is, I propose, the
very basis of life."

When Gardner says "Values are thus the means to
sustaining life: that which furthers life is a value,
and is the good; that which harms or destroys life is
a disvalue, and is bad or evil", I have to say that
this seems somewhat simplistic when the means to
sustaining my life sometimes involves destroying
other life.

------------
Ah, POLITICS! Gardner refers to the chapter on "Man's
Rights" in Ayn Rand's _The Virtue of Selfishness_ 
and says: "Due to man's moral autonomy, no man can
have a positive claim on the life of another; rights
serve as a negative obligation, stating that a man
must be left free to live his own life by his own
mind, so long as he leaves others free to do the
same. The most fundamental right is the right to
life, and the right to property is its practical
implementation."

Although this is a very brief overview, I agree with
it wholeheartedly, even as I am unsure of all its
ramifications. As an example, consider the current
debate over 'intellectual property' and the Thomas
Jefferson quote: "That ideas should freely spread
from one to another over the globe, for the moral and
mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his
condition, seems to have been peculiarly and
benevolently designed by nature..."

BTW, there was an excerpt from Michael Spicer,
"Public Administration, Social Science, And Political
Association". _Administration & Society_ (March 1998)
on the Hayek list last week (see
http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/CGI/wa.exe?A2=ind9804&L=hayek-l&F=&S=&P=10734)
that made the interesting distinction between
'purposive' and 'civil' associations:

" ,,,  In a purposive association, it is necessary
that individual actions be conducive to the
attainment of the substantive ends of the state... On
the other hand, in a civil association, it is not
necessary that individuals undertake particular
actions that conform to certain substantive ends of
the state because a civil association does not
explicitly posit any such ends."

What's most interesting to me here is the
implications for human knowledge (citing same article):
"In particular, given the availability of individual
discretion over actions within a civil association,
much of the information or knowledge that men and
women use in deciding on what actions they will
undertake is inevitably dispersed and is, therefore,
inaccessible to any single mind or group of minds,
including those of social scientists."

Somehow this doesn't sound like an Objectivist
definition of knowledge to me, but that may be due to
my shallow understanding of understanding in
Objectivist terms.

------------
Last, but not least, ESTHETICS.

I'm not really comfortable with the notion of
romantic heroism, at least not with focusing on such
escapades, because, as LDC put it the other day: "The
myth of the small lone inventor coming up with a
unique and marvellous idea out of nothing in his
garage is fairy tale... A /true/ creative mind
honestly acknowledges that nothing is created in a
vacuum; every 'creation' is a synthesis of old ideas
from a thousand sources, and maybe one or two
randomly strewn new ones."

Gardner's page on this declares: "Thus the type of
art most consistent with man's nature is romantic
realism. This school emphasizes the fact that man is
a volitional being, capable of setting values and
striving to achieve them."

I, too, see no esthetic value in emphasizing despair
and negativity (I wonder: is "Crucifix in Urine" a
positive, negative or irrelevant artistic statement
to an atheist?); yet, striving *is* about overcoming
obstacles, and some of the most satisfying works of
'art', to me, are simply natural (and cultural)
scenes where decay and growth are juxtaposed.

The supposedly Balinese aphorism - "we have no art;
we do everything as beautifully as we can" - works
well for me.

------------
I wonder if the core of Objectivism could be
abbreviated to Reality, Reason & Romanticism?  John K
Clark doesn't like the magic number 3 (Extropians
debate with Tony Hollick a while back) but I always
seem to find myself thinking with triplex Peircean
logic :-)

Is this actually true, has anyone discovered a worm hole?  I think he 
is right.  Buy this I mean knowone has traveled through a black hole, 
therefor knowone knows what is inside of it (and do not say but we 
have sent satilights into them).
If a blackhole were actually a worm hole then it would travel to a 
parellel universe, a universe that is off of any of our current 
universal tracking.   So I belive it could verywell be possiable for 
a blackhole and a worm hole to be the same thing at times.

For arguments sake----You come out on the other side and discover 
that you "seem to be in the same place".  Then how wwould you look

"known physics"
You dont understand it?  It doesnt take physicist to understand.  Im saying
there is no limit to space.  The universe we see and the energy that is the
universe is a point compared to infinite space.  With quantum I'm referring to
the speed in which the limits are recognized, which is instantaneous, a
paradox cause there are no limits, but energy and light travels at the speed
of light, so its expanding.  Light is also connected quantumly so perhaps
there is much more beyond what we see as the end of the universe, which we
have not seen.  I think we used the hubble to look the farthest it can into a
very dark space and the picture came with tons more galaxies.  

Its just a thought, I wish people would play with ideas on here rather than
beat them down.

  IAN: Or, in other words, identity holism is 
  something that anyone who was under 12-years-
  old or who was Hara Ra could NOT understand,
  even after having several years to reflect!

  I realize that, like the fallacy of free energy,
  the fallacy of free identity stems from a limited
  comprehension of the phenomena under investiga-
  tion. The idea that energy is spontaneously 
  created out of nothing expresses a failure 
  to perceived that any energy in subset X 
  came from some other subset in not-X. 
 
  In the same way, any identity attribute 
  of subset X did not come from subset X
  but from some  other subset in not-X.
  With the identity matrix we can see
  how elementry this principle is:

                1  2  3
               _________
            1 | 0  1  2 |
              |         |
            2 |-1  0  1 |
              |         |
            3 |-2 -1  0 |
              -----------

  The column below each entity along the 
  top lists the identity attributes of that
  entity relative to the other entities. Note
  how each entity gains 0 identity from itself.
  All attributes of X are derived from not-X.
  Identity, just like energy, is conserved.

did anyone else just KNOW CALYK was going to repond harshly to that one? 
hehe, predictable i suppose.

Anyhow, lets say that space isnt expanding, rather it is "stretching" 
because of "waves", or probably more like "ripples" of force brought on 
by explosions in the universe;stars, supernovae, etc. it would be sort 
of like an ocean. there have been current studies to show the the 
universe is somewhat in a particular "shape" or "pattern", and if these 
explosions happened at a constant rate, which im sure they do, they 
would create the illusion that the universe is expanding on one side, 
the side closest to the majority of great stellar explosions, and 
shrinking on the other side, the side of least stellar explosions.there 
would be the constant wave or even spiral like shape of the universe 
possibly. there are theories that the universe is expanding, as well as 
some that say it is shrinking. the universe could be as constant as the 
energy suppply that lies in the universe, cannot be created or 
destroyed. that way its allows me to understand more what would be 
"outside" the limits of the universe, that is if you want to think of 
the universe as an egg out of its shell in the center of a large plate. 
or maybe we could go back to the age old idea that we wont just "drop 
off" at the edge of the universe, its actually geometrically more like a 
globe. im open to "thrashful" comments because opinions like these 
deserve some criticism so do give me some feedback.

Post-hoc comparisons have essentially no value for proving things; only for 
suggesting hypotheses to be test.  I speak from experience; I worked in
medical devices for 7 years doing statistics.  I've seen post-hoc results
in our studies as far out as 1 in 20,000 turn out to be completely bogus.
Post-hoc comparisons are most definitely a case where enough monkeys
will always produce something.

The energy needed is huge, but depends on mass. getting rid of the

I recall an article in Science News about 20 years ago.
at certain times of year in Kenya, fruits fall into
water holes, sink to the bottom, and ferment. The
elephants really do end up ingesting enough alcohol
to get drunk. Apparently, a drunk elephant is an
awsome sight. No, I'm not making this up.

The lesson is that somebody on this list will respond
to just about anything :-)

Secondary lesson: an ecology is a lot more complicated
than the simple sum of the information in the genomes
of the various species. This is the reason we need to
try to preserve ecosystems and not just genomes as we
ramp up to transhumanity.

UTOPIA is the parallel byte interface specified by the ATM forum

Conclusion 1: definitions are context-sensitive.
Conclusion 2: the electronics incustry is capable of finding
 a non-standard usage for every word in the dictionary.

This is my opinion. However, I realize that it is only one of a wide range
of possibilities. There are a whole bunch of interesting things for use to
consider, and in retrospect I feel that dispite my own admonishments to the
contrary I have focused in on a particular point within the space of possible
singularity initiators: I've picked the "single human" spot on the
"initiator size" axis, and the "instantaneous" point on the "rate" axis.
I've also picked the "single entity" on the "post-human population size"
axis. All of these choices are in my little paper, but none of them are
sufficiently explicit and I spend little time on explaining the alternatives.

I rejected the "zero humans" point on the initiator axis because think AI
(i.e., no human component of the SI) is harder to achieve than a collaboration.
I rejected the larger numbers of humans because I guess I thought a multi-
human collaborative component was harder than a single-human component, but
I'd now guess that this is a weaker argument. Now, I would still assign
a near-zero probablity to the pure AI and a large probability to an initiator
size of one human, but I think a small group (say a workgroup at a lab) is
possible, and a larger colloboration {say an internet mailing list :-) }
is also possible.

I picked the "instant" point on the rate axis for the reasons stated in the
paper. Of course, I started with Vernor Vinge's "singularity" as part
of the title of my paper, so I guess I'm biased. This choice is easy to
attack on all kinds of perfectly reasonable grounds, mostly because the
term "singluarity" isn't the correct mathematical/physical analogy. It's
better to use a phase change as the analogy: The liquid-to-solid transition
of a supercooled liguid when a seed crystal is added. The analogy is, I think,
clear: the raw available computing power on the internet represents the
supercooled liguid and some as-yet-undeveloped software represents the
crystal.

It might be nice if some of the participants from the prior round of the
">Web" discussions would add any new thought they may have had on this matter.

As to uploads: the SI may or may not choose to permit or compel uploads, and
may or may not choose to permit the continued existence of humans in any form.

Forwarded from another mailing list.  Synopsis: clouds affect Earth's thermal
budget; cosmic rays stimulate cloud formation; solar wind keeps cosmic rays
away; sunsports are correlated with solar wind; particle physicists actually
get to do something useful, in applying their cloud chamber experience.

   On a scale of scientific importance, Dr Henrik Svensmark and Dr Eigil
Friis- Christensen's research on cosmic rays and cloud formation may one day
rank as a world leader.
   Yet its origins were obscure and its initial impact negligible.  Pain-
stakingly assembled from weather satellite data and other astonomical
observations, the two Danish meterorologists' report was buried in a few
pages of the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics last year.
It made little impact at the time, but slowly the paper has acquired a cult
status among physicists.  And it may yet prove to be a scientific milestone.
   What Svensmark and Friis-Christensen discovered was simple: over the past
15 years they saw an exact correlation between levels of cosmic rays hitting
Earth and the proportion of the world's skies obscured by clouds.  The
effect may not seem profound: a typical 20% drop in cosmic ray levels
reduces cloud cover from 68 to 65%.  Nevertheless the impact for our planet
is considerable.
   "Clouds have a profound effect on Earth's radiation budget," says Dr
Jasper Kirkby of CERN, the international centre for particle physics
research at Geneva. "The more cloud cover there is, the cooler will be the
climate. Fewer clouds, and the planet will warm up."
   And our planet is warming up. Over the last 100 years global temperatures
have risen by about .5=B0 Celsius. It had been assumed that this was the
result of a steady rise in industrial activity - more and more factories,
cars and homes spewing out carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases,
trapping the sun's heat and warming the atmosphere.
   But there are inconsistencies in this simple picture. For example, global
temperatures fell slightly between 1945 and 1970, a fact that cannot be
explained by the steadily rising emissions over that period.
   Some scientists have continued to argue that other factors must be
involved. The importance of the work by Svensmark and Friis-Christensen is
that they have provided these doubters with a convincing alternative
candiate - cosmic rays.
   Our planet is bathed in cosmic rays, a heavenly rain of sub-atomic
particles that pour down upon us from deepest space.  Researchers believe
that the particles were probably spewed into the cosmos by exploding=
 supernovae.
   Cosmic rays trigger a cascade of other particles when they strike atoms
in the upper atmosphere, creating a background of natural radiation on
Earth.  This radiation would not be expected to fluctuate - were it not for
the sun. The sun pours out gusts of its own sub-atomic particles. We call
this the solar wind. It protects Earth from cosmic rays, sweeping them away
from our planet.
   In other words, when the solar wind is intense, fewer cosmic rays hit
Earth, cloud cover is reduced and temperatures rise.  And there is
compelling evidence to support this idea because there is an easy way to
tell when the solar wind is strong. Just count sunspots. The more there are,
the stronger the solar wind.
   Claims of a link between sunspots and the weather are not new, of course.
The great astonomer William Herschel noticed that the price of wheat in 18th
century England was lower when there were many sunspots and the weather was
warm. In the second half of the 17th century, when sunspots almost
disappeared, the Earth went through a miniature ice age.
   Crucially scientists have discovered that sunspot activity has been
changing radically over the past century. The solar winds have become
stronger and stronger.
   The only link that has yet to be established is the mechanism by which
cosmic rays influence cloud formation.  This is why Kirby and Dr Frank
Close, another British physicist, have proposed building a cloud detector at
CERN.
   This machine would recreate Earth's atmosphere. A chamer containing the
gases, water vapour and aerosol particles found in our atmosphere would be
battered with sub-atomic particles from one of CERN's accelerators to reveal
the exact mechanism that links sunspot activity with atmospheric heating.
   In this way, the expertise of the world's leading particle physicists
would be brought to bear on a critical environmental issue.
   If they succeed in establishing a link, a major environmental shibboleth
- that mankind is responsible for the rise in global temperatures - will be
destroyed, with profound political implications.  Fear that continued
industrial development urgently sought by the developing world, might have
devastating consequences could then be discounted, although other valid
concerns about acid rain and ozone depletion would remain.

Of course.  Do you see drool on my lip?  :)

The difficulty with the most detailed natural psi experiments such as Lotto
is, as I mentioned, that the owners of the data are usually unwilling to
disgorge it more than once. But my work so far has set severe upper limits
on any population incidence of psi (which might, of course, turn out to be
zilch).

BTW, Dr Radin (whose book I cited several times) was given the boot from
University of Las Vegas, and his research centre closed down, on dubious
grounds last year.  His side of the story can be sampled at

 www.psiresearch.org/crlthes.htm

Further to my critical remarks about the tacky and misleading cover/title
of his book, this exchange:

ME:

RADIN:
< Yes, I know.  I had to make lots of strategic decisions about how to
present odds.  I figured that while p = .01 is not exactly the same as odds
of 100 to 1, it was close enough for the expected audience, and for any
practical purposes in my exposition.  But I'll add a footnote about this on
the next edition for the purists.  BTW, the title and the jacket cover were
not my choice.  I was quite angry about the cover in particular. You can
probably tell this was the marketing folks' idea of what I was writing about.>

Hi Chuck,

Maybe this can help:
An expanding universe has no point of
reference with which to measure its
expansion, that much seems apparent.
Now, try this tiny experiment. Imagine
that some force (a heavy press of some
kind) pushes down upon your body. As the
pressure increases, you feel (if you
approximate human existence) some
discomfort. Increasing pressure elicits
increasing discomfort to you.

Now, pressure does not necessarily
equate to discomfort as a general
universal law of existence.
Nevertheless, you may see the connection
in the experiment above. Likewise, an
expanding universe has no way of
measuring its own expansion, except as a
measure of its relative size compared to
earlier versions of itself.

It makes me happy to think that this may
offer some entertainment, if not
clarification.

Cheers,

J R

"our brains"? What ephemeral ghosts the
owners of brains consider themselves!
What fools we think ourselves -- that
our recalictrant brains can trick us so!
What dastardly dissembling, to delude
these ghosts (that means "us") to
believe that we might carry on -- after
our dear brains have fed voracious worms
or flames.

But wait! Might not the pulsing brain
itself inquire... Does this uncanny
believer-in-souls harbor some doubt
about the power of the rubbery/gooey
mass inside the cranium walls?

Every believer has a beginning and an
end. Brain matter, and the life that
makes it, neither begins nor ends. It
rather self-organizes ceaselessly
against entropy. It exults in the
ecstatic growth that infuses extropy.
Ah, this!

Well, if it did, then earthworms would

had. Hmmmm....   Einstein's dying wish
to have lived as a "plumber" makes all
the more sense now.

If you believe that an unlimited ability

then you might have forgotten death. No

I always pictured the universe as a (insert dimmensionality from 4 to 
23, depending on the cosmological flavour of the moment) hyper^n sphere 
expanding into a hyper^n+1 dimensional hyper^n+1 volume, and so on and 
so on and so on, all within a tiny insignificant hyper^-1 corner of an 
infinite dimensional Hilbert Space.

Why shun infinite regress? Go for the gusto! :)

As pictures of the universe go, yours
looks as compelling as the next.
Nietzsche's picture of "eternal
recurrence" precedes your question about
infinite regress by a century. But what
does time matter to a hyper-dimensional
volume, as long as the Net has enough
bandwidth to catch these fallen stars?

Sure. But in my opinion there is far too much play with fun ideas now

Check the positions of the stars or other nearby referents to see if
they have changed?

But really, the wormhole geometries I know of wouldn't allow both ends
to remain in the same place, they would simply merge and likely turn
into a boring black hole.

One problem with simplistic space expansion models is that space may be
infinite.  In the simplest models from general relativity, if the density
of the universe is so small that it will expand forever and not contract,
that also implies that the universe, although curved, does not "close"
and so goes on forever.

You can still have an expanding universe even if it is spatially infinite.
It just means that distant objects move apart, slowly at first, and then
faster and faster.

Suppose space were not expanding.  It is three dimensional, obviously
(ignoring the "time dimension").  Would you demand that there exist a
four dimensional space in which the three dimensional one was embedded,
in order to give it reality?  And would that four dimensional space have
to be part of a larger five dimensional space, which is itself part of
a six dimensional one, and so on?

All this is conceivable, but is it really necessary?  I don't think we need
to assume there are higher dimensional spaces in order to give ours
reality.

Even though our space is said to be "curved", and expanding, those
properties do not require higher dimensional spaces, either.  Curvature is
like a gradual internal warping of space, so that large enough triangles
don't have angles that add to exactly 180 degrees.  It can be fully
described without reference to any larger embedding space.

Likewise the expansion of space can be expressed soley in terms of the
relations between objects within our universe.  There is no need to
postulate a higher dimensional universe which ours is part of.

Are your results consistent with the research you mentioned recently
which aggregated data from multiple studies?  Presumably they found some
incidence of successful information transfer.  Was your sample set large
enough that you can would have seen an effect if that same level of psi
were present in your lottery participants?

While I agree with you about that human-computer collaborations are
the most likely path towards SI, I'm not entirely sure about the
supercooled liquid analogy. 

Overall I am very sceptical of all claims that a single breakthrough
will produce a sudden singularity-like bootstrapping process that
leaves everybody but the initiator in the dust. There have been no
such events in the past, and even if we discuss intelligence
amplification techniques (which we so far have not had much experience
with) it is not clear that a given IA invention will make it much
easier to make even stronger IA devices.

And even if the device helps you make better such devices it might
turn out that this is limited by other constraints; for example the
human-software design system might quickly bootstrap to a level where
the user interface becomes the bottleneck, and further expansion
requires intelligence amplification in the service of the
human-computer interaction field instead. Most technologies seem to be
dependent on other technologies to reach their true potential, and
improving these might require even more work further afield.

It seems to me that a reall SI bootstraping process requires a width
of knowledge and skill that is not available in a small
group. Remember the car analogy: there is no single human able to
build a car from scratch, since that process involves mining
technology, refining, aerodynamics, metalworking, semiconductor design
and engineering, electronics, chemistry... and so on - but the
industrial web contains enough knowledge distributed between thousands
of people to do it. To make a true SI, we might need software
engineering, HCI, hardware design, economics, theory of complex
systems, psychology, neuroscience, nanotechnology and Turing knows
what else. And we might need a lot of it, not just a single expert for
every field hired by the would-be-SI team, but a whole community
testing out different solutions and working in parallel. 

With IA technologies and an emerging >Web, this could become a
historically very fast process, but it would likely still take a few
years (practical physical delays in building new hardware, costly
mistakes, the problem that people tend to sleep 1/3 of the time
etc). I don't buy the idea that a single technology will bootstrap its
lone inventor to godhood the day after he discovers it (makes a great
sf story though; I recall writing something like that in the third
grade, where a group of children bootstrap themselves to world
domination in roughly the >Web way), but that doesn't mean I don't
think the >Web concept has merit. Seen from a distance in time and
space, it might very well look like a small fraction of humanity
transcends almost immediately, but close up it will be a wide movement
involving plenty of people (definitely more than a few thousand) and
work.


Perhaps a better discussion would be how we *practically* immanentize
the transcension? :-)

The first genetic marker has been found for a gene that has a weak but 
statistically real effect on IQ. Robert Plomin of the London Institute Of  
Psychiatry reported the results of his 5 year study in the May 1998 issue of  
the journal "Psychological Science". Plomin studied the genes of 204 children, 
none were retarded and 51 of the kids had an IQ of 160 or higher. He found
there was a relationship between high IQ and a marker on chromosome 6 called 
IGF2R. Plomin said that there must be a gene very close to this marker on 
the DNA and it would account for 2% of the variation in IQ found in the 
population. Having this gene would be worth about 4 IQ points to you. 
Plomin noted the extremely rapid rate new genes are being discovered and
expressed confidence that more discoveries of this sort that deal with 
complex traits will be made in the near future.

It's been a loooong time since I exercised my astrophysical neurons, and
this seems as good a time as any...

Correct me if I'm wrong, doesn't the rate of change of the Hubble
constant indicate a limit (i.e., the speed of light) at a distance of
something like 15 billion light years?  If the universe were larger than
that, anything beyond this point would have to be receding faster than
light, in apparent contradiction with relativity.

Also, I think the contraction and closure you're referring to are two
different things.  A low-density universe may forever continue to expand
and yet have a finite area.

At the macroscopic level of reality, four dimensions seem to provide the
most useful model of spacetime.  I don't see why four dimensions
necessarily implies five or six.

The "internal warping of space" you describe seems isomorphic to a
four-dimensional spacetime, although the 4-D model provides (to me at
least) an easier to understand picture of things.  Whether of not there
really "is" a fourth dimension doesn't seem particularly important
unless we're doing time travel.  4-D models would probably be the most
useful if one were conducting large-scale engineering projects where an
understanding of the spacetime topology were important, however.

Journal of Hypertension 7(suppl 6): S244-S245 1989

"Atherosclerotic Cholesterol Ester Deposition is Markedly Reduced With a
High-Potassium Diet"

Abstract:

  In a normal rat on a normal diet, no cholesterol esters are detected in
the aorta by gas chromatography. Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive
rats (SHR) were fed for 3 months a basic diet containing 4% cholesterol,
14% coconut oil and 7% NaCl. One group of 13 rats ingested a normal (0.5%)
level of potassium in the diet. Another group of 10 rats ingested a high
(2.1%) potassium level. Mean intra-arterial blood pressures averaged 165
mmHg in the normal-potassium group and 161 mmHg in the high-potassium
group. Serum cholesterol levels averaged 229 mg/dl in the normal-potassium
group and 214 mg/dl in the high-potassium group. Total aortic cholesterol
esters per rat involving 16- and 18-carbon chain fatty acids averaged 187
microgram in normal-potassium versus 68 microgram in high-potassium rats.
These were the main esters; other esters were negligible. Thus, the
high-potassium diet reduced cholesterol ester deposits by 64% (p<0.0003),
even though blood pressures and cholesterol levels were quite similar in
the two groups. Both high cholesterol and high blood pressure injure
endothelial cells and increase the invasion of macrophages and vascular
smooth musccle cells into the intima; they also increase endothelial
permeability to proteins. With high plasma cholesterol levels, these
processes lead to atherosclerosis with choleseterol eester deposition. The
high-potassium diet, by protecting endothelial cells, can greatly decrease
this cholesterol ester deposition. This effect could be useful for
preventing heart attacks and sudden coronary death in human hypertension.

end abstract

Additional note:

   A 0.5% diet works out to about 3 grams of potassium for a human
consuming 2500 calories of rat chow. This a little above the average
potassium intake by Americans. A 2.1% diet works out to roughly 12 grams,
which is typical of stone-age human diets.

This isn't as exciting as it sounds, unfortunately. The gene codes for
an immune protein, and there are a few other intelligence-related
genes I have heard about which are also immune-linked. Partially this
is because they are easy to test for, but I think there is a fairly
easy explanation for the immune-IQ correlation: if you have a strong
immune system, you have more time and energy in school (or elsewhere)
where your brain will be trained.

Still, it is promising. It is when we start to find brain proteins
linked with intelligence we should really start to cheer!

You must be thinking of something else, this was just reported and as far as 
I know nobody knows what the gene codes for, in fact nobody has even found 
the gene, Plomin found a marker that must be near the gene, the marker itself 
is just a bit of nonfunctional junk DNA

If you're talking about children who do poorly in school maybe, although 
history is full of sickly geniuses, in this case however we're talking about 
children who's IQ range from a normal 100 to an unusual 160 and above. 
I don't see how lack of sickness can explain that, I think they're on to 
something.

Yes, it "may be." The task for
extropians comes down to this: grow up
and find out. Space may also exist as a
finite, yet unbounded quality, as
Einstein suggested. Then again, space
may succumb to the manipulative designs
of super-intelligent transhumans. We
might have the capability to know these
things if we expand our cognitive
skills.

If it doesn't go on forever, then

I take back everything I've said. This
clears it all up, and I'll never try to
divulge this information to anyone else,
because it suddenly occurs to me that
all my attempts to convey any idea about

appear to those who really do understand

Do you suppose that "wide movement" will

I'm sorry for the misunderstanding on this, but this is just a short
dinner, the kind of gathering we DC transhumanists try to have every
couple of months.  Unless you want to put in some time in DC for
other reasons, it might not be worth the travel time!  I've gotten
several emails from people in mighty far parts, and that makes me
wonder if perhaps we shouldn't think about an east-coast gathering of
some kind.

Kathryn

Not quite - largely (I think) because the conditions are not at all alike.
A truly huge amount of lottery guessing, as I mentioned, is stereotyped and
repetitive (not only selection of birthdays, but blatant patterning such as
filling in vertical, horizontal,or slanted lines of numbers, and crosses).
While there is also a tendency for that kind of routinisation to occur in,
say, ganzfeld or free response psi experiments, those formats are far more
open to novelty.  A standardised lotto form provides a ready-made template
for locking in die-stamped responses.

>Presumably they found some
>incidence of successful information transfer.  

Indeed.  This is all in the literature.  Dean Radin's book, despite its
simplifications and a certain broad church inclusiveness that worries me,
offers good, brief outlines of the main findings, with endnotes leading to
the original papers.  Of course, even university libraries tend not to hold
the Journal of Parapsychology, Journal of Scientific Exploration, and other
peer-reviewed outlets.

>Was your sample set large

>were present in your lottery participants?

Yes and no.  On the one hand, a pool of getting on for a thousand million
guesses looks likely to be contaminated by psi effects, even against the
constraints of patterned biases.  On the other hand, these were chunked
into only 20 draws.  I'd like to see a couple of year's worth of draws
normalised and compared.

Its been a while since we've discussed concrete scenarios of technological,
economic, social and political development.  The last couple of years have
brought some dramatic news items on the technological front, and also perhaps
some continuing confirmation of trends that have been operating for some time.
These developments and continuing trends may have shaped or changed our views
of the near term.

I'm curious about list members' views of probable and possible developments
over the next twenty years and think a more or less focused discussion might
be enlightening.  I'd like to start a thread here for discussion of specific
trends and developments and their impact on daily life and the "big picture",
with special emphasis on matters of interest to transhumans and extropians.
I'd like to solicit specific predictions for the 20 years beginning in 2000,
perhaps in 5-year increments. I'm particularly interested in folks that may
have a specialist's insight into particular technologies or social phenomena,
but would also like to solicit general discussion of interaction of specific
developments and general trends.  With that introduction, I offer the
following outline as a framework for discussion (I'm sure I've left out some
key technology or social issue . . .):

The May issue of the American Journal of Human Genetics contains two
articles that pertain to aging at the cellular level. One reviews
genetic strategies to study it, and the other offers more support for
the theory that programmed cell senescence results in the
manifestations of aging.

GENETIC FACTORS IN HUMAN AGING

'Causes, Effects and Constraints in the Genetics of Human
Longevity', by Francois Schachter of the Laboratory of Human
Immunogenetics, Pasteur Institute, Paris (page 1008)

Schachter uses a five-level biological heirarchy (Finch and Rose,
1995) to examine various genetic factors in human aging. Schachter
opens by noting that Jeanne Calment (oldest known humanand recently
deceased at the age of 123) was descended from agenetic lineage that
contained a disproportionate number of familymembers who lived beyond
the age of 80.  Due to the aggregatenature of the longevity trait,
however, he sees little utility in pursuing strategies that would
increase the occurrence of this trait.  Nor has the recent increase
in the mean human MLS (maximum life span) resulted in an increase of
the actual MLS, which has continued to hover at ~120.  In the next
few sections of thearticle, Schachter makes the case for rejection of
attempting to regulate or propogate longevity as a trait: 'The four
genes so far implicated in longevity, APOE, ACE, HLA-DR, and PAI-1,
share common features:  (1) they have an impact on intermediary
traits, such as plasma levels of a homeostatic protein or immune
response, and (2) they display gene-environment interactions in
normal adult populations. . . these genes appear to affect longevity
by modulating an individual's responses to life-threatening
disorders, not by regulating MLS as an intrinsic physiological
trait.'  

After a section on CA (compensatory adaptation) and on chronobiology,
Schachter moves on to the human genome and our murky understanding of
its role in longevity.  He suggests the potential utility o f
X-chromosomal loci as a testing ground for models of DNA damage in
cellular aging:  'the X chromosome is at the same time protected in
the germ line and critically vulnerable in the soma. . .'  He cites a
study that indicates a significant drop in the lifespan of daughters
born of elderly fathers compared to sons born of the same fathers.  


REPLECATIVE CELL SENESCENCE AND MORTALITY FACTORS

'The Genetics of Cullular Senescence' by Nathalie G. Berube, James R. 
Smith, and Olivia M. Pereira-Smith of the Huffington Center on Aging, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston (page 1015).

The authors conclude that identification of the genes involved in
regulating programmatic replicative cell senescence could lead to
greater understanding of the aging process and strategies to manage
it.   
Comments from John Ashkenas, editor:  'Do our bodies age as
iron rusts-passively, with the accumulation of damage due to
external insults?  Or, are the physiological changes of aging better
conceived as an intrinsic development process, similar to those of
our early histories?  Berube, et al, review the recent evidence from
cell-culture studies in favor of the latter model.  As Berube et al.
demonstrate, cells must continue to express several mortality
factors if they are to retain their normal capacity to senescence,
that is, to stop proliferating after a characteristic number of
divisions .  The accumulation of sensescent cells in various tissues
may explain many of the conspicuous features of aging.'

I don't understand why you did this. If people pick birthday numbers then 
they must have had a hunch that these numbers will win, in general their 
hunch was wrong but I'll bet many, perhaps most, who picked birthday numbers 
and won are convinced there is some sort of mystical connection. I don't 
think it's justified to throw out a hunch because its illogical, it's no more
illogical than a hunch that a non birthday number will win.

It seems that no matter how large the study is this is where psi is always 
hiding, at a few very rare events at the very extreme of the statistical 
distribution, and it is here where it's the most dangerous to make far 
reaching conclusions because error is so easy to make.

If it's difficult to predict the winning lottery number that are determined 
by only 6 simple events then how can it predict earthquakes , the rise and 
fall of empires, the weather, and the stock market, they're caused by a lot 
more than 6 simple events.

In the USA you can win about 10$ if you guess 3 out of the 6 numbers in any  
order, the number of these small winners is in the millions and the number is 
just what you'd expect if the psi effect was zero.

My basic problem with ESP is that we could be having this same conversation a 
100 years ago, and in fact people did. I don't demand that the psi effect be 
explained, I just want it proven to exist, and after a century of trying to 
do this the progress has been precisely zilch, the evidence stunk then and it 
stinks now. I think it's time to move on to more promising areas of 
exploration.

Haven't checked it out yet.  So what follows is based on my

I question his "no independent validity" though I think I

If you accept that things which interact must because
they interact be somehow independent -- otherwise,
they would not need to interact; they'd be part of the
same whole -- then things come before sensations of
things.  Theories are a different story.  They would not
be independent on this model but based upon things,
albeit indirectly through experience of things.

This does not make them less valid -- any more so than my
inability to observe the idea of "color" -- I can only see
the various things which have particular colors, such
as the light green of my copy of _Independent Review_
sitting on my bed -- makes it an invalid idea.

The conclusion made about nonhuman animals, though
sound to me, sounds like a leap.  I've read of studies,
such as _How Monkeys See the World_, which might
be interpreted as some species of monkeys having
a rudimentary (if very limited) ability to form concepts.

As for the Northern botanist you posit, she might form a
concept of "tree" based solely on evergreens, then
form another concept, let's say "abu," that corresponds
to our "deciduous tree," then come to see "tree" and
"abu" share lots of important similarities that "tree" and
"grass" (or "abu" and "fern") don't share and form
another concept "blok" that subsumes both.

The problem here is that concepts need not always be
formed the same way.  Given different contexts, different
sets of concepts apply.  It's been reported that Inuits
have many words for snow and ice, moreso than the
short list I've learned living in the USA.  Does that mean
that the Inuit concepts clash with mine?  Hardly.  It
merely means that they live in a place where such
differentiations are more important than they are in
mine.  (If I'm lucky, I see snow and ice about three
months out the year.)  This does not expose any fatal
flaws for Objectivist epistemology -- any more than it
would for any other flavor of epistemology.

Well, epistemology can be approached as a perscriptive
or a descriptive discipline.  As the former, it would offer
rules of evidence and justification to arrive at knowledge.
For the latter, we have to recognize that people arrived
at knowledge long before they starting inquiring into the
proper means.

Or hydroponics?:)  Such seeming contradictions should
not be hard on a robust epistemology, especially one
which seeks to understand the universe -- as opposed to
fit it into a preconceived scheme.

I've only read a bit of Peirce and found him, on the whole,
quite agreeable.  I'll have to look into this.

There does seem to be a difference, though, between
a control system in general and a living system.  The
living one, after all, evolved in such a way that it's
self-control furthers its existence.  For example, a
plant's ability to turn its leaves to the light helps it to
live, while my car's cruise control's ability to keep the
car going at a steady speed does not.  The latter's
existence is indifferent to whether it achieves its goal
or not.  The former's existence depends on it.

I think a big part of being alive has to do with one's
actions having an impact on living.  Surely, an
organism whose actions did not affect its ability to
survive would be unlike any organism we know of.

>Powers' conclusion here, I think, is worth quoting:

Well, to split hair here, we can distinguish between things
a bit different.  Control systems designed by humans seem
to be designed for a specific conscious purpose.  This is
a bit different from the conscious purpose of individual
humans, such as one's mission to the refrigerator duing
commercial break.  Both of these are different from the
type of behavior exhibited by the plant turning its leaves
to the sun.

Since life only exists in individuals and only individuals
can value, I see not problem.  The furthering of one life
might involve the taking of another -- such as when I eat
plants (I'm now vegan:).  The plants do not continue to live,
you know?  Or when someone shoots someone else in
self-defense.

I think intellectual property is a tough issue for any
system of rights -- whether Rand's, Locke's, Kant's
or whomever's.  While we might recite the pros and
cons here, I have doubts about solving the problem.:/

It's true that Rand and other Objectivists (e.g., Larry
Sechrest) have been critical of much of Hayek, I
think some of the latter's ideas are compatible with
[some variants of] Objectivism.  E.g., I know much
more about my condition than anyone in Washington,
D.C.  This doesn't mean I'm always right about me,
but given the constant failures of intervention in
people's lives, I think it does show, I would be and
am right more often than not.  (I also have an interest
in being right, moreso than anyone else, right?  No
pun intended!:)

I think LDC is making a caricature.  Lone inventors
do come up with great ideas, and, of course, they
do not exist on desert islands with no influence form
other people.  This does not marr their achievement.
Thomas Edison benefited greatly from living in a
society that not only rewarded his inventiveness
but had a culture of percolating ideas.  Surely, he
stood on the shoulders of others, but he still created
many great things -- some of which, I'm sure, would
have taken decades or longer to invent without him.

I don't know.  I do have many disagreements with
this line.  See my "Interesting Parallels: Kenyon Cox
and Ayn Rand on Art," "Architecture: The Missing
Art Form," and "Toward and Esthetics of Horror"
for an elaboration of these.  They are at:

        http://www.mcs.net/~tshell/ust/homepage.htm

Also, I believe the Romantic Realism as exists today
tend to be too formulaic.  Artistic movements typically
start long before their manifestoes are published.  This
does not mean all Objectivist ranting on the subject is
worthless, just that it's a bit early to see if a true
movement has come about.  I tend to think that art
is shifting in that direction, but less because of Rand
and her cohorts and more because Modern and Post-
Modern Art are becoming more and more pace.

That can be pleasing.  There is a difference too between
esthetics as a branch of philosophy and one's reaction
to particular works of art.  The former is a reasoned study
of art, its origins, its effects, etc.  The latter is a highly
personal thing.  I find myself drawn to things or repulsed
by them in ways I cannot always explain.  Does this means
esthetics is useless?  Hardly, but one should not think of
it as a means of remolding one's tastes overnight.

(I do think some remolding is in order sometimes, though
this is a matter for much debate.  I think art does have a
major role in self-betterment and self-perfection -- much
as it seems Natasha Vita More agree.  What do you
think, Natasha?:)

Being unfamiliar with the Balinese, their culture and the

Well, the original abbrevation is a bit too much also.  I
think it might be a good starting point, but Objectivism
is controversial on so many points, it's best to keep in
mind that the distillation leaves a lot out.

No argument from me on that preference.  No doubt,
it helps to always seek something extra -- as opposed
being bogged down in a system which misses some
important aspects of reality.

I've stopped giving such precise citations because oftentimes people

If the above is true then it logically follows that if I know I exist then I 
do exist.  I know I exist.

Descartes wrote the most famous phrase in philosophy "I think therefore I am"  
and it's famous for good reason, it's true. Some have criticized him and 
insisted that it should be "I think therefore thoughts exist", but Descartes

[SNIPPED a cogent discussion from Anders, supporting his view that

I nave now stated the 1998 version of the "spike",(the "instantaneous"
scenario) and Anders has restated the "swell" (historically-rapid-but-not-instant
scenario.) Anders' preferred spot in the scenario space is:
--transition initiation team size: a large subset of the research community,
 or perhaps society as a whole.
--transition time: "historically rapid" (a decade?)
--post-transition SI population: large(?)

This is in contrast to the "spike":
--transition initiation team size: 1 human, or at most a few.
--transition time: days or weeks
--post-transition SI population: single (perhaps incorporating humans
  and/or transhumans with apparent autonomy)

It may be useful to try to agree on the essence of the difference,
and perhaps on our points of agreement also. I think the essence
of the difference centers on the nature of intelligence
augmentation (IA).

The "spike" assumes that a human-computer collaboration can yield
an effective intelligence amplification without first solving
other hard problems in the many fields of knowledge related to
intelligence. The spike further assumes that the resulting augmented
intelligence can further improve itself by identifying and relieving
its constraints, perhaps by solving some of those hard problems.
In my paper on the subject, I focus on rapid augmentation of the
computer capacity available to the collaboration.

By contrast, the "swell" argues that the problems are in fact hard
and that many of them must be solved before IA can occur. Perhaps
solving a human-computer interface problem can yield a modest IA,
but this is not sufficient to rapidly solve the next problem: you'll
still need a lab full of human specialists for each problem. I will not
generally be possible for a group of (say) human interface specialists
to discover an IA technique based on a new human interface and then
apply the IA to discover another IA technique in another field (say
computer networking.) Instead, the human interface IA technique will
be diseminated, and a computer networking group will apply it.
Anders, please correct this if it's wrong. 

Thus, IMO the central difference is that the "spike" assumes the
discovery of an IA technique that boosts intelligence enough so
that the resulting augmented intelligence can rapidly discover another
such technique. The "swell" assumes that no such event will occur, and
each IA discovery is non-singularity event: it is either incremental,
or it requires a large external resource input, or it is otherwise
rate-constrained.

The "swell" hypothesis has history on its side: we have in fact
discovered IA techniques in the past, (notably moveable type, the
computer, the GUI) and none of them resulted in a "spike". The
"spike" proponents believe that history cannot be a guide here:
the "spike" can only happen once.

Newcomers who are interested in this may wish to read Damien's
book "The Spike." You'll have to mail-order it from Australia,
but that's what the web is for, isn't it?

The best I can do is to try to keep up with new advances in relevant
technical fields. For me, the most relevant fields are data communications,
computer architecture, distributed computing, human/computer interfaces,
nanotechnology, information storage and retrieval, and software development
tools. I'm very aware that others of us use radically different lists,
but IMO that's good. You can be in my SI if I can be in yours :-)

Of course, if you know, then you do exist...  but my question was asking

Yes, and this is the crux of my problem.  "How do you know that you think?"
is another way of asking "how do you know that you exist?"

"Cognito ergo sum" uses "cognito" as its underlying premise.  If I exist, I
would certainly agree that I do think.  If I exist, I am thoughts.  But how
is it that this proof simply glosses over the question of whether a person
actually thinks, and therefore whether a person actually exists?

This assumes that you directly experience you own existence, a premise
which I would certainly agree with, IF you exist.  However, since it was
the individual's existence which we set out to prove in the first place,
this logic seems circular.  So I don't really feel like this has answered
my question.  How do you know that you have direct unmediated experience of
your own existence?

Wouldn't it be more logically sound to simply accept the individual's
existence as the premise for further proofs?  That is, rather than claiming
that the individual's existence is true beyond logic, claiming that it is
an axiom, like so many others, that we leave unproven?

Hmm, I thought I had some references handy here, since I attended a
seminar on this subject at Stockholm University a coupe of weeks
back. I seem to have misplaced my notes somewhere, but I recall that
the study they reviewed involved immune-linked genes. I'll get back on
this.

If you have a good health (or just the right kind of health that
leaves your brain functional even if your body is sick), the brain
might get more nutrients and be able to develop better. But there
might be other factors too, a wild hypothesis might be that some of
these genes create very useful wiring structures that others lack or
have to build by experience.

A good summary. I indeed believe in a large SI population,
although I hold open the possibility of borganisms and functional
soups.

Sounds about right again. 

In some sense the spike scenario assumes that IA can improve general
intelligence and that it can fairly quickly gain the skills needed to
apply it to new areas. The swell scenario assumes IA methods mainly
amplify specific intelligence or skills rather than general
intelligence (even if the method is applicable to most of them).

Exactly. There can of course be cascades of discoveries, but in the
end they run into constraints. After all, how easy is it to learn a
whole new field (like nanotech) in order to get around a hardware
problem? It might be quicker to involve a team of already educated
nanotechnologists and give them access to IA (which hopefully is easy
to use, one problem might be that IA becomes so personalized over time
that one cannot simply give away one's interface to another, but the
person needs to "grow into" it over some time).

Yes. The spike is supported by the idea that IA techniques of this
capacity as we now assume have not occured in the past.

It's a deal! :-)

My list includes yours, with cognitive psychology, neuroscience and

Most likely it will be a question of who downloads the software and
gets onto the train before it leaves the station. Imagine that the IA
revolution is turning a sizeable part of the research community into
more and more efficient people. The software and tools are out there,
but most people will likely not just get it or wring their hands
instead of doing something useful (despite helpful advice from the
extrosattvas). Some will grab it and amplify themselves, trying to
bootstrap themselves to the level where they can participate or at
least keep up. There won't be a "transcension board" reviewing
applications, rather a question of if you adopt the new tools and can
use them. 

Fair or not, it doesn't really matter. The point is, whatever the form
this kind of development takes, it will likely roll on because the
people involved in it will push on and they will be getting better at
it. So the important questions are if this is possible at all, and how
we can act in order to make it conform a little bit better with our
own values.

We know empirically that in such tasks people mostly select numbers on the
basis of simple algorithms that have nothing to do with `hunches' - the
`lucky' numbers in their astrological charts, the days of the month of
their kids' or other loved ones' birthdays, etc.  This creates a composite
background profile of preferences that is staggeringly stable from week to
week (it varies a little when there's a jackpot draw that either brings in
some fresh blood or encourges regulars to buy extra tickets and vary their
chosen picks).   Perhaps the most intriguing finding in my study is that
people by and large *can't* be following evanescent `hunches', because
their behaviour is so rote.  People might be prey to magical thinking, but
evidently this take the form of a kind of blurry background metaphysics
rather than an intentional effort to change or perceive the world by
psychic means - at least in lotteries.

(1) a catastrophic earthquake, or bad weather for the picnic, or a market
slump, are each encodable as just one bit of data. 

(2) I don't recall offering to predict the rise and fall of any empires
other than the Galactic Empire.  :)

(3) You could in principle precognise the winning lottery numbers as a
single string of 12 decimal numbers, or perhaps as a strikingly mnemonic
graphic pattern on the entry form, but surely it makes best sense to
imagine that psi (if it exists) has to modify each discrete choice as it's
ticked or crossed off on the form.  

The sense I have of psi's functioning, from reports of lab work, is that
it's akin to looking up at a blackboard that might be illuminated
stochastically for half a second every minute.  If you happen to be looking
when the winning number is posted, your behaviour can be shifted; otherwise
you're in the dark with everyone else, making guesses based on internal
pseudo-random algorithms (which are notoriously biased and repetitive).

Good point.  But how do you know the outcomes are random?  They can't
possibly *look* random on any short timescale, for the reasons I've given -
collective preferences must mean that in draws where popular numbers happen
to be targets, many more winners will be generated than by pure chance
expectation, and the reverse when mostly unpopular numbers come up.  And
the effects we're looking for are probably marginal at best, because if
they were not we'd be running our communications systems on psi rather than
EM.

As Radin points out, this is the expression of a skepticism uninformed by
current evidence (from the last two decades, say).  John, I believe you
mentioned that you've never heard of PEAR, one of the major
academically-affiliated anomalies research programs in the world.  Even Dr
Ray Hyman, prime CSICOP debunker, admits that the latest batches of
ganzfeld studies show that *something* unexplained in afoot.  He doesn't
think it can be psi, because he argues that psi as classically propounded
is inconsistent with QT, relativity, etc.  (Nobel physics laureate Brian
Josephson disagrees with him, as it happens.)  But he doesn't know what
*is* happening to cause these repeatable, non-null-hypothesis effects.  

If you're gonna diss the field, bro, you gotta get out there and dip your
toe in the murky water.

In case anyone is interested in chasing up some of the details from the
comfort and security of their own notepad, here are some urls:

Fiona Steinkamp, at the Koestler Parapsychology unit at Edinburgh
University, has links at

http://www.ed.ac.uk/~ejua35/parapsy.htm

>From there you can try

http://www.ed.ac.uk/~ejua35/for.htm#articles

starting, perhaps, with Bem and Honorton's paper, the discussion following
it, and Jessica Utts' and Ray Hyman's assessments for the US Govt of the
official and long-hidden `Stargate' psi program.  And see also Utts' piece
on meta-analysis from *Statistical Science*.

Here's Utts' homepage:

http://www-stat.ucdavis.edu/users/utts/

And despite the occasional squishiness of THE CONSCIOUS UNIVERSE, I still
recommend a quick look (if only in the bookstore) at Dean Radin's summary
charts.

Thanks for the nod, Dan.  But I'm a bit worried about the way you've
adapted my term `spike'.  Really I just meant it as an quick and
media-memorable synonym for Vinge's `Technological Singularity'.  While
both he and you certainly expect a drastic rupture to happen very swiftly,
I think the key postulate is just that exponential change creates a wall or
horizon beyond which we cannot see or even usefully speculate.  I don't
myself think this rupture will happen literally overnight, or even within a
year (but who can know in advance?).  Like all horizons, the Spike will
recede as we approach it.  From here, it looks like a looming wall - we
can't see if it's swelling or jutting straight up out of the ground. Either
way, it will change everything for ever.  I hope I can hold my poor
decaying body together long enough for the swell to carry me up the spike.

BTW (plug time), people can order THE SPIKE from

More work with neural nets made to do more and more useful things.  Nobody
passes the Turing test.  More progress in artificial neurons; finer muscle
control available.  Still exhausting.  Several treatments for Alzheimers,
none of which seem close to a cure, all of which seem to help ease the
symptoms somewhat.

>Genetic Science and Technology:

Genome project still coming along nicely.  No human clones anywhere, as far
as the public is aware.  Some private testing still going on, but not
making much progress, and it is increasingly difficult to find scientists
who will help, not so much because of the worldwide ban, but because of the
100% failure rate.  Progress is still being made, but cloning supporters
must fight for every step.

>General Medicine:

A highly invasive and extremely painful treatment for AIDS becomes
available, involving treating the bone marrow in all of the major bones
individually.  Most AIDS patients don't consider it worth the pain, or the
expense.

Improved artery treatments; no cures on the horizon.

Angiostatin-endostatin work, but nowhere near as well as they did for mice.
 Submitted for FDA approval as a less invasive treatment, but not a
replacement for other mechanisms.  Research in the direction of treating
cancer by starving its blood supply increases.

Cryonics research continues, but no breakthroughs or significant
improvements.  Slight improvement in cell damage prevention.

>Other Biology:

More germline engineering of farm animals.  Animal rights activists in an
uproar, firms required to label products which have ingredients which come
from genetically engineered life.

The FDA takes more flak.  It still doesn't care.

>Power Technology:

Power market somewhat deregulated in a few areas; some suffer, due to
government regulations still in place, which make life difficult for power
firms.  Failures blamed on the free market.

A few scattered sources of new energy, but no new compelling alternative
technologies become available.  No progress in cold fusion.

>Manufacturing and Materials Science & Technology

CPU chips start to move away from lithography and towards something else.
(Not precisely certain what.)  Nanotechnology makes more progress, most of
which is still theoretical.  No one looks like they're about to build an
assembler yet.  Those inside the field say that the going is slow; those
outside the field still think it's just around the corner.

More use of MEMs in military technology.  We don't hear much about it.

>General Transportation Technology:

The clean car movement: electric, hybrid, etc. continues to progress.
Clean cars become almost as good as gas guzzlers, but much more expensive

Little advance in consumer market.  The military keeps on working on
whatever it's working on.  We don't hear anything at all about it.

>Space Technology and Development:

More of the private sattelite companies start seeing the light at the end
of the tunnel.  Two seem ready to go online "real soon now."  Mir is
finally put to rest; no replacement looks ready for the next two or three
years.  Lunar ice studied.  Some talk of private ventures into space; a few
expensive private Earth orbit shuttles, but no real market to speak of.

>Business & Finance Technology and Practice:

A tiny upstart brokerage starts selling stocks with digital-bearer

Cell phones are everywhere; everyone has them.  Pagers all but vanish.
Computer vidphones and phone companies reach a standards agreement.

quantum cryptography.

>Neuroscience/Neuromedicine/Bio-cognitive Science & Technology:

AIDS cure is available, but inconsistent.  Some people walk away as if

It's more than sufficient for me, too.  I'm just wondering if there isn't a
more conclusive proof available.

Hi.

I had an idea for long-range (6000+ miles) laser communication system using
(more or less) off the shelf technologies.  I am unable to find any obvious
flaw in my idea, so I was hoping for some feedback from people who may be
more knowledgeable about this than I.


Laser targeting/ranging systems, such as those used by the military, mark
their targets by detecting the laser light which is reflected off the
object being illuminated.  My idea was to use objects in geosynchronous
orbit as reflective bodies for the purpose of scattering laser light.  The
ground stations would use laser pulses to send data by reflecting them off
the geosynchronous object.  A passive sensor on the receiving end would
detect the laser light that scatters off the satellite and (hopefully)
discern the bits.  In the simplest case scenario, the data communication
would be half-duplex, but more complex arrangements could be developed.  I
am unsure of the type of baud rate that could be accomplished this way.

If this worked, it would be an interesting option for
covert/subversive/etc. communications.  Lock onto your satellite of choice
and send the data.  Encryption would be necessary, but it would probably be
difficult to locate the sender, especially if the laser didn't operate at
visible wavelengths.  The problem I see is the possibility that you
wouldn't get a good scatter off the satellite.  I know that the
ground-laser-to-geosync works because my mother used to work in a building
where data was transmitted that way, but I am unsure how the downlink worked.

Comments?

Here's an abstract (from the Journal of Scientific Exploration) of the
experiment I found ESPecially charming in Dean Radin's book THE CONSCIOUS
UNIVERSE:

       Unconscious Perception of Future Emotions: An

Is consciousness limited to perception of the sensory present and memory of
the past, or does it also have access to future information? In an
experiment designed to explore this question, a computer was used to
randomly select and present target photos from a pool of digitized
photographs. Some targets labeled "calm" included landscapes and cheerful
people; other targets labeled "extreme" included violent and erotic topics.
Heart rate, blood volume, and electrodermal activity were recorded before,
during and after presentation of the target photo to see whether the body
would unconsciously respond differentially to the two types of future
targets. Extreme targets were expected to produce classical orienting
responses after the targets were displayed, and a "presentiment" (future
feeling) effect was predicted to produce orienting pre-sponses before the
pictures were displayed. Calm targets were expected to cause no unusual
responses before or after the target was displayed. Four experiments,
involving 31 participants who viewed a total of 1,060 target photos, showed
the expected orienting response after the target photo was displayed. In
accordance with a presentiment hypothesis, there was a clear orienting
pre-sponse that peaked with a four standard error difference in
physiological measures between extreme and calm targets one second before
the target photo was displayed.

Things have been a bit rough recently for I-kicked-the-damned-stone-OK?
Realists.  I was enchanted and mildly gob-smacked today to read in the 2
May 1998 *New Scientist* of a new wrinkle on quantum computing.  Alas, I
don't have the names to cite, because I read it in the library, and NS's
web site gives no details, just this screamer:  

CRAZY LOGIC
                   There's a weird world where computers give
                   you an answer just by being there. You don't
                   even have to switch them on 

The bottom line is that some clever fellow has worked out how to get
answers out of a quantum preparation *without turning the machine on to run
the calculation*.

It's based on the bomb-testing idea I'm sure you're all familiar with from
Penrose's SHADOWS OF THE MIND.  Elitzur and Vaidman showed that one time in
4 you can determine the state of a macro-system, *without observing it*, if
it is coupled to a quantum detector.  All that's needed is for the
observation to be *possible* via that procedure, and quantum interference
can deliver you information about the real world without actually looking
at it.  Some of the time, anyway.  And since that's true, a sequence of
assays can multiply up your level of confidence to whatever degree you wish.

This has now been extended, in principle, to such tasks as intractable
computations.  I'm not talking boring old-fashioned quantum computers here,
with their staid superposition of all possible calculations.  Those dreary
things had to be turned on and powered up.  This gadget doesn't need to be
activated until *after* it's done the job.  (What's more, it's reported
that objects have now been `photographed' using this principle without
shining any light on them, simply because light *could have been* shone on
them....)

Penrose is evidently rubbing his hands with glee, because this sounds like
it might be the missing link in his theory that neural microtubules can
sustain quantal superpositions in something like a Bose condensate.  The
brain might thus leap instantly and without frying itself to conclusions
that even the smartest Turing Jupiter brain would be agonising over to the
end of time...

I dunno.  Sounds like witchcraft to me.  Pretty logic, though.

They sure seems like hunches to me. If psi exists we have not the slightest 
idea how it works and so we're unjustified in throwing data out just because 
it doesn't work. Birthdays, astrological charts, and interesting patterns on 
play slips are as legitimate as anything else. There is a insidious trap in 
science that should be feared, unconsciously "correcting" the raw data until 
the desired results are obtained.

Who says hunches must be evanescent? If I had a hunch that there was one 
chance in a thousand that a particular 12 digit number would win I'd play it 
every week for the rest of my life.

        >market slump, are each encodable as just one bit of data. 
                   

If it exists it seems to me psi would have to deal with a lot more than one 
bit because you'd have to know what the bit refers to.  Before you can 
receive an answer you must ask a question, just exactly how do  you explain 
to psi that you want to know if particular city at a particular place on the 
Earth's crust will experience an earthquake of a particular size at a 
particular time? First you'd have to explain to psi that an earthquake is a 
large scale movement of rock, then you'd have to explain what rock is and 
exactly what you mean by "large scale movement". Most earthquake predictions 
mentions the Richter scale and that involves the amount and rate of energy 
that is released. That's not a simple thing to determine and you certainly 
can't do it with one bit.

The state makes a lot of money off the lottery, if the total number of

the annual budget would be in the red because of it. It may be in the red but 
not because of that.

That's true I've never heard of it, but if the data is as solid as you say it 
is then it would be the most important scientific paper in 400 years. I read 
a lot so I really should have hear of this interesting development by now, 
the fact that I have not makes me wonder if the data is really that solid.

I don't think there is any question, if psi exists QT and relativity would 
have to be dumped, I'd be willing to do that but only if the data was very 
solid indeed. I know nothing of the latest research you speak of, maybe it's 
better, but psi's history of incredible sloppiness and outright fraud does 
not build much confidence.

Josephson is a strange man and hasn't done any physics in 35 years. He 
started off great and discovered the Josephson Effect as a very young man in 
1962, but then for unknown reasons he immediately abandoned science and 
became a mystic. And not a very good mystic.

Well now: 18000 mph = 8 km/sec = 800 sec at 1 g. Approx 3200 Km, or 2000
miles.
At 3g (reasonable for most people) 266 sec, about 200 miles.

In New York to Los Angeles, you get about 8 minutes of microgravity (using
3g).

I think you have misunderstood what I'm saying here.  *Of course* I didn't
`throw out' birthdays, etc.  But I knew in advance from many decades of
psych tests on college kds etc, and from previous psi studies, that
populations don't free-respond literally *at random*.  In the 1930s, Zenith
Radio in the USA ran a long series of ESP tests that asked people to mark a
sequence of binary choices and mail them in.  They got many tens of
thousands of answers,  When these were compiled and analysed (rather
witlessly, but psych stats was young then), they announced to a stunned
world that ESP had been proved beyond doubt.  There was a quite startling
correspondence between the collective answers and the targets.  

Then someone smarter noticed what is now obvious - that in almost every
week's responses, there had been a joint tendency for people to generate
the sequence 11211 (I think it was).  If the choice was Black/White, people
en masse tended to choose White White Black White White, say.  When all
this stuff was screened for such templates and biases, and the randomly
generated target arrays matched up, it turned out that by chance there had
been slightly rather more target sequences compatible with that format than
not.  Worse, subtle cueing meant that people were sometimes led to start
their guesses with one target rather than the other, which then entrained
the rest of the sequence.  And so on.  At a stroke, the evidence for ESP in
the Zenith data vanished, to relieved guffaws from the skeptics.

Forty years later I came along and went through it again, using a rather
denuded data base (the original data had been lost, and all that's on
record is the total number of guesses for each week and the standard
deviation scores for each target, from which one can reconstruct a rude
profile of the true guesses.  When one edits out the underlying and
repeated 11211 pattern, something quite interesting emerges.  It is now
obvious that something *was* going on.  Put it another way - people will
always collectively choose White in the first place, but the vote is two
percent higher (say) when White *was* the target than when it wasn't.

I have never published these results, because they are post hoc and too
grainy to be truly interesting.  But it showed me that when I came to look
at Lotto, I shouldn't go searching for, say, the 6 largest votes out of 45
each draw, taking that as the majority vote.  If I'd done that, I'd have
got pretty much the same 6 each week, because people collectively select 7
1.209 times as often as they might if there were no bias, 13 is chosen
1.215 times too often, 20 scores 1.247 higher; while 41 only gets 0.634
times as much of the vote as it ought, 43 gets 0.784, and so on.  All this
would wash out automatically  if I'd had a very large number of draws to
work with, but in fact in my pool of data some numbers came up as winners,
by chance, more often than others. (The numbers produced by the game
randomiser do *not* correlate with the population preferences, so that
stands as powerful evidence *against* any collective psychokinetic or
mind-over-matter effects in such games.)

The answer is obvious: don't compare 7's vote with 41's, but 7-when-it-wins
with 7-when-it-loses.

That's all I was talking about.  No data or animals were harmed in the
course of this experiment.

I happen to work together with a group who work with PET scanning of
phobic responses, and I think they took GSR data when showing phobic
and non-phobic stimuli. I'll try to get the data and see if there is
any evidence for presentiment in it. I doubt it, since this kind of
experiment is done all the time across the world and I think people
would have noticed the effect by now, but if it can't hurt to look at
real data :-)

Hmm, it seems to work rather good within the context of this
discussion, and didn't the original thread predate your book? But it
is probably a good idea to remain aware of the difference between the
concepts. In this discussion prediction horizons are (so far)
irrelevant, only speed and bootstrapping is.

Path loss looks to be the biggest problem here. Scattered laser light will
be WAY down in amplitude by the time it makes it back to Earth from
geosynchronous orbit..

If you can detect the signal once it's back on Earth, I imagine you want an
extremely robust error correction algorithm, as atmospheric distortion and
stray light will be adding lots of noise. 

The theoretical maximum baud rate is 1/2 the carrier frequency, so you
won't be seriously limited in speed with a laser signal. The actual data
rate will probably be about 10% of the maximum to give a reasonable S/N
number, and then the packeting and error correction overhead will be
subtracted from that.

I assume this would be a packet based system, otherwise you are just doing
a single point to point link?

It would be impossible to locate the sender from the ground. Surveillance
satellites could be easily made to pinpoint such laser signals from orbit,
however. The probability of a short transmission being seen is very low,
unless there's hundreds of such satellites up there..

Neat idea..

I admit it - it was a WAG - I did not use a calculator.

Still, my 1 G guess came pretty close to constant accel/decel, with a
turn-around at mid trajectory.

The clever fellow in question is Richard Josza, of the University of
Plymouth, UK
As I understand it, though, it's all very speculative stuff -  gedanken
experiments, maybe.
I was at the IEE quantum computing conference at which Josza expained
the idea of the computer you don't have to actually switch on. He was
asked whether you would actually have to build the computer in the first
place - all the same arguments seem to apply if just the *possibility*
of building it is there........but didn't that suggest there was
something wrong with the reasoning somewhere along that line?

Josza happilly replied "Yes, it does."

But personally I love the idea. I hope he's right!

See http://qso.lanl.gov/qc/proc.html for a link to a paper by Josza.

If the communicator scatters diffusively (as compared to reflecting the
light directly from point A to point B, which would require very careful
aiming), then you have two inverse square transmissions multiplying each
other, for an inverse fourth power efficiency.  That would require much
more power than just getting the laser from ground to space or back.

The path loss shouldn't be insurmountable.  I know that a 3 Joule laser is
sufficient to get a good return signal from the lunar reflectors.  I would
expect most of the loss to occur at the satellite when the laser light is
reflected off an object that was not designed for that purpose.  However,
depending on your choice of wavelengths, even a very low power return
signal may be adequate if you have decent contrast against the background.

Point-to-point would be a good start.  I was thinking of ways to set up a
relatively high-bandwidth mobile point-to-point communications link without
having to rely on RF bands or commercial channels.  A more ambitious
project would be to set up a packet network.  The system wouldn't be too
good for real-time communications, but should work very well for data.  If
you used Ethernet type collision protocols, packet communications would
probably work pretty well.  Every satellite would be the equivalent of a
hub.  The biggest issue that I see is the high latency.  Geosync and back
is not a short hop.

Visible wavelength laser uplinks are potentially visible up to 5-10 miles
or so.  The blue-green laser uplinks (financial data) in San Diego, for
example, are visible several miles from the source.  However, burst
transmissions should reduce this significantly.

My thought was that it wouldn't be too difficult to put together a
relatively mobile (vehicle-mounted?) secure communications system that does
not rely on commercial channels.  Setting up such a communications system
is non-trivial, but doesn't rely on exotic technologies either (lasers,
detector optics, and maybe GPS if you are mobile) so it should be do-able,
assuming that there are no serious problems with the design.

Hmmm...I was talking about diffusive scattering.  The idea was to use
piggyback the signal on other people's satellites.

However, wouldn't a telescopic lense on the detector be sufficient to
concentrate the signal on the detector, even at low power?  I suppose this
might not work during the day though, unless you used a wavelength with
good contrast, and possibly not even then.

I wonder - most satellites are covered with silver or gold colored foil as
a solar reflector - but it's usually not smooth, so you would get a fair
diffusion there. I don't know about solar panels..

GPS and suitable software that can access a database of geosynch satellites
should be able to aim the transmitter and reciever optics at the same
satellite. You would need both transmitter and receiver to agree on what
bird to aim at.

The lunar retroreflectors are corner cubes, so there's much more
directionality to the return beam. A diffuse reflector would be wasting a
large proportion of the incident beam.

Possibly, a first step would be to use a CW laser, and on/off modulate it
with the modulation bits tied to an atomic timebase - you can get the
timing signal from the GPS system - and the receiver would be synchronous
to the transmitter. Hams have used similar schemes for years to get
reliable communications in very high noise conditions..

All that is needed is to aim precisely. GPS and satellite data again.

I bet a good long telephoto lens set to infinity would work - back it with
a bandpass filter set to the transmitter's wavelength and a photomultiplier
or image intensifier..

I have an photomultiplier tube (from a scintillator) that I have never
found a use for..

cool thread, gburch!  as one whose work is in astronautics, i would submit
that the biggest change of many years is coming:  access to orbit will
become
much more affordable.  this is coming not because of any new ideas in
propulsion, but because so many countries are now weighing in with launch
vehicles.  i suspect that light payloads (1000 kg or less)  will see a
truely
dramatic reduction in cost, probably to go as low as a couple thousand bucks
	per kilo in low earth orbit.  that changes everything... i expect we
will see
	those kinds of numbers by 2005.....  spike

> is inconsistent with QT, relativity, etc.

  Psi is certainly not inconsistent with Quantum *Theory* -- which 
  predated Quantum _Mechanics_ by many years, and which subsumes Quantum 
  *Mechanics* (in its many guises) as an approximation theory.

  As for psi being inconsistent with 'relativity' -- which Relativity?  
  The Galilean Relativity of Classical Mechanics?  Or Special Relativity?  
  Or maybe General Relativity?  Non-locality has destroyed SR and GR.

  It is true that any phenomenon or effect which demonstrates Absolute 
  Simultaneity instantly demolishes Special and General Relativity.  This 
  is not merely a matter of 'signal transmissions' or whatever -- the 
  moment we find that one event in space and time is simultaneous with 
  another event in a different location within the same Cartesian 
  position-space, SR and GR are irretrievably destroyed as theories.  
  Bell, Aspect etc. have of course done this anyway, so the assertion can 
  only refer to Galilean Relativity, or so it would seem.
  
  But there is nothing in Classical Mechanics and Galilean Relativity to 
  prohibit any particular psi characteristic (mode of force transmission, 
  velocity of signal propagation).  All Classical Mechanics will demand is 
  exact conformance with Conservation of Mass and Energy.  Since Mass and 
  Energy are not interconvertible (except insofar as all matter consists 
  of the constituents of photons; and all energy is either kinetic or 
  potential) there is no physical obstale to telekinesis, telepathy etc. 
  Precognition poses a different problem -- you can argue that 
  precognition is a form of approximated extrapolated estimate of future 
  states; or you can argue a causal connection.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

  Except for those who have an a priori necessity to believe in the 
  non-existence of psi phenomena (some people don't _want_ 'their' 
  Universe to have these characteristics), it's really quite easy to find 
  out whether you have psi powers -- the Silva Mind Control courses offer 
  a money-back guarantee that they will train you to elicit these powers 
  in fully demonstrable form to your own satisfaction.  Clicker on my Home 
  Page.  Start by reading 'the Silva Mind Control Method' by Jose Silva 
  and Philip Miehle.  (Disclaimer: I have no financial conncention with 
  Silva).


  If you have problems relaxing or visualising, one of the brain-frequency 
  entrainment gadgets will take care of the problem neatly.  It can also 
  help you get to sleep, by entraining Delta brain frequencies.

Yep, sounds good if you can dig it up.  Radin reports, BTW, that this
alleged effect was first noticed in just such data, taken in the 1980s by
someone whose name I've now forgotten (the book's gone back to the
library).  But then Benjamin Libet's somewhat similar results have also
been a matter of dispute for years, although I don't think there's ever
been any suggestion that his forerunning electric potential build-ups prior
to conscious intentional acts are due to paranormal info.

I don't really wish to get into a dispute over lexical priority, but I'm
pretty sure I originated the use of the term Spike in this context.  Even
so, it's clear that the broad classes of possible singularities were
canvassed on this and other lists years before I joined.  I'm not trying to
steal anyone's thunder...  :)

Sorry, Damien. I remembered that at one point we were using "spike"
and "swell" as two alternatives, but I had forgotten that you had
achieved a synthesis. I should go back to "phase change" as a
descriptor for the instantaneous hypothesis. Anders and I seem to
have agreed on a consise characterization of the differences in
our positions. I think this is a positive result that clarifies the
issues, at least for me.

Yeah, but we'll buy more books this way! It is as easy to buy from
them at from amazon, and lower exchange rate takes the sting out of
the extra cost for fast delivery.

If there is anything to psi then the responses should most definitely not be

Well OK, but then you've reduced your effective sample size to only about 2% 
of what it was before, and that would greatly  increase the noise in the data.

little loony, maybe psi exists but there is an inverse relationship between 
the faith a person has in it and a persons psi ability. Perhaps that explains 
its ephemeral nature, a person experiences psi directly and becomes convinced
that it's real and as a result loses every last shred of psi ability .   
If so then the real psychics are those who think it's all a crock of shit and  
a die-hard skeptic such as myself is due to have a profound mystical 
experience worthy of the X files any day now. (:>)

On a purely non-technical note, you might want to be careful which 
satellite you're doing the bouncing off of. Shooting a medium powered 
laser at someone else's satellite could be interpreted as an unfriendly 
act, Especially if the satellite has sensors that could be 
dazzled/destroyed by such a beam. I have a feeling that a laser beam 
whose scattered reflection is powerful enough to be detected from earth 
is more then bright enough to create a big dead spot in the center of a 
CCD on any earth observation satellite.

What does "die" mean? Brain death, or cardiorespiratory death?
What are the standards in the Netherlands regarding
establishing death? Is it possible for a person to be
on life support (ie, vegetable) to be dead?

I am not a doctor, but am an Alcor Cryptransport Certified
Technician. The impression I have is that waiting for
brain death is not a good idea! Mentioning BD is a very
poor idea! Cardiac death is the best way to have a still
preservable brain (much simplification here).

Alcor requires a Whole Body Anatomical Donation. I don't
know how that would relate to your situation. I expect that
it would be hard to get life support for a WBAD.

Perhaps the other person is the cryonics provider...

I suspect ONLY if the remains have viable organs. Otherwise
ASAP may take hours or days.

Only a small percentage of terminal cases leave viable organs
for harvesting. It is far better to have the cryo team on site
when you die, and this TAKES PREPARATION. In my case, I plan
to relocate to Scottsdale when my condition becomes terminal.

>Please share your opinion. Is it a good thing to use this

I don't think it's very useful.

Once you have ischemia, you have to do a lot of things quickly
to keep the brain intact. I doubt this would be done as no one
has a use for transplanting brains. Also, the cryo based procedures
do not support viability of brains or other organs.

A nice literary conceit, but there's a leetle problem. The algorithm used
to generate PI can be written in a few thousand bytes of computer code,
therfore
the information content of PI is actually quite small, not enough to store
the plans for a Contact Machine.....

(BTW, I am referring to the ones actually used to rapidly compute billions
of digits. Describing the series which sums to PI can be done with much less
code, but a much longer run time....)

Well, maybe a Contact Machine is actually quite simple algorithmically
speaking. Remember that the Mandelbrot set is very complicated, but
generated by a short program.

Good point. I would vote for making sure of WHICH sattelite you point
at...the CIA might take it amiss, as would NOAA..

Next idea - would it be THAT easy to kill a spy satellite? I imagine the
orbits are secret, so you never know where they are..

First of all, the plans for the vehicle were imbedded in the signal we
received from the extraterrestrials, not pi.  The message from god was
imbedded in pi.  I'm rusty on this stuff, but what would an algorithm for
running pi out to billions of places have to do with the numbers themselves
anyway?

Secondly, my apologies for bringing up ancient history (re nanoguitar).  I
saw it in a magazine for the first time that same day.  I did notice your
very next post, however, had something to do with a one-horned goat from
decade ago.  Talk about ancient history.

These will disappear ... swallowed by The Wall (AKA

recall the quaint terms "megabyte" and "megahertz".

> Communication Technology:

>From a BLS news summary of April 16, 1998: "In its
first major study of the economic effect of the
Internet, the Commerce Department says that Net
traffic is doubling every 100 days, and electronic
commerce should reach $300 billion by 2002. More than
100 million people are now on line, according to the
wide-ranging report. The 'digital economy' is growing
at double the rate of the overall economy and
represents more than 8 percent of the gross domestic
product, it said."

Still, it looks like the old material economy is
still keeping a spike in the swell of the digital
economy, for a while yet ;-)

> Neuroscience/Neuromedicine/Bio-cognitive Science &
Technology:

One response says "no effect on everyday life", but I
agree with others who see prospects for big advances
in slowing brain degradation in the elderly, perhaps
allowing this growing segment of the population to
continue productively contributing their vast stores
of knowledge, not to mention their well-tempered
reason (but conservative biases as well..) to the
advancement of society.  Helpfully (because their
numbers will decline ;) religious Puritans will
resist these drugs & technologies.

> Genetic Science and Technology:

Weekend news: "accord gives the project enormous
genetic sequencing capacity and could trim years off
the current timetable for making a map of the human
genome". Still, it's going to take many more years to
explore the back country of this map, even with the
help of robust AI - which might even finally emerge
from this area.

> Manufacturing and Materials Science & Technology

Last week's news: Susan Warren writes about "Whatever
Happened to the Buckyball?" in the May 4th WSJ noting
how "Buckyballs [STILL] cost $11k and up per pound"
but they'd need to drop to $2.5k per pound to be
useful for pharmaceuticals, $680/lb for catalysts,
$100/lb for optical materials, and $15/lb or less for
most other materials applications.

> Business & Finance Technology and Practice:

The key economic statistic, productivity, "slowed
sharply in the 1st qtr", supposedly "a reminder that
it is still an open question whether the U.S. economy
can sustain vigorous expansion with low inflation". I
work at BLS and am convinced that these productivity
figures are pretty meaningless.  Yet, the Business
Council uses these to promote slower growth, hoping
this will inspire the Fed not to raise interest
rates. Here we see that quaint notions and political
pressure from entrenched rate-sensitive industries
are conspiring to keep us saddled with slow-growth,
status-quo macroeconomic policies.

Also, today's WSJ "Outlook" column deals with "Fixing
[the] Tower of Babel In Global Accounting", something
essential so that corporations can list on any stock
market world-wide and open the global economy to
investors everywhere.  However, count on things going
slowly here because "they create thorny political and
regulatory problems" for the Nanny-State.

>From another front-page WSJ article today, headlined
"Growing Up": "The emphasis on mergers is as much a
reflection of the stock market these days as it is of
the telecomm industry: What junk bonds were to the
takeover-crazed 1980s, muscle-bound stock deals are
to the merger mania of the late 1990s".

Meanwhile, 737s are being grounded to check for
wiring problems - time for a nap in the terminal...

< All: sorry this is so long and boring.:)>

I have a few final comments & references (then those
who want to turn the list into a chatroom can get
back to more exciting contemporary topics of
technology & politics ;) However, as an addendum for
the "Near-Term Scenarios" thread, those looking for
Nomological resolutions of the Hard Problems will be
disappointed...

Daniel noted:
< The problem here is that concepts need not always
be formed the same way.  [CUT] This does not expose
any fatal flaws for Objectivist epistemology -- any
more than it would for any other flavor of
epistemology. >

A very interesting 1993 paper (but new to me) that I
was reading over the weekend is Mark Bickhard's
"Representational Content in Humans and Machines"
(http://www.lehigh.edu/~mhb0/repcon.html - Bickhard
is a psychologist, philosopher and head of the
Computer Science department at Lehigh University in
Pennsylvania ).

What I think many of the 'constructivist' sources I
mentioned last week mean when they derogatorily speak
of Objectivism is what Bickhard calls ENCODINGISM. 
Referring to various cognitive scientists that he has
reviewed, Bickhard says: "they all share ... an
underlying logical incoherence in their
presuppositions. Specifically, they all propose or
presuppose that representation is fundamentally
constituted as some form of encodings". Basically, he
says, the problem with this is that "in order for an
encoding to be defined, some already existing
representation (or string of representations) must
already carry the desired representational content...
there must be a lowest level ... not defined in terms
of any other representations".

Anyway, Bickhard proposes "INTERACTIVISM: A model of
Emergent representation ... developed within control
theory ... [as] a framework for a particular kind of
functional analysis [SKIPping  many pages] ... [of]
processes that require continued transactions with
their environments". The first important property is
"recursive self-maintenance".  Which is, I think,
what you were getting at when you said
< There does seem to be a difference, though, between
a control system in general and a living system. >

But, of course, this is all much too involved to
discuss in this forum. Anyway, I just wanted to point
out what some in the research community seem to mean
when they dismiss Objectivism.

However, this doesn't mean that there is no such
thing as an Objective Reality.  Another article
that's useful on this (which I also haven't quite
finished digesting) is Barry Smith's 1995 "Formal
Ontology, Common Sense and Cognitive Science"
(http://wings.buffalo.edu/academic/department/philosophy/ontology/focscs.htm)
which does much to debunk notions of cultural
relativism in a rigorous way.

Smith mentions your point about Eskimos having many
words for snow, and notes: "Differences of this sort
may imply that the common-sense world that is
discriminated by natural cognition may differ from
culture to culture ... HOWEVER, they constitute no
challenge to our two theses of uniqueness and
autonomy of the common-sense world, since they
reflect no ontological incompatibility on the side of
objects, but rather differences of granularity or of
calibration in our articulation of one and the same
world".

Smith also deals with arguments about "naïve physics"
and "folk psychology", and fretting about
"emergence", that some authors on the Extropian
reading list (eg: Minsky, Churchland) make much of. 
But Smith warns about over-reliance on what Bickhard
called "observer semantics": "The thesis that the
common-sense world is capable of being investigated
in large part by standard physical means may,
however, have limited implications. Thus suppose,
with [D.R. Hilbert, 1987], that we identify colour
with the physical property of surface reflectance.
The latter is an objective property and is physically
well understood, yet, as Hilbert points out, 'it is
not reducible to more fundamental physical
properties. Fundamentally different physical
mechanisms can result in objects that possess very
similar dispositions to reflect light. The
reflectance of an object is a *multiply grounded
dispositional property*'" (my emphasis).

Finally (hidden here at the bottom, after everyone
else has already blown off this post ;-), I was
fascinated by your comments on esthetics.  Another
lengthy article that might intrigue you is Brian
Massumi's "Involuntary Afterword"
(http://www.anu.edu.au/HRC/first_and_last/works/crclintro.htm),
his piece for a special issue of The Canadian Review
of Comparative Literature, "Deleuze, Guattari and the
Philosophy of Expression" (same URL but with
crcltoc.htm). 

Actually, this brings me back to one of the footnotes
in my original response last week, where I pondered
the possibly extropian nature of Guattari's notion of
"surplus-value semantics".  What I was trying to get
at there is what section 2 of this CRCL issue calls
"The Superior Empiricism of the Human".  Massumi, in
his purely poetic way, puts it like this: 

"Even Kant notes the priority of process over form in
aesthetic experience. Beauty, he says, is 'drusy.' Or
more precisely, our interest in beauty is awakened by
drusiness. What in the OED is 'drusy'? A dusting of
miniature crystals appearing on a surface: the
sparkle of an appealing roughness that lures the eye
to extend the hand. ...

"The drusy, in awakening our interest in beauty,
points us in the direction of a non-cognitive
aesthetics: aesthetics as a kind of empiricism
involving itself with real conditions of emergence,
under-with cognitive conditions, or conditions of
possibility (Deleuze 1994, 154, 231-232, 285;
O'Connell). Drusiness points to the post-Kantian
dimension in Kant, or what Deleuze will call a
'superior empiricism' (1994, 56-57, 143-144).[5] What
is 'superior' about it is that subject and object
integrate into a greater autonomy of participation, a
matter-manner meld adding a new line of
multiple-singular encounter to the world: that of a
technic, an artificed between of any number of
possible subjects and objects, autonomous of any
given particular subject or object. This empiricism
is 'superior' because it is creative of reality. It
adds to reality."

I posted last year about a set of predictions by the "resident futurist"
at British Telecom labs, at:

http://btlabs1.labs.bt.com/library/on-line/calendar/index.htm

They are sorted by technology and then by date within categories.
Unfortunately there is no accompanying discussion or justification,
which is a shame since the dates he gives seem implausibly optimistic.

For example, in 1998 in the biotech/medical field he predicts the use of
artificial muscle in heart transplants; home diagnostic systems with
daily health check-up; virtual reality based exercisers in homes; AI
based elderly/handicapped support devices; and an artificial pancreas.
By 2000 he further predicts artificial blood; disability assistance
devices using thought recognition; full personal medical records stored
on smart cards; and artificial ears.

I won't say he's going to be wrong about all of these, but I'd be surprised
if more than one or two of these nine items occured in the predicted time
frame.

Stop me if this idea has already been done (I think someone had a
similar idea on this list a while back, I don't know if anything came
of it) but:

It's now common practise among governments to build future scenarios
to see what dangers may exist.  I propose a list to do the same but
with an extropian edge (of course).  If no immediate practical purpose
can be found it will serve as both an intriguing view of the future
and something to laugh about in 10 years time.  The list would work as
follows: To join the list an application would have to be approved,
the number of members will be kept low, occasionally a detailed
scenario will be posted by one of the members, the other members will
then respond with brilliant ideas and sharp wit.

Things to be discussed could include:

Nanotechnology
Artificial Intelligence
Crypto Anarchy
Augmented Intelligence
Genetic Engineering
Etc

Replies would not be opinions on whether these are good, bad, or
neutral but of what threats they present, what social changes they
could bring, and how they could come about.  For the purpose of good
reading scenarios could also have a fictional element (i.e. Not just,
"what happens if we upload", but how and when it happens in this
scenario).  Each scenario should be given the appropriate amount of
time before we move on to another scenario.

Comments, opinions, criticisms, lynchings, beatings, slappings,
pinchings, whippings, and general kink much appreciated :-)

I was under the impression that earth observation satellites are not
generally found in geosync because the long distance degrades the
resolution of their sensors.  If I am not mistaken, most observation
satellites are in LEO or MEO.

couldn't a civilian group spend the money just as well?..;-)

seriously, i was thinking that a large factor in the high cost is the simple
fact that many if not most of the items discussed on this list; augmentation,
cloning, tissue regeneration, space exploration and colonization, etc.. are of
value to a very small number of people...or rather the majority of folks seem
to feel that way... that is to say that it seems very few can or will see the
possible long term benefits of R & D in such areas...if only we had the same
sort of ad campaigns as used to sell shoes and candy and jeans and.....

Stone the crows!  Strike me pink, Mabel!  Gawd preserve me from my

What next - plugs for $cientology?

Correct.  But if a significantly large excess of heads over tails found in
the first pre-announced set of a million flips is repeated in the second
and the third and the fifth of five, you are talking about something akin
to the results detailed in the major parapsychology meta-analyses.

This comment of John's is the kind of handwaving `rebuttal' that rightly

Ah. Well, don't worry, this is false.

Someone has slightly misunderstood the process, and then jumped to a
conclusion that they *thought* followed logically from the description they
had seen.

Actually they also showed the result you are describing here, namely that
you can determine that state as with reliability as close to 1 as you like
(but not actually 1), and you can reduce the probability that that will
involve measuring the system (in any one universe) to an arbitrarily low
number above zero. Again, if you reduce it to zero, the scheme won't work.

Which means "to occur in some universes", remember.

The whole quantum computation that does this is the "sequence of assays".

False.

No. It's because light did fall on them in other universes. Just like any
other interference experiment.

All that microtubule stuff, and more generally all suggestions that the
brain is a quantum computer, while not witchcraft, seem entirely
unmotivated to me. The 'interaction-free measurements', however (or
counterfactual computations as Richard Jozsa has somewhat misleadingly
called them), are a matter of ordinary, uncontroversial physics. It is
indeed pretty physics. And it only sounds like witchcraft if you try to
understand it as happening in a single universe.

I believe the satellites that provide 'satellite weather' are geosynch - or

'Buzzed' gives straight answers on drugs 


Copyright © 1998 Nando.net
Copyright © 1998 Scripps Howard 


DURHAM, N.C. (May 12, 1998 01:26 a.m. EDT http://www.nando.net) - Don't let
those Hershey's cravings carry you away -- chocolate stimulates the same
receptors in the brain as marijuana.

Don't follow John Travolta and plunge an adrenaline needle into someone's
heart to reverse an opiate overdose -- that "Pulp Fiction" scene was simply
incorrect.

Don't get high the day before a calculus exam -- marijuana impairs
short-term memory for two days.

These are just a few of the tidbits in "Buzzed," a sort of Betty Crocker
book for the recreational drug world. In it, three Duke University
scientists -- whose motto is "Just Say Know" -- dispel the misconceptions
and myths about used and abused drugs from alcohol to Ecstasy.

The idea came from co-author Bill Wilson's daughter, a college junior who
had frank questions about drugs and their effects.

Since it was published in March, the book with the psychedelic red-and-blue
spiral on the cover slowly has caught on with law enforcement agencies,
drug addiction counselors and educators. The Chapel Hill-Carrboro (N.C.)
School District, for instance, plans to stock "Buzzed" in every school
library.

"It has information that students need and want without being
condescending," said Susan Spalt, health coordinator for the Chapel
Hill-Carrboro schools. "It doesn't beat around the bush, it doesn't use
scare tactics, but on the other hand it gives a very real overview of the
problems and consequences."

"Buzzed" tells far more than any high school health textbook: For every
drug, it describes the high feeling, ill effects, history and slang terms.

"We're scientists," co-author Cynthia Kuhn said. "We don't formulate public
policy; we're not lawyers. We understand what the drugs do."

All three authors conduct brain research on rats. Kuhn studies the effects
of drugs on the brain and teaches an undergraduate course, "Drugs and the
Brain." Clinical neuropsychologist Scott Swartzwelder teaches "Memory and
the Brain," and treats patients with brain disorders. Wilson, a
neuropharmacologist, studies the way drugs affect learning and memory.

Readable, unbiased and scientific, "Buzzed" is the answer, the authors say,
to the government's scare tactics in the war on drugs, misinformation on
the Internet and the public schools' anti-drug program, "Just Say No."

Not all drugs have the same danger level, the authors contend, and
anti-drug programs lose credibility every time a kid smokes a joint and
lives to tell about it.

"Often, the government will use the term 'dangerous' about every drug,"
Wilson said. "We say the 'Just Say No' phrase is dangerous; it's destructive."

People will make smarter decisions about drugs, the authors said, if they
have good information.

"There is this fear that if you start educating people, then you're somehow
giving people permission to use," Swartzwelder said.

The authors distilled data from hundreds of research papers and sprinkled
the book with literary and cultural references -- from excerpts of William
Burroughs' novel "Junkie" to the poppy field scene in "The Wizard of Oz."

"There's very little drug education in high schools, there's zero in
college and there's zero in real life," Kuhn said.

All three authors were surprised, they said, to find out how often college
students use and abuse drugs without knowing the dangers.

Wilson gained a rare glimpse into the college drug scene when his daughter,
Heather, entered Hollins College in Roanoke, Va., three years ago.

"We have a great relationship, and we're always talking about drugs,"
Wilson said. "And she was a little too interested in drugs."

Wilson was visiting campus one weekend when he and Heather discovered a
friend of hers lying unconscious on the dormitory floor in a pool of blood.
The girl had mixed cold medicine with bourbon, became delusional and tried
to slit her wrists, Wilson said. The girl would not have been suicidal,
both Wilsons said, if she had known not to mix the drugs.

Another time, Heather and some friends decided not to try the drug
"Ecstasy" after consulting Wilson and one of Kuhn's textbooks and learning
that the drug can cause permanent mood disorders.

"This was such a clear illustration that when people have good information,
straight information, they tend to make good decisions for themselves,"
said Heather Wilson, who helped research the book.

The book is unusual because scientists don't usually take the time to put
their findings into such readable language, said Carlton Erickson, head of
the Addiction Science Research and Education Center at University of Texas
at Austin's College of Pharmacy.

"It takes books like this to be able to synthesize all this information,"
said Erickson, who co-wrote a similar book, "Drugs, the Brain and
Behavior," that should be published next month. "There's a lot of people
taking these drugs, and we have to know how to help those people."

      That's a silly response.  The Silva people say you can get 95% of 
      the Course's value from the paperback book by Jose Silva, 'The 
      Silva Mind Control Method', which describes all the coursework and 
      the sought-for outcomes in great detail.  If you consider my 
      paragraph coolly, I'm just saying that you can find out for yourself 
      _if_ you have psi powers.  The fact that the Silva people say you 
      _do_ is not my point.  If you do the course and get nothing from it, 
      you get a refund (OK, you're out sixty hours or so).

      I did most of the Silva coursework without knowing it, in 1979, as 
      part of the first week-end of Werner Erhard's 'est' training (which 
      I'm much more critical of).  'est' is a sort of smorgasbord of all 
      the Californian Human Potential techniques, with all the labels 
      removed.  'est' is the Human Potential equivalent to bad acid, and 
      can do your head in, IMHO.  Read William Warren Bartley's book on 
      'est' for a more positive 'take.'

      Here are the possibilities re: Silva Mind Control:
      
      You read the book, and get value from that.  The book is Extropian, 
      in that it asserts you have latent quasi-magical _practical_ powers 
      that are easily liberated.  Of course, you may decide you'd rather 
      not have these powers.  HHOK....
      
      You do the course, and get more value from that.
      
      You get no value from any of this, and get a refund.


      As I may have mentioned, I'm working on a multi-media program to 
      give you all these benefits and more at your own speed.  I'm not 
      paid by Silva. I utilize scientific method.

      I make my usual offer to Extropians -- I stand behind everything I

>2.  Curmudgeonality: A person with IDP is often suspicious of or hostile

>standards.  Subjects 1, 7, 8 and 9 frequently made remarks regarding a

>3.  Transcendental Substitution: The Imagination Deficient person tends

>brotherhood, tribal union or spiritual values, so many of them
>substitute non-traditional institutions they find acceptable.  For
>example, the IDP may take up an interest in magic, or science, or they

>to three or more science magazines.  Again, all 10 subjects were
>positive on this indicator, 2 going so far as to setup temple like
>structures in which to meet.
>
>4.  Hyper-realistic representation: This is a tendency on the part of
>the Imagination Deficient to expect a realistic or rational
>representation in all aspects of life.  For example, the IDP may engage
>in nit picking about plot lines in TV programs or books, or complain
>about contemporary linguistic usage which conflicts with a technical
>term.  Eight of the 10 subjects scored positive on this measure.
>Subjects 8 and 9 wrote books substantially about correct usage of
>scientific terms.
>
>5.  Fictional miss-identification: Often an IDP will react to fictional
>representations as though they are real.  For example, they may complain
>about how a popular fictional TV programs portrays the paranormal, or
>get irate if book they are reading invokes a ghost or spirit, or has a

>Once again all subjects were positive on this measure with one (Subject
>5) even refusing to fly on an airline whose travel magazine included an

>
>6.  Delusions of superiority: In many cases the IDP will believe that

Perhaps others have already heard of this site and the upcoming book,
but I just discovered it.  It covers in great detail existing
methods/processes towards realizing the first phase of space
migration/industrialization - CELSS, mining the moon and asteroids,
manufacturing, construction, etc..

>>
>>by David Quinne

Yes - funny, stylish and deft.  And ouch-making.

I've been wondering about this paradox myself.  Despite having been an sf
writer by profession for, um, 35 years, I'm clearly `Imagination
Deficient'.  Part of this is what I would justify as
`Dick-Headedness-Intolerant', but part is quite close to what Quinne's
spoof parametrizes.  

Example: I can cautiously consider the possibility that certain claims of
the paranormal are valid without my head exploding, but I get very, very
angry when my sister-in-law blithely reports that she and her friends can
change the traffic lights green when they wish to.  

Leaving aside the question of rational adjudication of conflicting claims,
I've been musing on possible links between birth order, family dynamic
ecology, stress levels (measured by cortisol, say), temperament and
radicality.  Frank Solloway's recent amazing work on birth order as a
predictor of response to novelty is a key datum.  So is the recent paper
showing that first-born mice (and, I think, some other lab beasties) are
more skittish, easily stressed, than their later-litter sibs.  Might have
something to do with uterine environment, or with the mother's inexperience.  

It occurred to me that I (a first born) have a high probability - on
Sulloway's acount - of being narrow, conservative and opposed to change.
My brother Mick, 15 years younger and the family's `baby', should have
turned out neophilic and radical - as indeed he did, in a relaxed and
sardonic way (he's a scathing authority on nuclear tropes in movies and
TV).  But I sort of muddy the picture, being gung-ho for change in some
directions and quite narrow and hostile to innovation in many others.  (I'm
one of those people who find it hard to believe anyone except the mentally
infirm would choose  to wear a baseball hat backwards - it mimics baldness,
never a good look, it leaves you with the sun in your eyes, not a lot of
fun, and it's a marker of herd mentality.)  

I suspect this might have something to do with anxiety control.   If your
stress set-points are low, from birth, you might arrange your reactions to
the world in a defensive, suspicious way, and if you're intelligent as
well, you might do this by constructing/adopting highly complex, organised
systems of categorisation, evaluation and expression.  More relaxed people
might find it easier to break free, to explore `imaginatively' without the
risk of premature closure.  (If that's true, there'll also be more paranoid
delusives - who might seem at first sight to be wildly imaginative - among
the non-`imaginatives' as well... which is one of the claims in the spoof
article.)

Are you a later-born, Anders?  Max?  Natasha?  Greg?  Keith?  John?  Anyone?

Damien didn't ask for my input, but I hope he does not mind my adding it....:)

As a writer, I don't think that imagination has much relation to a 'relaxed'
mindset--
I find a much stronger correlation with mental restlessness and the need to
explore.  I was a 'later born' but from birth had a personality
characterized by a high level of energy and an adventurous nature, and I
think of that as the source of my creativity rather than parenting or birth
order. I could write for the next fifty years and not keep up with all of
the ideas I get every day, because I quickly become bored with stasis and
repetition and want to try new things.  I put on my mental hiking boots and
strike off on some faint path, just for the pleasure of following where it
leads.  Rationality plays a part in it, too.  The scientific studies and
other information I read provide the 'trail mix' that fuels my quest toward
some distant destination.  Sometimes the path leads nowhere, but along the
way I might get to see some neon squirrels and maybe a flying cow or two.  

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

hmmm... i'm in the middle...and quite imaginative...and extremely skeptical...

skeptical at least of claims to powers/abilities/knowledge that aren't
repetively demonstrable.   time and a gian i've read of so and so who can
predict such and such or telekinesis or what have you... i haven't anything
against believing these folks..i'd love it if such were possible... but show
me!  step out to the corner with me and grab a fellow and random and tell me
how much change he has in his pockets...
levitate my car into the air... too heavy?..fine i'll settle for my car
keys... do it again... and again... in front of others.  this whole idea of
the "powers" not working if i "don't believe" or if the wind is coming from
the southeaast or if i'm wearing a blue shirt or whatever the excuse is, is
what makes me and most others doubt the claimants... 

the sheer amount of fakery and fraud associated with the field is not the
fault of the skeptics after all. disbelief and a roll of the eyes is to be
expected in an area so rife with lousy controls, unduplicated data, wild
claims from all corners and outright liars... psychic friends network
anyone?... yeesh...

This seems to describe a different definition for "skepticism" than I
recognize.  Since when are these traits included as part of
"skepticism"?

 IAN: That's almost as goofy as people who claim
 that A is A free from not-A; of course, in the 
 fused-horn-goat case,  there was at least a 
 single example of their case (fake as it
 may have been), yet the atomists have
 neither a real nor a fake unicorn.

 No, my mistake, the atomists have come up

I'm a first born and I have all of the traits listed in the study.

It seemed to me that the study was about various aspects of social concensus not imagination.

IMHO it requires more not less imagination to defy social consensus.

I didn't realize that all skeptics were either "negative nay-sayers" or
"atheists".  Where'd he learn this, at Maharishi International
University?  At least the author recognizes that "imagination deficient"
isn't a "scientifically proven" trait.  Apparently it's just a label to
apply to people who question the validity of "imaginative" subjects like
Transcendental Meditation and quantum metaphysics.

Oops, I'm being unimaginative again.  Better go check my blood
pressure...

It reminded me of that saying people tend to abuse around here, "don't
be so open minded that your brains fall out."  You can form words into
pretty sentences, but do they mean anything?  Just the same, you can
be funny and make a point but it doesn't make that point valid.  Oh! 
Shit I'm being too rational (but not so rational <insert pointless,
but oh so clever, remark here>).

And why, pray tell, do you want to be more 'imaginative'?  It's easy
to make a funny remark and have people believe it's valid simply
because it makes some clever observations.  It's not so easy to say
something that truly is valid.

When someone makes a witty and "biting" remark so clearly aimed in
your direction there are two responses; A) retaliation - making some
other equally witty remark to keep face, or B) defence, agreeing that
you fit snugly into their social rut and then extrapolating to perhaps
why you do it.  You managed to fall into the latter.

I'm not sure I understand this.  Do you want to believe your
sister-in-law?

Well I'm the last of three; I'll let you decide whether I fit neatly
into your model.

Again I find you trying to fit yourself into someone else's rut (no,
Damien, don't do it!).  Being "gung-ho for change" when you should be
"narrow, conservative, and opposed to change" isn't "sort of muddying
the picture" it's wiping your arse on it.

Today's youth tend walk with their heads hung low; thus the backs of

You could have a point, I'm relaxed to the point of near-death and
IMHO I'm "open-minded" (i.e. I don't suffer from premature closure,
well, maybe once or twice but you know what it's like when you get
excited!).  And personally, I wouldn't say that a SF writer with
extensive knowledge of all things psi is prone to premature closure
either.

I did and then searched last weekend for the reults of the poll at ABC's

they ever published the results and, if so, where?

I have a terrible sinking feeling that more than one of the geniuses on
this list read the purported study forwarded by Tony Hollick (by Cat,
Thomas H. and Ray Fiddle [1983], wasn't it, or am I thinking of the
skepticism poll conducted by Hither, Adolph and Yon, I [1882]?) as a
serious academic paper.

Funny, that.

This list, much to its credit methinks, is rife with critical thinkers
of the skeptical variety. Yet, I can't help but cast quizzical looks at
http://wheel.dcn.davis.ca.us/go/btcarrol/skeptic/future.html where it
appears ExI is slated for debunking by the esteemed skeptic Dr. Robert
Carroll.

It is worthy for one to be skeptical. Yes, indeed. But it may be equally
worthy for one to be skeptical of the skeptical.

Cognitive dissonance, anyone? :)

Sacred cows are to blame. I find I have a much more open-mind to such
Damnable Heresies as Singularity, and Little Machines That Can Do
Everything And More. Things future and visionary make me all giggly. Is
this a symptom of 'a mind so open that the brains fell out?' Certainly
not. Or perhaps not certainly not.

/BEGIN ANECDOTE 

My very religious mother and I were having a brief conversation the
other day by way of voice (ugh) communication. We were talking about the
normal mother/son things (Powers, Dyson Spheres, Great Filters, etc. :)
when the thought crossed my mind that if I were to try to explain
nanotech to her, she might snicker like a skeptic in the best case, or
tag me a 'buffoon' for the rest of my life in the worst case. 

She might be right.

Anyway, the point is that she has no trouble believing that a wiseman
named Christ went fussing about turning water into wine and raising
folks from the dead (including himself). Furthermore, she has no trouble
believing that after having been killed once, HE'S COMING BACK FOR MORE! 

END ANECDOTE/

So, the moral of this story is that the more sacred your sacred cows,
the easier it is to swallow the really big pills that relate to those
cows (or at least make it more exciting to believe them).

Neat idea. Some people are convinced that the chasm between neophobe and
neophile is traversible using drugs of some sort. We've had this
discussion here before, and I don't know if it was ever settled. Maybe
Danny remembers? 

Inventiveness seems to have been a survival trait. Imagination? I don't
know. Are they different? The starry-eyed daydreamer would have died off
pretty quickly, it seems, what with the large predators running about
the savanna 25,000 years ago. OTOH, imagination seems to follow
intelligence around. Just look at the canonical interpretations of QT.
Or Kip Thorne and exotic matter. Who has more imagination than that? 

Imagination seems to require the ability to take some unproven things
for granted and extrapolate from there. And is it worth mentioning that
this sounds awfully a lot like theoretical applied science? 

>

Nope. I'm also an exception to the apparent rule. I'm a first-born,
low-stress guy, who doesn't mind reading the Psychoceramics list (and
who doesn't mind asking what *if* Monica Lewinsky and Elvis were on the
Trilateral Commission...).

The New York Times today finally got around to reporting about Dr. Plomin's 
work on a IQ gene that I talked about a few days ago. As I said the marker he 
used is just junk DNA but it's in the middle of a gene called IGF2, this 
might be the IQ gene or it might be another gene very close to it. IGF2 codes 
for a protein with the sexy name "Insulin-Like Growth Factor 2". Not much is  
known about this hormone but interestingly another scientist Dr. Randy Jirtle  
has independently studied it for years and has had a suspicion it's involved 
in the metabolism of the brain, he thinks a link to IQ is plausible. 
Dr. Plomin says there are  probably about 50 genes responsible for the 
difference between the 100 IQ kids and the 160 IQ kids in his study, this is 
just the first. He also said that he doubted that any one kid had all 50 
genes.

The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News 
Number 371 May 13, 1998   by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben Stein

A CARBON NANOTUBE TRANSISTOR, an electronic device based on a single 
rolled-up sheet of carbon atoms, has been built by researchers in the 
Netherlands (Cees Dekker, Delft Institute of Technology, 
dekker@qt.tn.tudelft.nl), providing a demonstration of room-temperature, 
carbon-based electronics at the single-molecule scale.  In the device, 
a semiconducting carbon nanotube (only about 1 nm in diameter) bridges two 
closely separated metal electrodes (400 nm apart) atop a silicon surface 
coated with silicon dioxide. Applying an electric field to the silicon 
(via a gate electrode) turns on and off the flow of current across the 
nanotube, by controlling the movement of charge carriers onto it. 
Although carbon nanotubes are robust and durable molecules, they can't yet be 
made uniformly.  While this can provide disadvantages (a slight deviation
from the desired radius can give the nanotube metallic properties), it can 
also bring about advantages--such as the possibility of a metal-semiconductor 
junction made completely of carbon nanotubes. (S.J. Tans et al., Nature,

Aha, that makes a certain amount of sense. It could be a growth factor
affecting among other things neural tissue (I seem to recall that the
IGF family acts as local growth factors, released (or identical to?)
the somatomedins).

The question is how they interact. I wouldn't be the least surprised
if having all of them would be bad due to nonlinear interactions. For
example, one could promote one beneficial neural growth process and
another for another process, but these two processes interfere
slightly. Mapping these interactions is an interesting problem.

      When I read the aforesaid 'paper' over on 'forteana' (the 'Fortean 
      Times' conference), I thought it made a good point (or two), leaving 
      aside the 'supporting evidence' and addressing the _hypotheses 
      themselves_.
      
      One of the glories of Critical Rationalism is that all we really 
      need be concerned with is the content of ideas.  Their source, 
      'confirmation', 'authority' and so on are quite unimportant.  A 
      hypothesis may be true even if everyone disbelieves it; it may be 
      false even while everyone agrees with it.
      
      I append a lovely essay by Karl Popper which makes these points 
      rather better than I.
      
      PS: Damien: I likely would have attended Melbourne U. had I not been 
      given a three-day ultimatum to be flogged in the showers by the 
      prefects at Geelong Grammar School; this was two weeks before my 
      Matriculation exams (over 90% in the mocks), after I called a 
      prefect an 'impolite bastard.'  John Gray Gorton's hapless son Robin 
      was being given 'leadership training).
      
      Despite this foolishness, I rather like Australia. >:-}

TITLE:           *** WELCOME TO 'PHYSICS/GENERAL' ***

      "... seen as the result of human endeavour, of human dreams, hopes, 
passions, and most of all, as the result of the most admirable union 
of creative imagination and rational critical thought, I should like 
to write 'Science' with the biggest capital 'S' to be found in the 
printer's upper case.


  Science is not only like art and literature, an adventure of the human
spirit, but it is among the creative arts perhaps the most human: full of
human failings and shortsightedness, it shows those flashes of insight
which open our eyes to the wonders of the world and of the human spirit.
But this is not all. Science is the direct result of that most human of all
human endeavours - to liberate ourselves. It is part of our endeavour to see
more clearly, to understand the world and ourselves, and to act as adult,
responsible and enlightened beings. 

      'Enlightenment', Kant wrote, 'is the emancipation of man from 
       self-imposed tutelage . . . from a state of incapacity to use 
       his own intelligence without external guidance.  Such a state 
       of tutelage I call "self-imposed" if it is due not to any lack 
       of intelligence but the lack of courage or determination to use 
       one's own intelligence instead of relying upon a leader.  
       *Sapere Aude!*  Dare to use your own intelligence! This is the 
       maxim of the Enlightenment.' [ref. 6, Immanuel Kant, 'Was ist 
       Aufklarung?']


  Kant challenges us to use our intelligence instead of relying upon a
leader, upon an authority. This should be taken as a challenge to
reject even the scientific expert as a leader, or even *science itself*
Science has no authority. It is not the magical product of the given,
the data, the observations. It is not a gospel of truth. It is the result
of our own endeavours and mistakes. It is you and I who make science,
as well as we can. It is you and I who are responsible for it...


  The nuclear bomb (and possibly also the so-called 'peaceful use of
atomic energy' whose consequences may be even worse in the long run)
have, I think, shown us the shallowness of the worship of science as an
'instrument' of our 'command over nature' or the 'control of our physical
environment': it has shown us that this command, this control, is apt to be
self-defeating, and apt to enslave us rather than to make us free - if it
does not do away with us altogether. 


  And while knowledge is worth dying for, power is not. (Knowledge is 
one of the few things that are worth dying for, together with liberty, 
love, kindness, and helping those who are in need of help)."


      by  Karl R. Popper

 IAN: Another sore looser having a temper
 tantrum, how pathetic! As soon as people
 run out of argument all that's left is
 mud slinging and cursing, whatever it
 takes to stop inquiry.  What else
 should we expect from a Yak that
 Yakked miserably against truth
 as the goal of inquiry? Heck,
 a Big Lie will do just fine!

 You may oppose truth and inquiry, but
 I do not, and thus will not shut up.
 Now go defecate in the toilet, not
 on this list, thank you very much.

>Are you a later-born, Anders?  Max?  Natasha?  Greg?  Keith?  John?  Anyone?


I was a later-born with three older siblings and one much younger.  The
stress level was a bit high during my developmental years into early
adulthood due to the competitive nature of my older siblings and expected
elevated creativity.  Being from a family of artists and scientists
(medical doctors and engineers), I felt most pressure coming from the need
to keep up and be unique.

My family put emphasis on creative ideas (father's influence) and
development of many female friendships (mother's influence).  In that most
of my influence comes from the combination of both, I (being on the
youngest-end) had to prove myself beyond the family norm.  I was often
teased and left out of things which resulted in my inner search and
personal exploration.

Being a later-born, I was able to watch and digest the actions of my older
siblings, learning from their interactions in the world.  Because my
sister's proclamation that she never wanted me to be born, I made it my
quest to seek out non-biological "sisters" -- procuring and nurturing my
many relationships with women.  Because of my families obvious and open
support of the male siblings, I worked harder to prove that females were as
capable as the males.  A situation that riddles me to this date.

Thus, my creativeness stems from having to keep up and prove myself early
on and a desire to combine art and science while paying very special
attention to my own femininity and the support from and giving to friends.
I struggle with anxiety and have learned behavioral methods to tone it
down.  I am not innately relaxed, but practice it as a way of finding a
"zen-like" quality in my life.  (Meditation, creative visualization and
exercise.)  I'm not always successful at it, but recognize it as being a
useful tool to letting my unconscious flow.

I don't have any problem with that.

Of course, I'm the one who claims that moderation is good but you shouldn't

I never saw a TV show until the mid/late '60s - my family was too poor to
own a receiver.  

BTW, further research has shown that the full first name of Dr Thomas H.
Cat's research associate Ray Fiddle, one of the earliest hippie children to
enter university, is Rainbow.  He was known in childhood as Beau, but
repudiated that abbreviation with revulsion once he realised why people
outside the commune kept laughing at him.

 As another web-search excersize, I asked  Altavista for "nutrition database"
and eventually found:
    http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/cgi-bin/nut_search.pl
Which is a few click down from
    http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/
Is that what you want, or are you looking for software for your PC?
I think they have some freeware at this site, too.

   What i really want is these three commands:




i_ate FOOD [TIME]

   This tells the system that i ate FOOD at TIME.  The information is 
entered into a diet tracker and stored on disk.



   
nutrient_status [PERIOD]

   Consults the diet tracker and tells me what percentage of the 
recommended nutrient intake i've had in the past PERIOD.




what_should_i_eat [PERIOD]

   Consults the diet tracker and suggests some foods that i could eat to 
bring my nutrient intake up to 100% of the recommended, when averaged 
over the past PERIOD.




   The idea is that i try to keep track of what i eat and enter the data 
into the diet log whenever convenient, using i_ate.  At will i can query 
the system, using nutrient_status, to see how my diet matches some 
preset target (such as that suggested by the CR/AN diet).  If i'm not 
meeting my target i can use what_should_i_eat to suggest a food or foods 
to bring me up to the target.


   The difficult part would be correctly entering your foods eaten into 
the diet tracker.  When cooking at home it's relatively easy, but when 
you eat food that others have prepared it's often difficult to assess 
the ingredients and their nutrient content.


   Other than that it's a simple database application.




   (Preemptive flame retardant:  I understand that the diet plan of the 
Caloric Restriction method is intended to be used in conjunction with an 
exercise program, and that the system described above does nothing to 
help you with the exercise regimen.)




   Bodies are machines.  Food is fuel and spare parts.  This is an 
attempt at rational food management.

  IAN: Check it out, the ACLU (http://www.aclu.org) 
  News is all about the legalization of cannabis:
  http://www.aclu.org/forms/nytimesad051298.html 

  Also be sure to check out Goddard's Anti-Author-
  itarian Journal hemp and anti-drug-war suite:
  http://www.erols.com/igoddard/journal.htm#WAR 

  The ACLU Spotlight (Spring 98) is also all about
  the herb and non-violence toward those using it.
  The article states that in an ACLU poll, 79% of
  the public supported legal medical cannabis. I've
  seen many other polls on that topic and all are
  around 75% for. Many polls on the legalization
  of drugs per se score as high as 40%. Now think 
  about it, are 75% of the drug-related programs 
  on TV pro-legal medical hemp? Are 40% pro-legal-
  ization of drugs? I'd say around 1% max. Virtu-
  ally all pump out the Govt hysteria as if they 
  were milled out directly from the FBI and DEA.

  The facts dictate that the major media does not 
  cater to the market. Any business that sought to 
  fill consumer demand would respond to a 40-75% 
  public vote of "yes" with a product designed to 
  accommodate such public sentiment. It's only too 
  clear that the major media, as if it were one 
  single entity, caters to a very small clientele 
  centralized in a few dozen buildings in downtown 
  Washington DC. The major media, or more properly
  defined as the GovtMedia, is in fact nothing more
  than a office of the Federal government. GovtMedia
  "journalism" is nothing more then the verbatim re-
  petition of the latest Federal Govt press release.

SO you admit it. However, you don't seem to answer the question as to why anyone
would invent anything if they didn't get paid for it. Name me one civilization in
which there was a similar level of invention as there currently is in the present
day, yet did not protect the intellectual property of inventors? You can't can
you?

Ok, this is obvious. What benefit is it to ME that somebody is benefitting from
my invention without paying me for the favor?  Altruism aside, you still cannot
answer this question because you automatically assume that others benefitting
from my intelligence without paying me for it gives me some sort of net benefit.
I don't put much value in the only benefit being that some cheapskates think that
I am some 'cool dude'.

This is the central fallacy of your argument. You treat an invention as a
monopoly product of a monopoly inventor.  In fact, in any idea market, there are
almost always several ways to accomplish something. Technology A, technology B
and technology C, all of which solve problem #1, may be invented by entirely
different people, and thus, you have a competetive market for technologies to
accomplish a certain thing. I ran into this in the energy saving lighting market
several years ago. A may have only half of the up front cost of B, but is twice
as expensive to operate over time. They may have identical costs, and are only
different in maybe their aesthetic value, or maybe those are identical as well.
In any event, your problem is that you treat solutions (i.e. inventions) as
monopoly items, when they are not. Only PROBLEMS are unique. There are almost
always several ways to solve a problem.

Yes, if I were Max, I'd seek to force by threat of legal action Dr. Carrol to get
on with it, as being associated by accusation on that page as being loopy like
many of the other things on that page (then again, he also plans on debunking
'flourescent lighting', which would be rather odd, it works, doesn't it?) is bad
enough in and of itself.

Yes. Many religionists find extropy/transhumanism to go hand in hand with more
liberal christian transcendentalism. Where you find dissonance is when an
authoritarian religionist understands the libertarian implications of
transhumanism, and the threat they pose to their black and white narrow minded
views.

Depends on what the present utility of the visor is and whether you have someplace
else to stick the hat while you are doing something for which it gets in the way.

Actually, I've found it to be traversible simply via a good application of reading
and humor, though pot helps, I suppose, though  I think that going through a
stressful period of any kind tends to force the mind to open itself to new ideas
in order to survive, its the old adapt or die instinct.

Running simulations, dreamCAD, and intuitive extrapolations requires both high IQ

In Japan, 'love detectors' mean mate is just a bleep away 


Copyright © 1998 Nando.net
Copyright © 1998 Reuters News Service 


TOKYO (May 15, 1998 08:26 a.m. EDT http://www.nando.net) - When would-be
lovers in Japan meet that special someone these days, they can truly say
bells have rung.

Or, more properly, bleeped.

A love detector that bleeps when the chance of romance comes near has taken
the Japanese market by storm, ringing up sales unseen since a distant
cousin, the "Tamagotchi," burst on the scene two years ago.

But while the Tamagotchi -- an electronic virtual pet that has to be "fed"
and "cleaned" by punching buttons -- was about platonic care, the
"Lovegety" is about love, love, love.

The egg-shaped device comes in male and female versions. One has a blue
underside and the other pink, and they are small enough to fit in a hand.

Owners can set the device to show display lights according to whether they
are in the mood for a simple chat, ready to sing karaoke, or want to go all
the way up to the "Get2" mode, in which anything the couple wants goes.

When a male Lovegety and a female Lovegety come within 4.5 meters (15 feet)
of each other, a high-pitched bleeper goes off, alerting the owners to a
possible rendezvous.

Neither responds to the same sex.

Once a hopeful couple has homed in on each other, a delicate social ritual
ensues as they size each other up and, if mutually agreeable, try to match
Lovegety program modes. When harmony reigns, the machines flash green.

"Men wanting to meet women, and women wanting to meet men - it's a
universal theme, and this toy is here to make the whole process easier,
less embarrassing," said Takeya Takafuji, at the Tokyo branch of Erfolg,
the firm that makes them.

The devices are certainly proving an attraction for reserved Japanese.
Priced at 2,900 yen - around $25 - some 350,000 have been sold since they
hit the stores this February.

Men have bought more than half, said Takafuji, because "Japanese men are
very shy."

The birth of Lovegety came when an insurance salesman friend of Takafuji's
said it would be nice to have a gadget that let people meet painlessly and
understand each other's feelings in a flash.

Takafuji took the idea to the president of Erfolg -- "success" in German --
and after a year of development, Lovegety was ready to strut its stuff.

Lovegety's runaway success was a shock that has given a massive shot in the
arm to the six-year-old company, which was originally a manufacturer of
modems and producer of Internet pages.

Takafuji said the huge success last year of Bandai Co Ltd's Tamagotchi
paved the way for the Lovegety.

She said the company hopes to sell three million of the love machines.

Plans are also afoot for a deluxe model by which prospective lovers can
talk to each other at a distance of 100 meters (yards).

The company plans to start sales of the device in Britain in several months
and is also talking with distributors in Hong Kong.

Many happy relationships have already resulted from use of the Lovegety,
Takafuji said, although nobody appears to have tied the knot yet.

"But I personally know of at least 10 couples, so there is always hope."

In the Extropian society, is the core principle:

"We acknowledge only those truths that are useful."

Such seems to be the consensus, stated in so many 
words, of some of the members of this list. If so,
then truth is a subset of the set of "utility" (U),
and as such, x is a member of U if and only if x 
is useful. So the Extropian principle would be:

"We acknowledge only those things that are useful."

The Nazi Party found the extermination of all who 
disagreed with their agenda very useful and adhered
faithfully to the utility-first principle that many 
on the ExI list adhere to. Does ExI = Nazism? I say 
no! I believe it is not the right ExI principle. I 
believe that to the extent we are directed to that 
principle we are infected with totalitarian memes.

I have advocated utilitarianism, but 
I think there may be a higher principle.

With a scientific definition of truth (like perhaps,
X = truth if f:X->Y = f(a)=f(a'), which is to say, X 
is the truth if the mapping of X on to the physical 
world Y is a one-one function, i.e., that X is the 
truth if X accurately models the physical reality 
without contradiction) then what's wrong with an 
Extropian "truth first" principle? Maybe some-
thing is wrong with it, I'm not God, but 
should this not be defined logically? 
But then that would be truthful... no?
What is the logical case against truth?

In the case of countering national socialism, the 
utility (appealing to the utilitarian) of truth-
first is that it is not true that your agenda, or 
your well-being, is maximized by the initiation of 
aggression upon other humans. Einstein escaped the 
Nazis, how many Einstein's did not? Even more, not 
killing people but using them as slaves also does 
not maximize the well-being of slaveholders versus
a society in which all are free to come and go. 
The descendants of slave holders are better off 
because of free markets, not antebellum slavery.

In sum, I believe truth can lead to Extropia!

What's wrong with a truth-first principle?

Ian, I wasn't referring to your theory but to your obsessive need to
relate it to everything you say.  Almost every post you make manages
to turn the subject into some off-hand remark about "A equals not -A."
 And how those people with their "goofy" ideas label you a "crackpot."
 Maybe your ideas haven't been given a fair chance but do you really
have to resort to forcing them on us?  Do you really think the sort of
pompous grandstanding you so frequently display will make people take
you seriously?

You may have noticed that when I "Yaked miserably against truth as the
goal of inquiry" I did not repeatedly bring the subject up in separate
posts.  Not once did I say, "well thinking that automation will lead
to unemployment is almost as bad as those people who think truth is
the ultimate goal of science."  To be honest I find your form of
"debate" offensive, much more offensive than the colourful use of
language that I so elegantly displayed.

I'm not at all opposed to truth and inquiry.  You turned that
particular post (on the dangers of presenting scientific truth as
absolute) into another of your "identity theory" crusades.  Many of
the posts I make to this list are simply ideas, most of the time
they're wrong.  Sometimes I'll post a great idea and someone will
dismiss it without thought, but why become so obsessed with proving
them wrong?  Focus your attention on your theory, not it's opposition.

--Wax

P.S. Please don't take this as an attack on your person, just some
constructive criticism (I hope).  And, if it sounds deadly serious
(i.e. temper tantrum) please forgive me.

SHO--
I belive nothing to be wrong with the principal, it is just that 
people have been taught to think 1 way and if another way of thinking 
should arise then they are told that way is wrong and not to belive 
that way of thinking.  

---I do not side with the Nazi's but look at the 
good things they did for the world.  the built the Autobahn, 
experiminted heavily in medicine (good and bad, which has helped the 
U.S. in serving out it's death penalties), they dabbled with 
macinery, and much more.---You see this is my view, sure they did 
lots of wrong but I have altered my way of thinking to see the good 
in people, and I try to stay on task as such.

If we are talking Gov't, they should be the most flexiable 
orginization in the universe.  One reason they are not is that THEY 
HAVE FORGOT THAT THEY WORK FOR US, WE DO NOT WORK FOR 
THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  At some time i think they branded us with 
the assumption that it is the other way around, that is just not 
true.

If people had an open mind they could see that "truth is in the eye of 
the beholder".--this has always, will always, and should always be 
true (in my eyes).

To this I answer:  Do you honestly believe that WWII was the best thing
that could have happened to Germany?  Wouldn't the German government be
leaps and bounds better off if that whole little fiasco had never
happened?  Besides, think about all the "Einsteins" which Germany COULD
have kept, but lost thanks to the Nazi holocaust!

To put this in a more concise logical fashion, your critique of
utilitarianism in favor of "truth" USES utility as its criterion of moral
value.  If using a one-to-one truth function brings about optimal utility,
as you argue, then by all means we should adopt it; but this is BECAUSE of
utilitarianism, not in spite of it.

My problem with truth-first as a PRINCIPLE appears when the pursuit of
truth is actually antithetical to human utility, in which case I maintain
that utilitarianism ought to win out.  The holocaust, for example, was not
a failure of utilitarianism as a principle, but a failure in application
of a good principle.  Had they correctly evaluated the consequences of
their actions, they would have seen that WWII was the last thing Germany
really needed, and that persecuting the Jews was a waste of their own
utility as well as their victims.

Compare this example to a thought-experiment.  If the pursuit of truth is
more important than human utility, then we should pursue truth even to the
expense of human utility.  So even if further studies in, say, science are
miserable to us, and where TECHNOLOGY would serve us better than further
studies of astronomical bodies, we would still be morally obligated to
pursue truth.

<thought experiment> Suppose you are studying an important effect in
quantum mechanics, but one which can be put off until later without
significant losses in utility.  Then, you look out the window and you
see: A Drowning Child (tm) [the philosopher's favorite play toy!]. 
You could save that child now and study quantum effects later, 
OR you could just ignore the child and continue the pursuit of the
one-to-one truth function.  Despite the fact that utilitarianism demands
that you save that child, truth-first demands that truth comes first, and
utility second.  You ignore the child, and finish observing your quantum
effect before even considering saving him/her. </thought experiment>

This moral conclusion is unsound by my thinking, and so I challenge its
underlying premise: that truth comes before utility.  Instead, we should
say that the pursuit of truth is aligned with utility most of the time,
and so the pursuit of truth is useful to that extent, but when they are
set against one another, utility comes first.

 More accurately, SOME truths may be members of U, 
 or it could be that NO truths are members of U, 
 because that principle is "utility first," or

Before you all get involved in arguing about this, let me note that this is
NOT a core principle. In fact it's not a principle at all. Where did you
get this from, Ian? Perhaps it's a view of some people on this list, but
it's hardly a principle of "the Extropian society" whether that refers to
ExI to the the Extropian community as a whole.

The media is generally rabidly anti-drug legalization, but in San
Francisco we have one talk radio station (KGO) with many hosts who are
sympathetic to the idea of liberalization of our drug laws and one host
who advocates total legalization (Gene Burns, who describes himself as a
libertarian). I also see advocates of legalization pop up on some of the
major "talking heads" shows from time to time. It's not as bleak as you
think.

   IAN: I did not mean to imply that * was * a core
   core principle of ExI, not at all! My point is to 
   raise the issue of should a principle, or "prime 
   directive" of an Extropian community be "utility 
   first" or should it be "truth first." I believe 
   this addresses the utilitarianism vs some other 
   principle issue, and the broad issue of truth.

   I've generally adhered to a libertarian/utilitarian
   paradigm and believe that utilitarianism generally 
   defines a principle, or prime directive, of the 
   humanist community, and it seems to me from 
   discourse on the list, that the consensus 
   adheres to that humanist principle.

   I believe that the possibility that the false
   can be inserted into the set of "useful things"
   not to mention atrocities, renders a "utility 
   first" paradigm unwise and to be rejected.

   What makes libertarian economics the logical 
   goal is not that it is useful, but that its
   framework is truthful, such as defined by 
   Ludwig von Mises and the Austrian school.

   As such, we need not define a "utilibertarian"
   paradigm, but instead a truthitarian paradigm.
   It may all be sematics, particularly if we can 
   show that truth = utility, but I'm not so sure.

   IAN: Why should it be acceptable for X to

   ad hominem? Why should the scoundrels who 
   commit such intellectual crime be ignored
   and logical inquirers attacked?

   It's the goal of inquiry to make observa-
   tions, make claims, and test them against 
   counter claims. But to react with cursing
   and name calling is an affront to inquiry.

The flaw in all this is the assumption that the fate of the poor is deeper
poverty. Yes, the rich get richer, and faster than the poor get richer,
and if the rich get richer faster, the rich accumulate an increasing
fraction of all the wealth - so eventually the top 1% may have 99% of the
resources, but the average wealth of the bottom 1% in the future may be
where the top 10% are now. To paraphrase George Orwell, we all get more
prosperous, and some of us prosper more than others...

  IAN: I think that that gets to the heart of 
  the matter pertaining to why truth is seen 
  as an unreliable standard... my truth, their
  truth, this truth, that truth. The same sub-
  jective morass applies to utility, their 
  utility, my utility, this, that...

  But this picture paints a false "same as"
  relation between utility and truth. While
  utility can always be defined as subjec-
  tive (even a useful thing like a spoon 
  is not useful if you prefer to eat with
  your hands), but truth is no so subjec-
  tive. If all can see that it's raining
  outside, but one guy says it's a sunny
  and dry day, we may say, "Well that's
  the truth for him," but I'm comfortable
  is saying that it is not THE truth, and
  thus I feel we can say truth is objective.

  I believe that we can have a scientific
  definition of truth (a one-one or maybe
  onto function, or both) that eliminates
  in one fell swoop this morass of subjec-
  tive truth,  which I think is a direct
  threat to science and ethical standards
  as this leads to a "utility first" frame-
  work that leads to "anything goes."

There's another possibility here. About 11,000 years ago there was a
huge flood in the Northwest, where the Snake and Columbia rivers are.
A very large lake had formed, dammed by an arm of the glacial ice sheet.
One fine day, the dam broke, and in one day, the coulees were formed.

A similar event may have happened with the Eurasian ice sheet, along
the series of water bodies (Black Sea, Caspian, Aral) being blocked
and suddenly released. This would create the Flood, and the motion
of such a huge amount of water may have indeed caused considerable
rainfall. 

And (further out), perhaps an asteroid crashed into this lake instead....

It distresses me to learn that you don't

useless truth.  --JRM

Another success for sf extrapolation!  Brian W. Aldiss described just such
a device in his ammusing 1961 novel THE PRIMAL URGE - except that in that
case it was wired to your forehead, and monitored circulating hormones,
surely the next step for Japanese with the yen.

Hmm, I thought this thread withered away weeks ago...one can only hope.

The flaw of your statement is I never once assumed anything, most especially 'that
the poor would get poorer.'  Poverty, per say, has nothing to do with it.  It has
to do with the means to providing for your own existence when increasing segments
of the economy become automated.  Being that I made no assumptions, I instead
asked if any there are any free-marketeers, who could explain in as specific terms
as possible, what people will do as more and more jobs get automated?

For example, what will the millions who are currently occupied in the retail
sector do as this sector fades away from a proliferation of online transactions
and e-cash?  Although some did answer this question with some success, others
assumed they would simply find other jobs (w/o specifying anything), while others
said they would most likely perish.  Neither response lives up to the challenge I
initially offered:

----------
I'm looking for optimistic free-market mechanisms that yield positive scenarios to
the following questions.

If people are unemployed through increasing automation, how will they support
themselves?

For example, if the millions of people being automated out of the retail sector do
find other jobs, what what might those jobs be?  Assuming there is a market for
them, can you say in all honesty that they *all* have the aptitude to be
scientists, artists, designers, or engineers?  If not, then what will they do to
support themselves?

These are not an assumptions, these are questions - answer them if you can.

Paul

The Extropian Principles are big on "we believes" (i.e. BEST DO IT SO)
but lack the "why we believe" that so many Extropians seem confused
about.  So why hasn't Extropianism got a core value, utilitarian or
otherwise?  Why exactly do Extropians seek BEST DO IT SO?  Eh?

I read this last night.  Thanks for the reference, Keith.  This is a very good
article and primed my appetite even more to read Wilson's new book,
"Consilience" (just as soon as I finish David Brin's "The Transparent Society"
and Jim Halperin's "The First Immortal" -- which I need to do before I'm on
the same podium with them in 2 weeks!).

I was also fascinated by the interview with Wilson I found at the Atlantic's
website.  Wilson seems to be on the same wavelength as many of us here; that
we are on the verge of a "New Enlightenment".  He very explicitly states that
the best course for our civilization is a conscious revisitation of the
program of the Enlightenment of the 18th Century.  However, I found his deep
biological conservatism quite surprising.  Wilson states quite explicitly that
he expects genetic alteration of the human form to stop at the eradication of
disease, that human progress will, for some unstated reasons, slow down, that
we will become engrossed with an immutable "human nature" and that we will not
pursue space colonization.  All these ideas seem utterly inconsistent with his
clear view of the evolutionary basis of human nature and also incompatible
with the Enlightenment's valuation of an ideal of progress.  Has anyone read
"Consilience" yet and, if so, does he rationalize this surprising conservatism
there?

It shouldn't.  I simply find your method of "not ignoring" to be
excessive.  I think you would have more luck if you tried a different
approach.  There's an on-going fight between you and those who don't
agree with you, and from my perspective you seem to be the one to
provoke the fight.  As I said, I think you should put your ideas
before upstaging those who don't agree with them.  Correct me if I'm
wrong.

Again, I'm terribly sorry - what I meant was to say, "this isn't
getting you anywhere."  My post was a virtual 'glass of water in the
face' to snap you out of it.

This would actually be a good idea to make a website about, a kind of
expansion of the principles where they are discussed and analysed in
depth. I have just finished my own website with transhuman philosophy
and history in Swedish, and I found it invaluable to actually try to
see how it all hangs together. An english extropian version might be
very useful.

   IAN: Your point is that function = utility.
   But we could have two functions, (1) a truth
   fuction that maps physical reality, and (2) a
   Big Lie function that masks physical reality.
   Both are useful to some, but only one is true.
   If "utility first" is my directive, I can choose
   either; if "truth first" is my principle I can
   choose only one. This limits my options, but 
   as a rule it maximizes social outcomes, which 
   is utilitarian, but utility comes second.

   What is more, since there is only one reality,
   yet myriad claims about it, the Big Lie function
   will be useful to most people and thus the demand
   for the utility of BLF will be greater than for 
   TF, so if our directive is  "whatever works to
   promote your idea," Big Lies will win the day.

   When I apply a "truth first" principle based 
   up a scientific defintion of truth, I submit 
   to a "higher authority" that will judge my 
   ideas (about any topic) accordingly. If I
   apply "utility first" then it's whatever
   I can get away with to promote my ideas.

   IAN: An interesting dilemma, but I think it 
   may be a false dilemma. Maybe I cannot swim,
   and I have no rope, or just don't care, so
   saving the drowning child is not useful to 
   me, afterall, that kid was a real nuisance.

   So it doesn't follow that utility dictates 
   that I stop my work and save the child.

   But if I have an axiom, "All human life is 
   sacred," and I see a life in eminent peril,
   I say "I believe that axiom is true, thus 
   I must stop my work and save that child." 
   It seems to me that the act of stopping my
   work to save another must rest on a truth.

   IAN: It is TRUE that Germany would be better off 
   if they did not start WWII and commit mass murder.
   It was useful for the Nazis to mask that truth, 
   for their goals were not making Germany better
   but enemy extermination and global conquest.

Well put. The poorest people in America now are living better than the
poorest people of 100 years ago. This is in a material sense and as relates
to healthcare, nutrition, etc.

I think that there's a different level of poverty that is growing in our
society. Spiritual or mental poverty appears to be on the rise. The worst
cases I have heard of are in the CHA's high rise slums in Chicago. These
places tend to collect the most impoverished people the world has ever
seen. They have heat, electricity, plumbing, TVs, phones, mail service,
public education, elevators (when they work), cars, public transportation,
free medical clinics, and welfare payments.

These 'new poor' do not have hope, or respect, in many cases no self
respect. They tend to become criminals and addicts at high rates.

I don't believe this rise in 'poverty' has anything to do with wealth and
its' distribution. I think it has everything to do with the way our
government has handled traditional poverty. The 'war on some drugs' is a
prime candidate for blame here, as is the welfare system.

Scientific truth: experiments can be devised and performed that give the
same asnwer again and again, with some statistical variances. All can agree
on the results. No opinions are needed.

Scientific truths are absolute, be they 'useful' or not.

Philosophic truth: beliefs, tenets of religions, political platforms.
Impossible to cleanly define what the 'truth' is for any but a small group
of like minded poeple.

Usefulness of this kind of truth is directly related to who you talk to..

Retail will not die for a long time. You will find it difficult to email
fried chicken, for example. Until there is no more need for transportation
for people to go places, there will still be stores to cater to them. It's
lots more fun to shop in person, anyway. For retail to die out, we must
postulater a worls where no one leaves their homes..

>If people are unemployed through increasing automation, how will they support
>themselves?

If automation reaches the ultimate level of 'replicators' there will be no
reason to support oneself. You can go back to the 'hunter/gatherer' level
of life, since there will be anything you want available for the taking.
This excludes land, unless we get cheap space transport. Land will be the
only thing in short supply.

Yes, I am postulating a 'free' energy source, and I am also not projecting
beyond the next 100 years.

With universal automation, the point is that there will be no need for most
of today's jobs. If you can get anything you want for free, why do you need
to make a living?

I think the bigger problem will be keeping the masses of displaced people
content with their lives..
Many will spend their entire lives in VR, living their dreams. No different
than losing oneself in a novel today, except in the future we will be able
to do it forever, if desired.

The transition form today's society to the future is a problem that must be
addressed. I am still puzzling on that..

I agree that repeatability and transparency are a big part of science.

>Scientific truths are absolute, be they 'useful' or not.

I agree in regards to truth of any flavor.  I do think that one can't put any
adjective before truth and mean what is commonly meant by truth -- which
I take to be when an idea corresponds to existence.  Thus, "religious
truths" and "mythical truths" are either oxymorons or metaphors or something
other than a literal interpretation of the term would have you believe.

>Usefulness of this kind of truth is directly related to who you talk to..

The problem here, of course, is that your view of scientific truth is a
philosophy.  You believe certain truths are on firmer grounds than 
others and we should focus on these.  Is this not a philosophy?  It
seeks to define and guide inquiry into what is true and even has
a value system inherent in it.

I do not think truth is completely separable into neat areas -- science,
philosophy, politics, ect.  I think philosophy is basic beliefs.  By "basic
beliefs," I mean stuff like the nature of existence and of knowledge.
I consider these the What and the How of philosophy.  The nature
of existence tells us, in general (because the sciences and history
tell us specific facts) what is, while the nature of knowledge would
give us methods of knowing as such (whether of general or specific
facts).

Does anyone agree with me here?

Cheers!

Chuck -  I highly insist that you read the entire thread as it evolved over the
last month, since it is obvious you haven't.  Your comments are equivalent to
jumping towards the end of a conversation that has been going on for hours - your
missing the context.  From this point forward I will not respond to any more
uninformed comments made on this thread, nor any comments of mine taken out of
context.

I'm a first born. My younger brother and I are quite different: I'm
theoretical and he is quite practical, I tend to explore many areas
while he focus on what needs to be learned and done. It is quite
telling that I'm a computer scientist/neuroscientist and he is a civil
engineer with computer specialization.

I recognize the same combination of openness in some directions and
closedness in others in myself.

I think we humans tend to complicate our psychology on our own. We can
channel our anxieties into certain schemas and deal with them in
different ways. So even if you have a high basic anxiety level you
might develop coping strategies focussing it in certain directions and
having broad and very relaxed perspectives otherwise. Maybe this is
why birth order seems to be a less strong predictor among humans than
in rats.

I'm off to pursue new and better things and will no longer have time
to participate in this list, so I bid you all a tearful goodbye.  But
before I go I'd just like to thank you all for using your brilliant
ideas to shape me into the hideous monster I am today.  There was once
a thread on this list that went something like, "when was the last
time an Extropian post changed your life."  And I'd have to say that
from the day I joined (just two years ago) to present day you have all
succeeded in challenging and changing (for the better?) everything
that defines me.

I'd especially like to thank:

Max More - the first time I heard about Extropy was when I saw you on
television (talking about longevity with Natasha I think).  So I'd
especially like to thank you for using a ridiculously easy to remember
name, it makes web searches less tedious.  Oh!  And there's that
little thing of starting all this in the first place!

Natasha Vita More - the search for "Max More" returned your web site
instead.  So my first exposure to Extropian thought was through your
writing and your art.  Can't think of a better way myself.

John K. Clark - for brilliantly rebutting every counter claim I could
make against anarcho-capitalism and uploading.  The former changed my
thinking forever, and now I'm a rich and ruthless man.  The latter
just gave me a headache.

And there's a whole bunch of others who have contributed more subtle
changes to my thinking (Anders, Damien, Lee Daniel, et al).  So thank
you all too.

And if I ever said anything to offend any of you (who me?) I really,
really, really didn't mean it and I'm very, very, very sorry.

Good bye, and good luck to you all!

I know what you mean by the first part of the above, but I think the way
you put it could be misleading. The Principles are not big on "we believe",
except in the most general sense. The Extropian Principles -- by my
deliberate design -- do *not* specify particular beliefs. They only express
a few general attitudes and approaches and values that Extropians hold. It
is not intended as a system of beliefs. The idea is to present a coherent
grouping of attitudes and values without restricting the specific beliefs
of Extropians. Thus, the Principles do not say which methods Extropian
should use to extend life, they do not say that Extropians should sign up
for cryonics, they do not specify the details of a economic or political
system, they do not specify how an operating system should be designed for
maximum intelligence, etc.

The lack of "why we believe" is also deliberate. There will be a continuing
healthy disagreement about why each of us holds these values and attitudes.
I have no interest in pushing Extropians into a particular way or reason
for holding these values. Some of us see these values as utterly arbitrary
-- just ones we happen to prefer; others of us think that these values can
be objectively validated; others think values lie somewhere in between
these extremes. Some of us think that knowledge is based on certain,
axiomatic foundations, others take a pancritical rationalist approach.

This absence of specifying "why we believe" or the details of "what we
believe" is a feature, not a bug! I intended that from the start as a
preventive measure against dogmatism (something that can threaten any
philosophy of life). (That's also one reason why the dishonest use of
"cult" in regard to Extropian thinking pisses me off so much!)

Discussion of these specific questions among us is a good thing, but I want
to make sure that we understand that the Principles do not and should not
attempt to define these answers.

Onward!

Greetings.

I try to remain fairly quiet on this list,  reading and learning are
more important to me than trying to express my own paradigm(s). 
However,  recently I've had to limit my time with this list,  and the
other three that I'm on (Church of the Virus, Advanced Freedom
Solutions, FringeWare News) because of final projects for my Freshman
year of college.

Upon returning home,  I noticed that I'd amassed approximately 2000
unread emails from these four lists.  I'm now in the process of sorting
through them all,  pulling meaningful quotes along the way. 

I will notify this list again when I have finished,  and will then
proceed in HTMLing these quotes - posting the URL.

The interesting thing is that I've decided not to credit these quotes to
anyone,  and sorting through them will (most likely) be great fun for
all. 

Take care,

Oh yes,  I almost forgot... I'm looking for a movie file of a cube being
manipulated in 4 dimensions.  I've got movies of 5D and 6D cubes,  and I
can upload them to a server if people would care to see them... but I'm
still looking for a cube in 4D's of rotation.

A good question, I look forward to hear what others respond with.

I think a valuable method is to minimize real distractions. With real
distractions I mean everything that makes you switch task - a small
irritating sound isn't necessarily a real distraction, but the
presence of another task (like answering email :-) that promises some
reward or fulfills a duty will incite you to switch task when your
concentration falters a bit. The solution is to place yourself in
situations where there are few other tasks possible. For example, I
often read research papers on the bus or trains, since there are no
other interesting tasks to do and the environment can be tuned
out. Reading them at home is much harder, there is too much to do.

I'm starting to think that windowing and multitasking is bad for my
concentration, they promote having dozens of tasks in the air at once
and hence disrupt my concentration.

  IAN: Good observation, I agree. I think 
  that is why the utilitarian vs not issue
  is important, as that is defining why X.
  "Whys" can be long winded, but they can
  also be codified into principled axioms.

For a variety of different reasons, none of which are necessarily
compatible with each other; just as it should be.

I doubt extropianism is justified the same way in moret han two or three
different individuals within the group; trying to agree on a universal
moral justification may even be ANTITHETICAL to the whole extropian
concept for some (a la pancritical rationalists.)  So I'd just as well
leave this topic alone.

Subject: ETHICS: Utility First--> Fraud
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Sender: postmaster@extropy.com

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com


If my principle is utility first and I have
a hypothesis about what nature is, then I do
research, gathering data about nature, add 
it all up, and lo and behold the numbers 
suggest my hypothesis is not true, I 
have one of two options:

1) conclude that my hypothesis is not true.

2) alter the data to make my theory appear true.

Option 1 adheres to a "truth first me second" 
principle, option two adheres to a "me first
truth maybe later," principle. A "me first" 
principle is obviously useful to me, so a 
"utility first, truth maybe" standard
will automatically promote fraud
and abolish a code of ethical
conduct that is the only
hope for science & humanity...

I think that we can say that a "utility first"
principle is a definitionally open door to fraud
(as just one example in a field of possible worst 
case examples), and fraud is an icon of that which
I feel an Extropian community should be against. A
"truth first" ethic instills a standard of ethics:
a principle which the individual must subordinate
him/herself for "the greater good," which, lets 
face it, is a defining principle of any com-
minity, that I will agree to abide by a
set of rules that includes your rights.

I think that Daniel is correct to observe the 
utilitarian aspect of a truth-first principle,
but this aspect is just as well as saying,
"Utility dictates that some other standard
than utility be the prime directive."

Utility without ethics leads to Nazism. Ethics
is a broad and subjective field of ideas, but I 
believe that we can extract one solid, reliable,
and objective principle from it: truth, defined
as a one-one mapping between "ideas and claims"
and "physical reality."

I think you misunderstood me.  My point was simply that your reasons for
accepting a "truth-first" principle were utilitarian in origin: that
people would be better off if we all accepted "truth-first."  Well, if we
WOULD be better off thanks to "truth-first," then utilitarianism demands
that we act according to "truth-first;" thus we would accept it BECAUSE of
utilitarisnism, not in spite of it.

But, as I think we're both agreed, Big Lies are BAD for us in the long
run.  Therefore, according to utilitarianism, we should avoid Big Lies.

How about the benevolence principle, an invention (I think) of JS Mill?

Uhm...  SINCE this is a thought experiment, I can always tweak it.  I
should have mentioned that you are ABLE to save the child, if you decided
to, at a trivial loss of utility to yourself.  (This was actually part of
the reason why I mentioned the "Drowning Child (tm):" ehtical philosophers
REGULARLY use this as a thought experiment: you could either save the
child or do something else.  Which do you do?)

It does if you CAN save the child, and if saving the child would result in
minimal utility loss for you.

What you're talking about is extensional equivalence, which is what
happens when two separate ethical theories require the same actions. 
Interesting questions arise when two ethical theories are COMPETELY
extensionally equivalent, but use different premises and arguments to
reach their conclusions.  However, as I think thought experiment can
show, truth and utility are NOT completely extensionally equivalent, and
when they disagree, utility ought to win out.

OK, let's stretch the imagination for a moment and pretend that the reason
Naziism happened was because, and only because, they thought it would make
the people better off.  Otherwise, you're not criticizing utilitarianism,
but something more akin to nationalism, which we both agree is a silly
moral premise. 

If Germany WAS acting solely to make the German people better off, then we
can see clearly that they made a mistake in that regard: Germany was made
worse off by WWII, not better.  As a definition of utility, if something
makes you worse off, then it is not compatible with your utility.
Therefore, I make the trivial conclusion that mass murder was NOT useful
to Germany, because it caused WWII, which went quite badly for Germany.

Utilitarianism does NOT demand, nor could it in any way be construed to
support, Naziism.  (It may have been used at the time as rhetoric, but we
can now see that people who argued that Naziism would make the Germans
better off were wrong, and that utilitarianism was NOT on their side.)

   IAN: This point Dan raises is the best case 
   for utility first. So is it truth or utility? 
   I think it's a false delima resolved by seeing
   that utility-first applies to one set of cases
   and truth-first applies to another set of cases.

   In the case above, the issue pertains to the 
   scarcity of funding, in which case scientific 
   research should put utility first, however, 
   and this gets to the heart of the matter,
   NEVER can "truth first" not be a prime 
   directive of research. So we must have 
   two sets here and no contradiction.

   First, observe that truth-first must always 
   be a directive in the research to which a 
   utility-first directive also applies since 
   any research into improved technologies 
   that is based on not truths will be even 
   MORE wasteful than research on the stars, 
   which could bump into a real gold mine!

   So I think that "truth first" applies to 
   the set of "all inquiry," and "utility
   first" applies to the set of "all expen-
   ditures below ideal levels of resources."

   By making this observation that truth-first
   applies to X set and utility-first applies 
   to Y set, I believe that I have removed the
   basis of confusion as to which ethic is best.

First, if choosing 2 would hurt humanity, then utilitarianism demands that
we choose 1, not 2.  You're arguing against EGOISM, the philosophy that
each agent should make choices in such a way as to maximize his-her OWN
utility, as opposed to utilitarianism which argues for greatest utility
for greatest number.  Utilitarianism is, for this reason, often criticized
that it ISN'T "me first" enough: that it seems to require us to make some
rather extreme sacrifices for the well-being of others.  I disagree with
these thinkers, but one thing I CAN say is that there's no possible way to
construe this philosophy as a "me first" principle.

Not at all, it is simply a statement that utlitarianism and truth-first
are extensionally equivalent.  Since utilitarianism is a philosophy of
action and total consequence, it states that acting according to
truth-first is just as good as doing the utilitarian thing, BECAUSE THEY
AGREE ON WHAT THE RIGHT THING IS.

> Utility without ethics leads to Nazism.

This is silly.  This would only sort of be an acceptable conclusion if you
counted Jews as non-people (an obvious Big Lie) or if WWII didn't happen.

Since Jews ARE people and WWII DID happen, utilitarianism states that
Naziism is WRONG.

Obviously, since your conclusions on what utilitarianism demands are
completely wrong, your rejection of its conclusions do not refute
utilitarianism.

Goddard, utilitarianism is a consequentialist philosophy, which means that
it evaluates choices and actions based on their consequences, just as you
do and have.  It states that an action is right if and only if it results
in the best possible consequences.  It evaluates consequences based on the
utility of all people, where utility is defind as their happiness,
satisfaction, etc.  One consequence is better than another if it results
in greater happiness for a greater number.  Thus, the right action results
in the greatest utility for the greatest number.

THIS is the philosophy you have so maligned, and so completely
misunderstood.  Obviously, Naziism is completely incompatible with
utilitarianism:  it involves killing people, which is bad, AND it results
in great unhappiness for the German people when WWII rolls around, which
is also bad.  Utilitarianism DOES have problems, but supporting Naziism is
not one of them.

The "core value" of extropy for me
equates to expanding awareness. Rather
than opposing entropy, extropy
transcends it. This resembles the way
life transcends death; not by
opposition, but by transcendant
self-organization.

Can you imagine that real science has no
use for ethics, because real science
tests itself with its own record of
accuracy... its ability to precisely
predict events. Science does not hope.
Science intends to know.

Obviously, science does not exist
separately from brains. But what if it
did?
"If science could talk,
it would whisper in song
like a morning breeze.
If science could touch
it would splash sweet lotion
upon my flesh and bones,
and the stream of it
would soothe, refresh and delight.
If science could see,
it would behold immense
and timeless reveries inside of me
within a heartbeat
sturdy as earth and sea,
and delicate as starlight
reflected in a misty eye.
The scientist's brain remembers shadows
of the would-be-nows
in feather-years of stillness
and dismay.
The scientist's brain knows silence
of the will-be-thens
in vaulted unknown spaces
of the bending land.
The scientist's brain knows suchness;
the stretching fibers
of a textured body singing
the ecstasy of light.
O passion of the quest for truth,
revealing science without end."
--Zulma Divya


"Utility first"? Nay, first find the
science that can free you from every
sort of  teleology.

"ethics first"? Absurd to demarcate good
from bad until you know the point of
doing so.

My own life teaches me that individuals
subordinate themselves to community
standards for entirely selfish reasons.
The myth of altruism persists, I
suppose, because it assuages the
cognitive dissonance of pointless
self-sacrifice.

Not quite. The usefulness of truth
coincides with its ability to provide
value to its adherents. For example: a
company that engages in fraudulant
testing practices knows that it has done
so. Such a company must nevertheless
acknowledge the truth of the matter by
diligently concealing the fraud.

One might suggest as a "prime directive"
the selection of a useful truth over a
useless one. In this case, it appears
somewhat unethical to try to identify
either truth or utility as prime
directives because we've just identified
reason as the prime directive. If it
appears unreasonable to do otherwise,
then we have our proof as well.  --JRM

For what it's worth: I was the third and last born, with a gap of 15 years
between my next youngest brother and myself. My two brothers left the home
when I was about 3 years old, and rivalry with them was never the slightest
consideration.

Unfortunately, I must seriously disagree with you, as treating truth
subjectively is the first step toward the destruction of the concept of
contract law. In any libertarian type society, where there is no
overarching sovereign authority to enforce the public will and contracts
amongst individuals, on individuals, individuals must rely on and protect
in their daily lives the concepts of integrity, honesty, and truth to
ensure that the contracts they make between sovereign individuals are
honored. THis is the essential key to keep a libertarian society from
devolving into chaotic anarchy/civil terror. I think that demanding that
truth for a given be at least agreed to by two soveregn individuals,
otherwize a contract has no meaning, if it means two different things to
two different people. Being strictly utilitarian with regard to truth means
one is merely an opportunist, with no regard for others and with no greater
purpose other than for one's immediate short term profit.

Libertarians know that a stable libertarian society requires that most, if
not all members must have a distinct sense that integrity and honesty
amongst members of the community is most beneficial to every individuals
long term self interest.

Yes, this is the whole reason behind what is termed by many conservatives
as the 'degradation' of society. If everything is subjective, as liberals
are wont to establish as a societal truth, then anything goes. THe
resulting destabilization causes people to prefer more authoritarian
statist measures to return society to 'normalcy'. This is not an accident.
Creating dissafected classes is essential to generating support for
authoritarian statist measures in any society, which is a central strategy
of terrorists and subversive groups in order to generate general sentiment
for their goals, as increasing authoritarian repression of dissafected
classes is essential to creating the atmosphere for a general uprising.
This is standard strategy taught in ChiCom, bolshevik, and other nihilist
guerrilla schools.

   IAN: I agree with you, I was stating the

   Your point about contract law is excellent.

   IAN: I also have wondered if the "watering down"
   of truth is not part of such a totalitarian agenda,
   or, gasp, "conspiracy." Maybe and maybe not, it may
   be taking the issue to a level that's not totally
   necessary in the ground level rebuttal of subjec-
   tive "there is no reliable truth" paradigms.

   Thinking on this issue has made me realize the 
   "ungrounding" that can take place to the extent
   that a "no reliable truth" standard takes over.
   I see this standard approaching on every front.
   If you could lead a population to believe that 
   truth is subjective and there is  no reliable
   truth, they'd be severed from the ability to 
   engage in rational thought and thus prevented
   from independent thought and analysis of the
   the things that their leaders tell them.

   But rather than this being a conspiracy, I 
   think it may be more of an expression of the 
   fluid nature of scientific discovery, perhaps
   nowhere more notably than in quantum physics.
   The nature of the new findings and the rate 
   of redefining old standards may foster just
   the atmosphere necessary for a "no reliable
   truth" paradigm meme to suddenly spread.

   In fact, I've had some strong reactions from
   the "right-wing conspiracy-theory camp" after
   I wrote an essay on TWA 800 and fuzzy logic.
   The idea was expressed that fuzzy logic was
   a conspiracy of the elite to destroy truth 
   and thereby undermine traditional values.
   But that is just irrational paranoia based 
   on total confusion of what fuzzy logic is. 
   Fuzzy simply observes that WORDS do not al-
   ways map onto the physical reality by 100%.
   Fuzzy logic increases analytical accuracy
   and is there an aid to rational thinking.

I would agree.  However, I look at it from a different slant.  SINCE
contract law is good for our long-term utility, we should agree on
objective truth.  Strict utilitarianism demands it.

This is where I must disagree.  I feel like most people are responding to
egoism, the philosophy which states that an action is right if and only if
it maximizes the agent's utility, rather than utilitarianism, which states
that an action is right if and only if it maximizes utility for the
greatest number. 

>From this perspective, we can see that while the EGOIST might act in this
way, (though they might take a little more care for their LONG term
profit, rather than short term profit,) the utilitarian would not.

I agree.  This is why I am a libertarian: because it is the direct logical
conclusion of utilitarianism.

With regard to your point about authoritarianism, I'm sure most liberal
proponents of this form of subjective truth claim to be moving towards
ANARCHO-socialism, or "true" Communism, rather than authoritarian
socialism; I am not so certain that they are completely wrong.  Any
thoughts on this matter would be appreciated.

It does not appear in the FOX network listing for Sunday or this week. Perhaps
it is on another network?

I see your point, defining the distinction between utilitarianism and egoism,
perhaps I am merely the victim of liberal memes which have pretty successfully
dovetailed utilitarianism and egoism in the minds of the general populace. THis
is something that has bothered me in the past. Perhaps we need to find or create
some good counter memes to promote....

While most armchair proponents of anarcho-socialism may have the wide eyed,
devoted beleif that they will wind up in an anarchical communist state, keep in
mind that both the Russians and Chinese thought the same thing prior to their
evolution, or at least included it in their propaganda. I think that it has been
repeatedly and sufficiently demonstrated in the dozens of failed communist
revolutions that while the rank and file may beleive this propaganda whole
heartedly, the hard core leadership of any such movement always tends to prefer
to grab power when it has been sufficiently demonstrated that most people do not
want to live in such an anarchical communist paradise. They find that they need
to shove it down people's throats at the point of a gun, or in the case of Pol
Pot, kill anyone at all who merely has the potential to think for themselves.

An afterthought: I noticed in the news that the IRA, while accepting the new
peace agreement, still maintains as its goal the eventual establishment of a
socialist state in Northern Ireland....I think that this is a good indicator of
their seriousness and honesty in regard to the current agreement...

That was my point! Agreement on the definition of truth is the crux of the
argument. What one calls truth maty be another's empty speculation or
outright falsehood.

As with most of the language, despite what the dictionary says (some times
because of it!) different folks used different definitions.

As far as history goes, remember that the winners usuallyy write the
history books, and even if reports from others survive, it's anyone's guess
how accurate they were. Once all the eyewitnesses die off, history gets
muddy past what artifacts actually survive.

Thanks for the responses to my call for some detailed generation of near-term
scenarios.  I spent some time systematically reviewing the responses this
morning and, as always, I found that it helps to think together!  Some things
pointed out by others seemed so obvious once I saw them.  Some examples:

-- Mark Crosby reminded me of TELEVISION!  Pinpointing the time when this most
influential of mass media begins to merge with what we now think of as PCs and
the web will be an extremely important prognostication point.  I suppose I
have thought about this as happening more effectively once consumer-level VR
becomes ubiquitous, but an earlier merger could cause an acceleration of media
tech developments simply because of the huge consumer power of the television
viewing audience.

-- Paul Hughes pointed out that the web, combined with increasing computer
power might make "ecological accounting" a realistic near-term development.
I'd encountered this idea before, but completely forgot about it in my first
pass.  A comment: I think (1) the "greens" and the big accounting firms would
have to work together somehow to develop some kind of GAAP with this idea
before it became common and (2) some kind of market or governmental impetus
would have to drive it before it was widely adopted.  Perhaps effective
micropayments for resource handling would do the trick.

-- In power technology, Paul Hughes also raised another point that slipped my
mind, fuel cells.  I was always fascinated with this technology when I was a
kid and it was used in the U.S. space program starting with Gemini and, more
importantly, on Apollo.  (I can still locate the fuel cells in both
spacecraft!)  I would like to know more about the state of the art and the
near-term milestones that must be achieved for wide-spread implementation.

I was also struck by how important cross-disciplinary views are.  The folks
more oriented to computer technology seemed far less optimistic about things
like bio-medical developments and, in the case of space technology, than
folks, like "Spike Jones" and myself who appear to follow it more closely.
The computer gods, such as the two Dans (Fabulich and Clemmensen), were
consistently (although moderately) more optimistic on the development of
computer speed and capacity.  In the case of space tech, the astonishing
number of serious private launching ventures seem very likely to yield
impressive advances in LEO and translunar development before 2010; yet much of
this development is not widely known outside of the space industry and its
ancillary cloud of enthusiasts.  

This cross-disciplinary effect points to the continuing value of this list and
the activities of the transhumanist and extropian community generally.  A key
insight of the transhumanist vision is the importance of synergy between
developing technologies.  Only by actively sharing information and informed
speculation can we expect to maintain a clear vision of the future, whether we
see it as a "spike" or a "swell".

With these comments and bearing in mind the input received so far, I offer
some speculation for the decade following 2005, although I abandon somewhat
the format I had originally offered, in part because some disciplines will
merge beyond their current meaningful categorical divisions:



2005 - 2015

Computers/Media
The VR Revolution is universally recognized in the first world: "virtual
consumption" of many "luxury items" beginning to supplant "real consumption"
(i.e. why pay $250k for a real Lamborghini when $100 gets you 80% of the
experience with "Lambo 2.0"); Design of virtual environments and highly
interactive scenarios becomes the principle artistic enterprise, significantly
blurring the line between the "software engineering" and "artistic"
communities; A large portion of business travel supplanted by virtual
meetings; Social interaction in virtual environments becomes ubiquitous;
Merging of VR into Chislenko ER "Enhanced Reality" in first world toward end
of this period.
The AI Revolution arrives: Toward the end of this period autonomous agents
become important economic actors, treated as human agents are now in law and
business; Industrial and product design and engineering become highly
automated with the use of various species of AI assistants and agents.

Biotechnology:
Toward the end of this period, using bioinformatic techniques, large parts of
the dynamic metabolic pathways leading up from the now-completely-mapped human
genome through actual organic expression are understood, giving rise to
effective genetic therapies for a majority of pathologies; Organ cloning is
perfected and, toward 2015 implemented; Nerve regeneration is mastered, making
whole body transplants feasible but as yet untested; Common pathologies are
treated with same-day DNA chip diagnosis and gene therapy; At least one first
world society (the EU dominated by the greens? The US dominated by religious
fundamentalists?) completely rejects advanced biomedical techniques; Uploads
still seem RELATIVELY remote, as emulation achieves small network level and
scanning technology still unable to achieve massive fidelity.

Industry/Materials:
Smart materials pervasive in high-end products; Smart buildings universal for
new construction in the first world; Programming/control continues to be major
impediment to "Drextech", limiting molecular manufacturing to centralized
materials construction only; Environmental degradation slows significantly as
lower-impact manufacturing technologies continue to develop.

Business/Finance:
Virtual consumption causes proliferation of low-capital, high-flux, small
enterprises characterized by fluid agency structure; "Agency management" model
comes to predominate in many first-world businesses (management of human and
AI agency resources); Market fluidity and decreasing transaction costs cause
capital fund managers to dominate industrial leadership, creating increasing
tensions between "planners/builders" and "profit-seekers".

Society/Politics
Single career paradigm in first world becomes minority lifestyle; Immigration
pressure into the first world abates as employment opportunities for non-
information workers stagnate and then decline; Industrial production (even
with increased automation) increasingly concentrated in second and third world
as a result; Fertility rates and energy consumption in the first world begin
to decline as virtual consumption supplants "real" consumption;
"Balkanization" of culture in the first world as virtual communities cross-cut
geographic boundaries; Major reductions in violent crime and second and third
world political tyrranies through implementation of "transparent society"
techniques; Conflict between privacy and transparency dominates social and
political agendas in first world; Development of a few Orwellian ultra-
surveillance tyrannies in the second and third worlds (Iran? Iraq?); A few
tech-terrorist incidents spark lightning super-smart weapon responses from
coordinated first-world militaries.

Law/Government
Proliferation of quasi-governmental adjudicative agencies dovetailing with
continued development and spread of smart contracts (primitive PPLs);
Traditional state judiciary and government increasingly preoccupied with
"info-torts" arising from conflict between transparency and privacy; Many late
20th century NGOs (non-governmental organizations) mutate into quasi-
governmental agencies (also identifiable as primitive non-territorial PPLs);
Some first-world governments become preoccupied with legislation and
regulation of biotech, others take laissez faire approach.

Space:
Human/robotics debate "resolved" as relatively small human presence is
perceived as necessary for high-level management across light-speed gap, thus
LEO manned station is only a way station to small human surface base managing
lunar prospecting and construction of research facilities and manned orbital
Mars facility is planned; Large growth in telerobotic LEO service industry for
telecomm sats.

Note that I continue to be conservative on advanced nanotechnology.  The
informational load for full-blown assembler-based nanotech seems so high that
many, many orders of magnitude of advance in capacity and, more importantly,
very significant QUALITATIVE advances in computing ability will be necessary.
Accordingly, I continue to see "ultimate Drextech" as coming after 2015,
although how much later I don't think we can say.

This is off the thread, but was WWII caused by the murders, or by Hitler's
expansionism? I always thought it was the latter, as most histories I have
read show that world acknowledgement of the death camps came late in the
war, when Allied troops liberated some of them. Before the graphic truth
was shown on newsreels, the war was mainly about repelling invaders from
Germany who were bent on conquering the world.

If Hitler had stayed home and set up death camps, would the world community
of the day have stepped in to do something about it? After all, he would
not have been directly affecting any other nation's borders or peoples.

I'm not sure I understand. I think we agree that MNT includes both the
itty-bitty machinery (assemblers, etc) and the control of that machinery.
You seem to be saying "OK, we may learn how to build the machinery, but building
the proper control systems is a lot harder."

My analysis is very different. I feel that nanotech will have a profound effect
as soon as the machinery is available, even if we are constrained to today's
computational levels for control. A single assembler arm operating under control
of a macro-scale computer should be able to build a logic fabrication factory
in a matter of a few weeks, even if it has to spend a portion of that time
building replacements for itself and doing testing and rework. Therefore, 
I believe that given an assembler and one of today's desktop computers, It
should be possible to build a supercomputer factory on your desktop. Well over half
of the current cost of computer components reflects the cost of the fab lines, and
most of the rest reflects operating and materials costs.

IMO a similar approach can build any simple diamondoid macro-scale part, such as
window panes, bricks, pre-cut building lumber, many machine parts, etc.

For any increase in the capabilities of the control system you should expect
an increase in the achievable complexity of the result. If by "advanced nanotechnology"
you mean the abiltity to make things other than diamondoid, such as potatoes, then
I agree, we need something qualitatively advanced from the "robot factory" model.
However, the IMO the robot factory generating diamondoid parts is easily achievable in
the 2005-2015 timeframe. This technoligy is sufficient to completely obsolete all
current capital equipment. If the groundwork in AI based on massively parallel computing
is in place when the assember is developed, then the assembler-built superconputers will
also precipitate the singularity.

   IAN: The issue I've raised does not exclude 
   any type of utility, such as egoic. The issue 
   raised addresses the idea that "useless truths"
   (where "useless" is defined as not causing mon-
   itary profits) should be rejected. The truth 
   that the planet Pluto exists may not be causing
   monetary profits, does that mean all data about
   Pluto should be erased from science books? I 
   say no. I say that truth is implicitly valu-
   able to inquiry into the nature of things.

   IAN: No. Your defining "utility" "the greater good,"
   I have not misunderstood that the greater good was
   anything but the greater good. I've simply addressed
   the issue in which "utility" could be defined by some
   other standard, such as egoic. In fact, there can be
   no other standard than egoic, because even if you do 
   things for others, you do them because you want to;
   your measure of the "greater good" is YOUR measure,
   for some the "greater good" is mass sterilization.

   I really don't care to get into a discussion of uti-
   litarianism, I just think that truths should not be 
   eliminated because they may not cause profits now.

   IAN: If utilitarianism is the greatest good 
   for the greatest number, and there are a set
   of theories as to which course of action will
   achieve that goal, which course do we choose?
   The course that is true, that is, the course
   which the evidence best indicates will yield
   the desired outcome. So truth directs utility
   and in this way truth is useful.  It may be
   that the two define each other inseperably.

   So if we believe it's true that the greater
   good is served by truth first, the 2 are 1.

There's no question that "nanotech when?" is the Big Question:

In theory, this is true, but see below.

I absolutely agree, and think that many, many macro-scale components will be
fabricated at the molecular level sometime between 2005 - 2025.

Right, and herein lies my doubts about development of an "anything box" before
2015, at least.  I believe it was Robin Hanson who best expressed my
reservations: We know it takes the information processing capacity of either
(1) a large segment of the economy or (2) a very complex living organism to
generate just about any complex device right now.  Any device that could
generate a complex device from inputs of only atoms and information would have
to be equally complex and coordinated.  Creation and control of such an
"anything box" doesn't seem to be any simpler than modeling an entire economy
or organism at a highly detailed level.  I believe this problem is solvable,
but is very, very difficult.  It seems to me that it will be some time before
a device under the ultimate control of a single individual -- even a highly
augmented one -- can be created.

Not overnight, I think.  The process will be "bottom up" in the sense that
simple component manufacture will fairly quickly succumb to "STMs-on-a-
superchip" manufacturing technology, but much secondary processing and
infrastructure handling will then be transformed more slowly (albeit in a
matter of a decade, IMO).

Again, I think this presupposes a much, much higher degree of modeling and
control of complex systems than we have yet achieved.  Accordingly, I see a
"great leap forward" in hardware that jumps a good deal ahead of "software"
for perhaps a decade.

My work area is not as concentration conducive as it will be when I
re-assemble it.  However, most of my distractions are internal.  My mind
is a really noisy place.  I've recently been engaged in a handfull of
projects each requiring different modes of thinking(music, mathematics,
coding, writing, video production).  Some of them are more engaing (music)
than others and clearing my head when I switch tasks is the part of the
problem I'm trying to work out at this time.  I've made some progress
simply by realizing and acknowledging what the problem is.  (The problem
could be that I spread my self to thin, but I'm not going to drop anything
I find fullfilling until I've made an effort to sharpen myself.)

which I'm not concerned with.  I just want to think more clearly and with

A friend of mine who was having problems humming tunes and thinking about
music while he was trying to concentrate on other things found that he was
able overcome his problem by listening to white noise ("SHHHHH") when he
needed to concentrate.

A moment to plug my space and astronomy page:

    http://users.aol.com/gburch1/space.html

(there's a link there to "P.E.R.M.A.N.E.N.T" that Paul mentioned, via the
Archemides Institute)

I update and add to my space page on a pretty regular basis and it has grown
to be a fairly comprehensive set of good links and commentary, IMHO.  I'm
always on the lookout for good additions, so space enthusiasts, please feel
free to send me a good new link.

OK, we appear to be in agreement about the following. Please correct
this if my oversimplification has introduced errors.
  1) we will be using nanotech to build simple stuff (i.e., most machine parts and
     components for buildings) well before 2015
  2) we will not use nanotech to build complicated stuff (potatoes, beefsteak,
     "anything box") until we achieve a breakthough in control systems such as AI.

We appear to disagree on the boundary between "simple" and "complex".
I place a desktop-sized supercomputer factory in the "simple" category.
I can't tell for sure, but you seem to disagree? It would be fun to
rank-order a set of parts or devices and see where each of us places
the boundary. We could each place the rank-ordered devices on a timeline,
except we both agree that a breakthrough is needed, more or less implying a
bimodal distribution.

I also believe that there is at least a chance that the availability of
nanotech-built massively parallel supercomputers will enable a path to
AI, which in turn could permit a nanotech control system that can enable
us to build complicated stuff. You appear to think this unlikely?

We also disagree on the rate of adoption of even the "simple stuff"
technology. I feel that the rate will be very rapid, while you think
it will take a decade. In essence, I feel that after the time that the
first macro-scale part (brick, tennis racket handle, whatever) there will
be no new orders for new non-nanotech capital equipment, and within a year
most simple hard-good parts will be diamondoid. In the same time, nanocomputing
will completely supercede microlithographic-based computing.

Very well summarized -- it's a pleasure doing business with you, sir.

I have to laugh at this -- only in Extropia could this comment be made so
casually. . . is this a great list or what?  Seriously, I place it in the
"simple" category only IF the designs are available.  Perhaps "simple" is
exactly the right word, but "widespread" is not.  It depends on intellectual
property law and custom.  If Intel and the other current manufacturers can
keep their designs protected, then it might be some while before it becomes
widespread.  I suppose a cadre of "freeware" chip designers could break the
logjam here, but they'd have to be able to show they designed their chips from
scratch and didn't incorporate IP owned by the Big Boys.  But the PRICE of
desktop-manufactured computers would definitely drop drastically, with many
concomitant effects.

I may take a stab at this on my next break . . .

Not necessarily unlikely, but definitely not certain.  I agree that it will
make HARDWARE cheap and progress in hardware very fast.  However, I don't see
the necessary link to the development of SOFTWARE.  That's where the
disagreement is, I think.

I strongly disagree.  Existing capital equipment won't disappear.  To a great
extent, the existing physical plant at the time of "simple stuff nanotech"
represents sunk costs.  Owners of those goods will continue to use them, but
at a developing competitive disadvantage.  It won't make sense to replace the
entire manufacturing plant of the earth in a year.  Capital equipment life
cycles WILL shorten and the old tools will be replaced with much more
efficient ones more quickly than they otherwise would have, due to the
financial incentive to "get with the program", but the old technology will
continue to be a drag for ten years, although less so toward the end,
obviously.

Yes -- chip manufacture will be effected most quickly, as the disincentive to
maintain old methods of production will be brutal.

Apology accepted.

I don't mean to jump on your case specifically.  Its just that this thread has
generated a lot of 'reactionary' and knee-jerk reactions of people who haven't
bother reading what I wrote, and then presuming that I am so kind of dogged
socialist proposing a centralized governmental body to re-distribute the wealth.
This is simply not the case.

The problem I'm trying to reconcile is the elegance of the free market combined
with increasing automation.  Obviously, once we reach the assembler breakthrough
this whole issue becomes moot. Money and work become meaningless in a world where
you can replicate anything you need.  My concern is for the *transition* leading
up to it.  I see those years as ones where large segments of the economy become
increasingly automated.  Jobs safe from automation until nanotech would probably
include - doctors, engineers, scientists, artists, programmers, consultants,
advisors, lawyers, etc.

The question is can blue collar/joe-sixpack adapt to the changing workforce by
becoming a knowledge worker?  I have my doubts.  Also, I believe much of the
service sector will become automated.  One secretary does today what it took
dozens only 30 years ago.  This trend in office automation is continuing.

However, some interesting counter-proposals from others on the list included
pointing out that the service sector will continue because of a high demand for
'human touch'. Although each company will need less people to do the same thing,
there will be more companies doing it. Dan Fabulich pointed out that with
increasing automation comes increased production at lower costs.  So although
wages will decrease, the price of goods will decrease even more rapidly, thereby
raising the living standard for everybody.

Thanks Greg for the pointer to your site - I've just added it to my bookmarks.
One site that comes to mind that I don't see on your site is the Artemis
Project:   http://www.asi.org/

If I find anything else I'll let you know.

Com'n, Michael.  Name me one civilization in which there
was a similar level of invention as there currently is in the
present day, *period*!  This isn't a matter of patent protection,
but the scientific method, and books.

For their time, certainly.  I would say that they
probably didn't invent as much over all the
centuries that their society existed, as even
the last century has produced in our society.

Actually, I think there are free market incentives for organizations accounting
for their waste.  That incentive is efficiency and financial gain.  Kevin Kelly
pointed out in his book 'Out of Control", the idea of  industrial ecology parks
where one companies waste is used by another as raw material in their
manufacturing process.  Right now, most companies spend large sums of money either
disposing of their waste within the strictures of the EPA, recycle, or dump it
illegally.  Not only is the waste itself, a marker of the manufacturers
inefficiency, but a costly liability in today's stricter environmental policy.

In collaboration with a nearby cement plant that happened to be owned by its
parent company Texas Industries Inc., Chaparral set out to find new opportunities
reduce waste generation, increase efficiency and create value. The results have
been noteworthy. Chaparral has reduced the volume of baghouse dust (a hazardous
waste which costs
$220 ton to dispose of) to 28% below industry average, reduced lime content in the
dust by 87% (allowing it to be used in metals recovery), reduced lime use by
one-third and saved over $1 million in 1994 by using 5130 tons of recycled dust in
the furnace.

In 1993 Chaparral improved magnetic separation of slag, (which it had previously
sold as a road-building material for $0.55/ton), recycling iron back to the
furnace and selling the resulting higher grade, low iron slag to the cement plant
at $22/ton. Added revenue, $6 million. Chaparral has replaced hazardous mill
cleaning solvents: non-organic caustic, halogenated organic and ignitable organic
with non-toxic products, and reduced solvent use overall by 160 tons/year, for an
annual savings of $400,000. And closed loop processes have enabled Chaparral to
cut make-upwater consumption in half.

The only limitation of this idea so far has been geographic proximity. The
internet can alleviate this problem by allowing otherwise geographically remote
industries to start selling their waste products to companies who could use the
raw materials found within it.  Even if companies gave their waste away, it would
be much cheaper than the money they now spend on disposal logistics.

By advancements here I'm assuming you mean cheaper access to space.  What kind of
$/kg costs are we looking at with these private ventures?

> 2005 - 2015
>
> Space:

I think the development of space during this period, assuming we still don't have
nanotech, will hinge largely on $/kg access costs to LEO.  Assuming we can get
costs down below $100/kg, the long-term payoff vs the initial costs of development
will spur major private industry into space.   For many applications Teledesic
will probably be replaced by much larger and more stable geostationary satellites
offering enhanced and comprehensive global telecommunication services.  Near-Earth
asteroid capture will become big business as the cost of capturing such objects
will pale in comparison to the costs of transporting the same materials off
Earth.  This in turn will facilitate major improvements in space-based
manufacturing, CELSS, space medicine, human-habitation-ergonomics.

Obviously, once nanoengineered materials arrive on the scene, such space
development will accelerate dramatically.

  How do you compare?
This mailing list has probably generated more text than all Egyptians combined,
and the complexity, level of abstraction, and the degree of understanding of the
world reflected in these messages, exceeds the wildest dreams of all ancients
combined.  So does weekly extropian list archive compare to the first
million years of human evolution, judged by total complexity of generated ideas,
or do we measure new key concepts [?] on a logarithmic scale, or?...

I agree completely. I rarely have more than two Windows processes
open at once, usually Eudora and Explorer. I feel my overhead at
"mental task switching" is too costly for the appearance of
convenience. Also, with a fast machine (I finally have a nice
300 Mhz PC) the time to restart apps from scratch isn't too bad
anymore.

I begin to see where we differ. Basically, nanotech may be usable in any of several
ways to build computers. I was thinking in terms of rod logic, because IMO
there are no "hard" problems to solve to get to rod logic, other than getting
to nanotech itself. In addition, any competent engineer should be able to
generate a set of basic building blocks: gates, flip-flops, etc. that can
form the basis of a computer design. Now a slight diversion. microprocessor
design involves a hierarchy of design levels. The most abstract level is
the "logical architecture", or "programmer's model" of the sysstem. below this
are levels like RTL and functional descriptions which can be expressed in
labguages like VHDL. Below this, you get to levels that become increasingly
sensistive to the actual physical and electronic properties of the transistors,
other components, and interconnections on the chip itself. The vast majority of
Intel's IP involves these lower layers. Indeed, there are computer archtiectures
(such as MIPS) whose upper layers are in the public domain. Therefore, I feel that
the playing field may be very level here, and Intel's only remaining advantage is
a collection of employees who can rapidly retrain from a microlithographical
orientation to a nanotech orientation. Most of their IP will be worthless.
Basically, the first generation of nanotech supercomputers will not need
the nanotech equivalent of sophisitcated routing tools. We can generate logic
blocks that are easy to design and easy to interconnect, without worrying about
efficient packing or band gap or even heat and power. The first generation can
accept huge inefficiences in power and volume and still be thousands to tens
of thousands of times smaller than silicon-based computers.

This is beginning to look like an agreement to me. Neither of us either
rejects or predicts that nano-based supercomputing must lead to AI. In this,
I defer to Hans Moravic, who more-or-less believes that progress in AI
directly correlates to the amount of computing power controlled by the
average AI researcher. My point was that hardware does not by itself
create AI software, but there are some brute-force approaches that may
become feasible with truly massive supercomputing. Of sourse, AI (or
my favorite, the collaborative SI) are grand general solutions to
the software problem: just create a superprogrammer. This is not the
only way to use truly massive computing to solve programming problems.

Again, we are pretty close. Note that I said no new orders for non-nanotech
capital equipment. I understand that existing capital equipent will continue
to operate until replaced. Essentially, the only constraint on this process
will be the design time for the replacement equipment.

Maybe you could use symbols or markers to denote your mode? "Thinking
hats" so to say. When you are working on music, put a bust of
Beethoven on your desk. When you switch to mathematics exchange it for
a bust of Newton instead, and so on. The presence of the marker will
remind you about what mode you should be in.

I think much of what is called meditation is just a fancy form of
sitting around relaxing and thinking, either concentrated on a single
task or trying to let the various mental subprocesses calm down. I
think that can be learned without much teaching, but it requires
plenty of training anyway.

I have to diverge here.  I find that their are times when my awareness is so
acute that I concentrate very effectively on close to a dozen activities
simultaneously.  There is a kind of 'high' I feel as a new level of coherence
emerges.  Even more remarkably, are the entirely novel and sometimes
pleasurable gestalts of thought in which I gain new insights into previously
intractable problems.  It almost feels as if I'm tapping into some new part
of my brain or making clusters of new neural connections.

I do agree that there are other times where increased multitasking decreases
my concentration proportionately.  I think this type of
coherence/fragmentation is relevant to the identity vs rapid change thread.

Indeed, but my point is that that agreement puts you in the court of
philosophy NOT science.  In other words, it is a philosophical matter,
and if you must partition truth in philosophical truth, scientific truth, etc.
then this would be a matter of philosophical truth.  Science would be
utterly dependent on a philosophical truth.

(I think these adjectives are misleading.  Truth is truth.  The adjectives
should merely describe methods of arriving at it, BUT we must be careful
because some methods -- e.g., observation, induction, inference,
scientific experiment -- work or work better than others -- e.g., reading
tea leaves, using a Magic 8 ball.  In this vein, it might be safe to say,
there is no such thing as tea leaf truth or Magic 8 ball truth.  Both of
those methods do not arrive at or validate truth.)

Okay.

I know that history writing is often very biased and that objective methods of
historiography are not usually even sought (but see Fischer's _Historians'
Fallacies_).  Even so, eyewitnesses (biased as they are) often leave behind
lots of evidence.  Eyewitnesses can be very biased because they typically
have more of a stake in how events are recorded and interpreted.  Look at
Thucydides' _The Peloponnesian War_.  Far from sticking to an objective
account, at every turn, he presents his view of why the events happen.

Losers do write a lot history.  I know you wrote "... winners usuallyy[sic]
write the >history books..." but even this qualification of that cliche does not
go far enough.  We know, e.g., most Japanese history books have a very
slanted account of WW2 -- despite the fact that Japan lost and was
occupied.  Another example: both Afghan Wars in the last century.  While
Afghan versions of this war exist, many British accounts also exist.  A lot of
scholarship is based on the latter.  We should not forget, the losers here --
the British -- not only wrote most of the history, but were by no means a
uniform camp.  They disagree with each other over the import of the war.

Marxists have, in a sense, lost in history (for now and getting them to admit
it might be very hard), yet their ideology still dominates historical
scholarship.
My point here is that losers don't just write a small amount of history.  They
write a large portion of it.  The Marxist example is important because I bet
Marxists put out more history books than historians of any other ideological
persuasion.

Also, losers change a lot.  In 1811, Fance might have been considered the
winner in Europe.  5 years later, that judgment would have been seen as a
little off.:)

Back to objective methods, I think it is still possible to retreive many facts
and objective interpretations of such from them.  That, e.g., we have an
Egyptian tablet and an Hittite tablet telling us of their war (at Kadesh?  My
memory fails me at this hour), even though both accounts claim that their
side won let's us know a war did happen.  Combines with other evidence,
we know neither side was able to wipe out the other -- else no treaty AND
either side's culture would have taken over the other.

Cheers!

I would separate meditation from relaxation although they share the same
basis. In fact, meditation seems to be relaxation combined with a high
level of awareness. Contrary to relaxation (which often occurs while
sitted on an armchair, laying on a bed eyes closed, or even on the floor
as in the yogic savasana posture), meditation includes some tension
which have to be maintained during the whole session : the back
straight, eyes open, hands or whole body in strange and hard to maintain
postures, etc. Martial art can even be seen as medtation occuring in the
stressing environment of fight! The results are, IMHO, very different.
relaxation often finishes by sleep, meditation helps me to stay awake.

As for "thinking more clearly", I'm not sure that meditation or
relaxation can have a real effect on the value of rational thinking
(except the fact that a relaxed body will probably concentrate more
easily), but don't forget that people who created meditation methods
were mystics and not specially interested in this field. this does not
means there is nothing to do ! if meditation is "created" by changing
the parameters of relaxation, we can perhaps change meditation by adding
some new elements created especially in the purpose of increasing
intelligence. for instance, combine meditation with Ars memoria, or
doing martial arts movements to navigate in an abstract virtual
interface representing some mathematical or scientifical truthes, in
little like the tai-chi experiment at

The Greeks had the ability, for certain, but their spin on the scientific
method was such that they saw no purpose in experimental proof of theories.
After all, once you have figured Nature out in your mind, what point is
there in getting messy by proving the truth? I particularly enjoyed reading
Socrates' arguments for the existence of an immortal soul, based on his own
personal experiences alone. No wonder the rulers of the time sought his
death - he was as far from the pragmatic science of today as possible.

Their 'inventions' were mostly used as special effects for their temples,
to impress the common folk, or for toys. Persons who actually would dig
into the mess to prove things were looked down on as mere mechanics and
laborers.

The Egyptians, I don't have good information on. Now I will have to go to
the library again..

The tension is likely necessary to keep the awareness high; if it
falters and begins to move towards relaxation (which tends to decrease
awareness as we slip into normal rest/sleep) we get a mechanical
response (sagging back, a sudden touch as the fingers move or the need
to realign the posture) that alerts us to this.

I really like the japanese idea of finding meditation potential in all
sorts of tasks, not just traditional meditation forms but in martial
art, everyday work or various ceremonies. I wonder if we could develop
a form of meditation for studying?

I am guilty of an occasional knee-jerk, and would like to discipline myself
away form jumping to conclusions. I did not, however, get the feeling that
you were proposing central control. I can't see the present forms of
government surviving unchanged once everyone can build a nanocomputer on
their desktop. Once the present system of wages dies off, how will they
justify their continued existance? Without being able to steal from
worker's wages, how will they fuel themselves?

This is probably too rosy an outlook. There is nothing quite as cunning as
a cornered bureaucrat..

That is also my problem. Once everything settles out, life on Earth may
approach some sort of leisure paradise. The transition is genuinely scary.
So far, we have pretty much dodged the bullet in industries like steel and
automobiles - there have been thousands of workers let go; in most cases
they were able to find other work.

Also in engineering! When I started in the industry in 1979, even
supertechs had access to file clerks and secretaries who typed up reports,
etc. By the time I finished school, the engineer was expected to do his own
filing and typing, and in some cases, purchasing for production. One
company I worked at also had the engineering staff taking service calls and
closing sales. (All this while being expected to turn out product faster..)

I, too, believe that there will always be a place for services and retail,
at least until everyone downloads into cyberspace..If we can play the cards
out right, perhaps we can avoid the huge disruptions and chao some have
postulated..

Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the whole point of Extropia and of 
Transhumanism (or rather, Post-humanism) the transformation of man 
biologicallly, physically, MENTALLY and POLITICALLY into something 
more advanced and liberated, less restrained by arbitrary limits?
If that is so, then the concepts of political truth and absolute 
justice shift before our eyes into something not yet properly 
defined (which is what EXI is here for, I guess).
Judging the Nazis by modern (as opposed not to primitive but to 
postmodern) standards is not only out of line and irrelevant in this 
context, but also - USELESS.

Most of you seem to take for granted the equation science=truth, 
which is a bit naive considering the fact that absolute scientific 
facts change on a frequent basis.
No actual/physical alteration of data is necessary to achieve a 
scientific situation which is only arguably true.
Consider Dark Matter. It is fairly reasonable to consider Dark Matter 
as a concept thought of only to resolve certain conflicts between old 
theories and recent calculations. As a matter of fact, there is no 
justification nor evidence of the existence of such a thing, apart 
from the fact that it allows existing scientific theories to stand. I 
wonder, isn't it more 'truthful', at least on the level of 
intellectual integrity, to cancel the old theories once they have 
been rebutted rather than inventing a new factor that makes them 
legitimate? I mean, this kind of behavior is practically religious.

I have to disagree with this, almost any rural poor area is much
worse off than CHA residents. Besides heat, electricity, plumbing,
color T.V's, phones, mail, public education, elevators (more on
that in a moment) cars, public transportation, free medical
clinics, and welfare payments, these building have a very high per
capita on "luxury" items like VCR's, cell phones, microwave ovens
etc. All of which you won't find among rural poor.

The elevators, the number one reason (two and three as well)
elevators are broke in CHA buildings is because of the RESIDENTS,
the kids get in the shafts and rig them to ride up and down like
amusement park rides, the gangs get in and sabotage them so people
have to take the stairs and are easier to rob.

My former roommate was a CFD paramedic and used to take a bag of
our rock climbing gear with him on every shift, he ended up
rescuing two to three kids a week from these shafts.

Another friend was the elevator repair man for one of these
complexes, he used to take polaroids of the destruction every time
he serviced the elevators, then a second picture of the repaired
mechanism. He said it was not unusual to be fixing the same
elevators every day. The city took my friends company to court a
few years ago trying to charge them with fraud and improper
maintenance. My buddy's thousands of photos and meticulous record
keeping saved the day.

I partly agree that the welfare system is to blame as are various
Govt programs, even though well intentioned. The real blame goes to
a complete lack of personal responsibility.

We can acknowledge truths that are useful - or rather those
that we think are useful (the difference in who believes what
here is one of ethics, not of approach.  If I use a tool, say,
a knife, to slice bread, while a criminal uses it to kill a person,
we are not similar [in our actions or goals], we just use the
same tool.  We all use the same time, space and energy as
the bad guys - does it make us the same?  No, as long as
we are trying to use them for different ends.  Same with
scientific methods).

We can also, in the extension of the utilitarian approach,
acknowledge truths that may prove to be useful at some
point (and what can't?), for us or somebody/something else,
we acknowledge hypotheses that simplify our understanding
of the world (that's what we always actually have in place of
truths), we promote creation of new truths - things that
never existed before, but are useful, expansion of ourselves
to make better use of more things and ideas, growth of our
appreciation of things we have, etc., etc.
So we expand the truths (the complexity of existing world),
ourselves, and the relations between us.  (Totalitarian regimes
usually attempt to simplify and restrict all of the above, BTW)

Of course, our work is guided by our interests, this seems
the only way a conscious entity can guide its activities.

seems highly doubtful, given the recent cases of such genocide in Rwanda and
other areas... the mass murder of Jews, Gypsies, Socialists, Homosexuals and
others persecuted by the Nazis did not cause WWII.  while Hitlers anti-

of the war were many and included the economic situation and the blow to
Germany's pride delivered by the treaty ending WWI...

Yes, porting and emulation from raw voxel data scans seems far enough
from current tech.  However, Destructive scans that output raw voxel
data at needed fidelity is almost possible now (and almost affordable
if you are B. Gates).  Of course, the only thing gained over cryonics
is room temperature and multiple location backup storage.  Also, with
good compression, possibly much less real estate will be needed. 
Mabey 100 people in a box of "Super Ultra DVD XXXIV" ROMs or
something. Room temperature storage means no maintenance and that with
the multiple backup storage locations gives enough advantages to
destroy cryonics.  Although all of cryonics technology will be needed
in the scanning procedure.  So I don't want to sound like I don't
appreciate the work in this area.
I also see a good possibility for non-destructive scans in this time
frame.  Possibly using a technology mentioned on this list before.  A
light source is pulsed on one side of the head and only the photons
that made it through without any collisions are recorded on the other
side.  The head is slightly rotated and this is repeated 360 degrees. 
Since most of your head is empty space (at least mine is) the
non-empty space is recorded per voxel.

Since I've gone from being conservative on my first point to being
speculative on my second, I may as well step out there on the fringe
for my third.
There has been some recent discussion about traveling into the past on
this list.  I've always been more interested in the possibility of a
"peering into the past technology" (PIP Tech) rather than actually
traveling into the past.  I define  PIP Tech as the ability to peer
into the past focusing on known coordinates at a specified past time
with the ability to scan a biological brain with near molecular
resolution.  I do not see PIP Tech as having some of the paradox and
contradiction problems associated with time travel.  Although the
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle causes some concern.   I just want to
throw this long shot idea out for the space time engineering types to
consider because it is obviously outside of my area of expertise. The
idea of using a black hole as a lens into the past by re-mapping the
distorted star field would not work here because I don't think you
could use the nearest existing black hole to peer through our
atmosphere at that resolution.  But what if we had a similar machine
to the light pulsing and rotating one described above pointed to the
nearest black hole.  Such a machine could be built cheap with todays
tech because the difficult part is receiving only the photons in that
very short window that underwent no collisions.  And that part would
be accomplished by the future machine.  This is just one possible path
to (machine in the present) assisted PIP Tech.  That is, we build a
machine now in anticipation of assisting a future machine to peer into
the past.  I really have no sound working theory for PIP Tech.  The
above example was just to get the idea across so the space time
engineering types could ponder the idea.  But I cannot dismiss it
because of the immediate grand impact it would have.  The present
machine along with a sound theory for the future machine(as opposed to
a working model)would have an immediate impact.  Thats a first.  We
use a sound theory for a future machine to get immediate results
before building that machine.  If nothing else, I guess this could
make for some interesting sci-fi.

As Robin Hanson pointed out, the vaccine against such a transition is to gain a
share in the means of production.  This could be anything from owning a small farm
to operating a small desktop manufacturing facility.  I hesitate to say tradition
financial investment would provide an adequate vaccine in the face of possible
hyper-liquidity of the market.  Currencies might fluctuate so wildly that all your
investments could dry up before you knew what hit you.

This is by no means the only method of meditation!

About 3 months ago I gave people instructions on the extro list on how to do
Energized Meditation (EM), which not only allows you to become very focused
and aware, but intensely relaxed in deep areas of the body.  The purpose of EM
is to relax areas of the body that have been locked in tension for years.
Anders, did you ever try EM after I published the instructions?

> I wonder if we could develop a form of meditation for studying?

Yes!  There have been several methods developed for learning meditation.  The
key is RELAXATION.  Studies have show that the more relaxed you are, the more
your capacity for learning (most types) is.

Not being in touch with popular entertainment is one thing, but you 
left out some very important specimen.
In music, the whole genre of electronic music, from minimalistic 
techno to grandiose ambient, the whole thing is about what you call 
Extropia or transhumanism. Listen to FutureSoundOfLondon's trilogy 
Lifeforms, ISDN and Dead Cities. If this isn't transhumanism in music 
(granted, in an abstract manner) I don't know what is.
In movies, well, some of Cronenberg's all time sci-fi megahits, 
Scanners and VideoDrome deal with this issue in the most intelligent 
and sophisticated way I've seen. And if you're in the Cronenberg 
shelf, check out The Brood and maybe even The  Fly and The Dead 
Zone, though they're not such good films, they all talk about 
"transhumanism".
Let us not forget the Japanese cult classic Tetsuo: The Iron Man, a 
hard-to-watch-but-still-worth-it ultrapiece.
There are many many more, these are just the most notable.
In literature the examples are too many to name, I'm sure that if you 
throw a stone in the sci-fi section of any bookstore you'll have at 
least a 20% chance of hitting one.
What's left? Oh yes. The wonderbox. A transhumanity engine in itself 
if you ask me. Well, being the most popular and populistic of the 
mediums listed, there isn't much room there for fringe philosophy so 
there aren't very many shows that dealt with that. I can't think of 
any important non-cartoon extropian show apart from the one you 
mentioned, but I'm sure there are, and even surer there will be.

Well, I will continue to amass equipment and tools that might enable me to

a fair machine shop now, including high vacuum equipment and a scanning

The degree of suffering due to lack of material goods in the rural areas as
compared to the misery in the high rises is a totally different flavor. The
high rise inmates (I hesitate to say tenants) are the worst products of the
welfare system. The public education system is simply a warehouse to store
the kids until they can take their place on the streets.

I have never understood how someone on welfare can get a cell phone, or a
microwave, or any of the other big ticket luxury items - who would extend
credit? Are all these the result of criminal or underground economy
activities?

In the rural areas you refer to, the majority of the poor are people who
would love to get better (or any) jobs and do something to better their
lives. The denizens of the high rise all too often are satisfied to sit
back and coast on thier welfare checks. This is learned behavior, taught by
the federal and state welfare agencies. The lesson is that if you get a
job, you lose welfare benefits. If you have more kids, you get bigger
payments. You are more likely to get money if you have kids and the father
is no where to be found.

I am sure that you will find rural poor with similar philosopies. However,
the degree of concentration makes a huge difference in the environment.
Gangs, for instance, are almost exclusively an urban phenomena.

Or rape, or kill. I agree. The gangs rule the buildings. They consider the
buildings their personal property, and the other inmates are their serfs. A
modern feudal system.

I long for the day the CHA pulls Robert Taylor and the other crime and

As a Libertarian, I heartily agree on the lack of responsibility. How can
we correct this? The schools, as I mentioned, are almost useless for
education, let alone teaching morals and ethics. I see some hope in the
latest govt. practice of limiting lifetime welfare payments; this might
force some people to rethink their lives, but it's going to take a few
generations to weed out the diehard welfare queens, I am afraid.

For the common (non-scientist) person, this is "true". Truth is what they

We need the adjectives to distinguish the non-objective 'truth' from the
scientific. The definitions commonly accepted force this. There's religious
truth, scientific truth, etc. Those not trained in science will need the
adjectives to be able to shift gears..

And eyewitnesses have been shown in psychological experiments to be dead

The losers in this case were much more powerful in the Western world, so

And so we can look into the ancient records and enjoy endless speculation

Tomography! However, to get atomic level resolution, as I imagine you would
need to get the physical memory structures of the brain recorded, you would
need some pretty short wavelengths. These might end up being anything but
non-destructive..

MRI has always intrigued me, but I believe it cannot achieve the required
resolution due to the same wavelength limitations. What is fine for imaging
is terrible for replication..

That reminds me of an ad in the back of Fantasy and Science Fiction back in
the '70's. The premise was 'Be part of our quest to achieve time trasvel!'
The method (I bit and sent in my $5) was that the organization would bury a
'time capsule' somewhere with the names of all the people who donated
money. At some time and place to be named on the plaque, a future time
traveller would appear with his machine, which would then be donated to the
organization to achieve their goal.

Never did hear what happened to them, I consider the $5 to be an investment
in a rather bad sci-fi plot..

While it's true that not all humans are equally innovative, we still
have a huge advantage over the greeks. In the greek culture, it about
a hundred people working full tijme to support one philosopher Those
hundred people (farm families, slaves and other household servants, etc.)
never got a change to be inventors. In victorian times, the ratio was
lower. Today, the ratio is much lower. I'd guess that today, in advanced
societies at least, a much higher percentage of potential inventors become
actual inventors.

This dawned on me very recently thanks to Michael Lorrey's elucidating
point about subjective truth and contract law.

These days, it seems like most academia has all but completely accepted
post-structuralist thinking, a philosophy which is completely hostile to
absolute truth. It's impossible to have a society bound by contracts when
a text has infinite meaning.

Also, note that you find most professors in universities, not 
corporations.  They are funded with public money as a public good most of
the time.  So while it is capitalism that has created this public money,
in the eyes of professors, the only reason they don't have more money is
because the greedy capitalists won't give it to them. 

Why authoritarian socialism rather than direct anarcho-socialism?  Most
socialists believe that we can't get straight to anarcho-socialism;  that
society isn't ready to live like that yet.  In order to fix this, they
need to be taught.  They need authoritarian socialism to teach them how to
think, how to work and how to live together without greed.  Once that
happens, you dump authoritarian socialism and live forever in utopia. 

Why don't they see the failings of this system?  Well, many of them DO see
that authoritarian socialism doesn't just "fade away" as Marx put it; this
is the reason why they are now so critical of the former USSR, but still
gung-ho for socialism:  The USSR was doing it wrong, even if it had the
right idea in mind.  Meanwhile, they CANNOT be dissuaded from socialism
while they maintain that reality is fundamentally a subjective
experience, and that a text's meaning is formulated within the mind of the
reader, having no objective meaning, and thus being unenforceable as law.

I'd be interested to hear (off-list if you prefer) if anyone else on this
list are home educating their children or know of anyone who is.  Seems to
me that this choice might be popular among this sort of crowd.

I have 5 children and a nice sub-tropical lifestyle.  High-tech and
tele-commuting, we've dumped public education and believe that we can do it
better.  Others ?

(Apologies to Susan Masterman for 'borrowing' her title).


I'm mildly surprised that more readers of this list are not fully familiar 
with logician Alfred Tarski's reconstruction of a commonsense Objective 
Correspondence Theory of Truth, utilizing a metalanguage.

   This following example is a bit more complex than first appears -- it's 
   deceptively simple).

   Following Tarski, we may say:
   
   'The statement "le ciel est bleu" is true if --
   
   and only if --
   
   the sky is, in fact, blue.'
   
   Thus, we can examine and test the correspondence of statements with 
   objective reality, with the metalanguage serving to avoid tautology, 
   among other things.
   
   Readers of Popper will be fully cognizant of Tarski's wonderful 
   breakthrough, which provides unbreakable logical foundations for the 
   commonsense idea that there exists a truth directly related to reality, 
   without all the subjectivist errors and pitfalls.


   Bayesian Probability is worth a look too -- it's extensively favored by 
   the intelligence community, which is why my friend Admiral Gayler says 
   "Intelligence work is a probabilistic kind of thing."  But Tarski's 
   method is superior in that it is exact, not probabilistic.

   PS:  Someone on this list, whose address I alas mislaid, asked me if 
   I'd ever met William Warren Bartley, and what I thought of him.
   
   Yes, I met Bill Bartley in London in the early Eighties, in the company 
   of my great friend Jeremy Shearmer (for eight years Popper's Research 
   Assistant) who knew him well.  I thought he was a bit 'stand-offish' 
   (he _did_ say "I don't care what anyone thinks.').  This seemed a bit 
   odd for a philosopher and an acolyte of Werner Erhard's 'est'!  The 
   world (and I mean 'the entire world') is however permanently indebted 
   to him for his rescuing some of Popper's unpublished writings.

   Bartley wrote a lovely book on Lewis Carroll's Logic.  It's such a 
   shame to lose people like Bartley and Feynman so young.

   I think his (prize-winning) book on Erhard and 'est' is very brave (he 
   expected it to ruin his academic reputation, instead of which it won 
   eleven prizea!  >:-} ) but is badly flawed by its failing to identify 
   the origins of the various elements of the 'est' training, foremost 
   among which are Mind Dynamics and Silva Mind Control.
   
   Feynman (Richard) knew Werner Erhard too, BTW.  I've been to meetings 
   with Erhard, but never met him personally.  He's very funny, and a 
   brilliant raconteur.  I haven't done his 'Forum' training, so I can't 
   say whether it has the flaws (or the brilliance) of 'est.' I'm wary of 
   things with Roman titles -- I'm with Greece against Rome (and Athens 
   against Sparta).

   I'll always remember thinking, early on in the 'est' training: "This is 
   the most brilliantly clever, intricate and powerful thing I've _ever_ 
   seen in all my life."  (I'd already toured NIMROD at Harwell, the 
   Atomic Energy Research Establishment) when it was under construction. 
   The big accelerators are truly _awesome_).  With all its faults, that's 
   still true. I work on a CD-ROM based Human Potential Skills Evocation 
   Programme which will (I hope!) be _more_ brilliant, _more_ intelligent; 
   and _staggeringly_ powerful.

   IAN: Unlike this one. I think that the atomist
   paradigm is properly defined as the  crackpot 
   paradigm. How so? If we think of the universe
   as a pot, atomism is the process of breaking
   that pot, cracking it into ten zillion sepe-
   rate fragments. Holism is the healing of 
   the cracked pot of atomist fallacy.

   A = A is A cracked away from the whole.
   A = A + (-A) is A rejoined to the whole,
   as A exists in reality. When we take
   atomism for real, we slip into 
   an "atomistic psychosis."

   Atomism is useful, and defines how we meta-
   phorically subtract a thing from the whole 
   and thereby draw attention to it and away
   from other things.  If I say, "Pass the 
   salt shaker," but define "salt shaker"
   as salt shaker + not-salt-shaker,
   your going to have some trouble
   passing it, or, I already have it.
   Yet at all times the salt shaker exits,
   it is what it is by relation to not-it.

   What is so amazing about the human mind
   is how it becomes conditioned to believe
   that it's own programing is THE truth, 
   that A actually is A free from not-A. 
   The mind confuses a useful fallacy 
   with reality, and that's psychosis.

   That's why during mystical experiences,
   or temporal-lobe epilepsy, the mind's
   program suddenly crashes, it stops, and 
   yet the "I am" is still there and like 
   a flood of light and realization I see 
   that all things are unified, that the 
   mind created this illusion of sepera-
   tion, of isolated and free identities,
   when in fact up is down, in is out,
   where A is A only by relation to -A,
   and A is all that which defines it.

   A thing exists on in context and no
   thing exists free from context, not
   even the cracked pot of atomism.

All of these, when compared to the societies before, were obviously more
inventive, but remember that they are really only known for a few inventions
that were true advances over what was used before, that were developed over
several hundred years. Comparing this with the over 5 million patents that have
been issued here in the US alone over the past 200 years (mostly within  the
last 50 years) is like saying that a mouse standing on a pile of dung has a
similar view as giraffe.

IMO, consistent time like loops are possible, but very, VERY VERY
rare, less likely than all the molecules in this room moving into
the next one. I personally doubt the notion of time beyond providing
a framework for micro events. I suspect that the "arrow of time" is
intimately connected to the process of creating and preserving
memory.

I've posted on this about a year ago, here's a summary. Imagine
the Universe as the set of all possible states for its contents.
Display this ensemble of states as a swarm of dots. (LOTSA DOTS!
I don't know how to calculate the magnitude of this number, but
I do recall Penrose stating numbers like ((10^100)^100). Represent
the rules of physics as links between the nodes. (Yup! The mother
of all Feynmann diagrams!)(Well not really, since STATES, not
particles are represented here)

Then, at each point there are a gazillion links to other points, but
each point's connections represent much less than a bazillion'th part
of the set of all points.

In this web, though most transitions are consistent with entropic
time, there are a FEW paths which create loops. By definition these
loops are consistent. But, oh, so rare!

Oh yeah - some of these transitions will look just like a functioning
worm hole...

  On January 17, 1961, President Dwight D. Eisenhower said:


	"[T]he free university, historically the fountainhead

	a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because

	virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity. ...

	The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars
	by Federal employment, project allocations, and the 
	power of money is ever-present and is gravely to be 
	regarded."

We homeschooled both of our kids.  The eldest took a GED pre-screening and 
will have to spend a couple months on her math before taking the test.

The youngest, we used a correspondence course (from ICS) for high school.  A 
program equivalent to 4 years of high school, she finished over the course of 
about 1.4 standard academic years (studying only half days), completing it 
about 3 months after her 15th birthday.

The history of the economic development of the world can be described as a 
process of internalizing costs and benefits.  (An internalized cost is one that 
must be paid by the entity making the decision; an internalized benefit is one 
that is received by the entity making the decision.  The alternative is an 
externalized cost/benefit, which goes to some person who doesn't make the 
decision.  As an example, if the smoke from my fire makes it hard to breathe in 
my home, the cost of that smoke is internalized; but if it flows instead into your 
home, that's externalized.  Guess when I'll be most interested in controlling the 
smoke...)

We had just seriously begun internalizing the costs of pollution through 
common law and the market, when the government stepped in to protect 
polluters from having to reimburse their neighbors for pollution-caused damage.  
So instead we have internalized the cost of following government-imposed 
pollution regulations, which are (at best) only loosely correlated with pollution.

I believe Bucky Fuller had something to say about this.  The first time I
read his ideas on ecological accounting and global computer networks I had
to quickly turn to the publication page to see when it was printed.
It was early 1970's I think (Bucky had a long run - he pops up everywhere).

Dan also noted the blind hostility towards capitalism
in academia. Ian Goddard responded with a 1961
Eisenhower quote about how, for some academics "a
government contract becomes virtually a substitute
for intellectual curiosity".

Or, it becomes a blank check to endlessly explore
artistic, sexual and social fetishes at public
expense.   Here's another quote in the same spirit
that I just saw today:

"When plunder has become a way of life for a group of
men living together in society, they create for
themselves in the course of time a legal system that
authorizes it and a moral code that glorifies it."
-Frederic Bastiat, "The Physiology of Plunder", p.
130, _Economic Sophisms_

The plunder, in this case, is by tenured academics
still fantasizing about the failed revolutions of
their youth, the Utopia that was 'betrayed' by greedy
market Reality.  Perhaps a few years from now a new
crop of more hard-science libertarian academics will
still be telling their students how the Singularity
was 'betrayed' by quaint cultural and ecological
concerns.

Still, it's possibly an Objectivist red herring to
characterize this as "hostility to truth", to suggest
that hermeneutics implies that a text really has
*infinite* meanings, or to equate all
post-structuralist thinking with the antics of some
jeering court jesters.  It's just the public-goods
market in evolution.

Can we really put a definite definition to the word truth?

If you believe we can then consider:

1. truth is in the eye of the beholder
  2. bias truth
     a. hitler is viewed as evil by the majority for ordering the 
death of millions,  yet Einstien is viewed as good when in actuality 
he killed millions more than hitler
     b. Columbus discovered America, usually discovery is of the unknown (America was already known, and inhabited) and he never saw 
America
3. my truth is not necessarily your truth, and yours not mine
4. truth is only a test of you collected knowledge, there fore the 
more knowledge the more truth
5. all truth has the option of being bias

I used to think hermeneutics implied that every interpretation is a mis-
interpretation -- or, at least, that all interpretations are equal.  On this
stance, someone who believed, to use a classic example, Belgium
invaded Germany in World War One is just as right as someone who
believed the opposite as well as someone who believed there was
no war or that Belgium and Germany were both nonbelligerents.

However, regardless of what I think, the Objectivist movement has
penetrated and been penetrated by hermeneutics.  See, e.g., the
works of Gregory Johnson (his "Hermeneutics: A Protreptic" which
appeared a few years ago in _Critical Review_ gives a semi-
Objectivist view of the subject) and of Chris Sciabarra.  The latter
has a web site at:

        http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra

It will be interesting to see what hybrids and mutants flourish in such
soil.:)

Personally, I don't believe _all_ poststructuralist, postmodernists and
hermeneutics is bunk, though like all movements, the members of
these probably do too far and lack perspective.  It's like the New
Critics who saw irony in everything or Freudians who see sex all
over the place.  I'm sure there's a good deal to be learned from all
of them.

Very sloppy thinking...as far as I know Einstien never killed anyone...

Oh...you mean mechanisms built which were derived from his theories and used
by others  killed millions?

Wouldn't that be like saying Henry Ford killed millions?

and perhaps more accurately...since I don't think the combined explosions of
Littleman AND Fatboy killed milllions....hundreds of thousands perhaps..

Name them. THis is a bald faced lie. If you are claiming that deaths due to nuclear power are his fault, his primary responsibility,
recall that he was not involved in the Manhattan Project in any way. All he ever did was write a letter to President Roosevelt for some
colleagues who were the people who developed the bomb. Even if he was responsible, less than a couple hundred thousand people worldwide
have died due to nuclear power, and most at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I would say that since nuclear power is what created the cold war,
and the prospect of Nuclear Winter made us second guess the idea of fighting nuclear war, we have most certainly avoided an open and
heinous Third World War between the Communist and Capitalist nations. In this scenario, we have to thank Einstein for saving billions of
lives....

Columbus discovered the New World, which is made up of all bodies of land connected to or neighboring the continents of North and South
America.

> 3. my truth is not necessarily your truth, and yours not mine

Since truth is merely highly accurate information, if you have information A and I have information B,  whoever has the most accurate
information is the one who has THE truth. You may beleive that the sky is yellow, while I may beleive that it is blue. Spectral analysis
of the light the atmosphere diffuses will fall within that band of the spectrum which any human being will call 'blue'. Therefore I know
an absolute truth, while you are merely either misinformed or self deceived, or both.

The more accurate the knowledge is, the closer to an absolute truth it is.

> 5. all truth has the option of being bias

i.e. all information is capable of being distorted by a liar. A liar cannot tell the truth, therefore, biased information is not truth.

Can you elaborate on Einstein's guilt? I am assuming you mean his
recommendation of the A-bomb in WW II.

There have been two atomic weapons used in warfare. Perhaps 100,000 people
died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Total deaths due to nuclear power are
probably under 100 worldwide, not counting Chernobyl. Well under a million
by all conceivable nuclear related causes.

Last count I heard, 'Der Fuhrer' was responsible for about 10 million
total, and almost the complete extermination of the Jews of Europe.

Seems like quite a stretch..

  IAN: I saw something on TV about this. A dog owner
  went with film crew to a shopping center and another
  crew stayed at home with the dog. The owner chose a
  random time to return. At the moment that she did,
  the dog at home woke up and, tail wagging, ran to  
  the window, looking out expectantly, but the owner
  was still a good 10 minutes away from home, so it
  could not have been smell, sight, or sound clues.
  They said that that dog always reacted like that.

  The studies cited in the Nando article Max cites 
  seem pretty lame in that they simply asked owners
  if this happened to their pets. That's totally un-
  scientific and worthless in my mind. But the arti-
  cle did cite some "laboratory-type" experiments:

--------------------------------------------------------------------
They involve setting up video cameras in the homes of pet owners to
record animals' activities while their owners are away. Then they ask
owners to return home at unpredictable times -- by taxi and not their 
own car. Reviewing this evidence, he claims that while some dogs are 
stripped of their psychic powers -- most are not.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
   IAN: Seems he's already concluded they're psychic.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
"The most extraordinary examples," he explained, "have been dogs who
begin to get excited when their owners are about to get on an airplane 
to fly home from thousands of miles away."
--------------------------------------------------------------------

   I don't think we should write this off just
   like that. It stokes my curiosity... What if?
   I'd think that some rigid tests could be set
   up that would give us some reliable answers.

I wouldbeleive it if an owner was thousands of miles away and threw 
something, and the dog automatically started to fetch at that very 
moment, every time.  No, I know that a study I did read about showed 
that most of this dog 'psychic' behavior was them hearing the sound of 
their owners vehicles at a far greater distance than previously thought 
capable. A similar study with african elephants, which seemed to 
mysteriously communicate at far greater distances than their ears were 
capable of hearing ultimately found that elephants have a heretofore 
unknown range of communication in the extreme low frequency range of 
sound, which they sense through their feet. ELF sound travels around 
obstacles far easier than sound in normal hearing ranges. This hearing 
range, known as the infrasonic range, is also the reason why elephants 
can find areas where water is flowing near the surface of the ground, 
and can sense thunderstorms at very far ranges.

THis is rather odd. Though I imagine that you mean that as two 
ideological adversaries, they have engaged in internal sabotage and 
raconteurism of their adversaries organizations, that is to be expected. 
That is not hard to do, I've done the same with state Democratic Party 
meetings, SDS meetings, etc. It can be very informative and fun...

  IAN: Physical reality. Concepts, ideas, and
  claims that are true are those that map onto
  the physical reality as a one-one function.
  Beyond the physical reality, a true claim 
  is one that follows logically from a given
  set of axioms and such claims are true only 
  to the extent they adhere to those axioms
  and may not be true outside those axioms.


>1. truth is in the eye of the beholder

  IAN: Physics equations can predict physical
  outcomes with little or no room for doubt.
  That Newton's law of gravity F = GmM/r^2
  defines gravity and allows up to predict 
  its effects under various conditions is
  a truth NOT "in the eye of the beholder."

   IAN: I doubt that that maps onto the physical 
   reality since I don't think that the A-bombs
   killed millions, or that Einstein can be said
   to be fully responsible. Mutual assured de-
   struction may have even saved millions.

   If those claims about reality do not map onto
   the physical reality, then they are not true.
   They very fact that you cite them means that 
   your relying on some standard of truth to 
   argue that there is no standard of truth!

The scientific method developed  in the Renaissance period in response to the
beginnings of patent law in the city states of europe, where princes, Doge's
etc. needed a policy which would encourage inventive individuals to commit to
selling new technologies for weapons of war only to a single Sovereign. The
Patent protected legally the inventor from being litterally 'screwed' in the
sovereigns dungeons in order to keep the technology secret. Remember, this
was a time when guns were beginning to become available, as well as cannon,
etc., a revolution in miltary technology was underway due to the competition
between the city states and principalities on the battle field. One of the
best known of these inventors was Leonardo Da Vinci, who had to develop a
secret code system in which he became so fluent that he could write by hand
while viewing his text through a mirror in order to maintain the security of
his workbooks.

The scientific method followed later as a method of scientific discovery and
experimentation merely to make a more efficient system for research than the
existing hit and miss system of guesswork.

I htink that it would be safe to say that we owe both the concept of
intellectual property and the scientific method to one invention that
preceded them: gunpowder.

    This is the 21'st update on my fly longevity experiments. Since flies
 used in run #8 had been pre-aged in holding bottles containing taurine
 larvicide for 29 days prior to use, the remaining life spans are shorter
 than those from the previous run.
    The results were very disappointing with acetyl-carnosine, and I have
 no explanation for why the flies given this died so quickly. However the
 poor result with almond powder was anticipated. This was the first time I
 have tested something that I was fairly confident would reduce life span.
 Unlike mammals, the dietary "essential" fatty acid requirement for flies
 is zero, and all tests with various added fats have yielded reduced life
 spans. However monosaturated fats had never been tested before, so I
 decided to try this with the almond powder.
   It looks like aged garlic powder, and the lower dosage of chili have a
 mild pro-longevity effect. Both the lower doses of cardamon, and
 corriander might also be slightly beneficial before tissue levels
 accumulate to a toxic level. I will have to check out extra low
 concentrations of these some time.
   For the ninth run I am testing a very high dosage (8X) of hawthorn,
 since the Hawthorn 4X did so well in the seventh run. Otherwise I am
 continuing to test the spice cabinet in this latest run. Flies were
 pre-aged for only 17 days, since about 75% of them had died by this time.
 This shorter holding period may be due to the current higher temperatures
 accelerating age associated mortality in drosophilia. These insects now
 show great reluctance in attempting flight, which is typical of aged
 flies.

Apparently it was purported to be a policy back in the 60's-70's to prevent average people from coming into
contact with meteorites or other objects which might have contagious organisms on or in them that humanity
might have no defense against. THis was when books like The Andromeda Strain was a best seller and
astronauts were kept in 'isolation' environemnts when returning from space....

However, I am aware that sections like that shown above that are publicly stated to be [reserved] are in
fact in use and are merely classified at a high level. For example, its been reported that classified
sections of the National Security Act of 1947 placed the nation in a secret state of martial law, in order
to combat the communist menace (remember that this was at the time of the Rosenbergs, Klaus Fuchs, etc. so
the paranoia was at an all time high at this point), and that there are a number of 'reserved' sections of
the Code of Federal Regulations which were enacted by this Act and are still today classified. At this
point, we start to reach X-files levels of paranoia ourselves, and are wont to end this digression....

This is interesting stuff.  Where can I read more about this?

In answer to your question as to why anyone would invent if they did not
get paid for it, I repeat my argument that inventors WOULD get paid: 
once, at the time of invention.  It would be worth paying them because the
invention would create a new market (or more demand, in the case of an
incremental change to an existing product).  The fact that others would
compete in this market does NOT make the invention valueless to the
supplier; it just means that the firm will only reap its percentage of the
market share, rather than the whole of the market (minus deadweight loss
from monopoization).

Ian, are you SURE your date clock isn't stuck on April 1?

You response definitely supports my post, unintended as
it was to the list.

Whether atoms exist or not exist, the atomist theory is
incredibly good at predicting what the world will do in
many, many contexts.

No.  I emphatically do NOT mean that.  I was only being metaphorical.
Johnson actually thinks a lot of insights from hermeneutics can be used
to broaden and extend Objectivism, particularly in the area of ethics.
Sciabarra thinks Objectivism fits into the Russian tradition of dialectical
philosophy, and thereby shares a lot of methodology with Continental
philosophy.  His book is titled, after all, _Ayn Rand: The Russian
Radical_.

Whether what they believe is true is another story, but their motives,
insofar as I can discern them seem to be not of ideological sabotage
(of either movement).  If they are, they've certainly hoodwinked me --
as I've had extensive contact with both of them.

Also, not all in the Objectivist movement agree with them.  _The
Intellectual Activist_, put out by Robert Stubblefield, a dude in the
Ayn Rand Insititute camp, ran a very negative review of Sciabarra's
book.  _IOS Journal_ (of the rival Institute for Objectivist Studies)
also ran a scathing review of the same work.  Most Objectivists,
from my experience, have ignored or disagree with Sciabarra's
work.  (Johnson is less well known, perhaps because he hasn't
made a splash by writing a major book on the subject.)

As long as one is able to verify their truth and their lies outside of what
they say.  My point, however, was that poststructuralist, postmodernists
and hermeneutics is equivalent to lying.  At least, not all of it is lying.
Surely, some of it -- like any philosophy -- is off the mark.

The thing to do is to look dispassionately at the methods and ideas.
For example, it seems that Sciabarra is onto something when he says
Objectivism is dialectical in method -- even if Objectivists don't know
it.  It might disagree with other dialectical philosophies, such as
Hegelianism and Marxism, but this doesn't change his point.  Both
Newtonian and Einsteinian physics lead to different conclusions
despite having similar methods.

Hi all,

I'm sorry that there were no new "Summa" pieces in the last couple of
weeks, but somehow I couldn't find the required motivation to do some more
Polish-English translating :-(
Instead, I give you the first chapter of Lem's earlier "Dialogs" (from
1957), quite entertaining in fact. The translation is from the German
edition (this time), which isn't flawless, but probably a lot better than
my poor English anyway, so if anything seems incomprehensible, blame it on
me...
In any case, the URL is
 
    http://itp1.physik.TU-Berlin.DE:80/~prengel/Lem/Dialogs/dialogs.htm

(or navigate from my home page).

Bye,
         F.P.

P.S.: In case an English translation already exists somewhere out there,
please let me know, I'll then remove my poor attempt...

Well, this is a tricky point.  As you must know, Rand herself was quite
hostile towards post-structuralism in particular, and I'm fairly certain
that political postmodernism, at the very least, wouldn't sit well with
her, though I can't recall her writing anything in particular about the
postmodernists herself.  On the other hand, she was also quite hostile
towards libertarians, a position which I find puzzling to say the least.

As for hermeneutics, as I seem to recall, one of its central ideas was
that supposedly contradictory elements within a text would coalesce into a
meaning by virtue of the fact that they contradict.  Depending on which
hemeneutic school you're addressing, this is either a restatement of
Rand's flavor of the Aristotelian principle of non-contradiction or its
very antithesis.  Is hermeneutics trying to say that the contradictions
never truly existed, or that they are able to agree despite the fact that
they contradict?  Different writers have answered this question
differently; I think most modern academics would agree more with the
latter than the former, and that Rand would disagree passionately. 

Anyway, I don't assert that poststructuralists are lying to try to get
themselves better funding; rather that they may simply be wrong.  :)

I'm having a hard time reconciling these ideas in my mind, especially with
respect to individuality vs. collectivism.  Applying the dialectic to
politics, as Marx points out, seems to lead us to a certain inevitability
in history.  I'm quite certain Rand would disagree with this, emphasizing
instead the role of the individual in historical events.  Maybe I'm
looking too much at the philosophy itself rather than its methods, but in
my mind the two seem inseparable.

An interesting overview article on hermeneutics is
Extropian Nick Szabo's "Commentaries on Hermeneutics"
at http://www.best.com/~szabo/hermeneutics.html where
he notes: 

"There have been several superficial (aka 'radical')
crypto-Marxist philosophies constructed using a gloss
of Heideggerian language, such as Sartre, Derrida,
et. al., but I take these only as a cautionary tale
to balance Heidegger's influence on Gadamer, who is
probably the most eloquent and thoughtful defender of
tradition in our time."

Another very useful but longer article is
"Hermeneutics: From Textual Explication to Computer
Understanding?" by MIT AI Lab's John C. Mallery,
Roger Hurwitz, Gavan Duffy published in The
Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence, Stuart. C.
Shapiro, editor, John Wiley &Sons, New York, 1987 at
http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/jcma/papers/1986-ai-memo-871/tableofcontents3_1.html
.  They summarize their interpretation of this as
follows:

"In sum, lexical-interpretive semantics differs from
approaches relying on semantic universals because
meaning equivalences are determined dynamically at
reference time for specific language users with
individual histories rather than statically in
advance for an idealized language user with an
unspecific background knowledge but who is
'semantically and pragmatically competent'."

I wonder if Mr. Szabo mightn't be surprised to find that the radicals have
taken over our universities.  :)  Ultimately, yes, hermeneutics can be
formulated with information theory as an algorithmic analysis of something
which is objective: the authorial intent.  However, many modern thinkers
have all but completely eschewed the idea of authorial intent governing
the meaning of a text; it's their own form of anti-authoritarianism. 
Derrida is probably the most historically prominent writer to advocate
this view;  radical though he may be, he is also awfully popular.

Or, more relevant to our earlier discussion about hermeneutics and
objective truth:

"...philosophical hermeneutics is not concerned with verifiable accounts
and, as noted above, it denies the possibility of objective knowledge.
Instead, it argues that only a person who stands in history, subject to
the prejudices of his age, can hope to understand it. A valid
understanding of an event, interaction or text is one that bridges history
or socio-cultural differences to highlight the inquirer's situation." 

The problems with both of these philosophies for capitalism is apparent;
it's impossible to enforce a contract as law if meaning does not
ultimately spring from authorial intent or if the referent of the contract 
varies, depending on the reader's background and upbringing.  We might be
able to make a little headway if we were to assert that legal contracts
are necessarily written in a formal meta-language remarkably LIKE English,
a language designed in such a way as to be infinitely more precise than
our own.  However, even this formulation is not without problems, and
doesn't help us to get around the greater problems presented to us by
philosophical hermeneutics, which I think we ultimately must reject if we
are to accept the existence of an objective reality impervious to
interpretation.

I mentioned nothing that gravity was the truth, some claim that they 
can overcome gravity by blocking that truth from their mind.  then in 
fact if they can, gravity may also be a bias truth.  But wait we are 
told that all things that have mass have gravity, we think this to be 
true, but no one can actually prove it.  Why because much as time 
gravity is a human defined reality, it is something we believe to be 
present but cannot be absolutely sure that is exists.

I certainly believe in gravity, but with minimal doubt.  If someone 
tells me there is a God in the sky, how do I know he is in the sky?  
Why couldn't he be all around us?

Research shows that socialisation is actually one of homeschooling's biggest
benefits.  When you meet kids that have been home educated you're always
amazed at the maturity and poise they display.   There are many reasons for
this but I won't go into detail here.  Suffice to say that your wife might
want to question the social skills that are taught in 'traditional' schools
instead.

If you have a picture in your mind of home-education meaning that the
learning goes on at home, think again.   Home is a great place for reading
books and studying, but there is a big wide world out there for the kids to
explore.  When a child spends their formative years out and about in the
general community and learning social behaviour by that example, they
generally end up better socialised than a child who was penned in for all
those years.  Don't you think ?

Some discussion and resources on research in USA on this issue can be found

I agree.  A friend of mine has 3 kids, all of which are home schooled.  The
oldest is 12 years old and shows a maturity that is completely uncharacteristic
of others that age.  Same goes for the 9 and 7 year-old.  At least once a week,
they go out and do some kind of hands-on education (field trips, museums, tours,
hiking, etc.).  The rest of the week, they are often traveling around town with
their mother doing errands.  They spend the first 3-4 hours every morning doing
more traditional homework, then have access to the internet during the afternoon
hours.

In addition to grant's post, you could also maybe put them in a summer camp or

summer camps.  I think there are benefits from a good pre-school though, but
into higher elementary and beyond home school seems a lot better.  I have good
memories from Montessori school, but who knows what schools will be like in
the near future, my old highschool just set up a graphic arts computer lab
with a lot of high-end programs, it also has a video lab and a photography
lab.  Chemistry labs and that kind of thing are ok too, so perhaps access to
things is what we're looking for.

But they wouldn't be getting paid fairly for it. This is about as logical as a
manufacturer only getting paid for some of the product he makes, i.e. not somthing
which should be legislated or forced on someone. Product for which a manufacturer
is not paid, and which he does not willingly donate to charity or give away is
STOLEN. GET IT?

Also, you are still ignoring my question as to why I or anyone should invent
something to benefit others without our say so as to who can benefit freely from it
and who pays. Anything less is theft.

All you are doing is akin to an attempt to legislate PI to equal 3. Get off your
subjectivist, post modern butt and pay for what you use. No free lunches.

   IAN: Hara Ra, I realize that "April 1" and 
   other such jokes are the best thing you've 
   got going against holism, but I am pleased 
   that you venture to make a logical argument!

   OK, so show us a prediction about any thing 
   A that is made free from relation to not-A.
   When you have shown that to us, you'll have 
   succeeded in supporting your case with a 
   single item of evidence, which is the 
   next step in logical inquiry.

   If you cannot find an example of a predic-
   tion about A made free from relation to 
   not-A, then where is the evidence that 
   atomism helps us make predictions?

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

I apologize in advance for my naivete, and also for perhaps going
off-topic.

	Something that has always puzzled me about Marxism... whence the
_need_ for this thesis-antithesis-synthesis junk? I mean, as long as
they're talking about collectivizing and redistributing the means of
production, the what, why, and how of their ideology is coherent enough to
agree or disagree with. What did they hope to accomplish by tying their
straightforward core meme to shaky generalizations about history,
determinism, and the nature of contradiction? Did the peasants and factory
workers bust out cheering every time Vladimir Ilyich launched into his
quantitative changes lead to qualitative changes speech, or what?
	For that matter, to me the thesis-antithesis doctrine begs the
question:  "won't the opposites of communism and capitalism therefore
synthesize into a mixed-market economy?". Another vulnerability they've
introduced into their ideology for no reason I can see is the assertion
that the victory of communism is an inevitable culmination of unstoppable
historical forces... BUT as soon as communism wins history will come to a
screeching halt and nothing further will ever evolve. Now certainly nukes
made that a distinct possibility toward the end, but I don't think that's
what Marx meant. 
	In short, can someone please explain what the dialectic
materialism meme had to do with the "workers of the world unite" meme? 

                                            --Sincerely, Alex F. Bokov

relaxation

You don't have to shave your head, take a vow to celibacy, or change your
religion to practice meditation.  Entrance yourself with sound, something
quiet and subtle that will pull at your attention and fill your senses with
serenity (I like the sound of running water).  Find a position that you can
be in indefinitely without much discomfort or disruption of circulation to
your limbs.  Pay attention to your breathing and establish a comfortable
rhythm.  Empty your mind of the numerous thoughts flying about, and let
your sensory experience engulf your mind.  Tel your muscles to relax.
Focus on your breathing; let it become the only thing you think of.  This
can paradoxically seem both impossible, and the easiest thing you could
possibly do.  Remain focused, lest you fall asleep.  
determination

intention

It's easy to stray off the path.  You can prepare yourself by having
directions that will take you from wherever you back to where you need to
be.  For example, if you need to write a research paper, make a list of
things you need to do (locate sources, read sources, extract excerpts,
create outline, formulate thesis, etc.).  Whenever you find yourself doing
something that is not productive (read email, IRC, random WWW browsing,
picking dirt off fingernails, etc.), go over your list of things to do and
put yourself back on track.  Done often enough, this process could become
automatic.


awareness

Concentration requires being in a certain state of consciousness
continuously for the desired amount of time.  Music has a powerful effect
on consciousness.  Listen to any type of music that helps you be in
whatever state you need to be in.  If fast thinking is required, fast music
is appropiate.  If repetitive processes are required, repetitive music is
optimal.  If possible, make a CD or tape of the required music and put it
on an endless loop...

alertness

Drugs are cool.  I am, therefore I think.  Caffeine will skyrocket you into
frenzied chaos, but will leave you too scattered to keep your wits.  In
proper amounts, however, it is beneficial.  I thoroughly enjoy a little bit
of chai when I want to be alert.  I am trying out piracetam, finding it
makes me acutely aware of blood flow inside my brain (or the illusion
thereof).  Supplements I recommend:  acetylcholine precursors (phosphatidyl
choline), Vitamins B (all of 'em), C, & E, Gotu Kola, Gingko Biloba, and
DHA (http://www.bio.com/home/martek/neuromins.html).  Of course, it helps
to have a healthy diet with fruits, vegetables, and grains.  I have heard
great things of Hydergine, and am waiting for mine in the mail.  Ginseng is
great, but it is said that it's best not to waste it on one's youth.


determination

Tell yourself you will never give up, and you will take yourself more
seriously.  I once struggled trying to learn a piano piece for 3 hours
straight.  It was frustrating at first, but it got easier once my brain
realized I meant serious business and was not going to leave the piano for
a few hours.  The temptation of scrapping it all and doing something else
is severe, especially if the task at hand is challenging.  Having infinite
patience is difficult, yet simple if one keeps one's priorities straight.
One of my favorite original quotes:  "The more patience you have, the less
patience you'll need."

hope this helps,

Magos

Thread is a soft composite constructed from several different atomic types.
I rank it as complex, if made solely by nano. It's simpler if you add a
small but macro-scale thread spinner at the end of your nano-scale production
line, but by my rules (which I just made up) you then have to add the complexity
of the thread spinner.

Hmm, I'm not too sure about this one. Consider altering the designs to
simplify the parts and to use simple parts. then consider nano-scale
connector systems to replace the bolts and other fasteners.

I put food in an entirely different category of complexity, much harder
than machinery, because it requires much more sophisticated chemistry.

Here, we disagree. I don't think an airplane is at a qualitatively
different level from a disc drive or a complete transmission. As
soon as you get past the level of a single solid part, you must
use macro-level assemblers of some sort. I put robots and factories
in the same category from the standpoint of building the hardware.

I should do a list of my own, but I'm too tired  tonight.

Addiction 93(2): 183-203 1998

"Alcohol Consumption and Mortality. I. Characteristics of Drinking Groups"

Abstract:

Aims. This is the first of a set of three papers evaluating drinking status
and mortality risk. Analyses of multiple studies describe associations of
drinking patterns with characteristics hypothesized to confound the
relationships between drinking status and mortality. Characteristics which
both significantly differentiate drinking groups and are consistent across
studies would suggest that mortality studies not controlling for them may
be compromised.

Design and participants. Associations are evaluated from the raw data of 10
general population studies which contained mortality data. Long-term
abstainers are compared to former drinkers, long-term abstainers and former
drinkers are compared to light drinkers (by quantitiy, frequency and volume
in separate analyses) and moderate to heavy drinkers are compared to light
drinkers. Tetrachoric correlation coefficients assess statistical
significance; meta-analysis determines if associations are homogeneous
across studies.

Measurements. Measures of alcohol consumption are quantity, frequency and
volume; long-term abstainers are differentiated from former drinkers.
Multiple measures of health, social position, social integration and mental
health characteristics are evaluated.

Findings. Across studies, adult male former drinkers are consistently more
likely to be heavier smokers, depressed, unemployed, lower SES and to have
used marijuana than long-term abstainers. Adult female former drinkers are
consistently more likely to be heavier smokers, in poorer health, not
religious, and unmarried than long-term abstainers. Both types of
abstainers are more likely to be of normal or overweight than light
drinkers.

Conclusions. Characteristics of two groups of abstainers, other than their
non-use of alcohol, may confound the associations found between drinking
and mortality risk.

"Alcohol Consumption and Mortality. II Studies of Male Populations"

Abstract

Aims. This is the second of a set of three papers evaluating drinking
status and mortality risk. Analysis of eight general population surveys of
men evaluated all-cause mortality rates by drinking pattern.

Design and participants. Raw data from three studies of youth and five
studies of adults were evaluated. Logistic regression models controlled for
confounding characteristics. Meta-analysis combined study results.

Measurements. Drinking pattern was alternatively defined by quantity,
frequency and volume of drinking. Final models included drinking pattern
(as well as abstinence in the youth models and long-term abstainers and
former drinkers in adult models), age and other confounding variables.
Models also evaluated interactions of age and , respectively, long-term
abstinence and former drinking.

Findings. No evidence was found for the hypothesis that abstinence is
associated with greater mortality risk than light drinking. In the youth
samples, abstainers had a lower risk of dying than those drinking less than
15 times per month. One study of the adult samples showed a significant age
by former drinker interaction; this did not alter the lack of association
of former drinking with mortality risk or the homogeneity of results across
studies for this finding. The most consistent finding was the association
of heavy drinking with mortality among youth. Among adults, drinking 43 or
more drinks per month and drinking 21 or more times per month were
associated with increased mortality risk. Quantity per occasion was not
significantly associated with mortality risk among adults.

Conclusions. That frequent drinking was related to mortality risk, whereas
heavier quantity was unrelated, is inconsistent with the belief that daily
consumption of a few glasses of wine has salutary effects. Empirically,
however this pattern tends to be unusual. Findings were homogeneous across
studies lending generalizability to results.

"Alcohol Consumption and Mortality. III Studies of Female Populations"

Abstract

Aims. This is the third of a set of three papers evaluating drinking status
and mortality risk. Analysis of three general population surveys of women
evaluated all-cause mortality rates by drinking patterns.

Design and participants. Raw data from three studies of adult women were
evaluated. Logistic regression models controlled for confounding
characteristics. Meta-analysis combined study results.

Measurements. Drinking pattern was alternatively defined by quantity,
frequency and volume of drinking. Final models included drinking pattern
(including long-term abstainers and former drinkers) as well as age and
other confounding variables. Models also evaluated interactions of age and,
respectively, long-term abstainence and former drinking.

Findings. In models in which age was controlled, odds of death for
long-term abstainers and former drinkers (defined by volume or quantity)
were greater than those for light drinkers; odds of death for moderate and
heavy drinkers (defined by quantity) were greater than those for light
drinkers. When other psychosocial attributes were controlled, odds of death
were similar for abstainers and light drinkers. When other psychosocial
attributes were controlled, odds of death for heavy drinkers (defined by
volume and quantity) were greater than those for light drinkers. When
interactions of age and the two forms of abstinence were introduced, one
study showed a significant effect of age and former drinking.

Conclusions. Results were consistent with the hypothesis that
characteristics of abstainers other than their non-use of alcohol may
account for their higher mortality risk. With the exception of former
drinkers compared to light drinkers, when interactions were introduced into
models (for measures of quantity and frequency) findings were homogeneous
across studies, lending generalizability to results.

Information is not a product, nor can it be treated as same.  The
provision of information is a service, not a sale of consumable goods.
Your position is like saying that if I light a fire, and then sell you
some, and then you give/sell fire to your friends, you've stolen my fire.

Similarly, your argument that intellectual property is stolen when copied
is valid but unsound; as you should already realize, I am opposed to the
premise that the right of other people to make copies of a piece of
information could be lawfully owned.  Also, with respect to coercion, if
there were no intellectual prpoerty rights, then an inventor who knew this
and created a product anyway must necessarily be aware of the fact that
his transaction has positive externalities.  If the inventor created
anyway, then the action is voluntary; the inventor accepts the fact that
other people would benefit from his/her work.  This is simply stating the
trivial fact that if there were no property, there would be no "theft," in
the technical sense.  This is not a valid reason to eliminate property,
however.  Indeed, I maintain that we should enforce property rights in
such a way as to maximize economic efficiency.  For example, take a look
at: 

http://www.best.com/~ddfr/Libertarian/Machinery_of_Freedom/MofF_Chapter
43.html

Which is chapter 43 of David Friednman's _Machinery of Freedom_, arguing
for the enforcement of only economically efficient property rights.  I
intend to argue that intellectual property rights are NOT economically
efficent, and for that reason should not be enforced as law.

As Friedman notes, the Coase theorem states that if transaction costs are
zero, externalities will be handled efficiently; that is, in this case, if
transaction costs were zero, the inventor could simply say "OK, world. 
I've got my idea.  I'll tell everyone who wants to make a product with it,
all at once, if you all pay me your fair share in doing so."  Clearly this
cannot happen due to the fact that transaction costs are high; trying to
arrange such a bargain would be particularly difficult, especially
considering that you would have to provide provisions to correct for those
who would hold out on the deal, cheat, etc. 

In reality, one of two things might happen: either we might enforce
intellectual property, and as a result pay the high cost of trying to
enforce these laws (especially high over the Internet, where copying is
easy, anonymity cheap and encryption ubiquitious) as well as the
deadweight loss resulting from monopoly, or we should suffer
inefficiencies as inventors are not paid quite as much as they are worth
to society, resulting in a naturally lower price for invention, and thus
some deadweight loss as inventors produce fewer inventions than they
otherwise would.

Now, if we accept an economic analysis of law, then the question we should
be asking ourselves is: what form of intellectual property rights, if any,
is economically efficient?  I say that enforcing intellectual property
rights is more expensive than it is worth; while both result in deadweight
losses, if we presume that the supply curve for COPIES of the information
(or products produced using the idea) would be fairly elastic, a
reasonable presumption considering the ease of copying these days, the
halving of marginal revenues for monopolies would result in drastic
reductions in quantity, by up to 50% as the supply curve approaches total
elasticity.  Chances are something closer to 40% of the market is lost
thanks to monopolization.  And this doesn't yet consider the cost of
enforcement.

On the other hand, without intellectual property, these enforcement costs
would vanish; the only deadweight loss would be that from undervalued
invention.  While it is difficult to estimate precisely HOW undervalued
the price would be, as it would depend on the percentage of the
marketplace with which inventors would be able to sign a contract, it is
not immediately apparent that the inventor faces either a high or a low
elasticity in supply of ideas; I'd guess that it is probably not so
inelastic as the supply of copies is elastic.  Even if I am not precisely
right on this point, however, intellectual property is still not worth
enforcing if the deadweight loss due to undervaluing invention MINUS the
cost of enforcing intellectual property (a non-trivial value) is less than
the deadweight loss due to monopolization.  That is, even if the cost of
undervaluing inventions were greater than the cots of monoplization, it
still wouldn't necessarily be efficent to enforce intellectual property
because you would have to add on the cost of actually ENFORCING the law.

In this case, I don't think it's possible to make a reasonable case that
enforcing intellectual property rights eliminates more economic deadweight
loss than it costs, especially considering that it very likely ADDS to
economic inefficiency rather than reduces it, even if the cost of
enforcement were free.  I am anxious to see how or if you can show me to
be wrong.

> Also, you are still ignoring my question as to why I or anyone should invent

> and who pays. Anything less is theft.

Theft does not exist where property rights do not exist.  In the same way,
a feudal lord is not breaking the law when he exploits his serfs;
rather he defines the law in such a way as to make his actions legal.  I
agree that his actions SHOULD be illegal, but not because it's theft, but
because rigged laws are economically inefficient, and thus fail to maxmize
utility.  In contrast, I argue that intellectual property should not be
enforced, because doing so is not ecnomically efficent, and therefore
fails to maximize utility.

Seems to me that this line could be used by anyone against anyone who
disagrees with them politically.  Empty rhetoric, I say; I could just as
well say the same thing to you.

I'm no subjectivist, nor am I politically postmodern.  Politically, I am a
libertarian, and I justify my views through utilitarian principles.  I
support property rights because they are better for us than socialism, not
because they are objectively morally right.  I am also fully prepared to
pay for my choice of property rights in the deadweight loss which would
result from economic inefficiency.  Are you prepared to pay the cost of
enforcing a bad law?  Or were you looking for that free lunch yourself?

What we should really look for is whether homeschooled kids are better
in social interaction than non-homeschooled kids.  The socialization
issue always comes up with homeschooling, yet I've seen no evidence --
just anecdotes -- about whether kids are better or worse off with home-
schooling.

My gut feeling is that they are better or no different in this area, but I'd
like
to see some studies done.

Cheers!

From: "William H. Stoddard" <whswhs@primenet.com>
To: philosophy of objectivism  <OBJECTIVISM-L@cornell.edu>
Subject: Other minds

A crucial aspect of Ayn Rand's philosophy is her development of an anti-
skeptical position.  The key to this position is her identification of axioms,
or truths that cannot be rejected without committing the fallacy of the
stolen concept.  Rand equates the acceptance of these axioms to the 
affirmation that human knowledge is possible.

But she does not give equal attention to all the skeptical arguments.  Skeptics
classically argued against the validity of the senses, against the existence
of physical objects independent of the mind, against causality; and Rand
presents arguments that all these assumptions are necessary and that they
are aspects of the basic affirmation of existence and consciousness.  But 
skeptics also classically argued against the continuity of consciousness and
the reliability of memory, and against the possibility of knowing that
other minds exist--that other people are conscious.  Rand does not offer a
critique of these claims, nor affirm memory and other minds as axiomatic.

In fact, Rand does not appear to address the question of knowledge of other
minds at all.  This question does appear in Nathaniel Branden's early, 
partially philosophically focused writings, however.  Branden argues that
we are directly aware of our own consciousness; that we are aware of
the actions we perform that proceed from the control of our consciousness
over our bodies; and that, seeing other human beings perform similar 
actions, we are able to infer that they are controlled by consciousnesses
like ours, though we can never be aware of those consciousnesses.  This
is, in fact, very close to the classic introspectionist paradigm in psychology.

Epistemologically, this position has significant problems.  Consider, for 
example, a parallel position about matter:  that we do not have direct
knowledge of material objects, but, from experience the sensory states
that those objects create by impinging on our sense organs, we infer that
the objects exist.  This representationalist model of perception led
naturally to Berkeley's questions about how this inference could be made,
and to Hume's skepticism about knowledge beyond immediate sensory
awareness.  And in just the same way, the claim that we do not have
direct awareness of other minds, but only infer such knowledge, leads to
a skepticism about the validity of this inference that was at least 
latent in Hume and that emerged fully in his logical positivist
successors--and was popularized in some of the fiction of Robert 
Heinlein, who was haunted by a nightmare solipsism that gave rise to
stories such as "They" and "All You Zombies."  In contemporary 
philosophy, it is commonly accepted that any claim to know what is in
another person's mind, or even to know that that mind exist, is difficult
to support and needs special justification.

And metaphysically, Branden's assertion that we cannot perceive
another person's consciousness, but can only infer it from its effects,
comes very close to the dualism that Rand claims to reject, and goes
beyond Rand's legitimate claim that consciousness as such as axiomatic.
It is one thing to say that our consciousness is an axiom which no
knowledge of the physical basis of human life and behavior can ever
overthrow.  But it is another thing to say that no physical instrumentation
can ever detect consciousness.  To assert this is to claim that consciousness
is not and cannot be a physical state or process at all--and if this is true,
then it must instead be some kind of nonphysical state or process.  This
is exactly the kind of approach that Peikoff rejects as rationalistic.  And if
we do likewise--if we leave it to scientific investigation to discover whether
consciousness is a specific configuration of physical changes or something
apart from such physical changes--then we are leaving open the chance
that physical instruments will be able to detect and measure consciousness
within a living brain.

I don't suggest that philosophy can prove by logical arguments that this
can or will happen.  I think it's a question to be settled by observation and
experiment.  In fact, I think observation and experiment have already begun
to settle it--see, for example, Paul Churchland's "The Engine of Reason, the
Seat of the Soul," which shows a sketch of an image taken from the brain of
a monkey looking at a geometric design, in which a distorted but recognizable
variant of that image is spread across the neurons of the monkey's visual 
cortex.

But, beyond questions of scientific fact, I think that philosophy does have
something to say about knowledge of other minds; and I think what it has to
say is quite parallel to what it has to say about knowledge of physical
objects or of cause and effect.

In the first place, I think it can legitimately be claimed that the existence of
other minds is an axiom.  At a trivial level, if X tells Y that X does not
believe
in the existence of other minds, Y is entitled to ask, "Who do you think you
are trying to convince?"  By the mere fact of engaging in philosophical
discussion, we are presupposing that the other participants in the discussion
are conscious.  But, more generally, the existence of other minds is at the
base of our knowledge, and to deny it would be to deny the possibility of
knowledge.

For one thing, conceptual knowledge is embodied in propositions that are
expressed in language.  But language is learned from other people; even if
there are valid cases of children who invented their own languages when
cut off from other human beings, such cases involve at least two children
using language interpersonally.  Solitary children do not learn to use a
language.  But if we are to learn to use language to refer to the physical
world, it appears that we must presuppose that the people from whom we
learn it are also using it to refer to the physical world, and thus that they
too are conscious.

More generally, consider the enormous extent of human knowledge, and
how much human knowledge is needed even to think of philosophical
questions such as whether other people are conscious.  No one person could 
possibly invent all that knowledge alone, or hold it in their awareness.
People may perceive and reason alone, but without a massive cognitive
division of labor, they would do so in an unimaginably narrow scope. We
have to accept that other people have knowledge of reality--and thus that
they are able to identify reality--and thus that they are conscious.  If we
don't, we have no warrant to accept any beliefs that rest on what we
have read, or heard in conversation.  In short, the existence of other minds
is an axiom, in the strongest sense:  to deny that other people are conscious
is to deny the basis of so much of our own knowledge that even the denial
itself could not be claimed to be a valid belief.  Or, to paraphrase John
Galt, let the psychotic who denies that other people are conscious prove
it without drawing on anything they were taught by other people.

But, in the second place, Rand also states that axioms are known by direct
perception.  We don't deduce that existence exists; we see it before us.  We
don't deduce that we are conscious; we experience consciousness.  Axioms
are first known by perception, and only later consciously identified and
underscored as the basis of knowledge; and that underscoring is not a proof
of the axioms--since any attempt to prove anything already presupposes
that they are true--but a recognition that we are presupposing them and
a reaffirmation of our intent to go on doing so.

It's easy to grasp that the validity of the senses can be known implicitly in
this way; all knowledge starts out through sensory perception, and thus
the fact that we are relying on our senses is implicit in all awareness of
anything.  But how can we know that other people are conscious in this
way?  How can we perceive consciousness in other people?

A scientific approach to this question can be found in a book that I believe
has been referred to in this mailing list previously:  Simon Baron-Cohen's
"Mindblindness."  Baron-Cohen proposes that there are automatic neural
mechanisms through which human beings perceive other beings, and
particularly other human beings, as conscious, and that the basis for
autism is the impaired functioning of some of these mechanisms.  Baron-
Cohen describes four such processes:  intentionality detection, which
identifies self-propelled motion; eye-direction detection, which
identifies the focal point of another's attention; shared attention, which
turns one's own attention to such a focal point, as when a baby looks in
the direction of its mother's gaze; and theory-of-mind, which infers
internal mental states.

Whether Baron-Cohen's account of the causes of autism is correct is
a complex issue needing further research.  But the idea that such automatic
mechanisms operate within perception makes it comprehensible that
we could perceive each other's consciousness, rather than inferring it
through abstract thought.  Remember that a perception is a group of
sensations that are automatically retained and integrated into a
whole.  The fact that there is no sensory receptor for the neural activity
within another brain, or for the mental activity within another mind (if the
two are distinct), no more means that we cannot perceive consciousness
than the fact that there is no sensory receptor for three-dimensional
shape means that our brains cannot integrate sensations of light, 
contact, pressure, and muscular effort into a perception of shape, or that
such a perception is merely a theoretical inference, or that it is
open to skeptical doubts.  In fact, perception of three-dimensional
shape is the starting point for our knowledge of the physical world; and
perception of other people as consciousness is the starting point for
our knowledge of psychology, or at least a starting point for it.

And once we are freed of the idea of consciousness as a mysterious hidden
force, state, or process that lurks within the brain, we can see that
consciousness is readily apparent to observation.  Is the cat asleep or
awake?  I say his name, softly, and watch his ears; if they turn toward
the sound of my voice, he is awake and has heard.  When I see this, I see
a shift in his attention--and thus I see his consciousness.  On the usual
dualist or behaviorist accounts, going from the motion of the ears to
the functioning of consciousness to produce that motion requires 
sophisticated scientific and philosophical theorizing, to such a degree 
that only a brilliant mind could achieve it; but, in fact, most species of
animals that are preyed upon have some ability to perceive that a 
predator is looking at them.  Consciousness is known perceptually long
before it is identified conceptually.

Of course, we can be mistaken in seeing someone as conscious, just as
we can be mistaken in seeing two lines as having the same length.  We
can certainly misperceive what specifically another person is paying
attention to, or what they are thinking about it.  But this no more invalidates
our basic awareness that they are conscious than misperception of physical
objects gives us any ground for doubt that physical objects exist.

In short, other minds can be known to exist in the same way that physical
objects can be known to exist, by perception; and such perception is at the
base of our knowledge long before we gain enough knowledge to identify
it consciously as having the status of an axiom, which it has.  And to argue
for knowledge of other minds as an inference from our own introspection
and from perception of other people's bodies is to grant too much validity
to skeptical doubts on the subject--just as to treat physical objects as having
existence inferred theoretically from our own sensations is to grant too
much validity to that sort of skepticism.

---   I do belive  there are psychics  in the world but not  of the  
nature  of  he ones  on  the  phone lines.   I myself have  dreamed  
thing  that  did  come  true most often  in  the same context of  my 
dream.  But the thing  I am most skeptical about  in  the predicting  
on a whim.  Maybe  if you where  sitting  at a  government  computer  
you could  be  seen  as predicting, but  it  is not something that 
humans  can  accomplish.

The problem with "stealing" information is that it is
sooo difficult to show the missing information, since
it isn't.  As long as you still have something, I haven't

After you sell any other product, you don't insist that you

why with information?

Below are some research papers that have been done.  I got this from the FAQ
of the US Home-Ed Mailing List.  Listed are articles showing that they are
academically the same (or better), that their parents don't need to be
qualified teachers and that socializtion isn't an issue and that they go on
to university or work without difficulty.  Anything else ?

Articles in academic journals about homeschooling can be accessed using the
ERIC database (available in many public and university libraries);

When searching in ERIC be sure to look at all the forms of the word
"homeschooling" (i.e. home school, home-school, home education, etc.) in
order to get the largest number of references. You can also write to the
National Home Education Research Institute (see above) for details on how to
obtain their current bibliography of home-schooling articles.

To obtain a copy of a dissertation, be sure to get correct reference numbers
from the University Microfilms International (UMI) Dissertation Abstracts
database or books (according to their literature they are "the only central
source of accessing almost every doctoral dissertation accepted in North
America since 1861").

(Apologies to Susan Masterman for 'borrowing' her title).


I'm mildly surprised that more readers of this list are not fully familiar 
with logician Alfred Tarski's reconstruction of a commonsense 
Correspondence Theory of Objective Truth, utilizing a metalanguage, 
whereby we evaluate the truth content of formal statements concerning 
objective reality.

   This following example is a bit more complex than first appears -- it's 
   deceptively simple -- sometimes there is more to the obvious than is 
   obvious...  >:-} ).


   Following Tarski, we may say:
   
   'The statement "le ciel est bleu" is true if --
   
   and only if --
   
   the sky is, in fact, blue.'
   
   Thus, we can examine and test the correspondence of statements with 
   objective reality, with the metalanguage serving to avoid tautology, 
   among other things.
   
   Readers of Popper will be fully cognizant of Tarski's wonderful 
   breakthrough, which provides unbreakable logical foundations for the 
   commonsense idea that there exists a truth directly related to reality, 
   without all the subjectivist errors and pitfalls.


   Bayesian Probability is worth a look too -- it's extensively favored by 
   the intelligence community, which is why my friend Admiral Gayler says 
   "Intelligence work is a probabilistic kind of thing."  But Tarski's 
   method is superior in that it is exact, not probabilistic.

   of my great friend Jeremy Shearmer (for eight years Popper's Research 
   Assistant) who knew him well.  I thought he was a bit 'stand-offish' 
   (he _did_ say "I don't care what anyone thinks.').  This seemed a bit 
   odd for a philosopher and an acolyte of Werner Erhard's 'est'!  The 
   world (and I mean 'the entire world') is however permanently indebted 
   to him for his rescuing some of Popper's unpublished writings.

   Bartley wrote a lovely book on Lewis Carroll's Logic.  It's such a 
   shame to lose people like Bartley and Feynman so young.

   I think his (prize-winning) book on Erhard and 'est' is very brave (he 
   expected it to ruin his academic reputation, instead of which it won 
   eleven prizea!  >:-} ) but is badly flawed by its failing to identify 
   the origins of the various elements of the 'est' training, foremost 
   among which are Mind Dynamics and Silva Mind Control.
   
   Feynman (Richard) knew Werner Erhard too, BTW.  I've been to meetings 
   with Erhard, but never met him personally.  He's very funny, and a 
   brilliant raconteur.  I haven't done his 'Forum' training, so I can't 
   say whether it has the flaws (or the brilliance) of 'est.' I'm wary of 
   things with Roman titles -- I'm with Greece against Rome (and Athens 
   against Sparta).

   I'll always remember thinking, early on in the 'est' training: "This is 
   the most brilliantly clever, intricate and powerful thing I've _ever_ 
   seen in all my life."  (I'd already toured NIMROD at Harwell, the 
   Atomic Energy Research Establishment) when it was under construction. 
   The big accelerators are truly _awesome_).  With all its faults, that's 
   still true. I work on a CD-ROM based Human Potential Skills Evocation 
   Programme which will (I hope!) be _more_ brilliant, _more_ intelligent; 
   and _staggeringly_ powerful.

  But even if things did not behave predictably

   IAN: I also had one vivid dream sequence from which 
   I awoke. Several weeks later the entire event unfolded,
   down to the most minute details,  involving things in 
   a room I'd never been before and the people in it and
   the things they were doing. It was a doctors office.
   Precancerous growths were found and removed from 
   me, so the event had a significance. So many 
   details were exact that I have to believe
   that I had some kind of "fore vision."

   At the time of the dream I had no idea that I would 
   be at that doctor's office or that I had any health 
   problem, so it could not have been anticipation.

   I've also had deja vu that's too uncanny to dismiss. 
   It could be that we're "time blind," we cannot see down
   the forth dimension for some reason. If we could we'd
   it would probably destroy the illusion of being a free
   agent. The mind obviously evolved to compensate for being
   time blind by having to think logically in order to  be
   able to predict what will happen. It's impossible to con-
   ceive of existing physically in any way other than being 
   time-blind. But it may be that somehow at rare moments 
   the mind catches a glimpse of the future. But I agree 
   with you that probably nobody can control such vision. 

   The fact that experiments in quantum physics have shown
   the backward-time-travel of particle waves, and the fact
   that our brains are "tuned into the field," as it were,
   may lay the physics ground work to explain psychic stuff:

Information can certainly be treated as any other product. Since information cannot exist
in nothingness, it needs to be represented in an arrangement of printed letters, or
electrons, or sound waves, then it certainly has material existence and is therefore a
product.

A service is work, a kinetic, not a static state. Information is static like any other
product. Transmitting information is doing work as it is a kinetic action, expending
energy to do work, so the act of transmission is a service, and the act of agreeing to
lend someone the use of my information for specific purposes on the condition that you do
not reproduce my information to sell to others is also a service. The information which
is lent is still a product.

Moreover, service, or work, is the ultimate property right, unless you beleive in
slavery. Only a slave does not have sole right to his or her own labor. An individual
cannot have his or her work stolen from them. Intellectual property rights protect the
product of that work, whether it is a statue, a song, a building, a machine, or anything
else which is the result of man applying his or her intelligence to add value to
something.

I understand your logic, and beleive that you are wrong in your economic evaluation.
Without a protect of an inventors intellectual property rights, there will not be the
same level of invention as there is when there are such protections. The human race is
desperately dependent on advancing technology from invention that is stimulated by
intellectual property rights incentives, only because we are stuck on one planet with an
ever increasing population. Every increase demands greater efficiency of resource
utilization, something which can only happen with high levels of invention. You have
ignored the incentive effect that such protections have on technological development.

Exactly, which is why your concept cannot work and maintain a decent level of
technological advancement.

There are many ways to doctor information to ensure that it can be identified as a copy.
For example, in my work, I deal with mail list brokers. We do mailstream processing for
their customers. The broker will send us a tape or disk with file(s) that the customer
rents from the broker for a single or more use. The customer then does his or her mail
campaign with the rented list. The doctoring comes in in that the list is seeded with
dummy name records which are set up by the broker. The customer does not know what names
are seed names and what are real names, so they send their mail campaign to all of the
names. The seed names receive the capaign materials (magazines, junk mail, free samples,
what have you) and log it. If the customer is larcenous, they will try to use the rented
list more than once, and wind up sending materials to the address the other times,
including to the seed addresses. THis way, the broker knows that the customer is breaking
the list rental agreement and can charge the customer for additional use of the list.

Intellectual property enforcement  costs are extremely low, because it is very easy for
the public to know when a product is a knock off or not. Granted they have gone up in
recent years, but only because we have opened our economy wide to the Chinese, who have
no respect for intellectual property, nor any other type of property or individuality, it
seems. Rather than looking at pirating as a positive externality, look at the cost of
enforcement as an externality created by pirates that everyone has to pay. If trade with
pirate economies were cut off, our cost of intellectual property enforcement would go
down again.

You have to date, only guessed. Since the current situation is one where intellectual
property is respected and enforced, I think that the onus is on YOU to prove your point
with real numbers. Until you do, all we can think of your ideas is that they are quaint
fantasy with no basis in fact.

I think that history shows that lack of intellectual property enforcement causes
invention to be severely undervalued. Looking at how national borders create natural
limitations on intellectual property rights, and how making such rights enforceable
across borders via tools such as GATT it seems rather clear that prior to enforced
intellectual property rights, invention was severly undervalued, and the rates of
productivity growth suffered as a result. Today's startling increases in  productivity
just a few years after GATT are proof that expanding the incentive to invent expands the
rate of invention and therefore the rate of productive growth

Considering that you have refused to respond to my refutation of your assertion that an
invention is a monopoly, your argument does not stand. Any engineer will tell you that
there are always many many ways to solve a problem. Only problems are unique. Invention
is not a monopoly market.

I don't need to. The present economy is my own proof. YOU need to come up with proof that
economic growth would be higher without such protections. That the US has one of the
highest levels of intellectual property protections, along with among the top 3 or 4 per
capital incomes/standards of living, and among the highest economic and productivity
growth rates for a nation at its state of development (a third world with a 50% growth
rate doesn't mean anything if they are starting from nothing.)

No, theft is when someone benefits from someone else without that persons permission or
acquiescence. To fail to protect the product of an individuals mind is to declare that
all minds are slaves to society, that the individual has no rights at all. That is a
collevtivist, subjectivist, post modern scam if ever I heard one.

Fails to maximize the utility of what or who?? Society? Sorry, society has no rights, and
is not entitled to its own utility. Lack of intellectual property is enslavement of the
mind to the collective. Bye Bye BORG.

Hardly. As history has shown intellectual property works (American history). Lack thereof
does not work (most everywhere else's history)

You have yet to objectively and scientifically demonstrate that it is a bad law. The only
dead weight here are those who steal the product of another's mind.

Sure, as long as its free enough for me to go nuke anyone who steals my
property....remember, I'm with the Force Doctrine camp as the source of human
rights. Whether I do it personally or have my government representatives do

I don't sell my invention, I rent its use. A lease agreement (license) is not
a bill of sale.

If inventions were monopolies, you might be right. However as any engineer
can tell you, there are always many ways to solve a problem. Only problems
are unique. Therefore, any one invention is not in a monopoly position in a
market. (contrary to popular beleif, Windows is not a monopoly, no matter
what the government says. As there are many other operating systems out there
that can be used, that anyone can choose from freely, Microsoft forces no one
to buy their product.)

Pet Cloning, Homegrown Steak & Cell Phone Spying

RECYCLED ROVER

Pussycats might soon live more than nine lives. Prepare
yourself for the next wave of future shock -- pet cloning.

A Las Vegas company called Clonaid says that by September it
will start duplicating dogs and other household critters. Pet
owners will never again have to suffer the loss of a beloved.


"This is the next step toward human cloning, our ultimate
goal," said Clonaid scientific director Dr. Brigette
Boisselier. "We have been contacted by many people who want to
give there pets eternal life."

Clonaid is closely associated with the Raelian Movement, a
group founded in the 1970s that believes life on earth was
created in laboratories by space aliens known as the Elohim.
Their founder, Rael, says, "Cloning will enable mankind to
reach eternal life."

"We foresee no legal hurdles and less ethical resistance than
with human cloning," Boisselier says.

The cloning procedure for a horse will probably cost at least
$100,000, she says. Other animals may be cheaper based on
their size and gestation period.

Not sure when you want to send in the clones? Try Clonaids
Insuraclone. With this service, Fidos cells are stored in
something akin to a blood bank. If he ever chews on the wrong
bone, you then decide whether you want to defrost a
replacement. 

Cloning Tip: If your pet dies, dont pack it in ice and ship it
to Clonaid. For best results, deep freeze the pooch in liquid
nitroge

Where does this reasoning leave trade secrets? If they become public
knowledge via theft, under your reasoning, there's no recourse unless you
catch the thief in the act?

The information in a patent is freely available to anyone who wishes to see
it. The nominal fee the patent office charges is for filing and
reproduction. The right to build PRECISELY what the patent describes is all
that is owned by the patent holder. All others are welcome to use the
information to make a better product, or to make the original patented
thing obsolete, if they wish. They are just not free to reap the benefits
of someone else's hard work in developing the original product, for a
period of time that should be long enough for the inventor to recoup his
initial expenses and most likely for the whole idea to become painfully
passe..

Obviously, there are people and businesses out there who abuse the patent
system, such as the guy who had an 'idea' for the microprocessor, but never
did any actual development. Later, when others had independently invented
the thing, he came back and fought for a patent on the grounds that it was
'his idea'. I believe he won..

A local electrical engineer here has made a career of patenting any and all
schemes related to discharge lighting such as metal halide, florescent, and
neon, and electronic ballasts. Numerous times a cursory search of the
Motorola data books from ten and twenty years back will find the identical
circuit he has received a patent on last week.

Instead of scrapping the whole system and the protections given to prevent
a real inventor's ideas from being stolen by those with the bucks to outgun
him, why don't we think of ways to correct the flaws in the present patent
and trademark laws? Perhaps a return to the 'working prototype' concept
would suffice - if you can't build a working model of what you propose,
it's either not well enough thought out to be a real invention, or it's
unpatentable because it does not work.

I thought the Microsoft problem came from their strongarm tactics of
telling PC vendors they could not offer competing software on PCs with
Microsoft OS installed, thus preventing other software makers from
contracting with these same vendors to include THEIR code..

Something akin to the way car Chevy dealers used to be prohibited from
selling other brands in the same showroom with Chevys - I believe something
legal was done about that a few years ago.. Coke and Pepsi at the same
fountain - etc. etc. etc. All these are 'monopolies' of a sort, aren't they?

I disagree.  Information is completely immaterial.  Conisder:  I am a
novelist who has written a book.  I have taken energy, ink and paper and
turned them into a draft.  If I submit this draft to my publisher, he
could publish it.  Obviously, I have added value to the ink, paper and
energy by writing my novel.  (Let's imagine for a moment that my novel is
good.  :) )

However, if I gave YOU the same ink, paper and energy and told you to
write my novel, you couldn't do it.  You probably couldn't even do it if I
gave you TWICE as much energy.  Why?  Because you would not know what my
novel says or is about: you would not have the information.

The fact that given ample matter and ample energy you could not generate
my information means that it is a very different process from widget
making, which economics presumes CAN be done by anyone with enough labor
and capital.

Information is also unlike a product in that, unless I forget about it, I
can never return it to you, nor have you lost your use of it while I
borrow it.  Whether or not you agree that this is a service rather than a 
product, I think you must admit that this an attribute which is unique
to information; I argue that it is because of this unique property that we
should not enforce property rights over it.

Go back and reread, and then consider my coercion point a little more
carefully.  Suppose there are no property rights, and I am deciding
whether or not I am going to invent.  I know that if I invent, many people
besides me will benefit.  Suppose that I decide to do so anyway, FULLY
AWARE of the fact that others will benefit.  Since this action is
voluntary, and not coerced, then the benefit which others would take from
my action as an externality is not stolen, but willingly given; if I was
unwilling to give it, then I would not have done so, and refused to
invent.

Now, this externality is still bad, because it means that I do not have
enough of an incentive to invent as I otherwise should.  I ACKOWLEDGED
that in my last post:  this was the "deadweight loss as inventors produce
fewer inventions than they otherwise would."  I argued that this
deadweight loss would be OUTWEIGHED by the economic efficiency gained from
not enforcing those rights.  Let's examine this more carefully.

I did NOT ignore it; I specifically referred to it, and argued that it
would be outweighed by the deadweight loss due to monopoly plus the cost
of enforcement.

Wrong.  The fact that transaction costs are not zero means that the system
of allocation of resources is inefficient; this is represented by
deadweight loss.  However, enforcing intellectual property is ALSO
inefficent, as it grants monopolies over copes of ideas, resulting in more
deadweight losses, as well as incurring the cost of enforcement.

The question is not which system is inefficient and which is not; the
question is which is LEAST inefficient.

If each buying person gains equal utility from a copy as they do from the
original (an extremely likely presumption when we're talking about pure
information) then it becomes profitable to buy your goods from the black
market rather than from reputable dealers.  And if you think the black
market for information is easy to break, the software industry has NEWS
for you.

Even today, software copyrights simply aren't enforced on a wide scale; to
do so would require monitoring everyone's personal computers and
wire-tapping the whole Internet; it's completely impossible to
discover/prevent if the pirates are using encryption for anonymity and
transmission.  You'd have to outlaw cryptography in order to even come
close to eliminating software piracy.

Software piracy is probably the highest costing market upon which to
enforce intellectual property; music probably comes in a close second
(it's a black market which is unevenly enforced so you can't get official
numbers for this sort of thing).  However, even if the cost due to
enforcement is lower for some goods than for others (your mailing list,
perhaps), you STILL have the problem of deadweight loss due to
monopolization of copies.  Basically, I'm covered by BOTH effects: the
cost of enforcement AND monopolization.

Your logic is dizzying: the more the positive externality happens, (which
this is, by definition,) the more we have to pay to stop it from
happening!  Of course, if we weren't trying to pay for IP's enforcement,
then we would circumvent that part of the problem entirely.

Guessing?  Only so as to provide extra precision.  If you'd like I can
stick to being very general, based on what we already know.  We already
know that the cost to an individual of producing another copy of a piece
of information is low, and that it does not increase significantly when
lots of people are producing lots and lots of copies.  Therefore, we know
that the production of copies is nearly completely elastic.  (HOW near is
what I was trying to guess.)  Since the marginal revenue curve for
monopolies is half of the demand curve, we know that it will strike the
P=0 line at 0.5Q, where Q is the quantity demanded when P=0.  If the
marginal cost curve were completely elastic, then the market for copies
would shrink by 50% thanks to monopolization.  Again, since it is only
nearly completely elastic, deadweight loss is is only nearly 50%; I
guessed 40%, which gives me a large margin for error.

Oh, there's no question that the rate is affected. I agree: when the
incentive goes up, invention goes up, and when incentive goes down,
invention goes down.  That's not what I'm on about.  What I'm saying is
this:  we know both that the market for copies is slashed by at least 40%
when IP is enforced, and that the cost of enforcement is non-trivial.  Is
monopolization's deadweight loss plus the cost of enforcement GREATER than
or LESS than the deadweight loss due to decreased invention?  I say
greater; you know why.

We must assume that the engineer's ability to route aroun IP is not a
significant effect, otherwise IP has NO economic effect at all: whenever
you try to patent your idea, I invent another one just like it and you
gain nothing.  If this is true, then the only difference in costs between
enforcing IP and not enforcing IP is the cost of enforcement; and that's
in MY favor, not yours.

However, if we assume that IP cannot be so easily routed around, as we
must if we think IP will have any effect, then we must observe that IP is,
by its very definition, granting the inventor monopoly rights over copies
of their idea.  This is how we define IP; there isn't any argument to be
made here.  And, since in this market copies are cheap and supply is
elastic, the market for copies suffers at least 40% losses thanks to
monopolization.

I'm making a MICROecnomic argument, not a macroeconomic argument.  As you
well know, there are hundreds of thousands of effects which have positive
and negative effects on the economy, many of which are present in the US
and not in other areas (or vice versa).  The only macroecnomic argument
which I can present is that microeconomic efficiency, as a trend, leads
towards greater GDP.  However, the behavior of one market can never be
used to predict the behavior of the economy as a whole.  Microeconomic
markets tend to clear and/or equilibrate; they have no business cycle.
The macroeconomy is practically the antithesis of this model.

If I am right, then IP is just one of the galaxy of factors which hold
America back from greater growth, none of which alone could possibly
explain our growth rate.

> No, theft is when someone benefits from someone else without that persons permission or

If there are no IP rights, and the inventor invents despite knowing this,
then the inventor has, by necessity, acquiesced.

Well, how does this sound:  I declare that individuals have a right to
their physical property and energy, and that anyone has the right to
organize their property in any way they want, even if they organize their
property just like someone else's property.

Doesn't sound very collectivist to ME.

What striking rhetoric.  No, not the utility of society, but of all of the
individuals in society, in sum.  Just like how America's wealth is not the
wealth owned by America, but the wealth owned by every individual in
America (and that's the way it should be!), I refer to net utility as the
utility possessed by every person in the nation. 

See?  Not collectivist.

> Hardly. As history has shown intellectual property works (American history). Lack thereof
> does not work (most everywhere else's history)

Whether IP works or doesn't work is the subject of debate; it cannot be
demonstrated by looking at GDP, as many nations which DO have IP are
nonetheless doing poorly macroeconomically; the behavior of one market
does not dictate the success of the whole.

> Are you utilitarian or libertarian. There is a distinct difference.

My ethical principles are utilitarian.  Because of that, I certify that I
do not believe in or advocate the initiation of force as a means of
achieving political or social goals.  You decide whether that makes me a
libertarian or not.

> You have yet to objectively and scientifically demonstrate that it is a bad law. The only

Monopolization objectively leads to deadweight loss.  I have argued that
the law is bad for this reason.  Now it's time for you to show how the
deadweight loss under my system is bigger than the deadweight loss under
your system as well plus the cost of enforcement.

By the way, would you consider increasing the margins on your mailer?

At last, _The Ethics of Liberty_ by Murray N. Rothbard is again

natural rights and private property, is Rothbard's most extended 
treatment of the subject, but it has been out-of-print since
1984. 

This new edition, from New York University Press, features an 
extended analysis of Rothbard's contribution to political economy 
by his student and colleague Hans-Hermann Hoppe, a new bibliography,and a
new index. Hoppe compares Rothbard's theory 
of the pure private property society with John Rawls's defense of 
redistribution and Robert Nozick's early advocacy of the minimal state. 

Rothbard covers the theory of rights as well as applications to 
criminal justice, the market for protection, family law, boycotts, 
animal "rights," lifeboat situations, land monopolies, relations 
between states, immigration, and free speech. He discusses 
utilitarian economics, the unanimity principle, "negative liberty," 
Hayek on coercion, and the Nozickian state. Finally, Rothbard delves 
into the intellectual and political strategy for achieving liberty. 

The book, an uncompromising philosophical defense of the foundation 
of a free society, is 308+xlix pp. and beautifully hardbound. It
is available for $28 (postpaid in the U.S.) from the Mises 
Institute, Auburn University, Auburn, AL, 36849. Inquire about 
foreign postage. Phone 334-844-2500; fax 334-844-2583; credit card 
orders can be sent to mises@mises.org

Says NYU Press: 

"What distinguishes Rothbard's book is the manner in which it roots
the case for freedom in the concept of natural rights and applies it
to a host of practical problems. An economist by profession,
Rothbard here proves himself equally at home with philosophy. And
while his conclusions are radical--that a social order that strictly
adheres to the rights of private property must exclude the
institutionalized violence inherent in the state--his applications
of libertarian principles prove surprisingly practical for a host of
social dilemmas, solutions to which have eluded alternative
traditions."

Sorry to jump in the middle of your thread guys, but you got me thinking
about a particular example.

-----Original Message-----

The problem of course on the internet with this method is knowing *who* the
client is that has pirated your list.

For my example I will use a software purchase over the internet.  In it's
simplest form;
1) The customers requests and pays for the software
2) The software is "watermarked" in some way to identify who it was sold to
3) The customer downloads this package, and if any pirate copies turn up
then we've got him.

The problem here is of course that there is currently no way of providing
this sort of identity matching.  Short of smartcard implants at birth or DNA
authenticators on PC's, there may never be an effective way of doing this.

If you use my credit card number to watermark the file, it does you no good
to track me down because even though it was a *valid* credit card, I had
circumvented the bank's identification policy and got it in a false name.
You won't catch me because you don't know who to chase after.

In fact any "digital signature" is only as strong as it's policy for being
issued by the authority who makes it.

I'm interested in any pointers to discussions about how the information
economy will operate given the above conditions.  In my opinion this is a
fundamentally different problem than has previously been addressed by any
economic model.  How does Tim May's "Crypto-Anarchic Manifesto" translate to
real life and real economic activity ?

Keep the thread going, it's an interesting discussion.  Better than A=!A
etc..  Ignore this detour if it isn't central to your point - I just wanted
to have expand on it a bit.

This is another example of the increasing costs of government; it expands
the economic price window in which an anarcho- capitalistic PPA can
function.  As laws like this become harder and harder to enforce,
ultimately laws WILL be enforced according to economic efficiency.  Having
a "government" in place only serves to create friction in this market. 

Note that you could get around this problem of anonymity simply by passing
a law stating that all commerce has to happen via book entry settlement
using government issued digital signitures, but the cost of such an
enterprise would far outweigh its earnings.  A PPA could save money this
way by charging the same price (or tax) as the government currently
imposes, minus the price window, and then enforcing only those laws which
were economically efficient.  Since the government needs funding in order
to run its business, the gov't would eventually have to shut down.

If you want the "official" text on this subject, check out:
http://www.oberlin.edu/~brchkind/cyphernomicon/
It's May's Cyphernomicon, which expands on the manifesto and adds
a variety of important details.

  An overview of body weight of older persons, including the

  Examination Survey I--Epidemiologic Follow-up Study.

Abstract
  The authors studied distributions of body weight for
  height, change in body weight with age, and
  the relationship between body mass index and
  mortality among participants in the Epidemiologic Follow-up
  Study of the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHEFS)
  (n = 14,407), a cohort study based on an representative sample of the U.S.
  population. Percentiles of body weight for
  height according to age and sex are presented.
  Cross-sectional analyses of body weight suggest that mean
  body weight increases with age until late middle age, then
  plateaus and decreases for older aged persons. However, longitudinal analysis
  of change in weight with age shows that younger persons in the lower quintile
  at baseline tend to gain more than those in the higher quintile. Older
  persons in the higher quintile at baseline have the greatest average loss in
  weight. The relationship of body mass index to
  mortality is a U-shaped curve, with increased risks in the
  lowest and highest 15% of the distribution. Increased risk of
  mortality associated with the highest 15th percentile of the
  body mass index distribution, as well as the highest 15% of
  the joint distribution of body mass index and skinfold
  thickness, is statistically significant for white women. However, the risk
  diminishes when adjusted for the presence of disease and factors related to
  disease. More noteworthy is the fact that there is a statistically
  significant excess risk of mortality for both race and sex
  groups in the lowest 15% of the body mass index distribution
  after adjusting for smoking history, and presence of disease. Those in the
  lowest 15% of the joint body mass index and skinfold
  thickness distribution, were also at increased risk. Risk of
  mortality for both men and women who have lost 10% or more
  of their maximum lifetime weight within the last 10 years is statistically
  significant, even when controlling for current weight. This study has
  replicated previously reported relationships, while correcting for several
  methodological issues.

This is a good idea. I like to make "to do/maybe" lists - list of
things to do (often branched, with subtasks marked) and things I maybe
should do. It is very good feedback to see what I have done (already
checked) and what is possible to do.

It is also useful to learn to recognize when one is wandering or have
slipped out of the right kind of state; this can be surprisingly hard
to notice sometimes.

Caffeine seems to promote rapid, well-trained actions but makes you
less efficient at tasks requiring uncertain decisions, creativity or
fluid thinking. But the personal variations are great, and seems to
depend on the baseline level of arousal.

Of course, the hardest thing is to train oneself to achieve better

It's easy to be a psychic.  All you have to do is get set up to take
credit card numbers over the phone.  As a credit-accepting merchant, you
can arrange access to look up customer's credit records online as they
call.  By looking at the caller's credit records, the psychic has
instant information about you, including:

Your current address, and a history of your addresses:  "I sense that
you just moved from the desert southwest to a place near an ocean, maybe
6-8 months ago...  I sense that you move every 2-3 years."

Your current salary, and a history of your salaries:  "I sense that you
just got a raise...  I sense that you frequently get raises..."

Credit problems and late bills:  "I feel that you started having money
problems recently.  I sense that you had plenty of money, and your
problems didn't start until this year..."

Creditors and new accounts:  "I see that you just bought a new sports
car...  I also see a hospital stay last year...  Did you have a death or
some kind of funeral arrangements two years ago?...  I sense you working
with realtors, and maybe moving into a new house very soon!...  I see
you starting to work out at the Gym, and starting to take sky-diving
lessons!...."

Types of creditors or purchases:  "I see you working with lots of
computer equipment...  You just bought a lot of new equipment...  I
sense $10,000's worth just last month!..."

900-numbers:  "I feel you are a lonely person...  I see you calling
900-sex lines seeking companionship...  This started three or four
months ago..."

Long distance credit card calls:  "I see you traveling out of the
country a lot...  I sense you were in asia this past year....  You were
in Paris just recently..."

You get the idea.  I want to be your Psychic Dog!  Send me your credit
card numbers now.  My spirit-guide tells me you want to!  The first 10
minutes is FREE FREE FREE while I look up your credit history!  The
extremely gullible can qualify for extra charges!

  IAN: "Tarskian truth" seems to be exactly
  the case for a definable truth I was making.

  Physical reality is true, and words are true
  to the extent they map onto reality one-one.
  This is also the natural notion of truth,
  since a lie is a report about events in 
  the physical world that do/did not exist,
  and thus do not map onto the physical world.

First computer-assisted open-heart surgery performed in France 


Copyright © 1998 Nando.net
Copyright © 1998 The Associated Press 


PARIS (May 22, 1998 06:56 a.m. EDT http://www.nando.net) -- French surgeons
used computers and robots to perform open heart surgery on six patients
this month, a technique that doctors say could result in less trauma and
pain for the patient.

The first operation took place on May 7 at Paris' Broussais Hospital,
followed by five other successful heart operations using the same
technology, the hospital said.

Developed by Intuitive Surgical, of Mountain View, Calif., the technology
"lets us perform difficult, even (heretofore) impossible, gestures," Dr.
Alain Carpentier, who lead the team of French doctors, said Thursday.

"It's a revolution, a formidable step forward," said Carpentier, who
performed the surgery with Dr. Didier Loulmet.

Speaking at a news conference, Carpentier said that higher precision is
among the benefits of the system officially called computer-assisted
instrumentation.

The system uses "mini-incisions" and is less traumatizing and less painful
than traditional techniques, but also more difficult, a hospital statement
said.

Several of the six patients, all adults, suffered from heart valve disease.
The first patient had a defect involving communication between the heart's
two upper chambers, the atria.

Using the system, the surgeon sits at a console several yards from the
patient, peering inside the heart via a three-dimensional camera inside the
patient and directing a robot that actually performs the surgery.

The surgeon's gestures are transmitted by computer to the robotic tools,
which "faithfully reproduce all movements of the surgeon," Carpentier said.

Dr. Philip Oyer, professor of cardio-thoracic surgery at Stanford
University, said the computer-assisted technique is part of a new trend of
minimally invasive surgery. Much of the early promise of the techniques has
not been borne out, however, he added.

"But there's no doubt many people are working on it and pushing the limits
and this (computer-assisted surgery) is one more step along that road,"
Oyer said in a telephone interview.

Carpentier said it was the U.S. military that originally conceived the
notion of a robot surgeon that could work on battlefields, a dream that
"sat in the drawers of the American Army for years."

The physician said he was excited when operating with the new technique
"because you are in a world that you have never seen before," including the
insides of the heart's lower chambers.

"I think it is the same emotion that the people who first walked on the
moon must have felt," he said.

Some skilled martial artists will occasionally go into brief moments of 
transcendence during combat, essentially amnesiatic fugues in which the 
body carries on its tasks without conscious awareness.

  This would definately be a change.  I don't think it could be called 
meditation afterwards.  Meditation is intended to produce transcendental 
experiences, at least in the major meditative schools.  The fundamental 
property of transcendental consciousness (also called the introverted 
mystical experience) is the complete abscence of any defining 
characteristics.  If a concept of mathematical and scientific truths 
persist, then there can't be nothing, and thus it is not a 
transcendental experience.  However, I am not saying that such a goal is 
necesarily far from meditation.  It is reported in various meditation 
literature that in states very close to transcendence highly abstract 
and mathematical concepts persist after all the more gross thoughts and 
sensations have disappeared.   DesCartes' Meditations may be an example 
of a state of consciousness just short of transcendence where all 
awareness of the environment has disappeared but pure individuality and 
abstract reasoning persist.  The increase in pure intellect you seek may 
be found fluctuation around the transcendental moments of pure 
meditation.

  I have a question about how far you can take a Tarskian truth such as 
'The sky is blue'.  It certainly is some of the time, but towards sunset 
it can be orange and red, if it is overcast it can be grey, if it is 
nighttime it can be black, and if it is nighttime in the city, some 
orange or purplish color.  If an H-bomb goes off nearby, it will be 
blindingly white just like everything else.  If you are colorblind, it 
will be grey.  It may be blue now, but if the sun goes out tonight, it 
will never be blue again.  From what perspective does one decide whether 
the statement "le ciel est bleu" can be truthfully mapped onto the 
objective world? From the viewpoint of the observer?  This merely says 
that people have subjective views on the state of the world.  If a 
sighted man says "le ciel est bleu" to a colorblind man and a blind man, 
one will disagree or consider it a difference of opinion, and the other 
one will have to accept it as hearsay.

True, but if "blue" is strictly defined (which is the sort of thing you
can do when you're talking about meta languages) then the sky TRULY is or
isn't blue.  That it becomes black at night doesn't negate the proof; even
then, it truly is or isn't black.

How to identify the truth is a separate point which I don't think Tarski
answers; he merely shows that there IS truth.  (An important
accomplishment, especially in the face of certain sollipsists who assert
that the truth is whatever we think it is.)

I have also been thinking of the many zen koans that describe how
masters hit their students with the stick after one of them had
uttered or done something profound. My explanation is that the
surprise and pain triggers an adrenaline reaction, making memory
encoding more efficient :-)

Or rather, the awareness is disconnected from the actual tasks. This
is also common in crisis situations; "He felt there was somebody else
fighting" etc. Some form of dissociation, might be very useful.

The problem is that the complaintants are only the BIG PC makers. The small guys
don't care or have not had problems. Where Microsoft demanded this special
treatement with PC makers was because the big PC makers wanted specially low
pricing on Windows, lower than what they were previously paying on their normal
quantity scales. In exchange, Microsoft decided that they wanted tit for tat,
special treatment for special treatment. I am surprised that nobody has mentioned
this in the news at all....

No, they are merely competetive advantages. It seems that the Justice Dept has
strayed from mere anti-trust into the area of nullifying competetive advantage.

Don't get me wrong, I don't like many of the things that microsoft does, but they
are mostly to do with the way their software works. If their 'monopoly' is such a
problem with consumers, then the market should be able to protest with their
dollars just like any other democracy.

Yes, the act of writing a novel is a service. The resultant manuscript is a product. Do you see
the difference? One is kinetic and the other is static.

Because I cannot produce exactly the same service as you. However, if I were given an outline
of the novel, descriptions of the characters, I could certainly create a reasonable facsimile
of the novel that you would have produced. My writing the novel is a service, the resultant
manuscript is a product.... get it yet?

No, if I do not give another manufacturer exact plans for the widget I produce, then by
definition his widget is going to be slightly different. Even if I tell manufacturer A and
Manufacturer B to make a widget that does Job A in Manner B, they will still be slightly
different, but will do the same job. Cases in point:

1) Jeep Cherokee and Ford Explorer
2) F-16 Fighting Falcon and Mig-29 Fulcrum
3) La Cage Aux Folles (sp?) and The Birdcage

This is why it is most important to enforce property rights on it. This is why the word is COPY
- RIGHT, or right to copy, get it?

It is important because information is very easy to reproduce, while much more substantive
products are not so easy to reproduce. Especially with software, if there is no way an
individual or company can hope to get paid for its software, if the first person to buy a copy
goes out and gives away copies to everyone, then there will be no incentive to produce software
and the industry will die, or at least become severely retarded. The only way to make money in
software will be in technical support charges, so essentially income in software will be
equated with a tax on stupidity, which might not be a bad way to go, but I doubt that many
investors will be that big on such a high risk concept, especially as such a market is self
correcting....unless you purposely release bad software....

So you admit that it is a severe disincentive against invention, if an inventor is guarranteed
to have his invention stolen the minute it goes public. How many people will be able to devote
their lives unselfishly to producing software when they have no hope of being compensated for
the undertaking? Far Far fewer than those at present.

I work in the software industry, and it is easy to create fingerprints in data and in software.
The problem in the software industry is a refusal on the part of nations like china to enforce
the laws they already have, because the pirates are top officials in the Communist Party.

its more a matter of prosecuting those in the breach. An easy way for, say, Microsoft to
enforce its own copyright is to require that all resellers of Windows perform license checks on
software on customers computers when the coputers are sent in for maintenance. I don't see any
reason why Apple, Microsoft, and IBM don't get together and adopt that as an OS industry
standard practice.

One interesting thing I've found is that the pirate market overseas is turned a blind eye by
most software and music producers because its a neat way to get reduced prices from their CD
manufacturers (and consequently lowered tariff costs) by cutting a deal with the chinese CD
producer that allows him to produce X number of CDs on the side for his own resale on the
'pirate' market. THis way, the music or software company can continue to make huge profits in
markets where the CDs are sold at high retail rates, while minimizing their production and
shipping costs. Its really just a tax dodge....

How does someone else know exactly how someone else organize their property?? If they haven't
paid for the product (i.e. the information about the other person) then they cannot organize
their property the exact same way, can they?

Destroying the incentive to invent destroys the utility of every thinking mind. Destroying the
value of the thinking mind makes a human nothing but another animal that can be penned,

I don't need to. I have the present system as my proof. Since your system is the new one, you
need to do the quantification comparing the two. Rough percentages and uninformed guesstimates
do not cut it.

I wholeheartedly agree.  Now, suppose someone BUYS your manuscript
(static, rightfully owned) and uses this manuscript to make another
manuscript.  They have stolen nothing; they have rightfully purchased
everything that is static.  The only thing that changes is the
organization of THEIR ink and paper and energy, something which YOU don't

I sure do.  That means that I can buy a copy of your written manuscript
and do what I wish with it.  It's STATIC you see, and I can do anything I
want with my STATIC property.  It's MY copy of the idea: you sold it to
me.

Counter-examples:

1) Non-mechanical Pencils
2) Aspirin
3) AA batteries (despite what the manufacturers tell you)

Keep in mind that widgets are mythical products with certain properties
which make them easy to work with from an economists perspecive, and that
one of those properties is "perfect substitution."  In other words, one
firm's widget is just as good as another firm's widget: no better, no
worse.

I know perfectly well what it is, and think that it should not exist.

here?  I don't insult YOUR intelligence every chance I get.

On the contrary; all this means is that the price of copies will plummet,
and as a result more people will buy the product who wouldn't before. 
(This is the 40-50% of the copy market to which I have been referring.) 
The market [for copies!] will GROW, not shrink, because the law of demand
dictates that when prices fall, quantity demanded increases.  Meanwhile,
the number of new inventions will decrease; I argue that the copy market,
coupled with the cost of enforcement, will outweigh this loss.

It's not stolen.  He's selling copies.  People are doing whatever they
want with THEIR PRIVATELY OWNED COPIES.

And YES, I'm aware that incentive will decrease and that invention will
decrease.  However, we will ALSO see an explosion in the copy market, and
we will all save, as taxpayers, the cost of enforcing this law.  These two
effects will OUTWEIGH the decrease in invention...

> And I replied that I think that you are out of your hat to think so...

... and you have yet to provide an economic argument which counters that.
Indeed, you completely FAILED TO RESPOND to any of my previous points,
arguing that you wanted to see real numbers.  Well, as I'm sure you're
aware, these numbers don't and CAN'T exist, because this is a
MICROeconomic argument, not a macroeconomic argument; while I argue that
enforcing intellectual property will hurt GDP, I'm not saying that a
country with IP protection will have less GDP growth than another nation
that doesn't.  Indeed, the best I can say is that ONE nation with IP will
do better if it stops protecting IP; because the behavior off one market
cannot ever explain the behavior of the whole economy.

I'd like to prove this more vividly.  Let's take welfare for example.
Welfare sucks.  It hurts the poor more than it helps them, and drags down
our macroeconomy.  This can only be demonstrated through a MICROeconomic
argument: that it reduces efficiency thanks to distorted incentives which
lead to deadweight loss.  How much deadweight loss?  No one, not even the
best macroeconomist anywhere can tell you exactly how much.  It is NOT
simply the dollar value of government expenditures on welfare, adjusted
for inflation.  It's actually much much larger than that.  Can you
demonstrate this?  Can you show it using "real data?"  (hint:  any attempt
to do so must necessarily use theoretical data, in other words "uninformed
guesstimates," by your account.)

If not, then a liberal could say to you:  "I don't need to show that
welfare is more ecnomically efficent than laissez-faire capitalism; the
current state of our macroeconomy is my proof:  we're doing EXCELLENTLY.
Now, how to fix Social Security..."

Since we agree that welfare is bad, yet our economy is doing well, then it
is plausible, a priori, that IP may be bad, EVEN THOUGH our economy is
doing well.  And the ONLY way you can show this is with a MICROeconomic
argument, which you think you can gloss over.  Well, you can't.  I've
provided my microeconomic argument using sound market theories which WORK.
Care to provide your own?

> You have yet to quantify any of your claims, probably because you cannot quantify those
> claims.... come back when you get real data...

I have left myself a WIDE margin of error with 40%, using strong economic
principles which are completely valid in this example.  You'll never get
better data than that; nor could you provide such numbers if we DIDN'T
have IP and you were arguing for its creation.  One market cannot explain
the entire economy.

No, the problem is that even if we DID have those fingerprints, (which
many products already do!) we'd have to monitor people's computers in
order to actually FIND THEM.  Couple that with the fact that a reasonably
competent programmer can disable fingerprint protection with a crack, and
you've got a situation where in order to find the pirates, you'd have to
raid houses at random, violating our rights and wasting our time and
money.

Then it will be more profitable to have your computer upgraded by a black
market computer repairman.  You can't stop the market, even when you pass
laws to the contrary.

Again, this problem could be solved, REAL easy.

Now, from here on we have a real interesting phenomenon.  Here's where I
provide my argument from microeconomic efficiency, and explain the
difference between the microeconomy and the macroeconomy.  You just ignore
it.  Funny that.

Too true!  So I had best BUY a copy of your manuscript, and then, using my
property, organize my property just like the copies that belong to you. 
You own the manuscripts and all of the words written on them; but if you
sell a copy to me, then I own a copy, with all the words written on it.  I
can do with my property whatever I please, including organizing my
property just like your property.

> 
> Duh, in sum is society.

I think we're using different words to say the same thing.  Society
doesn't have the right to own property.  Individuals do.  The sum of the
wealth owned by individuals is not the property owned by society, but the
simple sum of the property owned by those individuals.  I think we're
agreed on that.

In light of that, your statement above is not correct: otherwise we are
forced to say that the sum of the property owned by individuals IS proprty
owned by society.  However, we both agreed that society HAS no rights,
especially not the right to own property, only the individuals have these
rights.  Therefore, the sum of the property owned by individuals is NOT
the property owned by society.

Similarly, I assert that we should maximize the sum of the utility for
each individual; NOT the utility of the society, which is not a brain and
therefore has no utility.  If I were arguing that society DID have
utility, THAT would be collectivist.  THAT would be Borg-like.
Fortunately for the both of us, I'm not saying that at all.

Slaughtered at will, eh?  This is either some weird hyperbole, some
obscure attempt at a reductio ad absurdum proof, or a gross
misunderstanding of my argument.  Obviously, I do NOT think that
individuals ought to be slaughtered at will.  Nor do I think it's OK to
take away static property.  I don't believe IP exists, or to put it
another way:  I don't think that we should enforce the concept of IP,
because it does not maximize the sum of the utility of the individuals in
society.

If you would REPLY to my argument, rather than gloss over it, then I could
show you that my argument is NOT uninformed, but rather leaves a wide
margin for error.  If you had only read what I had said about
microeconomic vs. macroeconomic arguments, you would understand that the
current state of the economy is NOT evidence that IP is working, any more
than it proves that welfare and social security are working (and they sure
as heck aren't).

So you DO need to provide your own argument; your macroeconomic argument
simply does not cut it.

I would rather think of Objectivism as a philosophy originated by but not
forever tied to Ayn Rand.  Rand is wrong about many things, including
where her philosophy would lead.  Thus, her tendency to paint with a
very broad brush -- with libertarians, for exampel -- can and must be
rejected.  In fact, a major camp in the Objectivist movement -- the IOS
camp -- rejects Rand's take on libertarians in particular.  See David
Kelley's _Truth and Toleration_.

I'm not saying that all of hermeneutics is great and fine.  It's just that
some of its methodology is worth looking into.  Some of it can definitely
be removed from the wider corpus, just as not everyone who uses a
syllogism agrees with Aristotle's whole philosophy.  (Bertrand Russell,
for instance, used syllogisms, yet he disagreed with Aristotle's meta-
physics.)

>Anyway, I don't assert that poststructuralists are lying to try to get

A point with which I can agree upon.  There is also a lot of sloppy
thinking going on out there and a lot of postmodern philosophy is
just that.

Sciabarra's take would be, I believe, that the above is a false alternative,
a dualism of social atomism and of social organicism.  The first view sees
individuals as totally separate from and with little need for society, while
the latter sees individuals as totally constituted and in need of society.
Individualism transcends this dualism by defining the proper relation
between individuals, which allows them to benefit from living in society
without being smothered by it (as in collectivism) or destroying it (as in
social atomism).

(For another take on this, see Marsha Familiaro Enright's "Why Man
Needs Approval" in _Objectivity_ 1(2) [1991].  This article covers the
psychological needs for a social life in humans.  This goes beyond
economic arguments.  Details on _Objectivity_ can be found at:
http://www.bomis.com/objectivity/ )

Robert White, in his "Racism:  A Radical Critique," applies Sciabarra's
take on this to the problem of racism in New Zealand.  He shows how
racism as a form of collectivism emphasizes social contradictions -- 
antagonisms inherent in the structure of society.  He also calls for the
adoption of individualism to overcome these antagonisms.  This paper
was printed in _The Free Radical_ and can be found at:

        http://freeradical.co.nz/

I don't know if I buy all of this, but it does seem to show that dialectics
do not necessarily lead to left-wing (a la Marx) or right-wing (a la
Hegel) politics.  If Sciabarra (see also his _Marx, Hayek, and Utopia_)
and White are correct, then various strains of libertarianism are no less
dialectical than Marxism et al.

Rand's view of history is the topic of the last third of Sciabarra's _Ayn
Rand: The Russian Radical_.  Also, see her _For the New Intellectual_.
Her theory wasn't so simple as you portray it.  She believed that
philosophy determined culture which in term determined politics.  She
did not think this determination was total, however, she did feel that
lone individuals could only do so much.  Hence her efforts to spark
philosophical change.  Even so, she did not think this would happen
quickly.

Her novel, _We the Living_, is in a way a testament to the individual's
need for a free society to flourish and even survive.

As far as how her view was dialectical, though a society's overall
philosophy determines the type of society on lives in, each person
can, to a degree, choose her or his philosophy and shape the
wider culture.  This back-and-forth influence is dialectical, is it not?

But the question here should be: Do dialectics imply historical
determinism of any sort?  I do not think they do.  Dialactics are a
method of ascertaining the truth.  It just so happens that Marx
was a determinist.  This no more means that dialectics must be
determinist than the fact that Einstein believed in God implies
General Relativity Theory must be theistic.

I suppose one could solve the vagueness of blue by assigning it a strict 
definition.  Blue is light with a wavelength of 550 nm. Given such a 
definition, the truth value of the statement 'le ciel est bleu' must be 
no, as the value will be something other than precisely 550 nm, and will 
fluctuate across the horizon and from second to second as light is 
marginally refracted by water vapor and other chemicals inthe 
atmosphere.  The only way to get a true Trotskian statement on sky color 
is to limit sky to a particular point in the sky to a particular point 
in time and find the precise wavelength.  In practice this will not be 
very useful, because nobody says things like, 'le ciel est bleu at a 
point 67 degrees and 35 minutes above and 23 degrees and 12 minutes to 
the left of my reference point at exactly 3:57 PM.', even in a 
metalanguage.
   I like Bart Kosko's notion that Trotskian statements should be 
assigned a fuzzy truth value.  An absolutely true statement is not 
likely to be found outside of tautology (formal logic), so it is 
sensible to assign 'le ciel est bleu' a .99 truth value on a clear day 
at noon, and a .4 value in general, signifying that the sky is blue some 
of the time (The sky is black would probably have a slightly higher 
truth value, as the sky is black at night even if it is overcast, 
although you might wish to factor in the presence of stars.)  This 
method also allows you to provide adjustments based on situation and 
location, so you could assign that statement a .25 value within the 
cloudy confines of Seattle.  Some people dislike the lack of absolute 
precision, but I think it preferable to the neurotic potential of the 
endless search for "true" statements.  Using this method, every 
statement is true, although many are only true to a 0 degree.

On the contrary:  rather, nobody uses metalanguages in day to day
conversation.  (Lojban advocates, this is where you can pipe up if you
feel like it. :) )  If we did, however, you're right, this is the sort of
thing we'd say.

>    I like Bart Kosko's notion that Trotskian statements should be 
> assigned a fuzzy truth value.

NO, and this is where me must take care.  First, I presume you mean
TARSKIAN statements.  ;)  Second, we may say that our INFORMATION is
imprecise, but the TRUTH is not.  When properly defined, the sky is or is
not blue; we may be only 99% certain of its blueness on a clear day at
noon, but that is VERY different from saying that the sky is 99% blue
(again, restricted by our formal metalanguage).

We already quite often say in science that the wavelength of certain light
is 550 +/- 10 nm.  This is not to say that the wavelength varies, but
that our information is imprecise.  So, to the extent that it is
necessary, when we need to make clear how certain we are of something, we
will add the precision to which we think we know it. 

We don't need "fuzzy truth" statements: the truth is binary, and we
already have a means of communicating precision.

One thing which I have found helps is the making of lists of reasons one
is engaged in some large task. When your determination begins to falter,
reading the list reminds you why you got into the task in the first place.
I find this helps a lot.

It's been a decade since reading Contact, and I didn't recall anything

Well, most gods have lots to say, but little real information in their

Some theories of complexity define the amount of information in a string to
be defined as the length of the shortest possible algorithm which can generate
that string. By this definition, the string which represents Pi (which is
infinite)
can be generated by a Pi computation algorithm, which is on the order of a few
thousand bytes. So, Pi has little information and little complexity.

   IAN: The point is that a given
   statement X is true to the degree
   it accurately maps reality. "Blue"
   may be said to be a broad range 
   of colors that are "bluish."

   The truth is primarily physical 
   things, secondarily the degree of 
   accuracy that words relate to things.
   Indeed, fuzzy logic helps to define such.

I don't want to appear to be an all out defender of hermeneutics, but
here goes...

I agree authorial intent should be part of literary criticism, though it should
not be the do all be all of it.  The influence a text (or anything for that
matter) often goes well beyond what the author intended.  A writer's goal
is not always clear -- hence the debates on the meaning of Homer's epics
that go on to this day.  There is also open deception.  Thirdly, unintended
consequences creep in, as they creep into every intended thing, e.g.,
welfare policies.  Should we not apply the same idea to literature?  Surely,
the writers of the Bible did not intend for Ayn Rand to use their symbolism
in her novels -- as the late Ronald Merrill proclaimed in his _The Ideas of
Ayn Rand_?

I agree, though some of the methods of hermeneutics are transplantable
and useful outside the above quoted context.  The problem of
interpretation, if consistently applied, also makes non-capitalist systems
unviable.  How can the people vote for central planners in democratic
socialism IF each individual is so mired in her context that she can't
communicate with others?  How can Marxists or Fascists interpret the
forces of history -- be they embodied by the proletariat or the nation --
correctly, IF no objective rendering is possible?  This extreme position
-- that any interpretation is equal and inconmensurable with any other
interpretation -- is obviously false, but it does not help anyone to support
any political or social system.

The only reason, I believe, many academics support anticapitalist systems
is just that they traditionally have done so.  Despite all these radical
philosophies, the university has always been a very conservative place.

Cheers!

Subject: LIBERTYLOOP: New Libz site

Well!  Here it is, only a month or two past the originally proposed launch,
and I'm pleased to announce that the new website is now operational at

http://www.libertarianz.org.nz

The key word being "operational", as opposed to "finished".  The only way it
got there was for me to finally heed my own advice that a website is never
"finished" -- it can always be improved -- but as the encyclopediast said, "If
I were to await perfection, my work would never be published."

So we have a lean machine on which to add some muscle and a few of the bells
and whistles so beloved of Generation X.

Now before you tell me what's missing, let me say what's coming next, more or
less in order of priority:  First, I have heaps more links, some of them quite
amusing and provacative but there were so many of the damn things by the time
I finished checking that they worked, there wasn't time now to put them in an
accessible or logical order.  Next, Ian Fraser has kindly agreed to provide a
proper history for that page (to replace the picture), as soon as he's put
this issue of the Liberty newsletter "to bed". After that, I want to put some
of Lindsay and Bernard's past efforts for Craccum and Critic in the archives
and add the PDF facility for our brochures so people out in the regions with a
laser printer can download decent copies for redistribution. Finally, in the
bells and whistles section, I'll be looking at adding some sound files and
perhaps some Bumper Stickers you can print out and use.  It should keep me out
of trouble for a while...

I would especially like feedback from those on you on PCs using Internet
Explorer. We're all on Macs here and although its been run through Netscape,
Mosaic and IE for Mac, the only way we could test the PC version was by asking
the Mac to emulate one (which they really hate doing at the best of times.)

Title
  Potassium's cardiovascular protective mechanisms. [Review]
  [88 refs]
Source
  American Journal of Physiology.  268(4 Pt 2):R825-37, 1995 Apr.
Abstract
  High rates of potassium intake are associated with
  protection from cardiovascular diseases in populations consuming primitive
  diets and in vegetarians living in industrialized cultures. In studies in
  humans and in animals, a strong inverse association between
  potassium intake and hypertension and stroke has been
  described. However, acceptance of the putative protective effect has been
  limited by inadequate understanding of 1) long-term
  potassium regulation, and 2) mechanisms by which small
  changes in plasma potassium concentration may affect
  development of cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we present results
  from analyses of long-term potassium regulation that
  indicated 1) changes in potassium intake may result in
  potassium concentrations from 3.1 to 4.6 mmol/l, and 2) when
  the initial rate is below normal, potassium concentration is
  very sensitive to changes in potassium intake rate. In
  addition, we present results that provide bases for possible mechanisms by
  which potassium may protect against cardiovascular diseases:
  1) increases in potassium inhibit free radical formation
  from vascular endothelial cells and macrophages; 2) elevation of
  potassium inhibits proliferation of vascular smooth muscle
  cells; 3) platelet aggregation and arterial thrombosis are inhibited by
  elevation of potassium; and 4) renal vascular resistance is
  reduced and glomerular filtration rate is increased by elevation of plasma
  potassium. We propose that elevation of dietary
  potassium intake increases plasma potassium
  concentration, thereby inhibiting free radical formation, smooth muscle
  proliferation, and thrombus formation. As a result, the rate of
  atherosclerotic lesion formation and thrombosis will be diminished. In
  addition, we propose the increase in glomerular filtration rate will cause a
  shift in the relationship between arterial pressure and sodium excretion that
  will lead to a reduction in arterial blood pressure. By these actions, high
  levels of dietary intake of potassium could provide the
  observed protection against the cardiovascular diseases that have plagued
  humankind since we began eating a modern high-sodium,
  low-potassium diet. [References: 88]

My gut tells me that you are right, but your humor is premised on the sense of
my uncertainty.  Perhaps I have missed some important new development, but the
DEFINITE correlation of speed with ultimate capability via genetic algorithms
seems to have the distinct flavor of hand-waving to me (to mix metaphors).  

A critique of this idea occurs to me after only part of one cup of coffee this
morning.  I can imagine that employment of genetic algorithms alone might
entail an accretion of inefficiency through multiple generations of
algorithmic evolution that eventually either offsets gains in hardware speed
or even effectively nullifies it.  

More probable seems a subtler loss of the ability to control the specific
direction algorithmic evolution takes as it progresses in complexity.  Perhaps
there is a dynamic tension between control and evolution that could offset
much of the speed-derived gains, such that the necessity to intervene in the
process to check-and-direct with human (even augmented human) intervention in
the algorithmic evolutionary process imposes a relatively low upper limit on
at least the first stages of "SI fetal development".

Rather enjoying the atypical role of progress-skeptic, I remain,

Ideology and philosophy is not just a bunch of positions (well, maybe some
forms are:).  Instead, people have certain core beliefs and methods and
these together lead to the positions like "collectivizing... the means of
production," laws against using drugs, freedom of expression, etc.  Even
with this, lots of people support a particular ideology for reason other than
its core methods and assumptions.

The reason Marxism caught on so well in Russia was not that the proverbial
man in the street agreed with dialectical materialism, but merely because it fit
better into his worldview than did the known alternatives at the time.  Marxism
seemed to promise a better society to him.  He did not look at all the
alternatives -- there were no libertarians in Russia at the time, at least, none
with any large audience -- just the ones he'd heard about and felt were viable.
The two main ones during the Civil War were Marxism and loyalism.  The
former merely fit better than its rival into most people's belief system -- or
those who disagreed with it weren't able to come up with a popular enough
alternative to keep people at the barricades.  (Often ideologies win by
default.)

I'm not sure what Marx meant after all these years.  However, I think he
believed that communism would overcome the contradictions of
capitalism.  (Hegel was more of a welfare statist for the reasons you
give.)  I believe he thought capitalism created contradictions while
communism would not.  However, he was not very clear about what
communism would be like.

I agree that vastly increased information flows will facilitate improved
control of environmental through-put management (to coin a bureaucratic-
sounding term).  However, I remain somewhat skeptical of proposals that
complete recycling of industrial waste can be economical with near-term energy
and manufacturing techniques, simply because of energy inefficiencies.  

I think many current "green" proposals for industrial waste recycling are
fundamentally wrong-headed because the energy input necessary to recycle
ultimately CAUSES more pollution: The energy necessary to accomplish them
increases the hydrocarbon load on the environment.  Thus, simply burying the
waste in question is ultimately better for the environment because it is the
lesser of the two evils.

Improved information systems WILL allow a more informed choice on these
questions, though, since the energy load for any particular process ought to
be a matter of "micro-accounting" that will allow the actors involved to
calculate the economic and ecological costs and benefits of any proposed
waste-recycling transaction or chain of transactions.

They all seem to be advertising that they will achieve the much-vaunted

Yes, although I think we'll see a significant upward increase in developmental
trends and much synergy between specific projects at the $1,000/pound level
(what is that, $2,200/kg?).  In particular, I think it very possible that the
LEO satellite fleets will create a market for fairly sophisticated telerobotic
servicing devices within ten years of Teledesic's deployment, i.e. at around
2010-2015.

I think we will see very significant developments before the $100/kg and full-
blown assembler point, simply because micro-machine technology really does
provide real payoffs at the $1,000/pound level.  The generation of sensors and
effectuators going into the pipeline now yield real improvements at this
level: Check out the size and capability of the very tiny video cameras aboard
the "New Millenium" series of probes and compare their functionality at 10% of
the weight of the previous generation.

I think not: The relatively long light-speed latency inherent in GEO

Yes, but I think not until after the period we've been discussing.  The first-
stage telerobotic infrastructure I envision developing in the 2010-2015 period
won't be capable of handling the entire chain of resource extraction and
manufacturing from asteroid to finished product.

IMHO, it will take full-blown Drextech to make asteroid mining profitable and
this industry will develop within 25 to 50 years after that point.

I believe lower costs come about if the government gets out of the space
business.  NASA, etc. tend to make costs skyrocket (no pun intended)
because they have no incentive to lower costs and also since their
operations are labor intensive.

For near term exploitation, we really don't need a whole lot of new hardware.
This can keep development costs low.  What we do need is to create a
free market in space services in the place of the current government-
business combinations (e.g., NASA-Boeing, NASA-Rocketdyne) that
dominate the space industry.

This will involve a change in the mindset of most from viewing space as
the preserve of big government/big business alone.

Without focusing solely on the technical issues, what about ways to bring
about policy changes so that the above occurs as quickly as possible?
After all, moving to space is one way to avoid any sort of the nanotech
disaster scenarios some have proposed.

Cheers!

Is I understand it, one of the hard parts of GA is a rigorous specification of
the goal toward which you are optimizing. As it happens, speed and space efficiency
are just about the easiest goals to specify, and the early GA success stories
frequently mention speed and space optimization.

I agree that goal-setting is the big problem, but I'm more optimistic about
increasing the goal-setting efficiency. In my favorite model, the SI is a
collaboration, and the human is doing the goal-setting. The effectiveness of
this process is dramatically and continuously enhanced by improvements in
the data presentation and visualization algorithms that let the human
understand the problem to be solved.

They are not contrary at all, if you agree with me that libertarianism is
more conducive to net utility than any other political scheme (except
possibly anarcho-capitalism, but I believe anarcho-capitalism will arrive
at a libertarian system of laws).

True!  A capitalist economy can withstand people acting completely in
their self interests with no thought for other people's utility.  How? 
Well, in order to get what you want in a capitalist economy, you have to
help people in some meangingful way.  If somebody feels that something you
could do for them would increase their utility, then they will pay you for
it, maximizing the utility of both parties, despite the fact that this was
neither person's intent.

As an economic principle, voluntary transactions necessarily lead to an
increase in utility for both parties; otherwise, the parties would not
participate in the exchange.  This ultimately leads us to agree with
Smith's assertion of the "invisible hand:" that rational self-interested
agents acting in a free market economy maximize the utility of all those
within the economy, despite the fact that nobody was trying to do so.

For this reason, I endorse capitalism.  I endorse libertarianism because
it allows capitalism to work the most smoothly.  I endorse anarcho-
capitalism because I believe that it will work better still.

It would be clearer if you simply replaced "Force, Theft, and Fraud" with
the broader category of "coercion."  From this perspective, people acting
in a "me first" way, who at the same time fail to coerce one another, will
maximize utility.

Now, keep in mind that the acting participants in this economy are NOT
utilitarian, or at least, don't have to be.  Simply by virtue of the fact
that they act according to egoism and yet are constrained from coercion,
the optimal utilitarian consequence results.  However, this is NOT true
from the perspective of the egoist: if I were an egoist, (that is, if I
considered an action morally right if and only if it maximized my own
utility; this is different from Rand's definition in a meanginful way) I
would REJECT libertarianism, and instead struggle to become king: to
steal, cheat, and defraud others in any way necessary to get what I want. 
Though this would make others worse off, it would make me much much better
off, and THIS would be the optimal egoist consequence. 

Rand makes an argument which I don't find convincing: that having honesty,
integrity, etc. is actually in one's own self-interest, because in order
to be rationally consistent, one must not prevent others from acting
morally, that is, one must not prevent others from seeking their own self
interest.  I disagree wholeheartedly: An effective king will be much
better off than an honest capitalist, despite the fact that others will be
made much worse off under the king than they would under capitalism; if
this prevents others from "acting morally," SO BE IT, because our moral
code doesn't say anything about OTHERS, only about maxmizing our OWN
utility.  If preventing others from acting morally would maximize one's
own utility, then egoism DEMANDS that you prevent others from acting
morally.

Take this thought experiment: You have the opportunity to steal something
you want; you know that you will not be caught.  Your utility will
increase if you steal it, while the owner's utility will decrease more
than yours increases.  An egoist, acting to maximize agent utility, will
steal; a utilitarian, acting to maximize net utility, will not steal.

And while we're at it, egoism WOULD endorse the slaughtering of others, if
you liked that sort of thing and could get away with it.  Utilitarianism,
however, obviously does not endorse slaughter, because it would not
maxmize net utility.

Nitpick: Anarcho-capitalism is a form of libertarianism.  What you are
talking about is probably what is called minarchy -- another form of
libertarianism in which the government is still a monopoly but only
one restricted to enforcing individual rights a la Locke, Nozick, and
Rand.

How are you guys defining net utility?  If the fascist values war in
itself, if the communitarian values community in itself, the pacificist
values peace, the antisocial person values being alone, and the
Islamic fundamentalist values enforcing Allah's will in itself, how
does one put all their utilities together to come up with an overall
utility which can be maxed out?

Cheers!

No, however, when they purchase a copy of my product, they are agreeing to not copy that product
beyond what I allow them. I don't have to sell my product to anyone who does not agree to those
conditions, and anyone who does is in breach of contract and can be sued. In order to buy my product
you must agree that it belongs to me and that you are only purchasing a right to use it, a lease, per
se, rather than purchasing all rights to the product.  I am quite comfortable with this distinction,
and it has nothing to do with IP as a concept of 'natural law'. IP as a concept of contract law is
quite sufficient. I think that where we are talking past each other is that you look at IP as a
consequence of natural law, and I look at it as a consequence of contract law.

Sorry, I just don't understand how someone who claims to be intelligent could come to such a nutty
conclusion. I hear your arguments all too often from many people, and they invariably turn out to be
cheapskates who want to get something for nothing. As you can tell by my sigline, I don't have much
respect for such people, and if I have transferred that disrespect toward you by association when it
may be unwarranted, accept my apologies. However if it does turn out to be warranted, please don't
take it personally....I'm an equal opportunity hater.

If there is no incentive to produce new technology, then economic growth will come to a screeching
halt. If everyone can copy whenever they want, then the product will no longer be bought, but
shared.  it would be interesting to see the welfare lines in Silicon Valley after that happens.....

However, when prices fall beyond a certain point, it is no longer profitable for a producer to
produce a product and will go out of business. When a product can be freely copied, there is no
longer a market for the product.

You still dont' seem to understand it. I do not sell you total rights to ownership of my product, you
own the right to use the copy I produce for you.

This is the central, incredibly outrageous hogwash of your entire argument. An economy cannot grow
without advancing technology. With an increasing population and without rechnological advances to
increase resource utilization efficiency, economic stagnation will quickly result, bringing us back
to the dark ages.

Of course a nation that stops protecting IP will perform better, because it will be reducing its cash
outflow to pay for intellectual property rights held in other nations. Thus, it is externalizing its
costs to increase its net domestic product. It does not expand its gross domestic product except by
the capital savings that result. In this case, your argument will only work if ONE or SOME nations
fail to protect IP, as they then are externalizing their IP costs onto the economies of those that do
respect IP. When ALL nations fail to respect IP, then technological development will halt and
economic depression will result.

Yes. We can compare nations that respect IP and those that don't. Excepting the IP which those
nations steal from other IP protecting nations, we can measure the economic growth which results from
domestically developed IP. China is an excellent example. During its cultural Revolution, there were
virtually no inventions developed in China, there was also zero economic growth. Once they opened
their economy, they started stealing IP from western nations. We can extimate as a result that most
of China's economic growth in the past 30 years is not due to domestic IP that is not protected, but
by foreign IP which is stolen and are therefore externalized costs that boost the Chinese economy.

If people merely acted in compliance with the contracts they sign, then there would be no IP
enforcement costs. This goes back to my previous statements about subjectivity eroding respect for
contract law. You are proposing that people who produce intellectual property should not be able to
protect their interests with contracts, or that people should not be bound by such contracts. Once
again you have exposed your subjectivist, post modern underbelly.

If the curve is not a line, but truly curved, then it will not be 0.5Q, but some other number. It may
be higher, it may be lower. In a commodity market, the curve makes this number very high, while in a
monopoly market, the curve can be rather low. You are only using a standard 1 for 1 slope on the
curve, which is inaccurate, disingenuous, and false.

A patent is worth more if it is as broad as possible. The most broad patents are concept patents,
while the most narrow are design patents. Even in design patents, an engineer will try to include as
many designs as possible, to shut out competition from routing around his property very easily. Even
then it is usually only a matter of time before someone does. The main advantage that a patent gives
an inventor or the company he licenses is product to is time enough to establish market presence and
fine tune production systems. Once you have established brand name presence in a market and have
refined your production system, usually, there is competition on the market using alternative
technology.

The purpose of the patent is to give the inventor (individual or corporation) the time to recoup the
capital costs of research and development, as well as the capital costs to establish a production
capacity. Failure to allow an inventor to recoup these costs is externalizing the costs from the
consumer to the inventor and producer and therefore stagnating technological development.

In an expanding population, with stagnant economic growth and zero technological development, the
resource base shrinks steadily (since technology is no longer increasing resource utilization
efficiency or reducing resource acquisition costs).

If the inventor has invented and has only licensed use of his product to others, and those others
violate the terms of that license contract, then they are stealing. He has asquiesced to nothing.

If I sell you the right to use my copy. You can use my copy to organize your own property any way you
want, however you cannot sell copies of the copy I sold you to anyone else.  If you sell the copy I
sold you to someone else, and delete all copies of that copy that may reside anywhere in your own
property, then it is not theft....since if you sell the copy to someone else, you are selling them
your right to use that copy.

You cannot say that this sort of arrangement is not used in any other market, as real estate deed
covenants are widely used.

I dunno, the state owns plenty of property. As a sovereign government, in theory it holds original
right to all real property in its domain. People only own real property (i.e. real estate) as granted
by the sovereign in granted deeds. The sovereign holds right to reclaim those deeds under emminent
domain, provided the deed holder is refunded the original license fee, plus interest and compensation
for any improvements to the property.

In a theoretical libertarian society, where every man is sovereign, and is vassal to no state,
emminent domain would not exist per se, however IP will still exist in contract law. If you wish to
benefit from my product, you must agree to not reproduce my product. If you break that contract, you
are in breach and can be prosecuted in civil court by my PPL. Others who benefit from your breach can
also be sued, ad nauseum. It may take some precendent cases in a libertarian society, but IP will
probably be better respected in such a society then it even is currently here.

Yes, however you forget the origination of those properties. In the example of real estate, the
sovereign holds all original rights to all real estate in his or her or its domain. all other land
holders posess their land by granted deed.

In an information economy, I invented widget A, or software B. I hold original sovereign rights to
that widget or that software. I will only grant others the right to use copies of that widget or
software if they agree to the terms in my granted deed to use that property. If they do not, I hold
the right, by deeded contract, to prosecute their breach as I see fit. I could simply sue them in
civil court, have it 'corrected' by a contract 'fixer', or simply go and nuke the bastids.

That society may hold property as a sovereign government,  if individuals in that soceity are not
sovereign individuals, with some or all rights delegated to the state, then the state can own
property in trust for the benefit of all society.  THis is how things are presently. In a libertarian
society, individuals would only delegate those rights which they choose to delegate on an individual
basis.

Yes you are. You are measuring the utility of IP protection as a sum set, i.e. for all soceity. You
are not measuring it on an individual basis.

I agree with the CONCEPT of your economci argument. I think that your numbers are completely wrong.
Failure to protect IP will lead to the downfall of technological society.

  We live in exciting times. IMHO, I think there is a possibility that
death from cancer may become a thing of the past during the next couple
of decades, with either endostatin/angiostatin or some other therapy.
  I also suspect that combination therapies including potassium may be
effective in preventing, if not curing cardiovascular disease. The results
with potassium treatment of stroke-prone rodents are hard to believe.
Super high blood pressures, and little or no organ damage or mortality.
(Journal of Hypertension 2(Sup 3): 363-366 1984) EG: SHRSP rats mortality
reduced from 83% to 2%, and Dahl S rats from 55% to 4% with additional
potassium.
  I think many of us would-be life-extenders may have ignored the fact
that curing or preventing various diseases is a much easier task than
eliminating aging itself and that it is the former that is an absolute
prerequisite to a significantly increased life span. Even if aging is
completely prevented, little increase in human life spans may result if
plaque build-up in arteries is not also slowed.
  Indeed I suspect this may be the general reason why aminoguanidine seems
to be ineffective in increasing life span in rodents, despite from all
appearances being successful in slowing down the aging process. These
animals die primarily from cancer, and even a successful anti-aging
intervention is not going to increase their life span, if it does not
reduce tumor growth. Ironically aminoguanidine is effective in preventing
cardiovascular and renal pathology, so it might be effective in extending
human life spans, even it does not benefit cancer prone rodents. (Proc.
Natl. Acad. Sci. 93: 3902-3907 1996)
   I suspect the good results from caloric restriction in rodents may
not be primarily due to any putative anti-aging effect, but instead is due
directly to an anti-tumor effect. There is experimental data to support
this. (Mechanisms of Ageing and Development 92: 67-82 1996)
   To sum-up eliminating the primary diseases responsible for mortality is
a necessary precursor to significantly extended life spans.

Title
  Magnitude and causes of socioeconomic differentials in
  mortality: further evidence from the Whitehall Study.
Source
  Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health.  44(4):265-70, 1990 Dec.
Abstract
  STUDY OBJECTIVE--The aim was to explore the magnitude and causes of the
  differences in mortality rates according to socioeconomic
  position in a cohort of civil servants. DESIGN--This was a prospective
  observational study of civil servants followed up for 10 years after baseline
  data collection. SETTING--Civil service offices in London.
  PARTICIPANTS--11,678 male civil servants were studied, aged 40-64 at baseline
  screening between 1967 and 1969. Two indices of socioeconomic position were
  available on these participants--employment grade (categorised into four
  levels), and ownership of a car. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Main outcome
  measures were all cause and cause specific mortality, with
  cause of death taken from death certificates coded according to the eighth
  revision of the ICD. Employment grade and car ownership were independently
  related to total mortality and to mortality
  from the major cause groups. Combining the indices further improved
  definition of mortality risk and the age adjusted relative
  rate between the highest grade car owners and the lowest grade non-owners of
  4.3 is considerably larger than the social class differentials seen in the
  British population. Factors potentially involved in the production of these
  mortality differentials were examined. Smoking, plasma
  cholesterol concentration, blood pressure, and glucose intolerance did not
  appear to account for them. The pattern of differentials was the same in the
  group who reported no ill health at baseline as it was in the whole sample,
  which suggests that health selection associated with frank illness was not a
  major determinant. The contribution of height, a marker for
  environmental factors acting in early life, was also investigated. Whereas
  adjustment for employment grade and car ownership attenuated the association
  between short stature and mortality, height
  differences within employment grade and car ownership groups explained little
  of the differential mortality. CONCLUSION--The use of social
  class as an index of socioeconomic position leads to underestimation of the
  association between social factors and mortality, which may
  be reflected in public health initiatives and priorities. Known risk factors
  could not be shown to account for the differentials in
  mortality, although the degree to which this can be explored
  with single measurements is limited.

Subject: Bulworth

Bulworth and the Socialist Critique of Capitalism

I thoroughly enjoyed *Bulworth*.  Warren Beatty portrays a California
Senator who breaks down and becomes honest again.  Beatty's Bulworth is a
refreshing alternative to our real politicians who talk to and from nothing
but big money.  (One woman asks Bulworth, paraphrased, "Why haven't we
received the Federal Aid you promised us?"  He responds, "Well, you haven't
really contributed to my campaign, have you?")  Bulworth realizes he's been
a sell-out, and then  he fights to make a change.

Beatty is on the rampage here.  He is subverting the entire
Democrat-Republican cooperative, and challenging us to stop prostituting
principles.  This, I love.  (Oh, and the plot and characters are developed
fully and interestingly.)

What I love rather less are the particular principles for which Beatty
fights.  He explicitly calls for "socialized medicine" (at least he has the
balls "to call a spade a spade"), private subsidization of insurance for
the poor, and a myriad of other socialist programs.  What I don't get is
that, while Beatty recognizes that "politicians have f**ked up public
education," he expects them to expand public education, government
medicine, and government on all levels.

As Murray Rothbard and others have long-recognized, the radical left and
radical right share a number of similarities.  We both call for radical
cultural changes, we both believe that the current system is corrupt in its
power, we both denounce Democrats and Republicans.  Where we differ is in
our interpretation of corruption.  We libertarians think that the
government is responsible for the current problems in medicine, education,
and so forth.  Socialists such as Beatty think that big business is the
source of corrupt power.  Hence, our political agendas are the precise
opposite.  Libertarians call for the radical cutback of government so that
the private sector can fulfill human needs; socialists call for the radical
increase of government so that the government can fulfill human needs.  We
agree only that the current nexus of government and big business is evil;
libertarians think that government is the fundamental corruptive force
while socialists think that big business is.  Perhaps this is the root of
Mises' theory that one system will ultimately drive out the other.

Largely our disagreements are an empirical matter which can be resolved by
open-minded discussion and research.  (*Can* be, not *will* be.)  I think
that Beatty errs on two counts - first, that big business is inherently
corruptive and that the free sector is incapable of providing just, honest
business, and second, that the private sector is incapable of providing
charity, quality health care, and so forth.

See Bulworth for two reasons.  In the abstract, Bulworth represents a
dedication to Principle.  We can be inspired by Beatty's devotion even as
we are repelled by the particular content of his principles.  The second
reason to see Bulworth is to get a better idea of where the socialists in
America are coming from - what they believe and what they advocate.  I
actually agree with a lot of what Bulworth says.  Bulworth and Pat Buchanan
share some notable beliefs that I dismiss.  If the libertarians are
supposed to contain "the party of principle," I'd say that Beatty and
others are trying to restore that title to the Democratic Party.  The
Republicans obviously are ideologically bankrupt; if the Democrats find
their moral voice, then we are in for some major shifts in favor of
government power.  That is unless, of course, we are able to manifest a
fervor and eloquence in support of *our* principles to match that of Beatty
and the other Democrats-of-Spine.

    IAN: If we say there is "no possible way to construe 
    utilitarianism as a 'me first' principle," we say
    the sets of "me first" (M) and utilitarianism (U) 
    are disjoint, such that the intersection (^) of 
    M and U is the null set(/), ergo: M ^ U = (/).

    If a libertarian society (L) is a society defined 
    by the free market where individuals act according 
    to their own measure of what is in their best in-
    terest, there is an intersection of L and M.

    Therefore, if L = U (as we agree), then there
    IS an intersection of U and M, such that the 
    cited claim that M ^ U = (/) would be untrue.


    I think that M and L intersect, but not by 100%,
    which is to say, as you've articulated, that not
    all things that can be defined as "me first" can
    be defined as libertarian. I think that L is either
    equal to U or all of L is in U, such that no L is
    external to U (which I think we agree). I believe 
    that L may be defined: "me-first + nonaggression."

    No question this may be open to improvement, and 
    does not constitute any deeply imbedded analysis.

Bout 20 years ago I was subscribed to a newsletter re the topic
of sex gadgets. There was a report of a visit to a Japanese
sex gadgets fair, where there were two interesting devices. Both
were small egg shaped things to place in the rectum, and
operated using radio waves. One of them gave endless small orgasms.
The other one was for the man, and created huge (hit the light bulb
on the ceiling) ejaculations. The author of the article reported
overdoing the #2 device, and was rather sore the next day. I have
never heard of these since. Is anyone on the list tuned into the

Now that we have Viagra, when do we get Niagra??

After all the ballyhoo regarding TWA Flight 800, especially
by Ian Goddard, I note with some irony that the FAA has been
inspecting jets with similar construction (ie, power and signal
cables in the center fuel tank) and GUESS WHAT! A number of
inspected planes have faulty wiring, some with arc burns which
holed the conduit in the fuel tank, many with chafed wiring
exposing the conductor, etc.

Repair of these planes of course increases flight saftey.
Regardless of whether there was some other cause for the Flight
800 tragedy, the due process of the FAA has revealed and is
correcting a real problem.

We may dislike the system, but sometimes it works, you know.

This is not a sustainable argument because the more information we had 
the weaker this definition of blue would become.  For the moment I am 
going to shift the basis of the thought experiment away from the color 
of the sky because that is too complex and diffuse; containing all 
wavelengths of light to some degree.  Let us presume that a man on the 
moon is shining a laser down on our instrumentation, and we are trying 
to determine on whether it is a Tarskian truth that 'le laser est bleu'  
Presume that with advanced femtotechnology we have built the most 
precise wavelength measuring instrument possible, one that can measure 
the wavelength between individual photons being emitted by the laser 
down to picometer scale or better.  If the laser is calibrated at 550 nm 
the light will certainly fall into the predefined range of blue.

Curiously, you could get away with this statement in ordinary language, 
but in a metalanguage suitably precise for defining Tarskian truths this 
sentence is nonsensical, because of problems drawing conclusions from 
exact time.  However, I'll make a couple other points before coming to 
this one.

This argument does not hold up because an increase in informatio will 
actually increase the ambiguity, or at least make it more obvious.  It 
is certainly acceptable to assign blueness a range of 540-560 nm, but 
there will still be certain situations in which it is impossible to say 
whether the light is blue or not.  For the moment I am going to abandon 
the sky because the entire visible spectrum is present in what we 
perceive as the blue sky.  Imagine a satellite is beaming a laser down 
on our instrumentation.  We are trying to determine whether or not 'le 
laser est bleu' has a true or false Tarskian value, based on a 
definition fo blue between 540-560 nm.  Presume using advanced 
femtotechnology we have a wavelength detection instrument so precise 
that it can measure the distance between each individual photon that 
strikes the receptor down to the picometer scale or better.  This 
instrument will be able to detect wavelengths as precisely as physically 
possible.  Also presume that the laser on the satellite has been 
calibrated as precisely as physically possible.
       If the laser on the satellite has been calibrated to 550 nm, or 
555, or 548, or any value in the middle of the blue range, we can quite 
easily give it a true value.  However, what if the laser is calibrated 
at exactly 540 nm at it's source?  As the laser shines through the 
atmosphere, the photons will be slightly, randomly refracted so that the 
time between photons striking the instrument will wobble slightly (The 
instrument would measure wavelength between individual photons by 
dividing the time between photon strikes by the speed of light).  Slight 
variations in temperature gradients throughout the atmosphere will slow 
photons sufficiently to cause a wavelength change (this problem is 
accerbated by the fact that both the position of the photons and the 
atoms of the instrument are slightly ambigous because of quantum 
uncertainty principles, but I shall ignore this factor for the moment).  
The instrument would record the distances between individual photons as 
follows:
Photon Number:     1     2     3     4     5     6     7      8 

Distance Apart: (5) 39.97 40.03 40.01 40.04 39.99 39.95  40.04

In fact the variation from 540nm would be far, far smaller (not taking 
into account quantum effects, because if one did you couldn't assign any 
precise number at all), but it makes no difference in principle.  
Because the wavelength of the light will inevitable wobble, the validity 
of assigning a Tarskian truth value to the statement 'le laser est bleu' 
is destroyed by the fact that neither a true or a false value can be 
assigned at the borders of the definition (540 and 560 nm).  The change 
over time destroys any attempt at certainty.
  One way to try to freeze the truth would be to freeze time, make the 
precisely 5:34 P.M statement mentioned earlier.  However, besides being 
impractical in the real world, if time was frozen, light would not 
travel and there would be no way for the instrumentation to measure any 
value at all.  If you froze time exactly at the point that a photon 
struck the receptor, you would be able to tell whether the light was 
blue in the past (540nm)/(186,000 km/sec)(I am suddenly struck by the 
mortal terror that I have misremembered the speed of light.  I will 
fight my neurosis by sending it off as is).  However, you would have 
absolutely no basis for saying whether the light is blue NOW because 
that will not become apparent until the next photon strikes the 
receptor, and of course nothing at all can be said about the matter 
until it is tested.  
    As a brief backtrack, I'll note the advantage of ordinary language 
over metalanguage in that ordinary language allows just enough ambiguity 
to avoid nonsense.  When people use the term precisely, they allow for 
that to include enough time so that light and sound waves can continue a 
brief ways on their appointed rounds, thereby not striking the world 
deaf and blind at that precise moment.  I think the reason why common 
language is so much more common than metalanguage is that it is much 
more useful.
     
      In fact, it seems that allowing for a discrete range of blueness 
has made the ambiguity twice as bad.  If blue was defined as light with 
a wavelength of 550nm, at almost every point the Tarskian truth value of 
the statement 'le laser est bleu' would be false, except at 550nm which 
would be ambigous.  By creating a range, there is an area of clear 
truth, clear falsehood, and TWO ambigous points.  It does not seem to me 
that Tarskian logic is the path to finding absolute truth if there are 
necesarily ambiguities wherever one tries to draw boundries. Indeed, the 
only way to create a genuinely universal Tarskian logic statement would 
be by defining blue as being the set of all wavelengths, i.e., an 
infinite statement.


>We don't need "fuzzy truth" statements: the truth is binary,

I admire faith, and thus I choose not to argue against it.  As bivalent 
truth is the foundation of an information system, it cannot be supported 
using the precepts of that system, any more than you can say that the 
Pope is infallible because the infallible Pope said so. A foundation 
cannot have foundations.  I chose to allow for fuzzy truth because I 
find it more relaxing philosophically and allows me to see more creative 
possibilities.  My support of fuzzy truth does not have any more logical 
basis than your support of binary truth.

>already have a means of communicating precision.

And the greater the precision, the more clear it becomes that it isn't 
very clear.

Er, good point.  Not thinking in a metalanguage leaves you prone to these
sorts of errors.  Instead, you might add statements of precision to each
of your values, or simply presume that each of these values were precise
to their least significant digit.

> This is not a sustainable argument because the more information we had 
> the weaker this definition of blue would become.

I wholeheartedly disagree.  If blue were defined to be any light within
the wavelengths 549nm and 551nm (where both of these values have perfect
precision; they are simply part of our definition after all) then the
definition of blue cannot become stronger or weaker.  More information
will only tell us whether certain wavelengths (ie 551.00 +/- 1nm) are, for
example, truly blue.  Not that this is a particularly USEFUL definition,
of course, but you get the idea.

(On an unrelated note, is 550nm really blue?  That number sounds wrong,
for some reason...)

Ah.  You are correct; we have been talking past each other.  This poses
new and very different problems.  For example, suppose you have licensed
your information out to a hundred people.  Then, to your surprise, I,
someone with whom you haven't contracted, begin to market this information
publicly.  You can't sue me, because there is no contract binding ME from
distributing your information.  Indeed, the only people whom you CAN sue
are those to whom you have licensed information, and they all deny it. If
I have managed to remove the fingerprints you have added to your

(For the purposes of this example, suppose this information had been

information from one of your licensees anonymously; I don't know whom I

that I was buying the information from one of your licensees.)

Right now, we create IP laws in order to get around this problem: we pass
a law such that everyone is required not to use or distribute protected
information without paying royalties to the author.  Without such laws, I
could make an exchange like the one listed above, leaving you SOL. 
However, as you note, such laws are in no way grounded in "natural law":
they would only be created because the contract was *too difficult to
enforce otherwise.*

Well, suffice it to say that I endorse contract law, and NOT enforcement
of copyright beyond that.  However, I don't think that will protect
inventors in any meaningful way; it would be as if IP did not exist at
all.

But despite the fact that contract law IP would be ineffective, there
would STILL be an incentive to invent new technology; it would be smaller
than that available today, but not zero.  I demonstrated this earlier this
month;  see http://www.extropy.com/exi-lists/extropians/4600.html

On the contrary; copies are cheap, but not free.  However much they cost
to make, that's how much people will sell them for.

As noted, technology would advance, only SLOWER.  For evidence of this,
take a look at the Linux operating system.  It's covered by the GNU Public
License: it is explicitly and forever available to be copied freely.  It
advances slower than Windows, isn't as popular, but it's also available
for much less.  Indeed, many people think that Red Hat 5 is BETTER than
Windows NT, thanks to the open source policy.  It's also a hell of a lot
cheaper, but NOT FREE: you'll see the Red Hat CD selling for ~$50 most
places.

Technology can and does advance without IP laws, only not quite so fast. 
It is also much cheaper.  This is just what my argument earlier would have
qualitatively predicted, strong evidence that it is actually true.

As always, there are a hundred reasons why China's economy would go the
way it did.  I'd say the biggest one is probably that they switched to a
planned economy, which is more than sufficient to kill growth in ALL
industries; invention would cease because there were no rewards for
increased efficiency AT ALL.  The economy's planned, so what's the
point? 

If I'm right, IP was not the reason China had no inventions, but rather a
planned economy was the death blow to innovation.  Can you separate these
effects into "real numbers?"  If so, there's a Nobel prize in Economics in
it for you if you'll just tell us how. 

> Don't give me percentages, give me numbers. I'll bet that Sasha Chislenko's economic simulator will

<sigh> If you want, I can go seek out how large the software industry, the
movie industry and the book binding industries are, and tell you that they
would practically double in quantity as their prices dropped.  But that's
really not enough information: we'd need to COMPARE this with the cost of
enforcing IP laws; except that copyright ISN'T enforced on individuals the
majority of the time; people copy video tapes, books and software all the
time; we'd REALLY need to compare it against how much it WOULD cost to
actually stop piracy.

I haven't heard of Chislenko's economic simulator, (nor could I find it in
a quick glance over Chislenko's web site,) but I somehow doubt that it can
predict the shape of the demand curve for microeconomic markets.  In
general, we can only determine this based on approximations based on
marginal costs, quantity sold and prices over time; again presuming that
demand isn't CHANGING during those periods (which it obviously is). 
Indeed, I'd guess that the simulator is a MACROecnomic simulator, which
uses numbers which are much easier to measure: inflation, total GDP, the
money supply, interest rates...  Yale's got one, too; it's quite good. 
Come take a look:  http://fairmodel.econ.yale.edu/

Unfortunately, you won't find the quantity of inventions, books or
software as any of the variables.

To conclude, I can show that the area inside one shape is bigger than the
area inside another shape without knowing how large either shape is.
Based on their RELATIVE sizes, I can show that one microeconomic strategy
would be superior to another; but even then I don't know how MUCH
superior.

> A reasonable competent fingerprint will make software not work at all if it is tampered with.

Really?  Care to name a program that uses one such fingerprint?  ANY
program?  I can basically guarantee you that if the program has sold more
than a thousand copies, someone out on the net has bothered to break its
copy protection.  There are archives of cracks available specifically for
this purpose, with lots of reasonably competent programmers on BOTH sides
of the battle lines.

That's because I can't.  Neither could you if our situations were
reversed, and you were arguing for the establishment of general (beyond
contract) laws. It's one microeconomic market; there is no equation which
will determine GDP based on the behavior of one market.  It's like asking
me to predict how tall a growing child will be depending on whether they
drink milk today or not.  They'll get some calcium, and as a trend the
child will get taller as a result.  But how much taller, and how tall in
the final outcome?  I can't say.

Not at all; rather I assert that if this were the only protection
inventors had against copyright infringement, they would have no
protection at all, and that this would be economically superior to a
system under which these contracts were supplemented by intrusive IP laws.

Actually, I can be quite certain that it WOULD be 0.5Q.  See, the way I
came across this was by the economic principle that in order for a
monopoly to increase the quantity sold, it must lower the price twice as
fast as a competitive business.  As a result of this effect, the marginal
revenue curve WILL strike the P=0 line at 0.5Q.  Obviously, then, it would
be false of me to claim that the market would fall by 50% unless the price
was actually 0; I left myself a 10% margin for error.

The inventor gets no EXTRA time to recoup losses.  And I agree, by
externalizing, the pace of technological growth will slow, but it will not
"stagnate."  The inventor will gain a percentage of the new market; if
that percentage is larger than the cost of invention, then the inventor
will invent.  If not, then they won't.

Yes, but you never try to make a covenant with multiple people for the
same piece of real estate; when the lease is broken, you know precisely
who broke it.  Nor can real estate be copied.  That makes this an
excellent arrangement for real estate, but an inferior one for
information.

Indeed, what could you do to me if you DID lease land to me, and then I
copied it and returned the land to you?  Even if this were forbidden by
the lease, how would you know who had broken the contract if someone else
started selling copies of your real estate who had purchased it from an
anonymous seller?  After all, it could be me, or any of the other hundreds
of customers you've serviced.

Agreed; this is how governments view property today; I think we're agreed

Remind me never to contract with you unless the terms of enforcement are
made explicit.  ;)

And again, I must agree with you here; only whom will you nuke when third
parties start offering copies of your goods?  You don't have any contract
over THEM.

The purpose of my parallel was to demonstrate that even if we accept a
libertarian understanding of property rights, ANY economic analysis must
make policy decisions based on net wealth; this is not wealth owned by
society, but wealth owned by individuals.  I don't consider it in any way
opposed to libertarianism to do so.  If arguments from net wealth are not
collectivist, then arguments from net utility ought to be no more so. 

> I agree with the CONCEPT of your economci argument. I think that your numbers are completely wrong.

I say that it will not, and I therefore cede to you that we ought to
enforce IP in contracts, but not as a law stating that no one may use
protected information.

First, there might be a meeting point between microtechnology (the little
silicon gears and so on) and nanotech built sensors. A very small amout of
nanotech interfaced with chips, basically.

Second, an "anything box" need only be able to connect together a few atomic
types and bonds, about 10 elements, a hundred or so bond types. Like a floppy
disk, reading and writing are the trivial part. The software and data sets to
make this device make anything useful is a whole other fish. The PC on my desk
has undreamed of capabilities, but the currently available software just
begins
to touch a few of the possibilities.

Meditation types differ. Take a look at buddhist forms of awake sitting
meditation. The Vipassana and Shambhala meditations are about awareness
and focus, not mysticism. Zen is also worth a look.

Hardly.  We can see this from a macroscopic example: if I lead you in a
simple waltz on the Mexican border facing north, my left foot will be in
America during the first measure and in Mexico on 2 and 3 of the second
measure.  (Ignore the fence.)  It will truly be wherever it is at any

Fortunately for us, we have calculus to illuminate our path.  A particle
whose location at time t is given by the function x(t) is defined to have
an instantaneous velocity at time t given by the limit of [x(t + h) -
x(t)]/h where h approaches 0.  Handy, yes?

As noted, in light of the above definition, this discussion of ambiguity
is fishy.  Since particles have a discrete location at a given time, and
since their instantaneous velocities ARE given by calculus, there's no
ambiguity at all on the Newtonian scale.

Hardly.  The truth of certain axioms is unquestionable; A=A leaps to mind.
You cannot logically support a position under which 0.99A=A, unless A is
0.  In other words, if anything exists, then A = A; logic does not allow
for contradictions.

Frankly, I think you have simply misspoken with respect to your point
about logic; in logic, things ARE either true or false.  It's one of the
defining characteristics of logic.  If you wish to adhere to fuzzy truth,
then you had best dump all pretenses of logic altogether and claim some
other higher ground; mysticism seems popular these days.  However, one
thing we logicians have shown, time and time again, is that the mystics
cannot beat us on our own turf.

I make no claims to originality here.  Forgive me if you've heard this
before.

The Extropian and posthumanist movements exist partly to spread their
views and change society.  How best to do this?  There are many
paths to the top of a mountain.  Aside from the many, successful means
quite a few of you are practicising -- publishing articles, letters-to-the-
editor, holding fora on various topics, etc. -- I'd like to suggest another.

It's already in use by the Ayn Rand Institute.  This is to run essay
contests with secondary school and college students as the target
audience.   ARI concentrates on Ayn Rand's _Anthem_ and _The
Fountainhead_, and Leonard Peikoff's _Objectivism: The Philosophy
of Ayn Rand_.  The number of contestants is in the thousands.  (I
believe last year they got 7K!)  The Extropy Institute or other
organizations can get together a reading list and target high school
students.  This might leak into classroom discussion making the
influence of our ideas even more widespread -- aside from the bonus
of having them more seriously debate outside our circles.

Let me know what you think about this.

Cheers!

Or can prove that it was she who stole it.  Insuring trade
secrets would allow for compensation of the victim, and
allow for a method of determining the secret's value to 
the victim.

This seems inseperable from the idea of owning ideas in the

"Free enough"?  I'm all for compensation, but that
seems somewhat extreme for theft.  Of course, we

Title
  Caloric restriction increases HDL2 levels
  in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta).
Source
  American Journal of Physiology.  273(4 Pt 1):E714-9, 1997 Oct.
Abstract
  Caloric restriction (CR) prolongs the life
  of rodents and other small animals, but the benefits of CR for primates and
  people are as yet unknown, and mechanisms by which CR may slow
  aging remain unidentified. A study of rhesus monkeys, Macaca
  mulatta, is underway to determine if CR might prolong life span in primates
  and to evaluate potential mechanisms for life prolongation. Thirty rhesus
  monkeys in three age cohorts, restricted to 70% of ad libitum calorie intake
  for 6-7 yr, were compared with 30 controls. Plasma lipid, lipoprotein, and
  high-density lipoprotein (HDL) apolipoproteins and subfractions were measured
  and compared with weight, percent fat, glucose, and insulin level. CR caused
  decreased triglyceride levels in adult monkeys and increased levels of HDL2b,
  the HDL subfraction associated with protection from atherosclerosis.
  Multivariate statistical analyses showed that differences in lipid and
  lipoprotein levels occurring with CR could be accounted for, at least in
  part, by decreased body mass and improved glucose regulation. These studies
  have used a novel dietary modification paradigm in nonhuman primates focused
  on calorie reduction. Results suggest that CR, as mediated by its beneficial
  effect on body composition and glucose metabolism, could prolong human life
  by decreasing the incidence of atherosclerosis.

I would agree with most of this, however, not with the total concept of
nonagression. Personal Caveats vis a vis nonagression:

a) no first strike policy against those who espouse and practice the same.
b) maintain a first strike policy against those who fall into a utilitarian or
communitarian subset which has in the past demonstrated a high likelihood to
practice first strike agression.
c) maintain and practice skills and equipment for first strike preparedness, as
the threat of instant retaliation seems to be the only deterrent which agressor
type sets respect.

While I have found that in some cases, even returning property which had been
lost and the owner had given up on can reap benefits, however not in all cases.

This might work. My 15-year-old daughter just completed an assignment
on "the ethics of technology." The class divided into groups and
picked technologies. Her group picked nanotechnology. Apparently
everybody had fun and learned a lot.

She goes to an exceptional school, perhaps the best public high
school in the country, but I suspect that a lot of kids would
like to do this. Kirsten's school has a coordinated
english/science/technology curriculum, in which the teachers of
the separate courses coordinate their assignments and grading.
Thus, the assignment was actually in the english class, but
with help from the other two teachers.

The typical teacher is fairly overworked, and may therefore be
resistant to curriculum changes. Your essay idea avoids that
by going directly to the student, but will therefore mostly
reach the motivated student. An alternative is to try to
catch the interest of the teacher. One way to do this might
be to create a complete lesson plan suitable for use
by the teacher to teach a one-class (45-minute) on an
interesting future-oriented topic. You can orient toward the
english class (readings, essay topics, debates) or toward the
science class (nanotech fits nicely in chemistry or physics.)

I've seen complete lesson plans for younger kids on different
topics. The map-reading units at USGS are an example.

You're right.  I checked a physics textbook, and blue is roughly in the 
range of 430-480 nm.  550 is in the green approaching yellow range.

If I can demonstrate in court that the information is X percent congruent with the information I was
licensing (as the information content in and of itself is its own fingerprint), then I can still sue you as
an accessory to breach of contract, even if I cannot determine the original breaching agent. Keep in mind
that under a libertarian system, there is no right to refuse self incrimination. Since I would be backed by
my PPL which has a standard practice of using veradication technology on individuals testifying in court, I
doubt that you could escape prosecution.

IP law is merely a societal contract under which the government is delegated authority to enforce the
individual contract rights of all of its citizens. It does not matter if the government is a monopoly state
or a competetive PPL. The principle is the same.

The individual who is in receipt of stolen goods. As the original license breaker is likely to have
distributed the information to others, then you can then offer immunity if the accessory in receipt will
give up sufficient relevant data to prosecute the original breacher. If the originator cannot be found, the
receiver gets the hook.

Licensed properly, it is as good as IP, possibly even better in a libertarian world, because the inventor
is not restricted by national borders from pursuing pirates.

I read that, which was what got me started on this whole thread. You still treat patents as monopolies,
while I treat them as competetive advantages in a competetive market. If you stop treating patents as
monopolies, then your argument goes away.

With electronic duplication and transmission, the costs are almost nil.

But I can go buy the Red Hat CD and reproduce it if I want. I have a CDR deck on my PC here, and I can get
CD blanks for less than $2.00. Where is Red Hat gonna be when I can sell copies of their CD for 10% of what
they sell it for, or even 20%? I could offer it on my web site for free transmission.  Obviously Red Hat
has put some added value into their Linux offering, so how do they expect to recoup their investment if
everyone can freely reproduce their product?

Even if it slowly advances, since there is no longer sufficient incentive for most people to invent, since
they have to worry about feeding their families first, invention will again become merely the province of
rich bachelors who can't get laid.

Its actually rather simple, though tedious. Its merely a measure of growth of sales of products bearing
chinese patent numbers. Just as today's economic growth here in the US is almost entirely in the high tech
sector. Kill IP in the US and you will have economic stagnation here.

Yes, this is rather indicative, isn't it??? A lack of ability to forecast productivity increases due to
technological innovation seems to be a rather huge gaping hole in a model which claims to be so accurate,
doesnt' it? Of course, they only give average accuracy numbers. I'd like to see how the accuracy numbers
have changed over time. Even Greenspan has noted how current economic models have totally failed to predict
the present economy, which is almost entirely due to increased industrial productivity derived from the
high rate of technological advancement. I'll bet that the accuracy of the model is far less now than it was
20 years ago. I note that it is also restricted to a forecasting ability of only 4 years.

How do you expect to demonstrate their relative sizes without knowing how large either shape is??? If you

SUch schemes are not currently used as the cost is currently greater than the cost of IP enforcement at
this time, due to the sufficiently widespread respect for IP protection. If this were to change, then such
schemes would then become cost effective. One such scheme takes advantage of passive boot sector virus/worm
technology to monitor tampering. If write attempts are made to specific hidden read only files, the virus
or worm built into the software will corrupt enough data to foil the tampering attempt, making the software
unusable.

However, you can predict the change in incentive to invent, and determine the utility value of invention
for inventors. This gives you the invention supply curve. Then correlating rates of patents being issued
with productivity growth in an economy, all other factors being equal, you can predict how change in the
supply of inventions will change the productivity growth.

While I assert that current IP is merely a matter of monopoly government acting as a PPL in protecting the
IP licenses of its contracted (i.e. patents granted) citizens. If I were in a libertarian society, I would
have a free choice of PPL agencies to contract the protection of my IP with, and would only engage in IP
trade with indviduals that were customers of the same PPL or with competetive  PPL's with which my PPL had
IP agreements with.

I find it difficult to follow your charts due to the problems with lining up the characters. If you can
produce either graphics or excel compatible charts I would appreciate it. Feel free to send these via
personal email at retroman@together.net. In any event, I see something which you may not. If a competetive
business only has to lower its price half as much to increase its market share as a monopoly does to
increase the entire market, then obviously it is more efficient to have a monopoly provide a product. If it
wants to increase its market size it must lower its price twice as much than if it were a competetive
business. That tells me that the comsumers benefit twice as much from a monopoly than from a competetive
business. I for one don't beleive that.

If the inventor has to recoup his research, development, and production refinement costs and his
competetors do not, then he is at a competetive disadvantage to invent. Better to let some other schmuck
take those costs and steal his inventions from him. In such a situation, the incentive to invent will be
negative, and invention will stagnate.

If it were so, then why are all of the economists totally flabbergasted at today's economy? None of their
models have predicted the huge increases in productivity which are what is driving our economic growth.

If the person who bought my land from me signs my covenant, one clause in my covenant is that the buyer
must agree that anyone he sells the land to is bound by the same covenant. Thus while you cannot reproduce
the land (except as seen below), you also cannot change the minimum terms of sale to your customers, and
their customers, etc. I can add additional terms, but the origianl terms cannot be recinded.

Now, there is a way I can reproduce the land. I can build multi-storied buildings on the land, and multiply
the square footage available within the boundaries of that land. So if I bought 10,000 square feet of land,
and I agreed in my covenant that I will build no larger than one story buildings on the land, I therefore
cannot multiply the square footage. If such a clause were not in the covenant, I could simply build a
building that had 10,000 square feet on each floor, build as many floors as I could, and sell those. When I
sold each floor to others, I could add to the base covenant that each floor owner could not subdivide,
lease, or sublease the floor in any manner, and the buyers would be bound by my copyright of that floor.

It doesn't matter. Receipt of stolen goods and accessory to violation of copyright are prosecutable even in
the original perpetrator is not found.

While anonymous money may make a significant impact on electronic commerce, I don't think that anonymous

No, but they have contracts with their PPLs, and I have contracts with my PPL. Any reasonable PPL will
recognise the validity of a claim upon an individual who has received stolen goods, even if the original
perpetrator cannot be found. As long as the stolen goods can be proven to posess a significant congruence
with the goods of the claimant which are documented prior to the receipt date of the stolen goods, then a
case and claim can be made.

Then you cede to the existing law. As IP law is prosecuted as civil offenses, rather than criminal offenses
(except when it involves transportation across state or national borders), you agree to most of current IP
law as practiced.

I want to let you know that the Planet One website, which seems to be a rather
large personal networking website that allows you to contact/get in touch with
people with similar interests or in similar organizaitons, defines Extropians in
its data base as a Religious Organization. I suggest that Max More contact them
about this....

I would suggest that ExI make regular efforts to search the web for references of
such definitions, in hopes to prevent our loose association from becoming totally
maligned by the ignorant.

I can't support 0.99A=A if I subscribed to bivalent logic and its forms 
of expression, but since I don't, there isn't any problem.  Fuzzy logic 
expressions are less concise than bivalent, because it is more precise.  
A=A and .99A=A are expressed in fuzzy logic as follows (although I will 
be less than economical by not putting it all in symbolic notation)

1.00A=1.00A to a 1.00 degree
.99A=1.00A to a .99 degree

When expressed in proper notation  the supposed contradictions 
disappear.  The main argument against fuzzy notation is that Aristotle 
didn't use it, and therefore anybody who does is a Satanist and going to 
hell.


>Frankly, I think you have simply misspoken with respect to your point

It's one of the defining characteristics of bivalent logic, and it's 
philosophical child, logical atomism. I do not believe that historical 
precedence is sufficient reason to declare all other systems of logic to 
be impossible or immoral.  All that is necesary for a system of logic to 
be valid is that true conclusions follow from true premises, which fuzzy 
logic satisifies.
  
If you wish to adhere to fuzzy truth,
>then you had best dump all pretenses of logic altogether and claim some

You have caught me.  I am a mystic.  In fact, I am a Jungian 
psychologist.;)

There are three definitions of mysticism in my dictionary <American 
Heritage> :
1. Immediate consciousness of the transcendent or ultimate reality or 
God.
2. A belief in the existence of essential realities beyond perceptual of 
intellectual apprehension that are accessible to subjective experience.
3.Vague, groundless speculation

I suppose that you mean mysticism in the third sense, while I support 
the second definition and have occasionally experienced the first.  You 
are correct that mystical beliefs are spreading quite rapidly in the 
Western scientific world.  This change in acceptance started with the 
quantum physics revolution, but I think the current upswing can be 
blamed on the spread of the Penrose/Hameroff quantum brain meme.  Many 
people still disagree with the theory that the human brain works via 
quantum computation, but the point has been reached that most people 
will admit that it is possible to both give credence to the idea and be 
in one's right mind. 
   Mysticism becomes sensible under these conditions by replacing 'God 
or ultimate reality' in the first definition with 'undifferentiated 
quantum field'.  Transcendental Consciousness is a state of 
consciousness in which there are no qualities (dichotomies) whatsoever, 
which is equivalent to the state of a quantum computer before you open 
it up and look inside.  Such a state cannot be experienced by 
intellectual or perceptual faculties (which I think are just different 
manifestations of the same thing) because by definition the intellect 
(logic) seperates things into parts.  This includes fuzzy logic, which 
differs from Aristotelian logic only in that it allows for partial 
dichotomies.
   It is worth remembering that the seperation between mysticism and 
logic has only been a recent historical phenomenon.  All early 
scientific systems had decidedly mystical elements; from the Jewish 
Kabalists (who invented alchemy which begat chemistry) to the cult of 
the Pythagorans, to Plato and his forms.  It is not suprising that 
mysticism and logic are once again uniting. I think the division only 
occured in the first place because the Catholic Church decided the 
ambiguity of mysticism to be a threat to its authority and managed to 
mostly stamp it out in the Western world.  Now that the power of the 
church is waning, mysticism is once again flourishing.

   I can easily see how this mistake could be made. Certainly 
Extropianism concerns itself with the same issues that traditional 
religions address; the role of the individual in society, ethics, the 
nature of the universe, the pursuit of immortality.
   Planet One's label in half correct.  It falls apart in that 
Extropians are antithetical to any organization except spontaneous 
organization.  Perhaps they should be contacted and informed that 
Extropianism is a Religious Disorganization.

Er, no.  I do not assert that this thinking is flawed because you're going
to hell.  That argument itself is inherently problematic.  Instead, I want
to fall back on my previous argument (I think this was before you walked
in) that IF an objective reality exists, then acting as if it doesn't or
presuming false things to be true to any degree will ultimately be bad for
us; that is, that adhering to falsehood is directly opposed to our own
self interests.

I don't think I need to provide a lot of examples to demonstrate this; I'm
sure you can come up with a wide variety on your own.  Falsehood is
inextricably coupled with human suffering and death in a non-trivial way.

I'm not opposed to fuzzy logic as a tool to help us to better approximate
the truth; ultimately it may be the only tool available to prove certain
facts which escape axiomatic logic.  However, I am opposed to assertions
that the truth ITSELF is fuzzy; even in quantum mechanics, arguably the
weirdest branch of physics we've ever discovered, things are weird in a
very specific way.  An electron, despite its particulate nature, will
diffract in a VERY specific way described by our equations.  The fact that
the cat in the box is, to some extent, dead and not dead simultaneously
does NOT mean that all things are and are not true; the diffraction of
light on a screen is not ambiguous in any way.  The behavior of photons
may be weird, and may be truly random, but there are certain behaviors
which you will never see and which quantum mechanics predicts can never
happen.

Listen to what you're saying!  "True conclusions from true premises..."
Not conclusions which are true to some degree from true premises, but TRUE
conclusions.  Again, I'll buy your logic as an approximation of the real
truth, but not your fuzzy truth.

Depends on which idea you're referring to.  That the brain is a quantum
computer?  This is not unbelievable, a priori, but once you get down to
the evidence, we will ultimately find out if the brain is a quantum
computer.  Science, even QM, always wants to boil down to truth
or falsehood.

Your physics themselves are a bit fuzzy here.  In a quantum computer, not
ALL dichotomies are eliminated, but rather what makes the quantum computer
useful is that all possible conclusions interact with one another in such
a way as to produce the correct solution to the assigned problem, and
never the wrong one.  And when I say correct, I mean REALLY correct, TRULY
correct; the equations, again, provide no ambiguity on this point. 
Certain principles which we use in modern chemistry are derived from the
fact that quantum mechanics states that some things always (or never)
happen; the Pauli exclusion principle leaps to mind. 

So again, even in quantum mechanics, we ultimately find ourselves looking
at certain things which are definitely true and others which are
definitely false.  Quantum provides no support for the conclusions which
you have drawn; not that it matters, because truth and falsehood are
meaningless to your paradigm anyway.  However, suffice it to say that
science will not help you in your march towards oblivion.

Yet we find the most adherent followers of objectivism are atheists, not
mysticists, with an eye on the truth, not on the abolition of truth.  And
though I doubt such things would interest you, since you reject the axiom
of non-contradiction, those philosophers which you refer to throughout the
ages were mysticists, yes, it's true, but that's about the extent to which
they agreed on anything.

The following are quotes from Admiral Thomas H. Moorer:
_______________________________________________________

   Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
   Staff, Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, USN, Ret.


July 17, 1998, will mark the second anniversary of the 
mysterious crash of TWA Flight 800 off the coast of Long 
Island, killing 230 men, women and children. ...

The FBI and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
... theory is that the crash was initiated by an explosion 
of fuel in the plane's center tank, but the evidence they 
cite to support this is so weak that many people have 
been unwilling to accept it.

As a former Navy aviator and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, I am puzzled and disturbed by the inconclusive 
results of this investigation. Blaming the crash on an 
explosion in the fuel tank does not ring true for several 
reasons. First of all, modern aviation fuel is designed 
for safety. It does not readily burn, much less explode. 
There is no precedent for a mid-air fuel tank explosion 
in a modern jet airliner using Jet A-1 fuel without the 
involvement of a high explosive device.

The NTSB searched long and hard for evidence that some-
thing in the center wing tank of TWA Flight 800 had created 
a spark that set off a powerful explosion in the nearly 
empty tank. They could find nothing that would have 
generated such a spark.

And unless the fuel was heated to at least 127 degrees 
Fahrenheit at sea level, you couldn't burn it with a match. 
That is why these modern jets using modern fuel have flown 
billions of miles with never an accident of this type un-
less a high explosive was involved.

There is no doubt that there was an explosion in the center 
wing fuel tank of TWA Flight 800, but the evidence indicates 
that it was the result of the explosion of a powerful missile 
outside the tank. 


... there is a great deal of important evidence bearing 
on the crash that apparently has not been given the atten-
tion that it deserves by either the official investigators 
or the news media. The most obvious and inexplicable example 
is the evidence provided by 183 eyewitnesses interviewed by 
the FBI who saw a streak of light heading toward the plane 
immediately before the explosion. According to an FBI report, 
96 of these eyewitnesses said they saw the streak of light 
rising from the surface.

The disregard of the evidence provided by all these 
eyewitnesses raises a number of questions.

· Why did the FBI insist that the NTSB not allow any eye-
  witnesses to testify at its public hearing on the causes 
  of the crash?

· Why did the Justice Department, through an assistant 
  U.S. attorney in New York City, order the investigative 
  team assembled by the NTSB not to undertake any eye-
  witness interviews, but to leave that to the FBI?

· Why did the FBI refuse to let the NTSB investigators 
  participate in its interviews of eyewitnesses?

· Why has the FBI refused to release its eyewitness inter-
  view reports to the press and public?

· Why has the government tried to discredit eyewitness 
  testimony with the claim that all those people who said 
  they saw a rocket-like object rising from the surface and 
  exploding 14,000 feet up had really seen burning fuel 
  spilling from the fuel tanks in the plane's wings.

The intelligent, sober people who saw a streak of light 
ascending shake their heads in disbelief when told that 
the government is saying that they really saw burning 
fuel falling.

There are many more questions I would like to see answered. 
The investigators conducted tests to determine what impact 
a missile would have on the plane, what kind of "fingerprints" 
it would leave on the wreckage. But their testing raises 
these questions:

· Why did they limit their testing of the impact of a 
  missile to small shoulder-fired missiles such as the 
  Stinger?

· Don't they know that these small missiles would not 
  have been effective against a 747 flying at nearly 
  14,000 feet?

· Why didn't they look for the clues that would be left 
  by the explosion of a large sophisticated missile 
  detonating in close proximity to the target?

· Why did they ignore the compelling evidence that in-
  dicates that this is just what happened?

The public is entitled to an answer to those questions, but 
the mainstream media are not asking the questions. They have 
been content to accept the official explanation of the crash, 
disregarding all the evidence that casts doubt upon it.

  IAN: Maybe it was such a spark that over 100 
  witnesses saw shoot up, trailing white smoke to 
  take down the plane, at least 96 of whom saw it 
  originate on the surface. But I doubt that any 
  of the wires of a 747 at 13,700 ft would also 
  be located on the surface of the ocean, or 
  even if so, arch 13,700 ft to the plane.

  Also, while the NTSB cannot say how a spark could 
  get into the CFT, there's no reason to believe that
  even if one did that it would cause an explosion. 
  The fuel used in commercial jets is Jet A-1, which,
  unlike gasoline, does not easily explode. You can 
  put out a cigarette in Jet A-1. It is not until 
  the fuel is 127 degrees that it becomes flammable. 

  The FBI/CIA Evergreen test claiming to prove 
  that the fuel in a test plane was flammable at
  14,000 did so in a plane with a 17-degree hotter
  ambient temperature than existed in TWA 800!

  See letters from Commander Bill Donaldson: 
  http://members.aol.com/bardonia2/ntsb7.htm 
  http://members.aol.com/bardonia/hearings.htm 

  Furthermore, fuel explosions are weak explosions. 
  Fuel explosions are * combustions * NOT detonations. 
  A combustion is when the explosive reaction travels 
  through the explosive material at a subsonic rate. 
  A combustion in the center of the plane will not 
  rip the nose off of the plane (which was the 
  first thing that happened). I could list many
  examples of physical damage that occurred to
  the plane and the passengers that define 
  high-velocity forces far in excess of 
  any low-velocity vapor combustion.

  The CFT theory is a crackpot theory that may be
  "good enough" to fool some of the people some of 
  the time, but not all of the people all the time.

I missed the earlier post, so I'll respond to this here.  You have
incorrectly stated the nature of my statement.  Indeed, while deontology
and consequentialism may sometimes agree on the same moral actions, they
are two VERY distinct moral theories; there is no way you could construe
one to be the other, despite the fact that they do have some overlap.

You're going to maintain a first-strike policy against communitarians???
You realize that this entails going out there with a weapon, TODAY, and
killing as many non-libertarians as possible?  Besides the fact that this
plan will be totally ineffective, (we're outnumbered, millions to one,) it
ignores the possibility that these people could learn from their mistakes,
change their ways, and learn to coexist with their fellow human beings.
As much as I dislike communitarians, you won't ever see me killing
somebody just for holding that belief.

I never said I'd kill all of them. A First strike can range from a mild talking to,
up to the agression you are insinuating.  Moreover, I was mainly thinking of it in
terms of the policy I would have in a libertarian world, not the current one.

The 1998 Tulluride Mountain film festival has as one of its entries a short
documentary entitled 'Grandpa's in the Tuff Shed,' directed by Shelly, Kathy
and Robin Beeck.  

Evidently, a resident of Nederland, Colorado, froze his deceased grandfather
inside a wooden storage hut, using tons of dry ice.  Trygve Bauge left the
US for Norway a few years ago, but his neighbors still maintain the cryonic
condition of the body in the shed.

Does anyone know if there is a way to obtain a copy of this documentary?

Just wanted to introduce myself... I'll be a lurker mainly, but more than
happy to chat with extropians, transhumanists, cryonicists and "life-ists" in
general -- then make a brief comment about the misprep of Extropy issue.
(Please feel free to introduce yourself to me at my personal address...  don't
thing the list would appreciate a long neverending "Hi Ed, welcome to the
list" string !)   

I'm Ed from Philly... been interested in "cryonics related issues" for about 8
years after reading "Engines of Creation" and then "Man into Superman" - -
Prior to going "trans" I'd been interested in humanism from the age of 13,
when as a "then" Orthodox Jew I read Freud's "Moses and Monotheism" and gained
the courage to get myself in trouble.  Hobbies are Jazz organ and travel
(spend lot's of time in Tokyo) and contemporary Japan related stuff (not Zen
and flower arranging !)...   I do curriculum design and ESL. I'm fascinated in
social and psychological issues related to immortalist philosophies - - for
example, given unlimited lifespan how man will have to redefine his/her vision
of himself, family, what the new lifespan psychology will be and even the role
fantasy and virtual reality might play in a distant future (i.e. would humans
choose to create physical world of their dreams, or use technologies to create
limitless alternative realities - - and how this would effect how humans
interact in the future) - - and finally the "psychology of fatalism" and the
way in which it shaped modern society and how/whether future humanity will be
able to overcome it.

- - Just a brief comment... so what if it's classified as a religion?   Right
now cryonic preservation is illegal in many democratic countries and has been
challenged in the U.S.   If a cryonics/transhumanist related organisation were
to be deemed (even against its will) as a bonified religion, wouldn't that
provide constitutional protection to the freezed and 'awantin' to be frozen
folk ?    I definitely don't want my innards frozen out because some county
sheriff or public figure is aspiring for higher grounds or has some kind of
grudge to bare to the media.     Forgive my ignorance, but wouldn't the "rumor
of religion" have a benefit to it - - even though "religion" to many of us
goes against our basic principal as "technology" not the "supernatural" as
saviour...   Must of us are pragmatists and utilitarians, aren't we ?

  IAN: Those wire problems have been found only in 
  737s and NOT 747s, as reports have indicated [*]:

	"The FAA said on May 14 it was giving airlines
	45 days to examine 737s. . . The FAA said it 
	took the action after analyzing the results 
	of 195 inspections so far which found at least 
	nine bare wires where the insulation had com-
	pletely worn away. The 737 is the world's most 
	numerous airliner with more than 2,772 worldwide."

  I just got word from a 747 mechanic that the pro-
  blem has only been found in 737s because 747 wires 
  are "sheathed in teflon and they have not found the 
  chafed condition." TWA 800 was a 747, not a 737.

  Furthermore, consider that if the wires in 737s 
  have been arching, causing the burning indicated,
  which could cause fuel to leak and be exposed to 
  to the conductor, then why are not 737s exploding 
  left and right??! Because the Jet A-1 fuel is so 
  safe it does not explode, as stated previously.

  Some media source, such as CNN, have failed to

  737s, and careful frame the story as if it were

Multivalent ("Fuzzy") logic does not conflict with absolute truth.  It
merely breaks it down into cheweable bites instead of forcing you to
swallow a whole apple or none at all.

Multivalent logic excels at identity problems.  If you take a bite out of
an apple, is it still an apple?  Bivalent logic is limited to a yes/no
answer.  Multivalent logic can more accurately state that it is an apple to
a certain degree.

Multivalent logic untangles us from self-reference paradox.  What about a
barber who shaves everyone iff they don't shave themselves?  Bivalent logic
cannot tell us whether or not the barber shaves himself.  Multivalent logic
can resolve the conflict by having the barber shave himself to a certain
degree.  Fuzzy sets allow for partial containment.

Multivalent logic is the superior tool for complex control logistics.  In
systems where many elements come into play, multivalent logic allows for
better weight distribution.  Fuzzy controllers are found in everything from
traffic lights, portable sound systems, washing machines, and air
conditioners.  The proposed improvement of the IP protocol takes a fuzzy
approach by assigning packets priotity values.

Believe it or not, there ARE times when one is neither completely right,
nor completely wrong.

best do it so,

Magos

Too true.  So long as we're aware that the truth itself is not fuzzy, but
we are simply using fuzzy logic as a tool to better explain or
conceptualize the truth.

> Believe it or not, there ARE times when one is neither completely right,
> nor completely wrong.

Perhaps, but not because reality itself is partially objective, but
because the statement one is making contains some fraction of true
information and some fraction of false information.

Like I said, it's fuzzy TRUTH that I'm attacking here, not fuzzy logic.

   IAN: That's somewhat of a bad argument on my part 
   since the CNN article cited is a Reuters rerun.
   Suffice it to say that the entire "wire problem"
   show is carefully framed by the GovtMedia to give 
   the impression that evidence is being uncovered 
   that supports spontaneous-CFT-combustion theory.

I was using an analogy; both of these philosophies are consequentialist,
but you cannot construe utilitarianism to be egoism because of their
important differences.  Using your notation, all of U must be in M in
order to say that they are the same philosophy.  According to the thought
experiment that I demonstrated, at least some of U is not in M, and
therefore U is not M.

As to whether the intersection of M and non-aggression (NA) is entirely
within U, we have another thought experiment, this one orginally from
David Friedman.  Suppose you had a madman on the loose, who will kill
hundreds of people unless you shoot him immediately.  Unfortunately, you
do not own a gun; but MY gun could be easily stolen and used to save the
people.  I am not aruond, but I have mde it explicitly clear that I want
no one to use my gun no matter how important the cause. 

Utilitarianism will steal the gun and save the people, then repay the gun
owner in whatever way possible; M U NA would not aggress against the gun
owner.

Well, IMHO, a plausible, simple and very near reality hypothesis about the
universe should be: 

An infinite vacuum, n-dimensional (n=?) space... Into it, there is a
_possibly_ finite  energy-matter subset, dinamically evoluting, with its
matter expanding or contracting (?), but with its farer photons (*) almost
certainly expanding universe limits at c (?) velocity... 


(*) or other possibly quicker particles, or other particles which were
thrown very very far by the last (why only ?) big bang, farer than its first
photons, if was not such big-bang just a local phenomenum and we have not
yet seen anything out of it ...???

BTW, does anybody remember the medium life of a photon. If I am not wrong,
it depends on the energy, doesn't it ???

Hmmm...  There MUST a better term for this than "First-strike", which
AFAIK entails disabling your opponent before they can disable you. 
Clearly, a mild talking to will not satisfy a rigorous first-strike
policy.  <shrug>

Well, to be honest, I think this would do us much more harm than good. 
Remember, most people consider "small religion" synonymous with "cult." 
And if you hadn't noticed, cults don't get particularly good press, nor is
the USG stepping out of its way to protect the cultists' right to worship
in their own special way.  Add to that the fact that many of us consider
ourselves atheists (or militant agnostics!) and we see that, as usual, the
lie does more harm than good. 

> Must of us are pragmatists and utilitarians, aren't we ?

I am; and for that reason, I want to make it clear to everyone whom I talk
to that it's not a religion; it's a philosophy, and ought to be treated
that way.

  IAN: Exactly. After writing about fuzzy logic 
  in a report, I got hostile reactions from 
  some folks that saw fuzzy logic as an attack 
  on the concept of truth. The entirety of that
  counter against fuzzy stemmed from a failure to 
  understand that "fuzzy truth" is a measure of the
  degree that a given word X maps onto the physical
  thing Y that X is purported to describe. The word
  "rain" maps on to a "misty drizzle" to a degree 
  that's not 100% or 0% true or false, but the 
  physical event described is always 100% true.

  In that way, fuzzy logic does not devalue physical
  truth, but rather the idea that a given word is 100%
  or 0% true. I wrote this short essay in responce to the 
  reactions I got: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/fuzzy.htm

Count me in the first category.    I agree with the negative connotation about
religions, but am also concerned about another issue :      Except possibly
under freedom of religion, where else is a person's right to chose their
matter of "burial" (or should we say post-mortem storeage) protected ?
Under Orthodox Jewish law, for example, a person is supposed to be burried
within 24 hours of death, and autopsies are forbidden.    If I'm not mistaken,
in most cases I recall, this religious practise has generally been protected
by the state. - -   I received a letter from a fellow who lives in Japan
mentioning that he found out if he wished to be frozen and shipped back to
America, his body would have to be held over for a great deal of time and for
whatever reason and paperwork) and as I recall, cryopreservation is virtually
illegal in Japan.   (Most States and Countries have laws about how and when
bodies are to be "disposed" of.)    On the other hand, Japanese beurocrats are
notoriously for making exceptions when it comes to grey areas if the proper
people intervene.     (I am not a lawyer or expert in American or Japanese
law, so will stop at this point until I get myself entangled in something I
don't fully know what I'm talking about.)

In conclusion, agreed : Honesty and ethics are important.    Public image of a
growing movement is also important.   I can't deny that.  - -  I forget the
author of a famous freethought treatist written in the late 19th century
entitled "A History of the Warfare Between Science and Theology" - -
ironically, that battle continues 100 years later, as we see in issues related
to cloning to the right to die.   Ironically, both touch quite close to home.
However, as what one might call "Life Insurance", unless you can point out to
one area that privates me a legal right to chose my matter of de-animation,
and a right to be frozen and remain frozen, I would half to play it from both
sides of the fence...   (incidently, I believe in law, this is known as
"creation of a legal fiction" -- a pre-contrived action or agreement which
allows for a grey area of the law to be supported in a person's favor.)

- - Ed, swallowing his words, "I think I'll only lurk..."

I appreciate this point, but it would be false and harmful to call
Extropianism a religion in order to get the benefits of protection for
suspension. There *is* an organization that it legally a religion set up
partly for this reason -- The Society for Venturism. Venturists are
transhumanists and don't believe in a supernatural realm. Contact Dr.
Michael Perry at <mike@alcor.org> for more information.

   IAN: Yes, that address the issue quite directly.
   Would you say that this defines a degree of dis-
   junction between L and U? We agree as per M and 
   U. I find that expressing ideas according to set 
   theory helps us "see" what we're talking about,
   and thus maximizes accuracy and understanding.

	What a splendid idea! It's nice to see more and more people
talking about _action_ in addition to abstraction.
	There's an article I scanned in from Analog a year or two ago
called "A Call to Arms", and that person was also interested in doing
outreach to high school and elementary school students. He had some
interesting logistical and strategic ideas. He provided contact
information if people were interested. If I can dig it up, I'll post it to
the list along with a URL pointing to the text of his article (I'm
assuming the folks at Analog can recognize an ally when they see one and
wil not sic their lawyers at me).

You miss the point of Russell's Paradox.  The barber must not shave himself
to *any least* degree, and yet, as a man of the region, is obliged by law
to be shaved - and nobody else is permitted to shave him (the iff). The
paradox arises in the self-reference loop from the whole sentence back to a
part of the sentence.  Fuzzy doesn't apply.

Something has been bothering me for some time...perhaps there are list members
who are more versed in the approriate areas of knowledge and can help me out.

It concerns dinosaurs.

To the best of my knowledge the elephant is today's largest land animal.
Supposedly ther were much larger critters in the past.  However...what
concerns me is the strength to weight ratio.  

I've been lead to beleive that due to it's size an elelphant is different from
all other land animals is some regards...for instance.  It cannot run.  I can
walk...REALLY fast...but it isn't the same as a gallop of other four legged
critters.  Also an elelphant can't jump...the only land animal which can't.
All this is purportedly due to it's minimal strength to weight ratio.  Not the
strength of it's muscels...which is awesome.  But the strength of it's
"building materials"...calcium bones...etc.  ...which are approaching "design"
limits.

If this is true.   Then it appears to me that the dinosaur hypothosis has a
problem.

Also the MegaFauna.

Does anyone have any ideas on this subject?

  IAN: I believe that we could say that L (libertarianism)
  is the intersection of U (utilitarianism) and M (me first), 
  as such (using squares to define sets rather than circles): 

           ______
        U |   ___|___
          |  |   |   | M
          |  | L |   | 
          |  |   |   |
          |  ----|----
          --------

  Some of M is outside L and U, and some of U is out-
  side L, as you note above. So I think this is it. ?

‚` FRussell's paradox "Set M which does not contain itself" is the third
valued proposition which is neither true nor false.

If set M which does not contain itself contain[s] itself, set M is not set
M. If set M which does not contain itself does not contain itself, then set
M is set M. So If set M contains M, set M is not element of set M, and then
if set M does not contain M, set M is element of set M. This means that Set
M is composed of two dual implications between contradictory propositions. 

Let p= "M is not element of M".If not p, then p, and, if p, then not p.
then p Ìnot p. 

Because this set M is contradictory to the true statement and the false
statement, and has to be expressed by a dual implication between two
contradictory statements, this set M is assigned the third truth value
which is contradictory to "the true" or "the false". There might not be
comprehensible proposition as an example of the proposition with the third
truth value any further.

The third truth value is, at times, assigned to a possible proposition, and
at times, assigned to a recurrent propositions, and at times, assigned to a
moral proposition which has the political contents, and above all, assigned
to a paradoxical propositions. And, such a phenomenon overflows in the
world. The third truth value represents these paradoxical or reflexive or
recurrent or possible propositions which contain itself anywhere or
anything in it's propositions. 

Let p a possible proposition, p depend on q which is something immature or
future, but something q depend on a possible proposition p. 
Now, let {p=p(q)} p depend on q, then p=p(q) and q=q(p). So,
p=p(q(p(q.......... . 
Let q=-p. Then, p=p(-p(p(-p(p(-p...... . 
This is the symbolic expression of a possible proposition p and its dual
implication.

The statement of this symbolic expression are a possible proposition or a
recurrent proposition or a future proposition or moral proposition, etc. So
this type of proposition is natural events in our life. 

Note: Denial of this third valued proposition 

As these third valued propositions exist certainly, the denial of the third
valued proposition becomes logical problem. So this four valued logic
assumes this negative form of the third truth value to the fourth truth
value. Then, this four valued logic is able to have the law of
contradiction or excluded middles like 2-valued logic. This is the reason
that this logic is said the simplest expansion of 2-valued logic.

Now, THAT is cryptic!
I must say, Ian, that I find some of your posts to be somewhat
inaccessible, although, to be honest, I read very few of the posts on
this list, yours included. And you are certainly not the only person
on this list  whose posts share that quality.

I am curious, though, Ian, what do you do for a living? Are you an
artist? I visited your homepage, and found your artwork pleasing
enough, though I am aware that that quality is highly subjective.

Are you a cryonicist? Your website writings indicate that your
personal beliefs tend towards acceptance of, how can I say it, the
supernatural. That would be unusual for a cryonicist.

At any rate, I didn't mean that I would vote for any person that spoke his/her
mind just on that basis alone.  I mean that it would certainly be refreshing
to have candidates that didn't speak in scripted sound bites.  However I must
say that I do believe we get the sort of candidates we deserve in that we seem

  IAN: I don't think that the above is mysterious,
  occultic or most things that might be inferred
  from the term "cryptic." The post pertains to 
  expressing the categories stated as sets to
  define their exact relations to one another.
  Of course, not following the thread could 
  cause such a "cryptic impression." I do
  try to say the most I can with the least. 


>Are you a cryonicist? Your website writings indicate that your
>personal beliefs tend towards acceptance of, how can I say it,

  IAN: The Random House Webster's College Dictionary
  defines "supernatural" as "of, pertaining to, or being
  above what is natural or explainable by natural law."
  Also noted is occult, ghosts, Gods, deities... I don't
  believe I have promoted a belief in any thing that
  was above any or beyond any natural physical law. 

  Of course my holistic philosophy may be seen as 
  supernatural to believers in atomistic identity,
  even as they cannot support a view contrary to
  holism with a single item of physical evidence.
  I believe that atomist identity is supernatural.
  The identity that is what it is free from holistic 
  relation is even more fallacious than Gods and ghosts,
  since the later at least have existence in the mind,
  yet the free identity cannot even exist in the mind.

Are elephants really near the physical limits? Remember that the
limits of size of an animal also depends a lot on its geometry; a
two-legged creature cannot get as big as a four-legged one, and the
way the bones connect play a great role in the strength of the
structure.

(BTW, it is hard to call dinosaurs a hypothesis, since we do indeed
have their sizeable bones)

One minor quibble.  I think we have fossils of bones.  Not the same thing. As
far as composition is concerned.  I don't think

That ExI exists should alone provide proof that Extropians do not necessarily
oppose planned orders.  Rather, they emphasize the importance of spontaneous
orders as an underappreciated mechanism for increasing local extropy.  Such
advocacy does not denigrate planned orders.

Title
  Height and mortality in the counties of
  England and Wales [see comments].
Comments

  Annals of Human Biology.  17(1):1-6, 1990 Jan-Feb.
Abstract
  Average heights of adults and children in the counties of
  England and Wales were examined using national samples of people born between
  1920 and 1970. Although height increased over this 50-year
  period the differences between counties persisted. Average
  height in a county is closely related to its pattern of
  death rates, which were derived from all deaths during 1968-78. Counties with
  taller populations have lower mortality from chronic
  bronchitis, rheumatic heart disease, ischaemic heart disease and stroke, and
  higher mortality from three hormone-related cancers, of the
  breast, prostate and ovary. The inverse relation of height
  with bronchitis and cardiovascular disease is further evidence of risk
  factors acting in early childhood. The positive relation between
  height and cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate could
  suggest that promotion of child growth has disadvantages as well as benefits.

  IAN: Because your points are often so 
  cryptic, it's up to the reader to divine
  them from your words. So if not to raise 
  the issue of wires and TWA 800, I guess 
  your point was that "the system works"
  since as a subset of a multi-million 
  dollar cover-up of mass homicide,
  they found some chaffed wires.

  BTW, did you find one single item of 
  evidence to back up your claim that 
  "atomism helps make predictions"?

You quibble that we don't really have dinosaur bones?


Where is this leading?  Do you doubt that dinosaurs really could have
existed?  Do you doubt that fossils are really the remains of dinosaur
bones?  What "hypothosis" would you propose instead?

It appears that a closet creationist has infiltrated the extropian 
ranks.  Next, we'll hear that the world started in 6000 b.c. and that 
God buried fake bones with divinely doctored carbon-14 signitures in 
order to test our faith!

It's not "leading" anywhere.  I'm just wondering about the supposed gigantic
size of prehistoric critters.   If they got so big...why not big critters now?
And fossils are not bones...they are "rock deposits" which have replaced the
original bones.  The shapes the same...but nothing else.  ARe the fossile
bones made from the same material that present day bones are?  How do we know?

Perhaps hypothesis was an incorrect word to use...perhaps I should have said
theory.

But back to my original question?  Is T-Rex possible...from a materials
"strenght to weight ratio" assuming it was composed of calcium bones...and
similar muscels, ligaments etc. as are present day critters?

If not...then what are the fossils?

If so....then why not similarly large critters now?

Yes.  Elephants push the limit of elephant construction, just as any animal
gently pushes the limit of it's construction.  Waste does poorly in natural
selection.  If elephants had a larger portion of their mass in bone, they
could be much larger - but at their present size that would be a waste, so
they don't have it.

>If not...then what are the fossils?
>

Well, there are some - in the sea.  Whales are by far the largest creatures
every to have lived.

At present we really don't know much about the advantages and disadvantages of
size.  Some of the Eocene mammals were far larger than an elephant.  Since
the Eocene, I think mammoths have been as big as they get.  This is just one
of those situations where we know a fact but cannot explain it.  It happens.

Oops!  Why "supposed" gigantic size?  You keep saying that you're not
leading this thread anywhere, but then you also keep slipping in clues
that you really don't believe in dinosaurs.  You seem to already have
decided that dinosaurs never really existed.

ABC News Special Report: Sex, Drugs And Consenting Adults

Airdate: Tuesday, May 26, 10:00

http://www.abcnews.com/onair/specials/index.html

"Liberty. What does that word mean?" Those questions begin ABCNEWS
Correspondent John Stossel's one-hour examination of laws against vice and
immoral behavior. With roots in both Puritanism and radical individualism,
America has always wrestled with the meaning and limits to freedom. In
"Sex, Drugs, and Consenting Adults" Stossel talks with Americans who say
that people should only be jailed if they directly harm other people's
personal property. 

The report features the views of prostitutes, pot smokers, gamblers, ticket
scalpers, euthanasia defenders, and others who feel that the law unfairly
restricts what we can do with our own bodies and our own lives. Police,
medical ethicists, and government officials, on the other hand, defend the
laws in the name of morality, safety, and community standards. 

----------------------------
Put this one on your calendars and spread the word:

John Stossel's ABC News Special

"Sex, Drugs and Consenting Adults"
Tuesday, May 26, 1998 10:00 pm

Examines the question: "Should adults be imprisoned for acts that do not
physically harm the person or property of nonconsenting others?"

Joe, Ev has been on this list for a long while. As far as I know, he's
always raised interesting questions and has always been extremely good
at dialogue and discussion, as opposed to rancor, rehetoric, and
name-calling. (I suspect from his background that he can be extremely
effective at name-calling if he chooses to be.)
He does not try to put words into other people's mouths
and then riducule those words. He has an interesting and pragmatic
point of view and is generally a solid reasoner. When he asks a
question, it's usually a good one. This question, concerning
allometry as applied to dinosaurs, is in fact valid. In general,
It is counterproductive to denigrate someone's post if you don't
understand what the person meant by the question. It just upsets
everybody without actually contributing to the discussion. A better
approach is to ask for a clarification. 

I assumed that Ev is asking whether or not we actually know the
microstructure of dinosaur bones.

AN elephant's bones are near the tolerance limits for those bone designs using
those bone materials. A Giraffe exerts much more stress on its neck bones than
an elephant does on any of its own. That a giraffe's neck is engineered like a
cantilevered truss is much more of a natural engineering feat than the shock
absorbing capabilities of the elephant. The reason why dinosaurs that we know
popularly (most were actually quite small) are so big is that they developed at
a time when all or most of the continents were part of the Pangea super
continent. Studies have shown that there is a direct correlation between the
evolved sizes of animals and the size of the land mass which they inhabit. For
example the wooly mammoth, of which frozen remnants have been found in the
tundra of Siberia, which was larger than the elephant, and carried much more
mass in its tusks than current elephants, as it was slowly killed off by post
ice age man, the last refuges in which its fossils were found to have lived most
recently ( from what I've heard as recently as 4000 BC) were small islands in
the arctic ocean north of Finland. As their food supply was restricted by the
size of their domain as it was cut off from the mainland by rising seas, they
slowly evolved into a 'mammoth' of only 3 or 4 feet in height.

	Also, it should not be forgotten that the larger, brontosaur types 
had the same advantage as whales; contrary to Jurrasic Park, their 
bulk was buoyed by the water in which they spent most of their 
lives.

According to the best current theories, there are indeed times -- at the 
subnuclear level at least -- when the truth itself is fuzzy.

And sometimes because the language contains embedded assumptions, or 
because the speaker is making assumptions -- which may or may not have 
been declared, or even be readily apparent.  (For an example, there are several 
embedded assumptions in the word "murder".)

And then there are true statements which seem false -- and vice versa -- 
because the language encourages dichotomies where reality is a spectrum.

And of course there are also occasions where the truth is not fuzzy, but our 
ability to percieve and measure the truth is fuzzy.

In a previous mssg in response to this I said:


<<<This is beginning to annoy me...>>>

<<<RTFQ...read what I said..          >>>

{more in sadness than in anger}

I apologize for that last...

<sigh>  It is a time honored tradition that if a question is asked...or a
message is delivered which is uncomfortable...then ignore the question or the
message and ridicule or attack the one who asked or delivered it. .
Politicians have honed this to a fine art. Witness our current occupent of the
oval office.

Still...it's sad to see such tactics as ridicule, straw men...and name calling
in response to perfectly sincere questions and speculation on this list.

<digging in heels...gonna be a looooooong fight>

First.

Hypotheses: 

Given a collection of facts, data, etc.  A hypothesis is an attempt to order
that information in such a way that is logical and explanatory.

Theory:...an hypothesis that has survived the test of time.

A theory can not be proved...it can only be disproved.  And if inconvient and
contradictory facts, or data become apparent the theory (hypothesis) must be
modified to accomodate the new info......or thrown out and replaced with
something else.
.....
Quibble.  A fossile is NOT a bone.  It is a replica of a bone.  Similar to a
plaster cast.  Some things can be determined from a replica...some things
cannot.  For example...a plaster  replica of a steel beam would tell us very
little about the tensile strength of that beam...merely it's shape.

The question still remains.

Knowing what we know of materials strength as applied to strength to weight
ratio...and using the modern day elephant as an example...is it reasonable to
assume that dinosaurs could reach such tremdous sizes and weights as is
popularly beleived?

I see nothing in that question which presupposes creationism....or any other
ism.

It's more than tolerated, it's demanded , a public official who did not 
behave in the standard way would be severely punished by the voters. 
Politicians act in an entirely  logical way, and there is a very good reason 
they're hypocritical, it gives them a survival advantage in the struggle for 
political existence. A mutant politician who had a tendency to speak of 
unpleasant truths, even if only on  rare occasions, would have a sever
handicap and be politically dead by the next election. Voters would rather 
hear pious lies, even if they know full well they are lies. I'm reminded of 
the time President Carter in a unguarded moment foolishly said that although 
he had never been unfaithful to his wife he had "lusted in my heart many 
times"; his popularity in the polls dropped 10% overnight. A good politician 
knows that if he wants to thrive in his ecological niche he must swear on a 
Bible that in his entire life he had never, ever, not ever for one second, 
looked at any woman in a sexual manner, except perhaps for his wife. Nobody 
will believe him but everybody will vote for him.
          

        >I am told repeatedly that "that's the way the world is", but I rather 
        >think that if fewer people accepted that BS answer, then the world 
        >wouldn't be that way...  but then, that takes effort and thought.  
        >Something most people seem loathe to engage in....
          

Voters are being quite logical also, the probability that their vote will 
change an election is so small that it would be foolish to waste time 
studying the issues, and you're not voting on issues anyway, you're voting 
for people and their promises, what they will actually do once elected is 
anybody's guess. It would be far more rational to spend that time lobbying
politicians for special favors, such as declaring your competition to be 
illegal and putting them out of business. It didn't take Netscape long to 
figure that out, Microsoft for all their skill in other areas was very naive 
in politics, they're only learning now how to play ball with Washington and 
it may be too late.

That theory was popular until about 1970, but very few believe it anymore.  
I doubt if brontosaurs spent more time in water than you or I do. The more 
extreme form of the theory, with them walking on a lake bottom with only 
their head above the surface is certainly wrong, the pressure on their lungs 
would be so much greater than the pressure at their head that it would be
impossible to breath. Whales don't have long necks so they don't have that 
problem.

Nutrition and Cancer 30(2): 163-166 1998

"Retardation of Experimental Tumorigenesis and Reduction in DNA Adducts by
Tumeric and Curcumin"

Abstract:

   Tumeric and its active principle curcumin have been extensively
investigated for their antimutagenic and antioxidant effects in bacteria
and animal systems. Because oral cancers are common in India, an
experimental model of 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene-induced buccal pouch
tumors in Syrians Golden hamsters was used to evaluate the tumor
retardation effects of turmeric and curcumin. Turmeric and/or curcumin was
administered in the diet and/or applied locally for 14 weeks along with
7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene. After the experimental period, the animals
were sacrificed and oral pouches were examined for tumor number and size.
DNA adducts were estimated by 32P postlabel assay in the cheek pouches.
Neoplastic changes were graded by histopathology. The results of the study
suggest that turmeric or curcumin in the diet and/or applied locally
significantly reduced DNA adducts at the target site. Tumor number and
tumor burden were significantly lower (p<0.05) in the animals that recieved
tumeric in the diet and applied locally. The histopathological examinations
suggested that the neoplastic grading was least in the animals fed or
painted with curcumin (p<0.05). The current study demonstrates that
turmeric or curcumin administered in the diet or applied as paint may have
a plausible chemopreventive effect on oral precancerous lesions.

Additional note:

   The dietary dosage used was 1% for turmeric, and 0.03% for curcumin,
which is the yellow pigment in tumeric.  A human consuming about 2500
calories daily of the rodent chow would ingest roughly 6 grams of turmeric
or 200 mg of curcumin.

Well, the fossils are consistent with the smaller ones, and what other
reasonable
hypothesis exists to explain them?? Ever been to Dinosaur National park in
Utah,
with that stone wall filled with hundreds of fossils?? And a thigh bone
about a foot
in diameter and 6 feet tall? Impressive....

Yes, but this is different in that the truth is "fuzzy" in a very specific
way; even the truly random is just that: TRULY random.

Attention New York area Objectivists:

I am posting Don Hauptman's newsflash and review of Ayn Rand's play that 
is running in Manhattan through May 29th.
**************************************
OBJECTIVIST THEATER ALERT!

        NEW YORK, 21 May 1998 -- Today, a friend phoned to inform me that 
Ayn Rand's play "Think Twice" is being staged by an off-off-Broadway 
company on Theater Row. I didn't think twice, but rushed exactly 20 
blocks south to see the show before its brief run ends.

        "Think Twice" is no "Atlas Shrugged," but it does have its 
moments. An intellectual murder mystery in the tradition of Rand's "Night 
of January 16th," it has an ingenious concept and some surprising twists. 

        The problem is that it takes a long time to get there. In the 
meanwhile, there's a lot of melodrama and emotional outbursts in a style 
that now seems dated. In addition, expect the creaky machinery that's 
inevitable in a whodunit, where a lot of dialogue and exposition is 
required to give everyone a motive for the crime. Some scenes appear a 
bit silly. All of which may explain why the play is so rarely done. 
("First time on the New York stage," boasts the show's flier.)

        Although "Think Twice" would be easy to burlesque, the director 
and the company play it straight--fortunately. (Some minor male 
characters were recast as female, which didn't appear to affect the 
integrity of the production.) The performers are all pros and are 
generally quite good. Occasionally, you even get a sense of the 
characteristic Randian hero. Everyone involved deserves credit for 
carrying off a complex production on a stage the size of a postage stamp.

        The show is at the Pulse Ensemble Theater, 432 West 42 St., 
between 9th and 10th Avenues. The gala opening was May 13th (who knew?), 
but a week of performances still remain: Friday, May 22, and next Tuesday 
through Friday, May 26-29, all at 8 PM.

It's your call.  I would like to see how the Ayn Rand Institute and the
Institute for Humane Studies runs these contests so we don't have to
reinvent the wheel.

We will also need to raise money and decide on categories -- like
cryonics, space colonization, nanotechnology, the Singularity(ies),
uploading, &c.

Be reasonoable.  Surely you must know of the classic battle between the
theories of evolution and creationism to explain these fossils.  If you
keep supplying evidence to discount one, you appear to be supporting the
other.  Why does this suprise you?  Unless you are referring to a third
theory that the rest of us have not heard about?

This seems like a rather biased & unsubstantiated opinion. Naturally,
we feel that the accomplishments of humans are significant compared to
other organisms, and we certainly do build bigger structures. OTOH, I
could change it into "animals procreate, and some may achieve pleasure
from doing so, but only human females are truly attractive."
And, who knows, a beaver, after utting the finishing touches on his
dam, might think to himself "now that is one GREAT dam!"
[not that I think that beavers think that way, only that we have no
way of knowing]

I think, in order to process this, I would need to have some sort of
ballpark definition of "greatness"

The Great Pyramid is sometimes atributed to Khufu on the flimsiest of
evidence; there is considerable debate on this point.
Would Khufu still be great if he had nothing to do with it?
Is the fellow who actually built it (hypothetically) but never
recognized for his achievement great?

What if Homer turned out to be several people- or several thousand
storytellers who each added a piece over time? Would they all be Great?
Is Achilles Great?
[or, Achilles is great if he existed. if he didnt, then Homer is great
for inventing him, or if what is attributed to Homer is in fact the
work of many men, all of whom are great.]
And what if I think that the pyramids are just a bunch of big rocks,
or that the Illiad sucks- does that mean that they arent great *to me*?

[BTW- saw an excellent documentary on Discover the other night on how
weathering patterns on the Sphinx indicate that it has undergone
considerable weathering from rain- and it hasnt rained heavily ont he
Giza plateau since 6000BC, indicating that the Sphinx may be 8-10,000
years old]

Ron

PS Not that I disagree, actually. It seems to me that something
divides men from animals- but I prefer to think of it as internal. If
Khufu strove against the world to achieve something, then that is my
idea of greatness- succeed or fail, even if his work doesnt outlast
him physically. Or maybe we agree on this?

Yes, the engineer behind this pyramid is the artist and visionary! IF
there were 30 engineers, so what! The accomplishment, the feat, is the
sign of there greatness.

As Warrl kyree Tale'sedrin just put it, "our ability
to perceive and measure the truth is fuzzy". And, I
believe this is always so except for tautologies and
axiomatic truths such as "I think therefore I am" and
"there are other minds" and "there really is a world
of objects out there that I can bump into". 
Stringing these together, we might even come up with
the 'Absolute Truth' that "I think there are other
minds out there that I had better be careful about
bumping into". 

If you pressed them, I doubt that even the most
relativistic radical would argue with these 'truths'.
 So, everyone has an ontological sense of truth, even
if they don't always admit it.  The part that people
argue about is when it comes to epistemology and that
particular slice of Reality they happen to be focused
on (the sky is blue, you say, well, define sky...)

What I really wanted to mention, though, was that
there's currently a discussion on another list that
is mentioning some of the same topics that have come
up here, in a slightly different context; namely,
F.Hayek's theory of mind and liberty.

In particular, Erik Davis (whose "thesis has proposed
a Hayek-Jung synthesis"), mentions Chris Sciabarra's
_Marx, Hayek and Utopia_ and claims that "'bootstrap'
theories of mental processes--which Hayek often
associates with vulgar Marxism and which tend to
antagonize or neglect the tacit dimension--go hand in
hand with totalitarian-utopian political theories".
(See
http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/CGI/wa.exe?A2=ind9805&L=hayek-l&F=&S=&P=13082).
 Davis adds:

"For example, Marxists of various sorts have tended
to see unintended/unconscious (and therefore tacit)
social-systemic processes as something to be
overcome--something unfavorable.  This is why in the
New Left one finds a synthesis of Marxism and
Freudianism, because Freudians also saw the
unconscious (and its tacit dimension) as  something
to be overcome--something unfavorable."

Michael Polanyi explained how tacit knowledge was
essential to personal knowledge.  Hayek explained how
this kind of "fuzzy truth" was also essential to the
functioning of a free society.  As Hayek puts it in
"The Use of Knowledge in Society":
(see
http://www.virtualschool.edu/mon/Economics/HayekUseOfKnowledge.html)

"The peculiar character of the problem of a rational
economic order is determined precisely by the fact
that the knowledge of the circumstances of which we
must make use never exists in concentrated or
integrated form but solely as the dispersed bits of
incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge
which all the separate individuals possess...

"Today it is almost heresy to suggest that scientific
knowledge is not the sum of all knowledge. But a
little reflection will show that there is beyond
question a body of very important but unorganized
knowledge which cannot possibly be called scientific
in the sense of knowledge of general rules: the
knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and
place."

This is why the notion of Absolute Truth seems
dogmatic and counter-productive to me.

Mark Crosby

due to weather, etc...

  IAN: Hay, we're making progress! Now you 
  need to show what in physics supports your
  claim that atomism helps make predictions.

  Can you name any physical attribute of any 
  thing, A, such as weight, size, velocity,
  color, that is assigned to A free from 
  not-A. Since your so sure that such 
  non-holism exists, this should be 
  as easy knocking off one liners.
  Just show one example of atomism.

  So how about putting your money where
  your keyboard is and back up your claim
  with something more than another claim.

  curcumin reduced the rate of colon cancer

  The outcomes were very impressive.
  I take curcumin about every day.

How about this...  I have a piano in one corner of a room.  Not the
piano is a particular shape - the room minus the piano.  I move it
to the other side of the room.  The piano is still the same.  Not
the piano is a different shape.  I move the piano into a different
room - not the piano, with respect to the room, is again different.
The piano is still the same.  Yeah?

Or similarly, the numeral zero on the integer scale and the numeral
zero on the rationals are both the same - the integers are a subset
of the rationals after all.  However, not zero in either case is
different.

  IAN: No, because there is 0% of untruth in the 
  physical reality. The fact that what I believe you 
  refer to can be quantified as the uncertainty principle
  demonstrates the fact that truth itself is not fuzzy.

  If we can only measure the position or the momentum 
  of a subatomic particle but not both at the same time, 
  the "fuzziness" expresses only the degree to which our
  concepts can be mapped onto physical things, but the 
  things always are what they are by 100%, even if 
  what they are is both particle and wave. 

  The physical reality is truth, and as such, whatever 
  it is is what truth is. If it's random, chaotic, now
  this and then that, then that's what the truth is.
  Fortunately or not the truth is pretty reliable.

The current ice age might be a strong reason why the large creatures
are rare; the climate has varied a lot the last few million years, and
stable periods suddenly end (like when the current interglacial
began). A stable climate and environment favors specialization, and it
is possible to maximize one's food intake by specializing, giving the
resources to grow to a large size (which is advantageous in terms of
predator protection and most likely in other ways).

If you stand in the same spot in the room to observe the piano, then 
move the piano (no matter what the light will strike it differently, 
there fore you are wrong + you cannot place the piano in exactly the 
same place in another corner, the piano will rotate.

As a casual observer, your "holism" is trivial.  It proves nothing that
atomism does not, and makes no predictions that atomism would not.  All
you're saying is that A + -A = 0.  Add A to both sides and you get A = A,
the atomist prediction.  YOU'RE SAYING THE SAME THING.

Your presumption that A + -A = 0 somehow proves the mystical experience is
hogwash; the mystical experience is that A = -A because A = 0 and A- = 0. 
The mystical experience demands that all things are all things, not that
the sum of all things is zero. 

To show that the mystical experience holds true, you must show that 1 IS
0, not that the sum of the identity of 1 and not-1 is the same as the sum
of the identity of 0 and not-0 (which is trivially true), but that the
identity of 1 is equal to the identity of 0.  Similarly, showing that the
sum of the differences in location with respect to multiple objects is
zero is again trivial; the mystical experience demands that all such
values actually BE zero.  Same goes for time.

So, as an example of atomism working, I posit: everything holism predicts.

Excuse the cross-posting, but I found it revelant in all places.  Use of
yage relates to chaos magick, self transformation, and transhumanism in the
richest ways.

I would like to hear of anyone's experiences regarding the use of
Banisteriopsis Caapi (aka Ayahuasca & Yage).  I am particularly interested
in specific rituals / procedures that guide the experience in a meaningful
way or achieve some objective.

Thank you,

I appreciate the kind words Dan.

Yup...in a manner of speaking I was.  Several things prompted that line of
thought.  What I mentioned regarding elephants (which I'm not positive is
true)...as well as an article I vaugely recall in popular science some time
back.

It seems that a computer model was run on good ole T-Rex.  The results implied
that T-Rex was more of a walker than a runner....primarily because if he got
to moving too fast...and tripped...it would be fatal.  Falling down would snap
his neck like a dry twig.

So it appears that T-Rex might have been more of a buzzard than anything
else...

And I was wondering if any other similar interesting info was known?

And sure enough Micheal Lowery comes thru.

  IAN: Alas, a skillful counter, 
  thanks! But here's the holism:

  Change of piano location in room
  or rooms (C = change, 0 = no change):

            Shape   Location
   -Piano:    C        0
    Piano:    0        C

  Because the location of a thing is an
  identity attribute of it, the identity
  of the piano changes to the extent that
  its location changes; and, changing the 
  L of P changes the S of -P, which maps 
  the their holistic-identity structure.

  So long as a change to A scores any
  change to -A, we have mapped holism.
  In fact, a change to A that did not 
  result in a change to -A would still
  map holism!, since the "not-change" 
  is defined by the change. It seems
  to me that holism can never fail,
  and is thus an absolute truth.

  Notice that the location of -P refers 
  only to the empty space as defined by 
  P and the walls. The location of the 
  room and its walls could be said to 
  change by moving the piano around.

  IAN: I don't see how this applies. We have
  two things with one similar trait, 0. Each
  thing is defined as a "different thing" by
  relation to the other, and all members of 
  each thing are defined by their relations.

Yes, and it also includes other factors, like the geographic features that limit
an animals range beyond just oceans. Also a really effective big predator will
evolve when there is an oversupply of really big herbivores, yet if it is too
effective, it may kill itself off when it kills off its main food supply, or it
may evolve to be smaller if its constant effective predation restricts its main
food supply. As for the swimming or non-swimming status of brontos, which while
they may not have lived totally submerged, could easily have been merely waders.
Then again, there are plenty of ocean faring dinosaurs which were quite large and
had long necks, and were very nearly the size of brontosaurs.

Another factor lending to large body size is climate. In a cold climate, large
animals will tend to develop, since you have the ratio of body mass to surface
area in an animal changing drastically the larger you grow. A large animal retains
body heat in a cold climate much easier than a small animal. It is likely,
especially considering the cold-blooded and semi-cold blooded physiques of the
dinosaurs, that they grew in size to better retain body heat in a climate that was
slowly shifting toward the chilly side.

We can see this during the last ice age, when the woolly mammoth had grown to
almost twice the size of the present elephant, and we had the Cave Bear, a
creature several times the size of the largest grizzlies today, as well as the
Sabre Toothed Lion, which was twice the size of present day mountain lions.

Fair enough, but I suspect that most people would not include
the location of an object as part of its identity - they would
hold that the piano before and after movement was the same
piano; that the coin one picks up, and the coin one slips into
ones pocket are identical.

That you believe them to be different may account for the
difficulty many have in accepting your world view.

Steve.

Harvey, your statement is equivalent to saying "If you're against the
democrats, you must be a Republican." This is not a good mailing list
for that sort of assumption. This is my last post on the meta-subject
of what Ev meant. Now let's talk about allometry.

I just did an altavista search on "allometry" and got the following page:
     http://earth.ics.uci.edu/faqs/sauropods/sauropods-allometry.html

With the following title:
    Sauropods, Elephants, Weightlifters: Allometry 

This was a bit more specific than I was looking for!

Title
  Adult body height, self perceived health
  and mortality in the Swedish population.
Source
  Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health.  43(4):380-4, 1989 Dec.
Abstract
  STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to examine adult
  body height as an indicator of general
  health. DESIGN: The study was a survey of a randomly selected sample of the
  adult Swedish population obtained by the Swedish National Central Bureau of
  Statistics. PARTICIPANTS: The sample studied was identified in 1980-81 and
  comprised 14,757 persons aged 16-74. Of these, 12,695 (86%) consented to
  interview. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Information was obtained on adult
  height, socioeconomic status in childhood and adult life,
  self perceived health, self reported longstanding illness, and
  mortality during a six year follow up. The numbers of people
  in three height groups who considered their general health
  as bad, who reported any longstanding illness or who died during the follow
  up were compared with the expected numbers in the same groups. The number of
  persons with reduced health and the number of deaths was larger than expected
  in the shortest height group. The excess risk of dying in
  the shortest group (about 20% higher compared to the tallest group) was
  reduced but not eliminated when present and childhood socioeconomic group was
  taken into account. Coronary heart disease mortality in
  particular was linked to height. The shortest group of men
  and women reported the largest proportion with bad general health and
  longstanding illness. For the latter the differences between
  height groups disappeared after controlling for present
  socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: There is a detectable excess risk of
  morbidity and mortality from being short. Assuming that the
  childhood environment is an important determinant of adult stature it is also
  important for adult health.

  IAN: Yes! But the point is that what we assume is 
  atomism is in fact holism, and atomism NEVER exists.
  If we just say A = A or even just A, that letter is 
  defined by the area surrounding it, which is -A.

  Since there is never an instance of atomism, we cannot
  exactly say H = A only in that H always is and A never 
  is. The process of inquiry must discover what is and 
  what is not, and I posit that atomism always is not.

  Here "atomism" refers to the idea that identity is 
  atomized such that the identity of A comes only from 
  A and not from -A. I posit that such is never true.

  If I'm wrong, then show me atomism doing something.
  I believe it cannot be shown that atomism exits.



>Your presumption that A + -A = 0 somehow proves the mystical experience is
>hogwash; the mystical experience is that A = -A because A = 0 and A- = 0. 


  IAN: If identity is difference, then A = 0 and -A = 0,
  where each are differentiated from themselves, which 
  is to say that the difference between A and A = 0.

  If identity is difference, then A is A only by differ-
  entaiton from -A. Lo and behold, the sum of that rela-
  tion also = 0. We cannot segment that relation into 
  two separate parts without each becoming 0, and 
  yet together they are also 0... in sum. But
  that sum, or union, is what they are dictated
  by the fact that they cannot exist free from it.
  So the "mystical insight" is always the whole truth.

  IAN: Your analysis is one of the most skillful
  I've encountered and shows that you have a rare 
  level of comprehension of what I'm saying, wow!
  Most responses express only not-understanding.

  The showing of "all such values actually being 
  zero" is the fact that "self to self = 0," that
  is, that the difference/identity of A to A = 0,
  which holds for every thing. Each thing gets a 
  non-zero identity only by giving the opposite
  non-zero to another thing (or empty space) and 
  the sum of that relation is the same as the self
  to self relation. So there is never not-zero.

  Zero may also be defined as "symmetry."
  If there is asymmetry, it is what it is 
  relative to symmetry, and that's symmetry!
  So there can never be not-symmetry in all.


>So, as an example of atomism working, I posit: everything holism predicts.


  IAN: I think that your saying that if holism always
  is, such that there is no not-holism, this is atomism,
  i.e., there is H and H is H free from not-H. The short-
  fall in that counter is that "the whole" is no thing, 
  it is not a subset, not an atom. Atomism is the con-
  cept of a subset free from the whole. The whole is
  itself free, it sums to zero, since there is nothing
  to measure it against, it is a subset of no larger 
  or other thing. It is therefore an expression 
  of holism: if no not-A then A = 0.

Ah well...

You just blew out of the water my next post.

Dino's are somewhat subject to question...in my mind...but MegaFauna are
rather more specifically documented.  I beleive there ARE bones of those
critters still around...not just fossils of bones.

And if a Wooly Mammoth was twice the size of an elephant...ditto (cave bear,
and kitty kat)...then my speculation on tissue tensile strength and bone
compression strength just got blown away.

Too bad...

NOW THIS is more like it...

I've scanned that paper...shot my line of conjecture down in flames by the
way...oh well...win some loose some.

There is a GoldMine of information there by the way....in the paper plus the
WebSite in which it is located...

 <A HREF="http://earth.ics.uci.edu/">The Talk.Origins Archive: Home Page</A> 

Love it...Thanks Dan

(I might even find out what allometry is...helps to know the right words when
asking questions doesn't it?)

  IAN: If location is not an attribute of identity,
  then identity is non-local, if identity is non-
  local, then A = -A, which is to say that the 
  identity of A exists equally in all locations.

  If identity is local and defined by location,
  the identity structure of A is also non-local,
  since the whole, both A and -A, is what is 
  causing A to be A. It's the space and uni-
  verse around me that puts me where I am,
  therefore they are part of where I am.


        It is there that 
        makes here here
        and
        it is here that 
        makes there there


  http://www.erols.com/igoddard/is-not.htm 

  As for changing-location changing identity,
  location is one feature of identity. If A
  changes location fast, then A is fast.


        It is the fast that 
        makes the slow so slow
        and
        it is the slow that 
        makes the fast so fast


  If A is not changing, then A is static.
  What A is, is what the identity of A is.
  Virtually every physical quantity that 
  can be assigned to A are derived from 
  motion, which is location-changing,
  and all are identity attributes.

  A coin on the ground is not the same
  as one in pocket,  if only because 
  the one in the pocket has a great 
  potential energy than the one on 
  the ground, since it is lifted
  higher than the one on the ground.
  Every thing about A is derived from
  the relation of A to -A and all in -A.

I think we disagree as to what atomism signifies.  Atomism is making a
statement about the actual values on the identity diagram, rather than
about their sum.  For example, on your site you give two objects, A and B,
where B is one greater than A.  If I add 0 to this mix, we get the
following identity matrix:

    0   A   B
0   0  +1  +2
A  -1   0  +1
B  -2  -1   0

When atomism states that A can change independently of B, it means that it
changes relative to 0, and that this does not affect B relative to 0.  For
example, if A increases by three relative to 0, we get the new chart:

    0   A   B
0   0  +4  +2
A  -4   0  -2
B  -2  +2   0

That this change is possible is trivially true; that it is compatible with
atomism is also true.  Not even atomism claims that something can change
relative to itself, but rather that it changes relative to 0.  Note that
this does not affect B relative to 0 (+2), or 0 relative to B (-2), which
was all that atomism was trying to prove anyway.

Wait.  Stop there.  What I'm trying to say is that under the mystical
experience, the difference between 0 and 1 is zero, NOT that the sum of
the difference between 0 and 1 and the difference between 1 and 0 is zero. 
The latter is trivial; the former is mystical.

A mysticist's identity chart would look like this:

   0  1
0  0  0
1  0  0

or, since 0 = 1,

   0  1
0  1  1
1  1  1

or even

   0  1
0  1  1
1  0  0

That your other identity charts do NOT look like this indicates strongly
to me that the difference between 1 and 0 is 1, and that the difference
between 0 and 1 is -1.  Though these SUM to 0, my mystical identity charts
differ from your identity charts in a non-trivial way.  I assert that MY
identity chart is mystical, whereas yours is not.  :)

I should have been more specific; I mean that you must show that 1 is 0
relative to 0 in order to demonstrate mysticism, as per the identity
charts I drew earlier; anything less is simply the regular old physics we
know and love.

Er, *I* don't define 0 as symmetry, and I don't think it's valid to do so.
Sure, symmetrical things will sum to zero in the way you describe, but you
commit a fallacy of parts to say that just because two numbers sum to a
value that both are that value.  This is like saying that since 1 + 2 = 3,
1 = 3 and 2 = 3.  Clearly this is not true; but in the same way, if 1 + -1
= 0, you cannot say that 1 = 0.

On the contrary, I am simply saying that H = A, a conclusion which you

A smart and far-sighted architect is behind one of the ancient buildings (I don't 
recall which one).  The king ordered a monument in his own honor, so the 
pretty white limestone facing had his image, his name, and his achevements all 
over it.  But we don't know any of that, now, because that limestone facing 
eroded (or was stripped off for other uses) a long time ago.  On the other hand, 
we know all about the builder: *his* name, image, and achevements were 
engraved in the hard structural rock underneath the limestone.

If I had a time machine I wouldn't go back to watch the building of Khufu's  
Great Pyramid, I would go back 30 years earlier during the time of Khufu's 
father, Zoser, during the construction of the Step Pyramid, because then I 
could meet Imhotep, Pharaoh's engineer and the first great scientific  genius 
we can put a name on. Nobody knows who first tamed fire. 

Imhotep does not seem to have been of high birth, which makes the great  
respect he enjoyed even in his own lifetime especially significant, later 
generations made him a God of course. I'm sure his exploits were greatly 
exaggerated but I think there must have been an individual of extraordinary
ability around this time, a lot of brilliant things were happening and they  
don't look like the work of a committee to me. It's not easy to go from small 
mud huts to huge stone structures in one generation, but Imhotep figured out 
how to do it. The step Pyramid was the prototype, the builder of Khufu's 
Great Pyramid was just following the design and construction principles that 
Imhotep  established.

  IAN: A URL I've posted a few times to the list

  threatening that they may do something about it,

  the threat to alt.politics.libertarian. It seems
  to me that TWA 800 research is contraindicated 
  with respect to any life-extension program.

Soory it took so long to reply to this one, but I was making up HTML

And if I bought the info from someone who had bought it from someone who
had licensed it from you?  Then I'm not even an accessory; I'm one step
removed from any crime that took place.  I'm also not bound by any
contract to do anything for you; are you going to try to enforce terms on
a contract I didn't sign?

In addition, you get even worse problems when the merchant is also
anonymous.  Suppose I post through anonymous remailers and a mail2news

sends me the price of a copy in anonymous cash.  I don't know to whom I'm
selling, and they don't know from whom they are buying.  How are you going
to prosecute me THEN?

I disagree.  Normally I cannot enforce the terms on a contract upon
someone with whom I have not contracted; only through special IP laws is
this possible.

I think on some level one must cede this definition, at least on the point
that a copyright holder has a monopoly over copies of that particular
piece of information.

Yes, but it's that "almost" that would keep the market going, at much
larger quantities than before, at a far far lower price.  Water is almost
free, yet it sells regardless.  Since copies without IP laws are widgets,
the analogy is apt.

Beats me, but they do it anyway, and people DO put it up on their
web sites.  Trouble is, it's rather large; so large that it's often more
efficient to earn $50 and buy a CD than it is to spend your time
downloading Linux.  But nonetheless, it's available online, and yet the
CDs still sell.

Weird, isn't it?

Whenever the free market rations anything, it rations it to the rich and
to the exceptionally devoted.  Fortunately for us, the exceptionally
devoted are also in many ways the most productive.  So it's a trade off.
At any rate, if we gain economic efficiency as a result of this trade off,
it's a good thing.

I think you misunderstood my point.  Clearly, some of the decrease in
invention came from the lack of IP, but I think you'd be hard pressed to
argue that the planned economy had nothing to do with it.  I was asking
how one would go about discovering what part of the lost patents were due
to a planned economy and what part was due to a lack of IP.

Economic forecasting is not entirely unlike weather forecasting to that
extent.  However, fortunately for my argument, these are all macroecnomic
forecasts, not microeconomic forecasts.  My argument from microeconomic
efficiency is not affected by the failures of macroeconomic models.

The men who have done so have ALREADY won Nobel prizes; I stand upon the
shoulders of giants when I follow their work.  As to how I can determine
relative sizes without knowing the size of either shape, we use
calculus and the supply and demand graph to tell us a lot about economic
efficiency; for example, since monopolists represent the entire market,
their marginal revenue curve decreases twice as fast as the demand curve.
Since firms will produce up until the point where marginal revenue equals
marginal cost, the quantity produced by a monopolist will be less than
that produced in competition.

Unclear?  I've made graphs.
http://pantheon.yale.edu/~dgf4/monop.html

I've just demonstrated that the monopolist's quantity will be less than
that produced in competition, despite the fact that I don't know how many
would be produced in competition or how many the monopolist would produce,
verifying my earlier claim that I could find relative sizes without
knowing absolute sizes.

A priori, I cannot show that it would be cost effective to protect
software in a secure way; I can do so using market numbers, however. 
According to the Software Publishers Association, "Few other industries
lose as much revenue to theft, estimated at $13.2 billion; nearly 1 out of
2 copies of software is illegally installed."* In light of this, I find it
hard to believe that eliminating piracy would be unprofitable, even if it
is thanks to piracy in other countries. 

On the contrary, the reason software companies don't use this particular
scheme is that it wouldn't work:  Just set up a copier that emulates a
computer, that records the program rather than executes it, and you've got
a fully functioning warez machine.  Nintendo game copiers operate on
precisely this principle; if you weren't aware, there is a thriving warez
market for pirated Nintendo and Super Nintendo games, both of which come
on ROM chips soldered into the game cartridges.  A "tamper-proof" 
cartridge would do you no good: All I have to do is read the game off of
the cart, and I'm golden.

Beg your pardon?  By precisely how much will the incentive to invent
change?  My argument has been qualitative, arguing that the incentive to
invent would decrease, but not specifying absolutely by how much.  In
order to find an actual supply curve, we'd have to know absolutely how
much the incentive to invest would decrease.  How exactly do you propose
to do that?

The whole point of my argument is that all other factors would NOT be
equal: the market for copies would greatly expand if copyright were
eliminated, and not having to pay for enforcement would lead to a
non-trival income effect.  You can't just leave these out of your
calculations.

A PPA which tries to enforce contracts on those who have not agreed to
their terms will probably not be economically efficient; similarly, it
will be impossbile to catch your intended victims over the Internet when
they are selling anonymously.

Do you still have misgivings after looking at the analysis on my web site?

Again wrong.  Competitive disadvantage only takes place when MARGINAL
costs are higher, not when sunk costs are higher.  For an analysis of
this, look at: http://pantheon.yale.edu/~dgf4/incent.html

The cost of invention is sunk, which means that it doesn't change the
shape of the supply curve.  Competitive disadvantage only takes place when
your supply curve is higher than the other guy's supply curve, so this is
clearly not the case.  Instead, we see from the graphs that invention is
only profitable if the increased revenues from invention outweigh the sunk
cost of invention; this incentive is smaller than that under a monopoly,
but not zero.

True, but again, say you license to Alice who illegally sells a copy to
Bob. Bob has broken the law, but now suppose he sells a copy to Carol.  Is
Carol liable under the terms of a contract she's never signed?  Now what
if she sells a copy to me?  As you can see, you quickly reach a point
where it would be absurd to prosecute me under the terms of your contract:
I've never seen it, have never agreed to it, and am not obligated to do
anything to help you recover your loss; unless there are special IP laws
which require me to do so.

Similarly, if Alice sells me a copy anonymously over the Internet, and I
start reselling it anonymously, how will you ever catch me?

If I am correct about the economic efficiency of IP laws, then it is more
economically efficient NOT to recognize such a claim than it is to do so:
it would be costly to prosecute all of those people, espeically when they
use cryptography, and it would also destroy a thriving copy market without
adding enough to the incentive to invent to make this worthwhile.  And if
Friedman is right about PPAs not enforcing economically inefficient laws,
then PPAs won't hear such claims.

Er, no: I don't agree that IP law should be enforced on resellers, but
rather on those who broke the license in the first place; if this has
happened at all, I have not heard of it.

Mike..what about the effort needed to maintain that body heat through
eating?..I mean, doesn't it become more difficult to take in the needed amount
of calories to maintain oneself as the creature grows larger?  sort of a cycle
effect..the creature evolves larger to maintain heat, but then requires more
food to stay alive, which is in scarce supply in such regions?..

John K Clark praised Imhotep, and I gladly join in. He is one of those
rare universal geniuses that manage to combine several areas well -
beside being an architect/engineer he was also vizier and perhaps also
skilled in medicine (less evidence for that though). Other examples
might include Leonardo da Vinci (a bit lacking in the political arena,
but a great scientist/engineer/artist), Benjamin Franklin and
Archimedes.

The most interesting question is of course how to do to become as
great and general as them. Any ideas?

   IAN: "A" changes relative to 0 as 0 changes
   (taking on the attribute of -4) relative 
   to A... this is holism. Also B does change
   after A changes: before, B was the largest
   entity, then it became the smallest entity. 

   The relation of B to 0 is constant just as 
   the relation of me in my moving car is con-
   stant. This "constant" is constant as derived
   by relation from something that is not-constant,
   such as the area outside my car that is changing.

   If atomism is defined as A, where the identity of
   A is derived from A, but not both A and -A, then
   no example of atomism has been evidenced. The ob-
   servation that A does not change relative to a
   non-changing relation is trivial and not atomism.

   IAN: To sum the parts is to define the whole.
   The mystical experience defines the whole and
   the whole relation of A to -A. To prohibit the
   summing is to prohibit the mystical insight.

   If we wish to prohibit the summing, we are nega-
   ting the holistic relation it defines. To negate 
   that relation is to define A relative to A, and 
   the differential relation of A to A = 0. So the 
   "not summing" where A = 0 you call the mystical 
   insight is true, for "not sum" is not-holism,
   or: the relation of A only to A.

  IAN: All the identities you cite, 1, 2, and 3 are 
  what they are relative 0, as you agree.  The nature 
  of this relation is symmetrical summing to zero. The
  mystical insight defines the whole, or the sum, of 
  the relations of all things among themselves.

I enjoyed your speculation, and it caused us to discuss some neat stuff.
recall our earlier posts on creativity. You probably have hundreds
of creative thoughts a day, nearly all of which are garbage. A few
get past the initial filter for further consideration, and most
of even these don't pan out.

Allometry is the study of ratios as applied to acaling of systems,
more or less. The major early work was "On Size and Life" I think.
You/ve probably seen at leat one reference to it, in Hienlien's
book "The Glory Road", he notes the disproportionate size
ot the legs of the giant rats, and reers to the "square-cubed law",
which is an important allometric result. (And an oversimplification.)

Yes, it would be naive to limit politics to the two main parties.  I
must be naive in this area.  I still know of only two theories to
explain dinosaur fossils.  One is evolutionism which says there were
real dinosaurs existed before humans and that left behind bones which
fossilized into what we have now.  The other theory is creationism which
says God created the world for humans, and that dinosaurs never really
existed before humans.

I'm sorry for being so naive, but what other theories are there?

In response to EVMicks question about dinosaur bones and what they
are actually made of, I called Chicago's Field Museum yesterday.

One of the staff paleontologists explained that although the bones
due undergo some mineralization due to water penetrating the very
porous surfaces they are in fact, bone.

The bones of Sue the T-Rex are so well preserved in fact that there
is hope to recover DNA from fossilized marrow. (this has already
been accomplished other places with other specimens).

Chicago may get a little too cold for a Jurrasic park.... ;)

Another interesting point for EVMick, the histology (structure) of
dinosaur bones is between that of large mammals and birds, in other
words they are more porous especially toward the outer third of the
bone and therefore considerably less dense that those of modern
mammals.

It is also believed by some that they were muscled more like birds
rather than mammals, being lighter still.

Others have already pointed out the "range" argument. Some wooly
mammoths survived till about 7 thousand years ago on and island off
Siberia as I recall, but due to the decreased range, they shrunk
till they were 4-5' high.  Interesting.

Apparently there are pygmy mammoth skeletons found on the channel islands
off the coast of Santa Barbara, CA, near where I live.  Supposedly the
mammoth survived there until they were hunted to extinction by the
Chumash Indians a few thousand years ago.

Yup...vaugely remember that...I've read all of Heinleins stuff...but it's been
a while.

SO!  Dino's were in fact strong enought to exist in a one G field...

And I had SUCH a neat argument about a neutronium asteroid hitting earth..
causing the extinction...and increasing the earths gravity...

Oh well.

>From various news sources:

Susan Terebey of the Extrasolar Research Corporation (Pasadena, California)
and her team of astronomers, utilizing the Hubble Space Telescope have
announced the sighting of an object that they believe to be a young planet.
The object was found and photographed within a star-formation region within
the constellation Taurus, about 450 light years from Earth.  The object is 2
to 3 times the size of Jupiter and seems to have been ejected 130 billion
miles from the two stars that produced it, in a sort of 'slingshot'
gravitational force.

More photographs will be taken in an attempt to determine whether the object
is indeed a young planet or a dwarf star.

Being in receipt of stolen goods is a crime no matter what your relationship or level of knowledge about its
source or the merchant you purchase it from. This is why art collectors who are now in posession of artwork
stolen from Jews by Nazi's and sold through middlemen can have their 'posessions' simply seized, as it was not
theirs, nor was it owned by the person who sold it to them.

In any event you DID sign a contract when you bought the illegal information from an anonymous seller: you waived
the seller, recognised that the seller made absolutely no guarrantees as it its accuracy, validity, or origin.
I.E. you bought into the implied caveat emptor contract that goes with any commercial trade as a base of
understanding.

a) Your customers, if caught with the illegal copies in their posession, will be arrested and prosecuted. Their
arrest and prosecution will be publicized in the media, thus generating a deterrent effect in the public that
will impinge upon your ability to do business.

b) nothing is totally anonymous. Anything on the net can be traced. As for your arguments about the cost of
enforcement, I can also say that the internet also gives IP enforcement agencies the ability to greatly reduce
the cost of IP enforcement, at least in regards to web commerce. I think that these costs will be reduced enough
that it will totally offset, and then some, your imagined 'efficiency' of having no IP.

If the person with whom you have contracted violates their contract with someone else with whom they contract,
and that third party passes along the information to a fourth party via another contract, the responsibility is
carried over.

You cannot enforce the terms of your contract with someone who has never come in contract with a party within
your contract chain. ANyone else can be bound.

But you are talking about a market. Markets are not markets of brand names, but of product types. The cola market
is not the Coca-Cola market, or the Pepsi market, but the cola market. Both have different recipes for cola,
which are protected by patent, both compete to satisfy the public demand for colas with different products. You
cannot say that Coca-Cola has a monopoly on the cola market. Thus my assertion that a patent is not a monopoly
stands.

So you are for treating IP as a commodity. Any commodity market is going to trend toward an oligopoly situation,
as economies of scale push smaller producers out or up in the market. Why is this? Because in the case of
internet commerce, bandwidth is discounted for large users, and hardware like servers, routers, drive systems, CD
writers, etc. are all cheaper on a per kilobyte basis the larger capacity you go.

In this scenario, the small home grown inventor is discouraged from becomeing a player in the market, unless they
are a rich bachelor who expects to get ripped off by the big boys, playing it off as if they are great
philanthropists, humantarians, etc..., or ulness the home grown inventor sells out to the established players in
the market. You are not encouraging a free market, but encouraging oligopoly/mercantilism.

Yes it is weird, but your numbers for the present market are not worth extrapolating from as it still is less
than 0.1 % of the market, yet even if LINUX catches on in the market beyond the hobbyist or iconoclast, companies
like Red Hat will not make any decent level of revinue, until one of the established companies, like Microsoft,
comes along and modifies the OS into something which it can protect, LinOS II. They then will promote this, and
soak up the entire market, putting Red Hat out of business, or back in the hat closet.

It would be a good thing. However I think that your expectation is wrong, and even if it does gain efficiency, it
will be because the commodity market for IP pushes invention supply into an oligopoly situation, which any self
proclaimed libertarian free marketer should abhor.

Considering that the economy is still pretty planned, with most industry still in the hands of Communist party
apparatchiks, I think that a) most of its economic growth is from externalization of western IP costs via
pirating of foreign owned IP properties, and the rest is b) from internal IP that is owned by state industries
and enforced by party apparatchiks with connections with police or army authorities, or c) small consumer
businesses, mostly in the service industries, that are privately owned.

yet you claim with a wave of your hand that nicroeconomic efficiency is beneficial for the macro economy without
showing HOW it benefits the macro economy, WHO in the macroeconomy truly benefits, and refuse to measure the
effect in the macro economy of the disincentive to invent on the rate of invention, and reduction in productivity
that results from stagnated technological development.

I would love to see links or book refs to anything that shows that you can determine the relative size of two
shapes without knowing the quantitative size of either shape. Sounds like magic to me.

Yet you show no quantified relative size. Also, since you only count marginal costs, not fixed costs, your chart
is absolutely meaningless, especially in an IP marketplace, where almost all costs are fixed costs (i.e. R&D),
while the marginal costs of reproduction are nil. Additionally, your measure of efficiency, i.e. the quantity
made available in the marketplace, is wrong. The efficiency differential  is measured as the change in price
times the change in quantity.

In addition, you also only use straight lines in your graph, which any microeconomist can easily tell you are
simplistic and inaccurate of a real market. The demand, cost and monopolist market line all will tend to be
S-curves of one degree or another, depending on the product, the state of the art at that time, consumer
confidence and utility, etc. In a market with such S-curves, the efficiency gained can be reduced or amplified
over your straight lined graph, depending on how the lines intersect.

Because it is thanks to piracy in other countries, it is unprofitable. Since a piracy enforcement agency, whether
a government or a PPL, cannot operate in a monopoly state jurisdiction without the expressed approval of that
state monopoly, and must operate within the legal guidlines set by that jurisdiciton, any state that wishes to
shelter piracy can make it unprofitable to enforce IP rights. Just as most terrorism and guerrilla warfare is not
successfull without the shelter and support from states outside the zone of conflict, IP piracy is only sucessful
with the direct participation, shelter and support of state monopolies.of power. Dont' make me label you a
pro-statist.

And it is just as easy to have programs written on a CD which automatically run when the CD is accessed. This is
how viruses get away with their mischeif. While AV software may be able to wipe a virus on a floppy, a) on a CD
there is plenty of room for multiple copies to watch over each other, and b) a CD cannot be overwritten that
easily.

It can be measured by the percentage of patents issued which are brought to market with the help of measureable
capital investment. Since capital invested in such a risk investment will demand a given return on that
investment, if the total on investment is reduced by the lack of IP protection to the point that the given rate
of return on investment demanded by the capital market will dictate that the amount of money an inventor can
raise from investors for a given invention will decrease below the point required to bring the given invention to
market, then the inventor will not bring that particular invention to market. I don't have any data right now, so
I am not making any blind guesses (unlike you).

And I say that since the supply of inventions will contract markedly, your pricing will not change much, until
consumer demand outstrips supply, due to population growth and limited resources, and no change in resource
utilization efficiencies do to stagnated tefhnological growth. At which point you will have inflation and
economic stagnation.

Yet any web server/router/backbone owner will have a contract with an insurance company to protect their assets,
especially if they have capital leins on the equipment. In a libertarian world, any sane insurance company will
require that the network asset owner subject himself/herself to the authority of their contracted PPL. Most or
all PPLs will have interlocking contracts of enforcement. Thus you will be able to track anyone on the net that
vilates your IP contract, and you are covered by your IP protection clause in your insurance policy. Anyone you
license your property to will have to subject themselves in your license agreement to ajudication and enforcement
of your self licensed IP rights, ergo your PPL can do a network audit on your customers networks, on their ISP
routers, etc. In an internet world, the cost of IP enforcement will go down remarkably.

Simplistic, basic microeconomic charts, any skilled economist will tell you, have ABSOLUTELY NO RELATION to any

No I see a serious retardant effect on technological advancement due to piracy losses. It is causing a serious
amount of lagging between advances in hardware and advances in software, which is why we have such bloat
problems. If software IP were effectively enforced, productivity gains around the world would skyrocket, and we
would be bringing the singularity that much closer to reality. Killing off IP protection will kill any hope of
acheiving the singularity.

Since customers are implicit conspirators in the piracy of the products they buy, they are as guilty as the
original theives.

Gentlemen, you have been discussing IPR for some time now and
are beginning to refine the discussoin somewhat. However, you
still appear to be repating yourselves to some extent, and
perhaps spending a little bit of time on rhetoric instead
of discussion. Still, It's a good debate. At this point however,
I'd really appreciate it if you could develop a brief consensus
statement, describing what you agree on, what you disagree on,
and the relevance to the future in general and to extropy in
particular.

It appears that you agree that:
   --the IPR issue is important
   --It's appropriate to discuss this in terms of private law
     (PPA's, PPL's, and contracts
   --There are IP enforcement costs
   --there are IP enforcement benefits

It appears that the crux if the disagreement is primarily in
terms of the costs and benefits.

There appears to be a secondary(?) disagreement on appropriate
measurement.

Perhaps you should each list your ideas of the costs and the benefits,
First just name them, and then try to analyze them. I would be
able to follow the debate more easily if you started with an
agreed-upon list of disagreements before you continue the debate,
but I realize I'm asking for a lot.

Thanks.

Sure.  And atomists will gladly concede that.  Newtonian physicists
agree that all motion is relative to something; all atomism is trying to
say is that the relation of B to our arbitrarily defined 0 does not change
when the relation between A and 0 changes.  This is really a trivial
point, and one with which I happen to know that you don't disagree.

You think atomism states that A is what it is free from not-A.  This is
not true; atomism states that A's relationship to zero does not affect B's
relationship to 0.  That's all.  Your definition is wrong, your point is
right, and so is atomism when defined correctly.  Move on.

On the contrary; it is trivial and it IS atomism; indeed, that is ALL that
atomism is trying to say.

I would never prohibit anyone from arithmetic;  whether to add or not to
add is a personal choice with which it is not mine to interfere.  ;) 
Rather, I argued that the fact that net identity sums to 0 does not prove
mysticism; I'm fine with the summation, but find the ultimate argument
invalid.  I demonstrated that there is a non-trivial difference between
saying that 0 = 1 and that 0 + -0 + 1 + -1 = 0.  I assert that because you
do not support the statement that there is 0 difference between one and
zero that your proof is not mystical, but trivial.  That you left this
point off of your reply is telling. 

I'll say it again:  A mysticist would agree with both of the following
identity charts:

   0  1         0  1
0  0  0  and 0  1  1
1  0  0      1  1  1

because there is zero difference between one and zero.  You do not; you
clearly see that there is one and only one chart which can be created in a
universe which consists only of a 1 and a 0:

   0  1
0  0 +1
1 -1  0

and that the two charts above are completely wrong.  You see that 0 is not
equal to 1, and therefore you have shown that mysticism is FALSE, not
true.

<sidepoint> As for your point that "to sum the parts defines the whole," I
think we can see, by using holism, that that's the biggest crock of shit
the world has ever seen.  The sum of the mysticist's chart is 0; the sum
of your chart is 0, yet the mysticist's chart is wrong and yours is right; 
there is a non-zero difference between the two charts.  Yet there is zero
difference between 0 and 0.  There is no difference between the sums, and
a non-zero difference between the charts; therefore, the sum of the
elements on a chart does NOT define the chart, and therefore the sum of
parts does not necessarily define the whole.</sidepoint>

Again, not-summing is not what I suggest.  Rather I argue that the sum
does not successfully prove your point.  The sum of the mysticist's
identity chart is 0; the sum of your identity chart is zero, and yet there
is a non-zero difference between your identity chart and the mysticist's
identity chart.  Therefore, the fact that your true chart sums to 0 does
not prove that the mysticist's chart is true, even if it also sums to
zero, because your chart is different from the mysticist's chart, despite
the fact that the sums are the same.  I'm repeating this point several
times in order to make this really really clear: your chart does not prove
the mysticist's chart, and therefore does not prove mysticism.

That does not in any way challenge my point that the fact that 1 + 2 =3
does not prove that 1 = 3 or that 2 = 3, nor does the fact that A + -A = 0
prove that A = 0 or that -A = 0.

Nowhere, so it's a good thing for us atomists your definition of atomism
is completely wrong.  Atomism does not claim that A is what it is free
from -A.  Atomism claims that the relation of A to 0 does not affect the
relation of B to zero.  That's the whole point, right there, hook line and
sinker.  No atomist will try to press you further on this point; if you
agree with the above, you agree with atomism, because this is the true
definition of atomism.

You must unlearn what you have learned, Ian: atomists AGREE with you. 
We're not claiming that A is what it is free from -A.  We're making a much
more trivial claim.  Never again should you argue that A is defined by -A; 
even the atomists agree with that.  We are making a much smaller point. 
You should understand this, accept that you have been fighting your own
straw man, and move on.

There is a somewhat vocal group of libertarians who insist that an
implicit contract is a void contract; parties must agree to the terms of a
contract before they may be ethically enforced.  Can you show that this is

Since I find this scenario interesting, I'm going to run it down step by
step.  You tell me where and how I get caught.

1)  I license the use of a copy of information you created.  2)  I encrypt
an advertisement and a pseudonymous public key to Dave's public key,
stating that I have a copy of your manuscript available for $0.05.
Only Dave can read this message; Dave has agreed to broadcast e-mails
which are sent to him via USENET. After enrypting it to Dave's key, I then
encrypt the ciphertext to Carol's key, adding a message requesting that
she send the e-mail to Dave; I encrypt that ciphertext to Bob's key with a
message requesting that he send the e-mail to Carol and send the message
to Bob.  3)  Bob decrypts the e-mail and sends his decrypted text to Carol
as requested.  4) Carol, ignorant of who originated the e-mail beyond the
fact that they sent it to Bob, decrypts her ciphertext and sends the
remaining ciphertext to Dave. 5)  Dave decrypts the e-mail, ignorant of
its author, and broadcasts it to USENET.  6)  Zed reads this message and
decides to post $0.05 in anonymous money encrypted to my public key along
with his own public key; he does so through a similar chain of anonymous
remailers; no one but the first in the e-mail chain even knows who Zed is,
no one but me knows what the message says, because Zed encrypted the
e-mail to me before sending it along the chain.  7)  I encrypt a copy of
your manuscript to Zed's public key and broadcast it anonymously.

In this way, Zed and I can conduct a trade perfectly anonymously.  If the
remailers do not keep a copy of the e-mail which they forward (they
don't), then it is impossible to trace either myself or Zed.

What are you going to do about this?

Well, let me put it to you this way:  any economist who knew anything at
all about microeconomics would agree that Coca Cola charges more for Coke
than it would if anybody could make Coke, and that this is because it is
the only company that makes Coke.  They would also agree that increased
prices lead to decreased quantity.  They would agree that this decreased
quantity coupled with increased prices would represent deadweight loss, or
economic inefficiency, and that all else being equal this will drag down
the macroeconomy. 

If you don't want to call this a monopoly, that's OK with me, but please
excuse me if I agree with the textbooks on this point.

Are you saying that it would be a natural monopoly?  If so, since when are
libertarians opposed to natural monopolies?  Also, I disagree with your
assertion that all commodity markets tend towards monopoly thanks to
economies of scale.  There are lots and lots of commodities on the market
that aren't monopolistic, never have been and don't look like they're
about to become monopolistic in the near future.  The existence of such
markets disproves your assertion that all commodity markets have this
behavior, though it may nonetheless be true for IP.

If you are correct, and it is more efficient for a monopoly or oligopoly
to produce the goods than it is for small producers to compete (or sell to
them), then by encouraging this process we are encouraging a free market;
this is because in the case of a natural monopoly, the free market is not
competitive.  I am not convinced that this is actually the case, but it
does not help nor hinder either of our arguments if you are right on this
point.

Most Linux users would disagree; they argue that the reason Linux is good
and growing (some say that it is already better than Microsoft's product) 
is because anyone is free to modify the source in any way they want, but
they are also prevented from protecting their invention under the GPL. 
This means that it is easy for anyone with a good idea to improve the OS,
rather than wait for Microsoft to release the next version of its
bloatware. 

Also, if there were no IP laws, information like Linux would make up 100%
of the market, not 0.1%.  Remember, I'm not trying to say that Linux is
going to beat Microsoft in today's market; I'm just saying that Linux
continues to improve despite the fact that nobody can protect their new
Linux code.  This flies in the face of your assertion that if inventors do
not receive royalties on their inventions, they will not invent.  They
will invent, only slower.

I don't abhor natural monopolies, nor should any other free marketer. It's
the COERCED monopolies that we have to worry about.  Also, I am not at all
certain that the market for IP is naturally monopolistic, and I definitely
disagree with your assertion that all commodity markets monopolize.

I don't think you can get much more qualitative than this analysis, which
was all that I was trying to show.  This is not to say that it is wrong,
necessarily, but simply that you can't do this quantitatively; you MUST be
qualitative.

Well, figure it out yourself.  The portion of surplus which is above the
price line and below the demand curve is consumer surplus; that below the
price line and above the supply curve is producer surplus.  If IP were to
be eliminated, consumers would gain more than producers would in the copy
market (see http://pantheon.yale.edu/~dgf4/incent3.gif ); also, the
increase in consumer surplus when demand increases is greater under
perfect competition than under a monopoly, while producer surplus is
greater under monopoly than under perfect competition, as noted.

As for how it benefits the macroeconomy, you should know this perfectly
well:  all else being equal, increased total microeconomic surplus results
in increased nominal GDP.  However, this is similar to the argument for
kids drinking milk:  all else being equal, a child will grow taller if
they drink milk than if they don't drink milk.  How much taller?  I cannot
say.  All I claim to know is that microeconomic efficiency is better for
the economy than microeconomic inefficiency, but I cannot tell by how
much.

Look, you want a REAL REAL simple example?  Suppose I have a triangle
formed by the points (0,0), (x,0) and (y,0) and a triangle formed by
(0,0), (z*x,0) and (y,0) where z is less than 1.  The latter triangle will
have less area than the former triangle.  I have no idea what their areas
will actually be, but I know their relative sizes on a qualitative level. 
No magic, just math. If I know enough about the supply and demand curves,
then I can use the same "magic" on the area of the deadweight loss, the
increase in revenues as demand increases, and the quantity produced by
monoplists as opposed to that produced under competition. 

> Yet you show no quantified relative size.

I never claimed to!  Did you read my conclusion?  All I said was: "To
conclude, if we let A be the area of the blue trapezoid under perfect
competition, M be the area of the blue shape in the monopolistic diagram,
D be the area of the grey triangle and E be the cost to society of
enforcing IP laws, then we should eliminate IP laws if D + E > M - A, or
if A + D + E > M."

Almost nil.  That was the low red line in the third graph.  As for fixed
costs, you're right, they don't show up on the graph, but they were the
central point of my use of those graphs: if the increase in revenues is
greater than the fixed cost of invention, then invention will take place,
if not, then it won't.  This was the principle I set out in bold; I
believe it is the most robust part of my analysis because it is so
trivial.  If you disagree with this part of the analysis, (and there's no
reason why you should: a priori, you could still be right even if this
were true) you'd better provide your OWN graphs showing why mine are
wrong.

Gee.  Funny how the area on the supply/demand graph is given in precisely
those units: Price times quantity.... SAY!  Wait a minute!  You don't
suppose it's a microeconomic PRINCIPLE that the change in efficiency is
given by the change in area on the supply/demand chart, do you?  Naw.  It
couldn't be...

Why do you think I spent all that time harping on about area, anyway???
Geez.

As you surely realize, I used lines because they're shitloads easier to
draw.  If you want to draw out your own graphs using S-curves, go right
ahead.  I'm anxious to see them.  So long as your curves don't violate any
principles, they will show the same qualitative results as mine do.

I don't understand.  It would be unprofitable to produce tamper-proof

Again, all I have to do is build a computer emulator that copies instead
of executes (especially easy when we're talking about CDs) and all the AV
software in the world wont help you as I burn myself an identical CD with
all of the AV software intact, and pop it into my real computer.  The new
CD is no different from the old CD as far as the software can tell; what
will the AV programs detect if they are never executed?

Yes, this is all true.  However, how do you propose to measure the
demanded return on investment on IP in America without IP laws, all else
being equal?  China won't cut it; planned economies don't let this
mechanism work at all.  You've got to use America and all else must be
equal in order for this mechanism to apply; in other words, you can never
make this measurement.

Well, go get your data and we'll see how YOU do.

Actually, interestingly enough, NOT if you are right about that natural
monopoly thing.  In that case, the big monopoly on invention-commodities
will have an incentive to pay a premium for inventions, up to but not
exceeding the area of the blue shape in my incentive analysis.  Inventors
will therefore have an incentive to invent given by this shape, just as it
is today.  That is, in that case, the incentive to invest is EQUAL in both
systems, as well as the deadweight loss.  The only difference, then, is
the cost of enforcement; again, the vote in my favor, not yours.

Meanwhile, even if natural monopoly does not take place, the blue
trapezoid under competition expands when the demand for inventions
increses, so there IS a demand effect on the incentive to invest; again,
smaller, but not zero.

I think I see.  So your PPA will go to the PPA(s) of all of those who
reside on my anonymous remailer chain and get them to tell who I am.  The
problem with this policy:  this is effectively key escrow, which has been
proven many times over to be inefficient.  If you have to hand over your
keys when the government/PPA says so, you can't do electronic commerce
securely.  Period.  If e-commerce is more efficient than physical commerce
(And there is a great deal of evidence that this is the case,) then
enforcing key escrow results in economic inefficiency.  So again I fall
back on Friedman's rule of thumb:  if it is economically inefficient, it
will not be enforced under anarcho-capitalism.

What?  That sunk costs do not result in competitive disadvantage? 
Competitive disadvantage is a technical term which refers only to the
supply curve, which is really not affected by sunk costs, honest to
goodness; you can go look it up.  Perhaps you meant something else?  The
average cost curve?

Yet they will agree that microeconomic efficienccy does lead to increased
GDP, ceteris paribus.  It's the ceteris paribus which most economists will
catch you on, but since all I was trying to prove is that IP laws are
economically bad for us compared to not having them, microeconomic
efficiency is the perfect choice.

   IAN: I would be interested to know where you get 
   your definition of "atomism." I get mine from the 
   the classical Three Laws of Thought that define 
   the structure of atomist identity (in short):

    1) A is A.
    2) A is not both A and not-A.
    3) A is either A or not-A.

   This defines a clear demarkation around A that 
   excludes holism by 100% and thus is atomism by
   100%. What definition of atomism is more exact?

   Your definition of atomism desribes a meta-rela-
   tion of three relations (A,B), (A,0), and (B,0) 
   and observes that as (A,B) changes, the other 
   two remain static, true! But that's NOT a defin-
   tion of identity, atomist or holist, and thus 
   is not a standard by which the "right" or the 
   "wrong" defintion is to be determined. So:

   * Why is "atomist identity" as defined by the 3 
   Laws of Thought a "wrong" definition of atomism?

   (Our disagreements revolve around definitions, 
   and it seems that we agree on everything else.)

   IAN: I think your accusation is in error! Cutting 
   to the quick: here again our difference is one of 
   definition. Your defining "mystical" as "a statement
   about LESS than all data," such as 0 = 1. Based on 
   that you then construct a series of matrices with 
   obviously illogical information and then conclude 
   that the "mystical" must be illogical. Yes! But
   if, and only if, your definition is THE definition.

   My definition of "mystical" is "a statement about 
   the unity of ALL data." Based upon that, I then
   construct a matrix that defines ALL identities
   and sums them into a statement about ALL things.

   So the real question here is: Why is a definition 
   of "mystical" as "a statements about not-all things"
   the right definition of the "mystical" ? As I said,
   I think we agree on all else but two definitions.

Vegetarian dinosaurs couldn't eat the good stuff most modern vegetarians eat, 
grass, because grass had not evolved yet, their main diet was something  
similar to pine needles, and you need to eat about twice as much to get equal 
food value. That's not the only problem, pine needles take far longer to 
digest than grass. Also, the teeth of these dinosaurs were simple pegs, they
didn't have anything like molar teeth that modern animals use to grind up 
there vegetable food before swallowing, they had to swallow their pine 
needles whole. All this means that if you want to make a living in this way 
you're going to need a very large stomach and gut, the rest of the body will 
be scaled up proportionally. You end with something like a huge fermentation
tank with legs.
 
Another reason we don't see land animals as big as the largest dinosaurs is 
simply chance, nearly all the species of animals that have ever existed are 
extinct, there is no reason to expect we'd be lucky enough to be around at the 
same time the very largest ones were. We were extraordinary lucky as far as 
sea animals are concerned, no beast has ever been as large as the Blue Whale.

    IAN: I should note that there is NO change in
    total. The net sum of all difference will always
    be zero, because any change is defined at least
    by a 1 + (-1) fluctuation, which defines the

Title
  Effects of green tea, black tea and dietary lipophilic antioxidants on LDL
  oxidizability and atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolaemic
  rabbits.
Source
  Atherosclerosis.  135(1):37-47, 1997 Nov.
Abstract
  The hypothesis that tea or dietary lipid-soluble antioxidants reduce
  atherogenesis by lowering the oxidizability of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
  was investigated. Five groups of 20 female New Zealand white rabbits were fed
  a restricted amount of a high-fat (30 en%) semipurified diet supplemented
  with cholesterol (0.15%, w/w) for 21 weeks. The vitamin E content of the
  control diet was 40 mg/kg diet. The animals received either green tea or
  black tea in their drinking water or vitamin E (200 mg/kg diet) or
  beta-carotene (20 mg/kg). The serum cholesterol concentrations (in the order
  of 18-23 mmol/l) were not significantly different between the groups. Vitamin
  E was substantially increased as compared to controls in vitamin E
  supplemented animals (3-fold within 8 weeks in plasma and LDL; P < 0.01) and
  weakly (1.2-fold) by green and black tea (P < 0.05). Green tea consumption
  tended to reduce aortic lesion formation by 31% (24 +/- 3.2% versus 35 +/-
  5.7% for control animals P = 0.11), while black tea, vitamin E and
  beta-carotene had no effect. This was in contrast to the resistance of
  isolated LDL to oxidation induced at high copper concentration. Green and
  black tea induced a 13% and 15% (P < 0.05) prolongation of the lag phase,
  respectively, with a correspondingly lower oxidation rate, while vitamin E
  increased the lag phase by 63% (P < 0.01) with a concomitant diminution of
  the oxidation rate and beta-carotene had no effect. Regression analysis
  showed that there was no relationship between the extent of
  atherosclerosis and LDL oxidizability or plasma
  malondialdehyde as marker of in vivo lipid peroxidation. The results of the
  present study raise the question whether LDL oxidizability (at least when
  tested at high induction rate ex vivo) is a primary causal mechanism in
  atherosclerosis in the cholesterol-fed rabbit. The
  suitability of the cholesterol-fed rabbit with extreme hypercholesterolaemia
  as a model to study antiatherosclerotic properties of dietary antioxidants,
  such as the tested polyphenols, is discussed.

OK.  At my website, http://pantheon.yale.edu/~dgf4/incent.html I analyze
the incentive to invent.  Looking at this will make my point much clearer,
but here is my analysis in sum:

The benefit of IP enforcement is that it increases the incentive to
invent. The incentive to invent is given by the increased revenues which
an inventor receives by inventing; this value is larger under a monopoly
than under competition. 

The cost of IP enforcement is twofold:  first, there is the actual cost of
paying for police investigations, arrests, imprisonment, trials, and all
of that other stuff.  I have argued that investigation would be
exceptionally costly over a system like TC May's BlackNet.  I have also
argued that attempting to enforce the terms of a contract on someone who
has not signed the contract is economically inefficient in the long run;
Lorrey argues that simply by buying an illegal copy of the good, you have
implicitly agreed to the rules of "caveat emptor," accepting liability and
responsibility for your purchase.

Second, there is "deadweight loss" in the copy market.  Deadweight loss
happens when prices are set higher than that which would be reached by
perfect competition or if the quantity is lower; if the total surplus
reached under perfect competition is the area below the demand curve and
above the supply curve, the deadweight loss is given by the total surplus
under perfect competition (the surplus we could have had) minus the area
below the demand curve, above the supply curve and to the left of the
quantity sold (the surplus we actually got).  Under perfect competition,
there is no deadweight loss; but when you give someone a monopoly over a
good, deadweight loss inevitably results.

I argued that this cost alone would be larger than the benefit of IP.
Since monopolies control the entire market for their good, they must lower
the price of the good in order to increase sales beyond a certain value;
in other words, the marginal revenue for monopolies decreases twice as
fast as that for competitive firms.  This means that while monopolies will
have an incentive to produce fewer products, they will still be able to
charge the higher price given by the demand curve at that quantity.
(Hence deadweight loss.)  More specifically, if prices were 0, then a
monopolistic firm would produce only half as much as a competitive firm
would; 50% of the potential market would go to deadweight loss.  I argued
that since prices were not actually zero, but nonetheless quite low and
nearly completely elastic, at least 40% of the copy market would be lost
to economic inefficiency.

I concluded on my website that if D was the deadweight loss in the copy
market, M the monopolistic increase in revenues due to invention, A the
competitive increase in revenues due to invention, and E the cost of
enforcement, then we should eliminate IP if the costs outweighed the
benefits, or if D + E > M - A, or A + D + E > M.

This analysis is a lot clearer with graphs.  Go check out the website and
see for yourself.

Well, it's basically this problem: lots of people consider themselves
atomists (myself included!) because I believe that one can define the
identity of A in terms of its relationship to only PART of its holistic
identity and still make sense.  More precisely, I'd say that identity of A
(as defined by holism) is governed by *everything* that is not-A; but the
atomist's definition of identity (which I'll call partial identity to
avoid confusion) is simply the relationship between A and a particular
other value; usually 0.  The net identity is the sum of the partial
identities of everything relative to everything else, which is always 0.

In the previous world consisting of A and B, we can see that one partial
identity is that A is one greater than 0 and another is that B is two
greater than zero; the latter partial identity may change without
affecting the truth of the former partial identity: B may grow to twenty
greater than zero, but A will remain one greater than 0.  Since 0 will
become twenty less than B in the process, the whole identity of A will
change, eventually leaving the net identity zero.  However, the truth of
partial identities are not necessarily affected by changes in other
partial identities, and thus, to some extent, partial identities are
"atomistic" in the sense that they exhibit some degree of independence,
even though the total identity cannot behave in this way, and even though
the identity of the partial identities themselves will be affected as that
which is not-"partial identity"  changes.  The important thing for
atomists is that the truth of a partial identity can remain unchanged by
the truth of other partial identities; perhaps truth itself is just a
partial identity of any given statement.

This is useful in many cases where I don't know certain values on the
identity matrix, but I can nonetheless say things about the partial
identities I do know; I may even use the fact that net identity is equal
to zero in order to find unknown values on the table.  As you can see,
this is totally compatible with holism, and yet smacks of atomism.

So my definition, in the clearest form you'll get from me at this hour:
Atomism is the statement that the truth of partial identities does not
necessarily change as other partial identities change.

Well, here I must fall back on utility:  when we use words to
communicate, the best words are those which are the best mutually
understood by the parties to whom we are communicating.  Adopting a
commonly held definition makes communication easier and makes you better
understood by others.

When most people say "identity" they mean partial identity; similarly when
they say "space" they mean partial space, and when they say "time" they
mean partial time.  If the best definition is that which is best
understood, you are better off saying that identity, space and time can
all be non-zero (again, meaning partials) but that the sum of all
identities relative to all other identities is zero and that this is the
whole truth.

Similarly, when people refer to mysticism, they usually intimate something
which is not predicted by Newtonian physics actually taking place.
However, as we can clearly see, your theories of identity and Newtonian
physics go hand in hand; you cannot use the identity matrix to prove
that psychic phenomena are possible or that reality is infinitely
malleable by the human mind or that 0 = 1; all of these are popular
conclusions of mysticism as practiced and defined by others.  This reason
alone may be sufficient reasoning to abondonit.

If this has not been sufficiently convincing for you, this e-mail exhange
may be sufficient evidence that using another person's definitions is
useful: to be blunt, I would never use the word "Identity" with anyone
else in the same way I use it when talking with you; only by reading your
web site, by understanding your matricies and ultimately adopting your
definitions, have I even begun to convince you that we atomists aren't so
bad after all.  (A task which a series of great minds on this list have
apparently tried and failed to do.)  I must admit, I balked when I read
your conclusions that there was no identity, no space and no time; when I
understood that you were using a different definition of identity, time
and space than most, however, the theories followed; at the same time it
has allowed me to demonstrate that some form of atomism is compatible with
holism; but again, not according to the definitions which you hold, but
only by creating a new term "partial identity" which I tried to use to
sneak past your mental defenses against anything atomist. 

By adopting the definitions of your "opponent" while remembering the whole
truth, you can gain a better understanding of their position, and are also
more convincing with your own position.  You might even discover that
you're saying the same thing.

 Spotted in the the May 28, 1998 issue of the Globe and Mail newspaper.

 Methuselah Whales?

    New research suggests Arctic bowhead whales may live beyond 150 years,
 making them the longest-lived mammals on Earth, writes Ben Spiess in USA
 Today. Since 1981, Inuit whalers have found six harpoon heads in bowhead
 whales that were made of stone or ivory. "The types of points they've
 found in these whales were gone by the 1890s," said archeologist Glenn
 Sheehan. "It's likely these points are from before that - perhaps the
 mid-1800s." In a study of amino-acid aging in bowhead eyes, marine
 chemist Jeffrey Bada of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography found that
 four samples out of 42 were more than 100 years old and one whale was
 estimated to be 180 years old. (His technique, "aspartic acid
 racemization," has a range of error of 12 to 50 years.)

  In populations, dietary intakes of potassium, calcium, and

  supplements of these minerals lowered blood pressure. We tested the
  hypothesis that normotensive persons who have low habitual intake of these
  minerals would be particularly responsive to supplementation. Three hundred
  normotensive women in the Nurses Health Study II (mean age, 39 years), whose
  reported intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium were
  between the 10th and 15th percentiles, received for 16 weeks' duration daily
  supplements of either potassium 40 mmol, calcium 30 mmol
  (1200 mg), magnesium 14 mmol (336 mg), all three minerals together or
  placebos. At baseline, mean (+/-SD) 24-hour ambulatory blood pressures were
  116+/-8 and 73+/-6 mm Hg systolic and diastolic, respectively, and mean
  dietary intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium were
  62+/-20 mmol/d, 638+/-265 mg/d, and 239+/-79 mg/d, respectively. The mean
  differences (with 95% confidence intervals) of the changes in systolic and
  diastolic blood pressures between the treatment and placebo groups were
  significant for potassium, -2.0 (-3.7 to -0.3) and -1.7
  (-3.0 to -0.4), but not for calcium, -0.6 (-2.2 to 1.0) and -0.7 (-2.0 to
  0.6), or for magnesium, -0.9 (-2.6 to 0.8) and -0.7 (-2.2 to 0.8). The
  administration of calcium and magnesium with potassium did
  not enhance the effect of potassium alone, and the changes
  in blood pressure were not significant -1.3 (-3.0 to 0.4) and -0.9 (-2.2 to
  0.4). In conclusion, potassium, but not calcium or magnesium
  supplements, has a modest blood pressure-lowering effect in normotensive
  persons with low dietary intake. This study strengthens evidence for the
  importance of potassium for blood pressure regulation in the
  general population.

If location is not an attribute of identity, then objects in
different locations can be identical.  Identical objects in 
different locations have different values of 'not-the-object',
so can not be defined by it.

Additionally, defining 'not-the-object' begs the question of
what set one is defining the 'not' operation on.  If we are
talking about the set { A B C }, then not-A is { B C }.  If
we are considering the latin alphabet, not-A is { B .. Z }.
Yet A retains its identity with each definition: it is the
same symbol.  Indeed, the set { A B C } is a subset of the latin
alphabet.

Thus A is defined, not solely by not-A, but by not-A and the
set or universe under consideration.

Steve.

Essentially, since most ecological niches were occupied by very successful
dinosaur species, the only niches in which mammals occpied were as small rodent
types. Only once the meteor wiped out the previous occupants of those niches could
mammals develop to occupy them. Only then could the top predator position be taken
by human beings, millions of years later.

A book I'd like to suggest is _Art, The Arts, And The Great Ideas_ by
Mortimer J. Adler.

"Does a piece of visual or musical art have any content?  How is a sonata
different from a poem?  Continuing his thoughtful and though-provoking
exploration of the substance of basic education, Mortimer J. Adler examines
the inherent value of various art forms and considers their significance
within a well-rounded curriculum.  He maintains that imaginative literature
and works of science, philosophy, theology, and history act upon our
intellects and stimulate the discussion  of ideas…"

Although I do not agree in total with Alder's understanding of art in its
full interpretation (he, does state that art is often misrepresented and
all too often referred to something visual such as an artifact); I do
appreciate the following contribution Alder makes to the world of thinking:

"'Art' is one of the most misused words in the English language."  In the
chapter titled The Current Prevalent Confusions, Alder discussed
misconceptions about art, artist, artifact and work of art.   I found this
chapter particularly significant because he touches on the aspects of the
viewer or appreciator of art and the artist or person who possesses the
power to produce an object of art or a performance or concept. 

"Is not the art they [artists] possess the power to produce this or that
object, this or that performance?  Is it, therefore not reasonable to use
the word 'art' for the skill that makes a human being an 'artist,' and to
use the phrase 'work of art' [objet d'art] for the product of the artist's
productive activity?"

Here he states that there is an important contradiction in the above
statement if we make the mistake of continuing to think that "what adorns
museums of art and makes the name of such institutions intelligible to
us-is the misuse of the world "art" exclusively for paintings and sculpture."

In the chapter titled The Relevant Clarifying History, Alder explains
cogently the use of the word "art" by the Greeks.

"Throughout the dialogues of Plato and the treatises of Aristotle, the word
'art' is used as frequently as 'science,'….  Science and art are for the
Greeks the two fundamental forms of knowing - the former, knowing that,
what, why and wherefore; the latter, knowing how."  But don't let this
confuse you!  It's not as simple as it sounds -:)  He goes on to discuss
how the word "art" got so incredibly confusing in the 20th century by
everyone - especially by the art schools (i.e, fine art and liberal art,
for example).

I especially liked his summary argument where he discusses imagination,
ideas and perpetual thought (including cognitive acts) that "have reality
in the every-changing, sensible realm of becoming."

Cultural blaster Camilla Paglia once questioned the literary disappearance
of Susan Sontag.  By doing so, she arouses an all-out search for Sontag's
writings. Susan Sontag's books _Styles of Radical Will_ and _Against
Interpretation_ are (like Paglia) a collection of quick witted essays not
only for their style but for content about culture.

[Camilla Paglia is a mentor for me.  I love her intelligent outspoken stand
on many issues, especially feminism and education.  Although she is a
self-professed libertarian, she seldom brings her politics into her essays
outright, but states her views on important issues in such a way that her
ideas ring louder than political phrasings.]

It wasn't difficult to pick up on what seems to be an unconscious lead by
Paglia that Sontag was her original mentor until Sontag denounced her
affiliation with Pop Culture (referenced in _Vamps and Tramps_).   Paglia
saw this as a literary and professional blunder for Sontag.  Regardless of
faux pas or not, I took this lead and decided to explore Sontag more
carefully.  Vroom!  Glad I did!

Sontag writes, in part, about culture and art. In the essay, "The
Aesthetics of Silence," she questions the artists' metaphoric silence.  If
the artist chooses to be "silent," if he chooses to make art that is
confusing to the audience, then she is actually silencing art by making it
uncommunicative and unobtainable.  If the artist creates a vocabulary that
is so difficult for the audience to read or understand, then he is
silencing art. 

Another essay, "One culture and the new sensibility," focuses on the two
cultures of art and science (my favorite subject -:), questions C.P. Snows
assumptions (right on!) and heads into the ever changing new standards and
new attitudes toward pleasure.  For her, high and low as slogans for art
are less and less meaningful and talks about interest in "sensory mixes."

If  Sontag had made it through the ridicule of her initial support of Pop
Culture unscathed, and if she were still around, would she write - as a
controversial critic- about our transhuman culture with a wide-eyed view?
If she could make even coffee nervous - she could delve into transhumanity
with an inquisitive mind.

"None of us can ever retrieve that innocence before all theory when art
knew no need to justify itself, when one did not ask of a work of art what
is said because one know (or thought one knew) what it did.  From now to
the end of consciousness, we are stuck with the task of defending art."

However, since we are talking about serial numbers, in order to escape
the virus guard, you would need to do a straight copy on a dumb copy
device, not on a computer, thus leaving the serial numbers and other
fingerprints intact. When the software is installed, it then becomes
active, and leaves the purchaser open for enforcement actions against
them.

As far as I can tell, any time you put a CD in a drive, or any other
disk in a drive, the drive checks the boot sector of the drive. This is
how you can get a virus from an infected floppy simply by sticking the
disk in the drive. You do not need to 'look at it' in order to give the
virus a go at your system. Granted you could use a specially rigged CD
copying machine, but these are expensive devices, not likely to be owned
by the casual pirate. This cost of entry limits potential pirates to
those with the capital to take the risk. Thus this limits the potential
pirates, and eases enfocement.

Ok...let me summarize what I think I understand.

A long time ago there were supercontinents...pangea and gondawondaland.  These
huge landmasses allowed for tremendous ranges supporting the evolution of
extremely large animals.

Also...very large critters are an evolutionary response to cooling
enviromental cooling.  Witness whales living in artic waters.  The megafauna
of the Ice Ages.

That being the case the HUGE dinosaurs would seem to have been ice age
critters also?

Hmmmmmmm.....Brontosaurs wading thru snowdrifts munching from the tops of
then-equivalent pine forests?  Stegasaurous being the equivalent to Bison?..
Allasuraus being that peroids's dire wolves?

Every critter fills a niche...

How for wrong am I?

But that leaves the question....64 million years ago when the dinokiller hit.
Was it glacial?  Was Gondawandaland (or pangea?) dispersed to be the map we
are more familair with today?  After all the dinoblaster is reputedly resting
beneath the gulf waters near the Yucatan. Were the big dino's already gone
then?

Help putting this all in perspective would be appreciated.

Wouldn't you say the artist is making ineffective art, rather than saying
the artist is silencing a reification?

Thanks for the recommendations on Paglia, BTW.  I've enjoyed several of 
her essays and was already considering taking some of her writings for a
spin.

I don't know what OS and hardware combination you are using Michael, but
this is not the case for PCs.
I thought we'd already cleared this up;

1)  Any copy protection scheme can be defeated in theory, and almost
certainly will be in practice if there is a high enough benefit for doing
so.  If your protection doesn't go at least as far as chip-specific
licensing and hardware dongle then you ain't even trying - and these have
proven to be ineffective.  To date, the cost of hacking any copy protection
has proven to be minuscule compared with the benefit of doing so.  Nothing
in any of the schemes you have mentioned (or any I know of) fix this
problem, or in fact offer any significant additional cost to the hacker.

2)  To quote Gary Larson, "On the internet, no one knows you're a dog."  The
only way I can think of where you could possibly ensure that you can catch
the customer who broke your contract and began distributing pirate copies is
if you took physical biometric data from each one of them and encoded it
into the software at the time of purchase.  Needless to say this rules out
any selling of your software on the internet, and is not very useful if you
are looking for something to keep the cost of IP enforcement down.  Also not
something I'd like to see a libertarian arguing in favour of  :-)

IP is going to have to get along without needing any of the above if it is
going to have any chance of 'efficiency' in the info-economy.  Anything else
will carry a massive overhead that dwarfs any supposed benefits to the owner
of the IP.  <cliche> Information wants to be free </cliche>

I don't know what Sontag has been up to lately, but I'm completely off of
Camille Paglia, who I used to admire, for three reasons:  (1) her refusal to
acknowledge the value of any scientific approach to studying the human
condition, insisting that we take our lessons from literature and
philosophy;  (2) her predictable opposition to any attempt to improve or
change the human condition;  and (3) her recent attack on Youth Pride and
concurrent denunciation of a five-year youth suicide study.  She has indeed
brought her politics to bear in the case of Youth Pride, because her
comments make it obvious that she did not bother to find out any hard facts
about the organization but rather based them on her political opposition to
the gay movement in general.  

For a while I thought she provided a refreshing counter to feminism, but,
having read all of her latest writings, I have concluded that she is not
breaking any new ground but rather engaging in attacks on anyone else who
attempts to do so.  This, of course, has been the strategy for maintaining
many an academic career.

   IAN: If we want to exclude location from 
   the definition of A so we can say that A
   does not change when its location changes, 
   we can. However, if we want to define the 
   nature of location, we will discover that 
   location is a product of holistic relation.

   A is derived by holistic relation (A + -A) 
   just as the location (here) of A is derived 
   by holistic relation (here + -here). So the 
   argument that the location of A is not an 
   attribute of its identity did not free loca-
   tion from the structure of holistic identity,
   and as such no free identity has been shown.


   Whenever we ask, "What is X?, where X is any-
   thing you could imagine, we are asking a ques-
   tion about identity, for which the exact answer
   will always be: X is a product of the relation
   of X and -X; and X does not exist outside that.

   Where X is the whole, the whole is defined by 
   the relation of parts (-X) to the whole, X.
   If there are no parts, there is no whole.

   Find the thing not defined and surrounded by 
   a state or states of difference, and then 
   you will find evidence against holism.
   Remember, the whole is not a thing.


>Additionally, defining 'not-the-object' begs the question of
>what set one is defining the 'not' operation on.  If we are

   IAN: The symbol A is defined by the external 
   area surrounding it. If you put it in a set
   with 3 members or a set with 26 members, the
   same inverse shape defines the shape of A.
   So, observing that A is always defined by 
   -A is not evidence against holism, but for!

   Shifting around members of -A and observing 
   that the shape of A is the same, is not an
   example that A is not defined by -A, if 
   that applies to what you're arguing.

   If we have change and not-change, the change
   is defined by its difference from not-change.


>Thus A is defined, not solely by not-A, but by not-A and the
>set or universe under consideration.


   IAN: I'm confused by your conclusion since 
   it seems at odds with the case you were mak-
   ing before it, which seemed to be that A does 
   not change when the members of -A changed.

In IBM PC clones (DOS), the boot sector is only read during boot up. No
files are read when the disk is inserted unless you execute one from the
disk. Win 95, etc., I can't speak for.

Windows 95 will attempt to autorun a CD, but this can be turned off in the
OS. I am not certain that you can completely disable the CD's being
autoscanned, but the programs, if any, will not actually be run.

Unless the code containing the virus is actually run, there is no
possibility of infection. By inclusion, this includes macro viruses such as
those now found in MS Word and Excel files..unless the infected file is
opened with the proper program, and the macros are run, there is no danger.

FWIW, I discussed this issue from a slightly different perspective in
THEORY AND ITS DISCONTENTS, where I commented:

======================================

Plainly, it must help if we keep clear that not all dichotomies have the
same force [...].  Aba and Eba are the kinds of grand exclusives which
practitioners of deconstruction are eager to demote, understandably enough
in political terms.  Much vulgar debate, much `common sense', has persisted
in the fallacy that these contraries exhaust the possibilities for
discriminating between categories.  When `man' is contrasted to `woman'
under the Aba/Eba rubric, `woman' will get short shrift indeed in a
phallocentric culture.  But of course there are other and better ways to
distinguish two classes.  

To define an elephant is not usually to distinguish it from quasars and
English muffins, though the act of definition, by definition, has the
side-effect of excluding it from those and all other non-elephant classes.
 Nor is it even to mark the elephant off from other large landbased
lifeforms.  Rather, a useful definition needs to specify the animal's
positive physiological, evolutionary and ecological characteristics.  In
the context of the Earth's grand ecology, we are far more interested to
learn in what precise ways an elephant metabolises oxygen than to know that
it declines to breath methane or uranium hexafluoride.  

Yet in the starved terms of post-Saussurean Theory, `elephant' has no
positive term.  It is solely a play of differences from those things which
it is not, as the vocable /cat/ is not /mat/, /bat/, or /can/.  But while
in a strict sense it is true that to define an elephant is to exclude
everything else in the universe from that set, it is a long and
debilitating step from this elementary truism of logic to the view [of
Julia Kristeva and Elizabeth Grosz] that we thus construct for the elephant
`an "other" in which it can cast all that it is incapable of accepting or
desiring in itself'.

Another way to make the point is this: let us posit that we may distinguish
a given entity from the rest of universe by a number of paths (assuming
that our discourse permits us to make discriminations in the first place;
if not we can abandon the possibility of logic at once).  `A' can be
divided from `non-A'.  Some boundary thus separates `A' from the rest of
the universe (at least in terms of some set of defining conditions).  But
we can also distinguish `A1' from `A2', and from [`A2' through `An'], or
perhaps as well from members of other classes such as `B1', or [`B1'
through `Bn'].  Indeed, only if we divide `A1' off from [`A2' through `Nn']
are we back to `A' and `non-A'.  But I hope it is clear that the simple act
of binary discrimination need not have a single effect, for good or ill,
since it can be performed in many different ways.  Post-structural Theory's
attack on binarisation appeals to a more fundamental metaphysical problem
in determining just what is inside the boundaries of these `A's and `N's.

  IAN: Is the exclusion of the area around this 
  letter A a "side-effect" of the identity of its 
  interior or is it THE effect of its interior? 
  In other words, is exclusion a lesser charact-
  eristic of identity, or are both inclusion 
  and exclusion equal characteristics?


>`A' can be divided from `non-A'.  


  IAN: Can inclusion in subset A be separated 
  from the process of exclusion from A? I would
  say that the process of inclusion into A is 
  the process of exclusion from A. To say A 
  is bright is to exclude dark from A.

  Is there any positive feature of A that does
  not simultaneously define exclusion from A? 
  If not, then A defines the union of A and -A.

Within a few days we will be making some changes.

The Extropians list will become two lists:

Extropians-Open -- this will be the direct descendent of the current
Extropians list. Its nickname will be "Extropians" and posting to that same
address will continue to work. This list will be open to everyone, member
and non-member, Extropian, non-Extropian, and anti-Extropian alike. All
topics are open to discussion, including "the basics".

Extropians-Select -- this will be for Extropy Institute members only.
Rather than debating the basic values shared by Extropians, the purpose of
this list will be to discuss ideas in depth, to post news items, and to
discuss strategies for spreading extropians ideas and for implementing them
in our own lives (life extension, intelligence increase, psychological
improvement, etc.).

ACTION ITEM: To remain on this list (becoming the Extropians-Open List),
you need do nothing. To make sure you are on the Extropians-Select List,
you need to (a) make sure we have your current email address; (b) make sure
your ExI membership is current. If you're not sure (the expiration date was
on the mailing label of the last issue of Exponent), call or email me and I
can tell you. You can renew by using the online form at
<www.extropy.org/join.htm>, or by emailing me your credit card info,
address, etc. (to <more@extropy.org>) or by phoning (310) 398-0375

Please note that I will be leaving later this morning to head north for the
Foresight Institute meeting, and so will be away from my email until late
on Sunday. Any questions about the running of the two lists can be
addressed to ExI's Electronic Communications Officer David McFadzean
<david@lucifer.com>.

Onward!

                      The truth is out there.

        SPRINGFIELD, Ore.(AP)--A second student wounded in the
    [Thurston High] school shooting rampage died Friday as police
    found at least five bombs at Kip Kinkel's home ...
        Kinkel, who had been suspended the day before for having a
    gun in his locker, fired off 51 rounds -- nearly all from a rifle
    -- before a wrestler, himself critically wounded, tackled him,
    police said. -"Second student dies; Police find bombs in Kinkel

        Pennsylvanians are finally getting a peek at one of the
    state's best-kept secrets -- violence in public schools.
        The picture isn't pretty.
        Statewide, public schools reported 31,597 incidents of
    violence during the 1995-96 school year, according to the state
    Department of Education. ...
        The first report on violence revealed that there were 20,003
    assaults on students statewide, including 11,617 fights; 1,119
    assaults on school employees; 274 firearms possessions; *2,560
    KNIFE POSSESSIONS; AND 7,738 OTHER WEAPONS POSSESSIONS.* -First

    Of course, many people  can't do math. That's why we have public,
    or government, schools: to keep people enslaved by keeping them
    technologically illiterate. Parents, if you want to help your

A very good solution indeed! That should stop the periodic whining of some
people about S/N... ;-)

Anyway, I think there's still one type of list missing: "transhumanism select":
an invitation only (or in any case restricted) list for hardcore transhumanists,
where all topics can be discussed without having to think about PR (you
could also call it ">H uncensored"). There have been some concerns 
about the effect of certain topics on transhuman PR, and this would solve
the problem without compromising the quality of debate (censorship of
any kind, no matter how reasonable or well-meant, is a killer of critical 
debate). The proposed list would also have a restricted (password etc.)
archive, of course.

(And yes, I know, the  very proposal for such a list is bad PR, but you 
can't eat your cake and have it too or something)...In the long run, it
would be better.

As usual, I have fallen into the linguistic trap of using assumptions 
which my reader will not have.  I should have said 'conclusions true to 
a specified degree follow from premises true to a specified degree.'  I 
know this is not the textbook definition of logic, but the textbooks are 
based on Aristotle, after all.  I imagine you will not agree with this 
definition either, but I am beginning to see a way out of our 
definitional difficulties, but I will restrict them to the original

Assuming that the barber properly finishes his job, he's going to shave 
or not shave himself...  He probably does not shave all of his body 
hair, or of any other man in the town, so in that sense he shaves 
himself to a certain degree. If the question being asked was 'Does the 
barber shave all men who do not shave themselves?', one could answer in 
a particularly vague fuzzy way, which would be to divide the men of the 
town who do not shave themselves minus the barber by the men of the town 
who do not shave themselves (1/m), and call the rest of the ratio 
ambigous.  So, if the town had 20 men who do not shave themselves, the 
barber would shave all men who do not shave themselves to a .95 degree, 
with the other .05 being ambigous or paradoxical.  However, this has 
nothing to do with Russell's paradox, as the question is whether the 
barber shaves himself.  The point of Russell's Paradox was that within 
formal logic there is no way out, vague or otherwise(vague being 
Russell's term for what we now call fuzzy).  Following the time that he 
formulated this paradox, Russell attempted to formulate a system of 
logic that would disallow paradoxes, but failed.  Somewhat later Kurt 
Godel proved that within any formal system of logic there would be at 
least one statement that could not be proved to be true or not true, so 
we are trapped with the paradoxical barber forever (at least, the 
formalists are).

I did not want to go classical to quantum without due cause, as it is an 
intellectual arms race, but once you start referring to particles as 
having individual wavelengths, you are talking quantum, and I must 
respond like Pakistan.  My apologies.
    The easiest way to point out the problems with finding an exact 
position is wavelength is the notorious Heisenberg uncertainty 
principle. I almost hesitate to bring it up as it is the only element of 
quantum physics that has made it into pop physics, (along with e=mc^2 
and that bit about Galileo dropping things off the Tower of Pisa)and 
thus is the most misunderstood theorum of quantum physics, as all the 
others are merely unknown.  This is not because it is complex, it is 
because people tell lies about it (or perhaps .2 Truths).  
Unfortunately I have no mathematical symbols at my disposal, so words 
must do.

The uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to precisely 
measure a particle's momentum and position simultaneously.  If one is 
measured precisely, the other becomes unbounded.  This has practical 
significance towards the question of whether a photon is or is not blue 
according to whether it lies within the range of 540-560 nm. As the 
wavelength of the photon may lie arbitrarily close to the cutoff point 
of 540 nm, the wavelength must be specified to infinite precision. The 
wavelength of a photon is determined by the relationship x=h/E, where x 
is the wavelength, h is Planck's constant, and E is energy.  I will 
further translate E into mc^2(which describes all aspects of momentum 
but the direction).  x=h/mc^2.     Planck's constant is constant, as is 
the speed of light.  The wavelength is therefore determined by the mass 
variable.  The observational task at hand is to pin down the mass to 
infinite precision so that it can be determined whether or not the 
stated photon is or is not blue.  However, once you have accomplished 
this the position of the photon becomes unbounded!  Since the photon is 
just as likely to be in the Andromeda galaxy as on the surface of the 
Earth, I do not think it possible to draw any conclusions about the 
color of the sky from your precise measurement of wavelength.
In practice both precision and momentum can be constrained to a very 
small range, although there is always a remote possibility (assuming 
non-infinite precision of momentum) that a photon emitted from your 
flashlight will end up in the Andromeda Galaxy. In our blueness 
defintion this suggests that there is actually some ambiguity at every 
wavelength, although in most cases infitesimally small.  We can perceive 
blue because the cones in our eyes are tolerant to small fluctuation of 
wavelength,and the sheer number of photons that enter our eyes make 
precise positions unimportant due to statistical mass.

The question is not the truth value at points well within boundries. It 
is what truth value to prescribe exactly at the border.  I will not try 
to extend the analogy to your macroscopic example,as feet are not point 
particles and will overlap the border.  Photons, when well behaving, are 
point particles and do not cause this sort of confusion.

  Unfortunately Newtonian physics had to be abandoned because it does 
not adequately explain the behavior of light (and other things, but 
light was the initial problem).  Your explanation works slightly better 
because it is not Newtonian.  Photons cannot have frequencies 
independent of other photons within Newtonian physics.

       The gist of my argument is that when attempting to map all 
statements (in a metalanguage) onto the world, wherever boundries are 
drawn there will be fundamentally unavoidable ambiguities.  At some 
point (in this case at the points of 540 and 560 nm), it will be 
impossible to give a truth value of either true or false.  I suppose if 
you insist on maintaining the Tarskian diagram, you could say "le laser 
est bleu' is Truly True or False, but I don't think this is what Tarsky 
had in mind! If you find multivalence truly abhorrent, I find no 
objection to making a Tarskian diagram with three Truth values, True, 
False, and Ambiguous (or Not Applicable).  However, as I pointed out 
above, the uncertainty principle would make Ambiguous the correct Truth 
value at every point (each photon may or may not be blue). While 
accurate, it doesn't do much good to anybody.
You could get around the problem of Ambiguity by redefining blue in 
terms of complex numbers, but your new defintion would not bear any 
relation to what anybody else thought of as blue.

Old news for some, but I've just stumbled on it:

http://www.wisc.edu/zoology/spring98/zoo258/258wk2b.html

is a Jan 97 review by Leonard Hayflick, of the celebrated Hayflick limit on
cell replications, of two books on aging and how (maybe) to avoid it:

The Clock of Ages
by JOHN J. MEDINA Cambridge University Press, 1996 ($24.95)

Reversing Human Aging
by MICHAEL FOSSEL William Morrow, 1996 ($25)


He closes, rather tendentiously,

< Although aging and death put an end to the lives of good citizens, they
also make finite the lives of tyrants, murderers and a broad spectrum of
other undesirables. Much of the continuing massive destruction of this
planet and the consequent ills that this destruction produces for humans
can be traced to overpopulation, a phenomenon that appears to show no sign
of abating. Extending the life of a population that already strains global
resources is, in the view of many, unconscionable.

< If the price to be paid for the beneficial results of aging and death is
its universal applicability, we should all pay that price-as we always have. >

Not necessarily. Its a function of their cooling demands. If they spent a lot of
time in water, they would of course be cooled more efficiently than if they were
in open air all the time, so they would trend bigger without necessarily a cold
climate. However, there is some evidence that at least some dinosaurs were evolved
to live in rather chilly climates.

Additionally, another persons comments about the nutritional content of flora of
the jurassic period is also relevant, in that a) needing to eat much more food to
get equal nutritional content will tend to trend animals to larger sizes, as they
need to engage biological economies of scale to eat right, and that b) larger
animals tend to have slower metabolisms, and thus require a lower percentage of
their body weight in dead mass food intake. Small animals like small birds and
shrew must eat at least their entire body weight each day in food to survive,
while you and I only need around 5% of our body weight or less  in food each day,
using todays highly nutritious food. This is also one reason why modern humans
tend toward the obese (besides the lack of exercise), as their bodies are evolved
for a much less nutritious diet.

Dinosaurs, which were cold blooded or semi-cold blooded, were evolved to eat a
much less nutritious diet than is presently available. I imagine that if any were
alive today, they would die early of obesity related health problems. THis could
also possibly be a contributing factor to their demise. Imagine that a much more
nutritious plant evolved, which was very sucessful at reproducing and spreading,
and became a staple diet for dinos. All of the herbifores would become fat and
easy for predators to catch, while the predators, now eating this 'cornfed' meat,
would start developing cholesterol problems, cardiopolumonary disease, etc....

Its thought that most dinos in North America at least were killed off by the
blast, as the regolith from the blast settled mainly over north america, and the
large tidal flood reached far up the missisipi valley to canada.  The amount of
dust blown into the sky would have been up long enough to kill off most plant life
for sufficient time for most of the remaining dinos to die off from starvation,
though I imagine that there were sufficient lizards species that survived that
they were around long enough to become todays modern birds and reptiles, while
creating an instinctual fear of reptiles in mammals.

Yes, Mr. Hayflick is apparently a couple o' bulbs short of enlightenment, as
are most other "great minds" & cultural icons. Could it really be that, of the 
aprrox. 6 billion people on earth, only a couple of hundred or so really think 
rationally ?

How absurd!

It is interesting to note that it is always the same arguments, and
they are of course as usual wrong. I think we should learn to counter
them well.

The above argument is actually rather chilling; if we lived a shorter
time the "undesirables" would live even shorter, so that ought to be a
good idea.

This is another of the "classics", and quite wrong (lifespan only
changes the size of the population, not the rate of increase; if
overpopulation is a problem then it has to be managed by family
planning anyway). But this is hard to explain, on my swedish life

for themselves varying the lifespan and number of children and see the
effect,

  Some of Dan's counters I've not properly 
  addressed by not clearly defining holism.
  Mapping the holistic structure of identity 
  is deep, and a complex effort. The source 
  of conflict is the mechanics of notion.

  When we say "A" we denote the inside of A.
  When we say "-A" we denote the outside of A.
  When we say "A + -A" we denote the union of
  the inside and the outside of A. The later 
  expression of union is NOT equal to the two
  former expressions. A shortfall of my case
  has been the failure to denote that differ-
  ence. Doing so, the logical expression of 
  holistic identity structure is achieved.

  As the identity structure of A (the state 
  of reality that makes A = A) contains both 
  A and -A, the singular notation of "A" is 
  incomplete as a means of denoting identity 
  structure. The holism I attempt to define 
  accurately is simply the process of noting 
  that to define the identity structure of 
  A requires that we denote both A and -A.

  Out of habit, I've still been saying 
  "A = A + -A" (even as I've improved this 
  a few months ago), which is an unclear and 
  inaccurate means of denoting the holistic 
  identity structure of A. The problem is 
  that the first "A" denotes MORE than the 
  second "A." This then is the improved 
  and correct notation of holism:

  (super)A = (in)A + (out)A

  Or we could say: A = +A + -A, where the 
  unsigned A implies the union of in and out.
  (Super)A is the set that contains all that 
  defines the identity of (in)A. If we wish 
  to define the structure of identity, this
  is the proper notation. If we want to de-
  note only one aspect of the identity stru-
  cture of A, then we only denote that aspect,
  but that dose NOT denote identity structure,
  only the part of it we want to talk about,
  and that's what communication is about. But
  if we want to know who we get those things 
  that we talk about, we need to define holism.

  The argument that (super)A is not a meaning-
  ful or useful way of defining A may or may
  not be true, however, that commentary is
  beside the point. The goal of scientific
  inquiry is the map the structure of what 
  is, and identity is, and a mapping of the 
  identity of A that fails to denote the 
  mechanics of the entire superstructure of
  A is a mapping that is NOT the whole truth.
  I believe that the whole truth is the true
  and deepest goal of scientific inquiry.

  IAN: BoInG! But but... now wait a minute there. :)
  But seriously: Yes, in that we can meaningfully 
  denote a given subset of things as "a conspiracy" 
  if, and only if, we can denote another set of 
  things that are "not a conspiracy."  We would 
  properly state this: C <=> -C, and if C did 
  not imply -C, C could not be implied. As
  such, this symmetrical implication 
  defines a logical union.

  C = (-C => C) C is its implication by -C.
 -C = (C => -C) -C is its implication by C.
  The holistic point (so to say) is that the
  identity structure of C contains both C and -C.

the drive might read the boot sector of the disk, but it does not execute
it.  AFAIK, you cannot get a virus simply by sticking the disk in the
drive, and even if you read data from the floppy you still cannot get the
boot record virii (unless, of course, you execute a program on the floppy
which contains the virus).  The only way to get a boot sector virus,
outside executing an executable with a virus, is to boot from a floppy, in
which case the disk's boot sector gets loaded by the BIOS and executed.
This is the reason why boot sector virii are almost extincts since the
need to boot from floppy is extinct.  Same as above holds for CDs.  
Reading data cannot heart, executing it does.

seems to me that the problem is that thinking takes too much effort for most
people. far easier to let someone else think for them, f'r instance, their
"Psychic Hotline"... 

i realise that my posts tend to sound a little disparaging of the mental
abilities of most people, but the evidence is all 'round me, in the papers, on
tv, even just walking down the block.  i am often astounded at the sheer
ignorance, stupidity, and obliviousness i witness. 
i'd be interested to know how the list feels about this. do you feel that
people in general are smarter than they are given credit for?..does it only
seem as if the general level of knowledge, understanding, and intelligence is
slipping?..or is this a legitimate concern?
i dislike to be so negative, but at least once a day i find myself frustrated
or inconvenienced by someone's boneheadedness
i'd appreciate some feedback from the list.. thanks.Cori

   IAN: But here's the paradox creeping back:
   If "A" = "to denote A" and if to denote A
   is to denote -A by implication, then A = -A.

   If the external area immediatley around this
   letter A is equal to the internal area in the
   formation of that letter, then the letter is
   equally BOTH of those areas, and thus A = -A.
   That masters the very "edge" of the paradox.

   I think I talk to myself almost as much as 
   I talk to others here. Hay, I keep an eye on 
   me, it's tough job but someone's got to do it! %^)

By this, I presume you meant that a couple of hundred people think 
"rationally" all the time? Leaving aside the difficulty in defining 
"rational" in the present context [1], I doubt that there has ever been a 
human being anywhere who was always rational. If you meant it in the more 
restricted sense of with respect to this issue, then you are wrong by 
many orders af magnitude. Based upon the best information known to 
them (which is usually very poor), the rational opinion for most people 
to have on this subject is either "I don't know whether immortality would 
be a good thing", or "I'd like it, but I don't think it's very likely". 
These are both opinions which I've heard expressed or implied quite often 
by a wide variety of people.

On a more general note, I have often been intrigued when reading the 
biographies of creative people to note the existence of huge blind spots 
in their thinking.  I wonder if this may not be more of an advantage 
to their creative abilities than a disadvantage. Profound knowledge 
combined with profound ignorance seems to be quite common amongst the 
most creative scientists. James Watson's "The Double Helix" is a good 
example. 

[1] It is quite possible to construct a value system which implies 
that immortality is a bad idea. If Hayflick's value system is of this 
type, then his conclusion is quite rational, although his stated 
reasoning is not.

Maybe intelligence should be viewed at several levels. There's the
personal intelligence, at which level a LOT of people seems stupid and
ignorant. :-)

Then theres the public, common, shared democratic intelligence where
some kind of subconcoius consensus decides what is right or wrong. Where
the local stupidity in an individual is leveled out by means of
statistics. Like the invisible hand in the marketplace, and the
selection of government in a democracy.

The thing is that it is impossible to be very smart in the many areas
that this world offers. How many people are really experts in things
like society, technology, art, bussines, sociology, politics etc. If
there's an infinite way to view things, and things to know, and we can
only learn a small subset of them really well. Then we are in fact all
pretty stupid aren't we? But somehow society seems to be humping along
pretty ok. 
Probably Because we all decide from that little subset of things that we
know. All those subsets probably makes for smart decisions if theres
enough of them overlapping in a big population.

<disclaimer> I do not know enough quantum to say very much about it;
anything I do say may be wrong.  Please be polite when you correct me.
</disclaimer>

However, I do know enough about light to say that the energy of light is
NOT given by mc^2. This is the rest energy of particles which HAVE mass; 
photons don't.  The REAL relativistic equation is actually E^2 = p^2*c^2 +
m^2*c^4, where p here is the momentum, given by (g)^2*m^2*v^2 for normal
particles, where (g) is given by 1/(1 - v^2/c^2)^0.5.  Plug the equation
for momentum into the relativistic equation and you get E^2 = (g)^2*m^2*
v^2*c^2 + m^2*c^4.  Factor this and you can get E^2 = (g)^2*m^2*c^2*(v^2 +
c^2).  For very small velocities, v^2 + c^2 ~= c^2 and (g) ~= 1.  So we
get E^2 = m^2*c^4, or E = m*c^2.

Obviously, the approximations we make for the rest energy of slow moving
particles is completely wrong; for light, which has no mass, the second
term of the first equation drops off altogether, and we get E^2 = p^2*c^2,
or E = p/c.  The energy on a photon is given by h*f where f is the
frequency, so we can get f = p/h/c.  Using the definition of wavelength
that x = c/f, we get x = h*c^2/p. 

We run up against a similar problem, however, when we do try to identify
the frequency (though very different from the one which you had originally
posited in your first post).  h and c are indeed constants, so the more
precisely you know a particle's wavelength the less precisely you know its
position.  Many people have taken the uncertainty principle to be saying
that were we to know the precise location of a photon, it would exist
EVERYWHERE; while this is often a useful way to think about it, this is
not strictly correct.  A photon whose wavelength is known perfectly may be
said to exist *anywhere* in the entire universe; a photon whose position
is known perfectly must be said to have *any* frequency.

Does this contradict the idea of Tarskian truth statements?  Not
necessarily.  Again, a large part of the reason who we have Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle is because particles move about in an apparently
random way, bounded by certain probability functions (which are themselves
very specific and well-defined).  So if we know the particle to exist at
precisely one location, its momentum will be completely *random*.  By
definition, no equation can predict the completely random; we cannot
therefore state, a priori, what that momentum will be.

Does that mean that the blueness of a particle whose position is known
perfectly is in an "ambiguous" state of blueness?  No, it means that the
particle is in a *random* state of blueness.  If you want to find out
perfectly if it's blue or not, you'll have to measure its momentum
perfectly, at which point it will have a perfectly random location.

What truth value to prescribe precisely at the border will be given by the
proper definition; for example, if blue happens when the wavelength is
greater than or equal to 450, then not blue is anything less than 450.  If
a particle's position is known precisely, it will have a random blueness.

Not ambiguous, UNCERTAIN.  That's why they don't call it the ambiguity
principle and why they DO call it the uncertainty principle.  And despite
the fact that the blueness will be completely random, it WILL be either
blue or not blue, despite the fact that we cannot measure which while we
know the position perfectly.

I presume you are alluding to the Shroedinger equation, by which you would
say that something was blue if the probability function of its momentum
fell within certain well-defined boundaries.  Interestingly enough, you
are right about the fact that it would not bear any relation to what we
call blue, but not because it involved complex numbers.

The easiest way to explain this is with something like the Gaussian
distribution, better known as the bell curve.  Suppose for a moment that
you had a probability function which looked like the bell curve.  Its
width at the points of inflection would be the standard error (which is
actually the value which is used in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle). 
Using it, we are accustomed to saying that a particle's position, momentum
or whatever is given by the position of the absolute maximum value on this
graph, +/- the standard error.  490 +/- 5 nm, for example.

However, look at the bell curve again.  It is not bounded by these points;
rather > 80% of its area falls within these boundaries; there is a small
chance that the particle, as described above, should have a wavelength of
400nm, an even smaller chance that it should have a wavelength of 600nm,
and a remote but non-zero probability that it should be 2nm.  If we were
to say that a particle was blue if its probability function met certain
well-defined criterion, then we would have to say that the above random
particles would be blue, despite the fact that their wavelength would
agree much more with purple or even red.  We'd still call it blue,
however, because the probability of it having a wavelength that small or
that large was small.  In other words, an unlikely red is blue. 

We don't need complex numbers for this, since the probability function is
actually the square of the Schroedinger function (which is the one with
the complex numbers), but it DOES give us some pretty non-intutive
results.  For that reason, I'm perfectly fine with saying that red is
bounded by particular wavelengths, rather than particular probabilities,
and that sometimes the redness of a light is truly random.

This, of course, presumes that any value system is rational, which I'd say
is a highly controversial premise.

It seems to me that any definition of practical rationality must on some
level include some element which prevents one from contradicting one's
self and one's stated values.  It seems to me that a death wish like
Hayflick's would therefore not meet this criterion.

I LOVE people.  I think they're great.  People are by far the niftiest
things on earth, IMO.  I love my friends especially, not all of whom are
transhumanists.  That makes me sad, because it means I'm going to lose
someone I love, but I don't think less of them for doing so.  Maybe this
is completely attitudinal, but there are so many good people out there
with so much great stuff going on in their minds (even if it's not all
rational!)... it's mindboggling.

If you haven't seen much goodness in people, maybe you haven't been
looking hard enough.  I see it all the time, in everybody I see and talk
to.  It's different from the kind of intelligence you'll find here, but
it's very special, and I consider it a special treat when people are
willing to share it with me. 

Call me a dynamic optimist, but I think people are good, basically
rational, and nifty to be around, even when they disagree with me.

Augh!  It was right up until here...  E = pc = hf = hc/x and therefore x =

Well that's only if we keep viewing programs as finished blocks of code
like it is now. If instead we view it as evolving systems, which
upgrades/updates in realtime. Then there's suddenly a very god
possibility of copy protection of software. What if you made some
software that people really wants which upgrades via the net by the use
of a serial number. Then there would be good reasons to "subscribe" to
the software. It would be easy to close down a number that updated too
many times and from too many places.

Also it would be both possible and wise to rent out this kind of
software more inexpensively than software currently is. As any good
bussinesman can tell you. The easiest customer to get is a return
customer. This would furthermore discourage from pirating due to the low
price.

I think there is far to much emphasis on open source, and the free
software on the net. Of course theres Linux, but it's still a fringe
product, And the few good examples of open source doesn't make for a
complete change in the way of the world. Netscape btw. still has to
prove that their open way of doing things is better than Microsofts.
Naturally distribution systems and pricing will change, but most of our
software will still cost money. We will might not buy it in big dead
lumps like today but more like a flexible subscription.

Freeware, and open source will coexist together with traditional
of-the-shelf products, and any other way we can concieve selling and
distributing software.

If there's only one 'copy' of the software, then

I have a floppy disk in hand with a benign Stealth C variant virus. In order to
get your virus protection software to go all bongo over this virus on this
floppy, all you have to do is stick it in the drive. Do nothing else. You also
do not need to be in Windows for this to happen. It does the same thing in DOS.
I have tested this myself, as I keep the floppy as a good way to safely test
antivirus software installations with real virii that do no damage.

BTW, if you want a copy of this virus, all you have to do is exchange files over
the internet with anyone on a PC at Sturm Ruger, Inc. Their entire network is
infested with it, or was the last I heard. Be sure to have your antivirus
software on when you receive it.

I was under the impression that the Stealth C variant virus I have on a disk is
a boot sector virus. If stealth viruses are not boot sector types, please let me

Cori, obviously you don't teach undergraduates in California. 20% of my
college juniors and seniors in a junior level class are academically functioning
at or below middle school level.
That is todays norm!

I'd put it differently: it acknowledges that any non-trivial system of 
thought requires certain founding assumptions. Using these founding 
assumptions is not an irrational procedure, unless you wish to declare 
all systems of thought irrational.

In the case of transhumanists, the founding assumptions, or basic values, 
are such that life extension is a rational goal. Other systems of thought 
do not necessarily imply that.

How does it fail to meet this criteria?

You are right. He is right. The energy is given by:  e=h/x, or the Planck's
constant divided by the wavelength. Gven this energy measurement, you can derive
the mass value of a photon as a function of its energy, when that energy is
translated at the end of the photon's trajectory, i.e. when it is absorbed. Its
quantum 'mass' is given by m=h/xc^2. Because its energy can therefore be
measured in terms of mass, it can be described as a particle in certain
circumstances, i.e. when its kinetic energy is absorbed.

Yes, while the frequency of each photon cannot be measured with certainty, you
can measure their average wavelegth with a certain amount of precision, with
variance depending on the accuracy of your instrument. If the accuracy of your
instrument that measures the average wavelegnth is less than +/- 1 nm, then you
have created a bivalent situation, where there is Truth and Falsity.

Yes, chromaticity graphs typically measure the wavelength of light usually by
the peak of the bell curve. Given that you have the vast majority of diffused
light in the sky generated by nitrogen, and some oxygen, as well as particulate
content (I doubt that Tarsky thought much about smog), then you can pretty much
depend on the distribution bell curves for these two gasses overlayed and summed
to determine the actual wavelength seen, depending on the angle of diffraction
the sun is at relative to your present point on the earth. Given the sun's angle
and the diffusion distribution curves, you can determine with quite a bit of
precision whether or not the sky is indeed blue.

The human eye tends to make its 'color' determinetion based on the peak of the
bell curve, or in the case of multiple substances, like nitrogen and oxygen
having offset bell curves with differing amplitudes, its a matter of averaging
the two peaks together....

 Lately, the song lyrics that stick in my head at work are from Elvis Costello:

"Everybody knows, that the world is full of stupid people....."

I sing it when some customer has sent me absolute garbage data and expects me to
wean gold from it....without telling me what format it is in, ascii or ebcdic,
record length, block size, or data density......arrrggghhhh..... I guess they must
think I'm a real wizard to be able to figure this all out ........So I look at it
this way: That I am so smart is what allows me to have such a fun job with no
physical strain or stress..... and make decent money. If everyone were as smart as
me I'd probably have to work hard at a real job..... I'd rather be a big fish over
being an average sized or small fish any day of the week....

Simple:  when you choose not to extend your life, you choose to die.  When
you are dead, you are unable to pursue your own interests (barring
afterlife presumptions).  Therefore, when you choose to die, you choose to
contradict the rest of your value system, if your life has any use at all
in bringing about that which you value.

Since I doubt that Hayflick would like it if I offered to kill him, we may
presume that he values his own life or that his life is extrinsically
useful in bringing about that which he DOES value.  Whichever it is, if
immortality is possible then he necessarily contradicts his own value
system by refusing it. 

This may not be true if for some reason his life ceased to be
extrinsically useful in bringing about what he valued.  However, it is
probably false to presume that it never could given lots of time.  So even
this case is not sufficiently strong to endorse suicide.

I would not assume that people are stupider today than in the past, unless
you have actually interviewed people who lived many decades ago.

It would be more precise to say truth OR falsity.  If we define blue to be
a single photon with a wavelength above a certain threshold, Measuring an
average to within +/- 1 nm means that some of the particles will be above
the threshold and some below, or that some of the light is truly blue and
some is not. For an individual particle, however, it would be wrong to say
that the statement is true and false.  Fortunately, since we're talking in
a metalanguage here, we can imagine statements sufficiently well defined
to eliminate ambiguity such as "the light is blue" would cause in this
example. 

To return to my waltzing example, on the first beat of each measure my
average location will be on the border of Mexico and America.  If "in
Mexico" is defined to be located anywhere from the border south, then I am
in Mexico and I am in America.  This is not the same as saying Truth AND
Falsehood, unless we posit the illogical premise that "If one is in
America, one cannot be in Mexico."  Clearly, since you are in America and
in Mexico when you are on the border, the premise is false; it would be
true if one was in Mexico if and only if one was SOUTH of the border, in
which case I would be in neither America nor in Mexico when I was standing
on the border; again, this is only a problem if we posit that "One must be
in either Mexico or America," an obviously false premise under these
definitions.

True, but take this example to its logical extreme:  450 +/- 300nm would
hardly be called blue by most, despite the fact that its peak may lie in
the blue range.

At any rate, if we say that something is blue or not depending on what the
probability curve looks like rather than the wavelength of the individual
particle, then you NEVER have ambiguity of the sort described here:
quantum DOES allow you to describe the shape of the probability curve for
location and for momentum with perfect precision; you never even have to
have uncertainty in a well defined example of this sort.

Who decides who is worthy of invitation?  And more importantly, what makes those who
invite worthy of inviting?  Although I agree the intention of having an invite only
list will increase the overall level of dialogue, it will also have the opposite
effect of shielding out others who might have intelligent ideas to contribute.  The
Polymath list is a perfect case in point.  The level of discussion is intelligent
but also completely inbred.  I don't see much memetic evolution taking place there -
only the same ideas hashed over again, with an occasional new hypothesis to stir
things up.

My view is similar. I think most people are pretty smart, when they WANT to
be. Unfortunately, too many people are willing to idle their way through
life and let others make thier decisions for them. The present state of the
US Government is ample evidence of this.

In the case of extreme circumstances, many of the idlers will wake up and
show their true capabilities. Unfortunately for them, probably fortunately
for us, such situations are few and far between.

Ok, that statement may have been a bit vague. By rational I mean 
"transhumanistsic", see also below. Of course no-one is purely
rational, or rational all the time, but one can be "basically rational".

So the rational reaction would be to investigate the possibilities (like
we did), instead of staying passive and ignorant. No-one really wants
to be stupid, sick, or grow old and die. Immortality and transcendence
are ancient human dreams, and one of the main reasons why people
have invented religion. What makes transhumanists more rational than
others is that they actively seek the most reliable method(s) to reach that
common human goal, instead of relying on fables, or accepting defeat
without even trying to fight. Because of the more or less common goal,
you *can* say that, for example, transhumanism is superior to religion;
it's a better tool for the job. 

> These are both opinions which I've heard expressed or implied quite often

So have I, but their fault is not their initial ignorance, but their refusal to
listen to sound arguments (let alone to do some research). Even if
you present the facts in the most clear, user friendly, completely
pre-chewed form they still won't listen. That is IMHO stupid.

A consistent stupidity is still a stupidity.

We could have a democratic vote ;-) Or use such guidelines as: membership
of a (any) transhumanist organization, suspension contract, frequency
of postings to the list etc, anything that indicates that this person takes
transhumanism seriously, and isn't just some lurking journalist looking
for a scandal, secret service guy looking for a bust, christian fanatic
looking for a spam etc. It's meant as a protective measure, *not* some
kind of elitism (for elitism, there's already the invitation-only Polymath 
list, for example).

There would still be the main free-or-all list, no ideas would have to be lost.
Again, the proposed list is meant as a sort of free zone, where you can
say anything without worrying about general transhuman PR.

Yes, that's why discussions should be conducted as much as possible in the
open, and only taken "backstage" when absolutely necessary. Nevertheless,
right now we don't have a "backstage" (except for private email, which isn't
too convenient for broader discussions), and it would be nice to have one,
just in case.

This is a start, though it is a highly intuitive argument with some
problems.  For
instance, it is debatable that humans were the top predator species until long
after they came to be.  There seems to be some evidence that early humans
were scavengers.  Even though many predators resort to scavenging, if humans
were scavenging, is there any reason to believe that had humans coexisted
with dinosuars, they could not just as easily scavenged off of the latter?

There is more to it than this, but I'm moving tomorrow, so I've to run.

Cheers!

Cori, I am not sure how transhumanism can impact this. Perhaps by being
a forum for thought.

A good part of the problem is the k-12 system. You might like to look
at Martin Haberman's article Unemployment Training in Phi Delta Kappan March
1997 which outlines how the school system is much of the problem.

Reminds me of a conversation with Ralph Merkle. We were bemoaning the slow

1. There's a basic evolutionary strategy, (Yes I'v read my Dawkins and this 
statement is waay to telelogical...) of "just good enough". Minimization of
effort. Most of the world doesn't need much effort or intelligence to deal
with in a minimal way.

2. Many of the power structures treat people as rather dumb 5 year olds, and
the simplest response is just to act like one....

The magazine of a national daily newspaper this weekend ("The Australian
Magazine May 30-31 1998") devoted an issue to 'future technologies'.
All newbie stuff and no new news, but Extropians got a mention.

Carole Parker (author of 'The Joy of Cybersex') in an article beginning page
43 titled "Getting it on - line" slides us in between tele-dildonics (don't
ask) and VR.
She writes;
"Perhaps, as the extropian movement hopes, your computer will one day be
implanted in your brain and it will transmit your thoughts to another 'post
human' in computer-mediated telepathy.  Your body may just become the lump
of flesh you would like to leave behind as you send your inner self off into
the ether.  And which will be more real ?  Your flesh or virtual self ?  At
that point it may be taken that your body is merely occupying space on earth
while your mind is involved in a society that has no physical presence as we
know it now."

Australian subscribers should tune into the first new Geoffrey Robertson
'Hypothetical' at 9.40pm on ch7 (June1 Bris,Syd - June 4 Melb, Adel, Perth)
His subject is 'Send in the Clones'.

Yes, this is a great example of how IP can actually work in the future.
Even among 'warz haqrz' the demand for the very latest 'day 0' software is
massive.  Art and technology go hand in hand in our desire to have the
latest and best.  However I would probably come down on the 'open source'
side more than Max does.

Even with your subscription software, the delay to the pirate market is
still small.  You have a better chance than current methods simply because
your greater efficiency gives you a lower price and therefore makes it a
less attractive target for piracy.

The big winners in the open source model are those who offer commercial
support contracts for their 'free, unsupported software'.  No-one can ever
pirate the experience and knowledge of the authors, and software is too
complex and commercial liabilities too large for support services to become
obsolete in the near term.

It is not still up to these people to prove that their open source can make
them a lot of money... What do you suppose Linus Torvalds is earning at his
new job ?  What about Phil Zimmerman ?
There are lots of examples of this.  None of them expect that their personal
business model will leave them short of a dollar for a long time to come,
regardless of where technology and law end up.  We should be looking to them
for the models that will work.

One thing I'd like to see is the ability to join the Extropy Institue
'anonymously'
Lots of people here are thinking for the long term....  Paid up membership
lists have been the downfall of many bright young minds even in your land of
the free.

This might be some way off, especially because it would require complete
online delivery of magazines etc.  Also need some fancy crypto-tech at your
end.  Please keep this in mind though.

Title
  Effect on mortality and
  reinfarction of adding fruits and vegetables to a prudent
  diet in the Indian experiment of infarct survival (IEIS).
Source
  Journal of the American College of Nutrition.  12(3):255-61, 1993 Jun.
Abstract
  The effects of antioxidant-rich foods as adjuncts to a
  prudent diet were compared for 12 weeks in a randomized, single-blind and
  controlled trial in 204 (group A) and 202 (group B) patients with acute
  myocardial infarction. There was a significant decrease in cardiac end points
  in group A compared to group B (37 vs 58, p < 0.01) after 12 weeks. Within
  intervention group A, those 108 patients with greater adherence to the
  intervention program showed a greater reduction in cardiac end points (14 vs
  58, p < 0.001), and a significant decrease in total
  mortality (6 vs 28, p < 0.001), including cardiac
  mortality (6 vs 25, p < 0.01) compared to group B.
  Underlying these beneficial effects, antioxidant-rich foods
  caused a significantly smaller rise in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cardiac
  enzyme in group A than in group B (427.8 vs 561.6 IU/dL), indicating that the
  protective influence of such a diet may be observed within 1 week. The subset
  of group A patients showing reduction in mortality also had
  a lesser rise in LDH and greater reduction in blood lipids, blood glucose and
  blood pressures. Antioxidant-rich foods also caused a significant decrease in
  blood lipids with a lower decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in
  group A than in group B. Assay of serum level of antioxidants and long-term
  follow-up may confirm our observations.

Additional information from tables 2 & 3:

  Total fruit and vegetable intake (grams.day) versus total mortality:

                    High Adherence Low Adherence Controls
Fruit & vegetables   652 grams/day     492         182
Mortality:             5.5%             10.4%       13.8%

Title
  The effect of phytohaemagglutinin at different dietary concentrations on the
  growth, body composition and plasma insulin of the rat.
Source
  British Journal of Nutrition.  76(4):613-26, 1996 Oct.
Abstract
  Young growing rats weighing approximately 83 g were fed on diets containing
  kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) lectin (phytohaemagglutinin, PHA) in the
  range of 0-0.45 g/kg body weight for 10 d to ascertain whether there was a
  minimum dose below which the lectin had no significant effect on body and
  skeletal muscle weights in comparison with pair-fed lectin-free controls.
  Averaged over all experiments, PHA doses of less than 10 mg/d (0.12 g/kg body
  weight) reduced body dry by 1.14 (SE 0.25) g when compared with controls.
  Between 10 and 27 mg/d (0.12-0.32 g/kg body weight) a further reduction of
  0.64 (SE 0.21) g occurred, suggesting a slight but steady decline of body dry
  weight with increasing dose. However, above 27 mg/d the depression of growth
  and changes in body composition accelerated. The difference between the
  proportional losses of skeletal muscle and body weight was not significant at
  doses of PHA below 10 mg/d (0.12 g/kg body weight) but the ratio of these
  losses rose to 1.5-2.0 at doses above this. The proportional decrease in
  lipid weight exceeded that of both body and skeletal muscle weights at all
  lectin doses, suggesting that lipid catabolism was the first target of the
  PHA effect. Plasma insulin level was depressed at the PHA dose of 0.02 g/kg
  body weight at which growth depression and muscle atrophy were minimal but,
  contrary to expectations, plasma glucose levels remained stable over the
  whole PHA dose range. It appears that despite a PHA-induced lowering of blood
  insulin, glucose catabolism is elevated by an unknown, possibly hormonal,
  compensatory mechanism. Thus, because low insulin levels facilitate the
  mobilization and catabolism of lipids, it may be possible to use low doses of
  PHA to reduce hyperglycaemia and body fat.

And what if you can't read, don't have time to read, don't have access to 
a wide variety of information sources? Like most of the world's population.

What if you do satisfy the above, but don't have the technical background 
to delve into the research literature on aging. Whose opinions should one 
trust? On what basis? See also below; advocates of one point of view are 
not usually terribly reliable.

Oh. I haven't had that problem with people I've discussed this with, who 
are, admittedly, mostly scientists. In the case of scientist, a more usual 
response is to respond with an analysis of the entire situation with 
respect to aging research, which usually concludes with cautious 
optimism. I've found that the Hayflick Limit and the telomere cap 
shortening, at least, seem to be very well known.
  
In conversations with non-scientists, I've found that many are willing to 
take the possibility of preventing aging quite seriously. Present a 
_balanced_ account of research to any person, and they  will start to give 
serious thought to the possibility. The essential  point is that if your 
views ought to be taken seriously, then there is little need for the biased 
and sometimes overblown claims so common on these lists.

Try to present both the pluses and the minuses of the 
research. I try never to trust an advocate, unless they've shown 
themselves to be thoroughly familiar with the problems of what they're 
advocating. Indeed, I would go so far as to applaud somebody who remained 
a sceptic about aging research after being bombarded with the usual 
trashumanist spiel about aging; only if that spiel were balanced by an 
account of the difficulties faced in aging research would I regard it as 
rational for them to respond with enthusiasm.

Incidentally, this is one aspect of Anders Sandberg's web site which I 
like very much -- what appears to be an attempt to balance the discussion 
somewhat. Even more links to discussions of the problems with nanotech 
etcetera would be appreciated -- provided such links exist!

In this instance, I'd simply conclude that a meeting of minds was not 
possible, due to differences in basic assumptions, and leave it at that. 
Provided such people don't try to interfere with my goals, there is no 
reason to abuse their value system.

But it's much deeper than just a measurement problem because Heisenberg's  
Uncertainty Principle is only a small part of Quantum Mechanics, and by the 
standards of that bizarre science a conventional part.  It's a little strange 
that there's a relationship between  position and momentum, and a limit on 
our knowledge of the product of both,  but it's not irrational. On the other 
hand there are some aspects of modern physics can only be described as crazy. 
Take the famous 2 slit experiment for example, shine a light on 2 closely 
spaced slits and it will produce a complex interference pattern on a film, 
even if the photons are sent out one at a time. If a photon goes through one 
slit it wouldn't seem to matter if the other slit, the one it didn't go 
though, was there or not, but it does.

Even stranger, place a polarizing filter set at 0 degrees over one slit, and  
one set at  90 degrees over the other, the interference pattern disappears. 
Now place a third filter set at 45 degrees one inch in front of the film and  
10 light years from the slits. The interference pattern comes back, even 
though you didn't decide to put the filter in front of the film until 10 years 
after the photons passed the slits! Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle does 
not enter in any of this, it's not that the photon goes through one slit and 
we just don't know which one, it must go through the left slit only, and the 
right slit only, and both slits, and no slit at all, and it must do all these 
things at the same time. Fundamental ambiguity in nature? Fundamental  
ignorance of some new law of logic? Backward causality? Parallel universes?  
None of the above? I have no idea. 

If this seems pretty stupid and completely ridiculous I don't blame you a bit, 
but I'm the wrong person to receive the  complaint, send it to God.

I agree with your entire post, excepting part of the first paragraph. The 
post is not really related to my original comment, though. Recall that the 
comment I made was a caveat, which I do not seriously expect to apply in 
many instances. For example, it was not intended to apply to Hayflick. I 
was merely pointing out that it is possible to hold a consisitent 
philosophy which leads one to conclude that immortality is a bad thing.

As a counter-example to your first paragraph, I offer euthanasia, which I 
believe is sometimes justified. This is not a counter-example to your 
conclusions, incidentally, but to your assumptions: this is a situation 
in which your life may have no use to you in bringing about the things 
you value.

this does not mean that the virus would be activated just by sticking it
into the floppy drive.  The virus protection software you are running is
running all the time i guess (background in windows, and as a TSR in dos),
and when you stick the disk in the drive and the boot sector is read, the
virus protection detects the virus in the disk.
The virus does not need to run for the virus protection software to detect
it (in fact, if it runs, it's too late).  Try the experiment.  grab an old
hard drive you don't need, stick the disk in the floppy, take it out, and
then check if the virus is in the hard drive.  I bet you 99-1 that it is
not.

i think that the stealth virus you've got is a boot sector virus, but
AFAIK, not all stealth virii are, by definition, boot sector virii.

  IAN: Nevertheless (and this was the initial point 
  disputed) that does not mean that the truth in the 
  physical reality is fuzzy, as in being less than 
  100% true at any time. If the physical reality is
  strange and chaotic, then that is the 100% truth.

  The idea that it means truth is fuzzy, is simply 
  a measure of a disjunction between what we think
  subatomic entities SHOULD do and what they do do;
  thus "fuzzy truth" measures, as it does in the 
  macro, a disjunction between ideas and reality.

Most likely. However, I have many student with English as a second language
and they do quite well. On a non verbal IQ test many of my students do not
score very well and the results are comparable. English proficiency may be a
cofactor
in one case. To give you an idea of the situation a undergrad college
population has an average IQ of 103-104. My junior class scores 101 to 102
on both verbal and nonverbal items. 103-104 is the population norm now!

Ra, right on. There is the concept of the boutique workforce. That modern
technological society does not need a large percentage of highly intelligent
individuals but a certain critical number to full key jobs.
At least the evidence is that the members of the boutique workforce are getting
somewhat well paid. A term use for them is "Gold Collar Workers"

Too many might lead to political unrest.

No problem... but despite the general weirdness of this behavior, I still
assert that it doesn't in any way subvert truth and falsehood.  In this
case, the slit experiments TRULY act weirdly, and when you do these
experiments, you'll definitely get these results.  It's not like you will
and you won't get them, or anything like that.  Rather you ALWAYS do, and

I've seen some counter the theory that the 
left brain is the technical mathematical side
of the brain and the right brain is the artistic
visual side of the brain (they probably both play
a role in those functions to some degree). Here's 
a report that speaks to this issue, entitled:

Right, well, you said:

I'd put it differently: it acknowledges that any non-trivial system of
thought requires certain founding assumptions. Using these founding
assumptions is not an irrational procedure, unless you wish to declare
all systems of thought irrational.

In the case of transhumanists, the founding assumptions, or basic values,
are such that life extension is a rational goal. Other systems of thought
do not necessarily imply that.

Obviously I do not wish to declare all axiomatic systems of thought
irrational (though, interestingly enough, this is a central idea in
pan-critical rationalism), however, I instead asserted that a value-ethic
is rational if and only if it is consistent; ie it does not advocate
actions which contradict its stated values.

And it was my attempt, in showing that choosing to die necessarily
contradicts other values, to show that this is not the case, and one must
be inconsistent in order to conclude that immortality is a bad thing.

I see euthanasia as being not-rational for the one whose suicide is being
assisted, but possibly rational for the one assisting; again, so long as
this does not contradict their value system (which need not incorporate
OTHER living beings in order to remain consistent but must at least
include oneself) then the assistant is acting rationally.

If immortality is possible, however, it seems difficult to rationally
justify suicide in any form:  So what if you've got an "incurable"
disease?  With cryonic suspension you could have immortality, and your
painful disease will be cured and you will go on to live a long, healthy,
and prosperous life.

            "First, we kill all the 11-year-olds..."

  Meaner than the mean kids who go on shooting sprees are the measures 
adults are pursuing in the name of combating crime -- including proposed 
legislation to execute preteens. 

BY ROBIN TEMPLETON | A series of high-profile school-site killings by 
young boys -- including last week's shooting spree in a Springfield, 
Ore., high school cafeteria -- have precipitated a more predictable 
horror: proposed legislation to try 10-year-olds as adults and apply the
 death penalty to 11-year-olds. It is as if a handful of problem 
children -- "mean kids" we call them -- are absolving adults of having 
to deal with the problems of children. 

"Current juvenile laws could not have anticipated violent crimes being 
committed by children this young," explains Texas State Rep. Jim Pitts, 
who is sponsoring the latest round of legislation. 

But it is Pitts' generation that warrants concern. For the past 
quarter-century, aging baby boomers -- not children or teenagers -- have 
driven the upsurge in violent crime. The FBI reports that arrest rates 
for violent crime have doubled for 30- to 49-year-olds since 1975. 
Homicide by children under 13 occurs less frequently today than in 1965. 


Texas is not a lone state. Long before Jonesboro, the governors of 
California and New Mexico appealed in the name of victims of juvenile 
crime for laws to lower their states' execution ages to 14 and 13, 
respectively. On state and federal fronts, efforts are proliferating to 
sentence children as adults, abolish the protective segregation of child 
from adult inmates and limit parole for juvenile offenders. New Jersey 
is deploying military-designed satellite technology to track juvenile 
parolees cuffed with 8-pound transmitters. The head of the state's 
Juvenile Justice Commission boasts that the system is like "Star Wars." 

In short, the war on crime has become obsessed with young people -- but 
as targets rather than victims, predators rather than prey. Which 
shouldn't surprise young people. After all, children are far more apt to 
be murdered by adults -- including their own parents -- than the other 
way around. "The only time people really pay attention to kids is if we 
pick up a gun and blast somebody," a 16-year-old friend observed a week 
after the schoolyard killings in Jonesboro, Ark. Yet most young people 
are more concerned about missing breakfast than dodging bullets. Some 12 
million children are malnourished in America today, according to the 
Children's Defense Fund. The poverty rate of young people overall is 50 
percent higher today than it was in 1970. 

Adults' response to all this would make Charles Dickens shudder: Since 
1970 we have cut back spending on education by at least 25 percent and 
upped funding for incarceration by $3.2 billion. If the present rate of 
incarceration continues, one out of every 20 children born in 1997 will 
spend time behind bars. For males the figure will be one out of 11, and 
for African-American males it will be one in four. 

The irony is that the generation of baby boomers backing these policies 
grew up, by and large, distrusting adults. Today it is adults who 
distrust the young. A Rand Corporation survey in 1996 found that 
American adults believe juveniles cause 50 percent of violent crime. The 
FBI, by contrast, reported that year that juveniles caused 10 to 15 
percent of violent crime. Last March -- the same week that media 
headlined the Jonesboro shootings -- the FBI reported a 30 percent drop 
in the juvenile homicide rate over the past three years. 

"I know what World War III will be -- a war against teenagers," 
predicted Emilio, 17, after watching "Twelve Monkeys," a film about 
postapocalyptic dystopia. According to the National Criminal Justice 
Commission, spending on crime fighting is actually increasing three 
times faster than defense spending. The spectre of 10- and 11-year-olds 
dressed in camouflage, toting rifles as they stalk their peers, serves 
as the new "Red menace" for a prison-industrial complex that is coming 
to rival the military-industrial complex. This time the enemy is among 
us -- our own children. 

Wars, of course, can be useful. World War II drafted 10 million American 
men after the Great Depression rendered more than 15 million Americans 
jobless. In deindustrializing economies, prisons convert otherwise 
expendable and potentially subversive residents into raw material and 
profit margins. The war on crime is assimilating young people on the 
margins by criminalizing them largely for nonviolent, economically 
motivated offenses such as drug possession. Three-strikes-you're-out 
laws make it clear that there is no such thing as redemption once you've 
activated the tripwire. 

Facing up to Springfield -- or Pearl, Miss., or Memphis or Jonesboro -- 
will require acknowledging that children devalue life to the extent that 
the adult world devalues their lives. In towns long considered America's 
heartland, mean children are arming themselves in imitation of adults 
increasingly determined to prove they can be meaner.

  It isn't at all odd!  Classically, all particles can spin (and 
  counter-spin) and vibrate on three orthogonal axes.  The complexity of 
  frequency-generating properties is awesome.  Anything with a frequency 
  has an accompanying wavelength.

  If particles of light are considered as rotating electric dipoles, they 
  have all the frequency characteristics exhibited by photons.
  
  Similarly, if alpha-particles (helium nuclei) are considered as rotating 
  systems they will have an accompanying frequency, and will evidence 
  interference effects.  Surely enough, they do.

  I must insist that you not conflate Quantum Theory (initially, the study 
  of light as quanta or particles) with Quantum _Mechanics_, which is a 
  subset of approximation methods.

      Heisenberg's point is that 'observing' an object entails bouncing 
      light off it, so we can see where it is or what it's like.  But the 
      impact of the 'observational' photons disturbs the object.  Thus we 
      may only select a particular (!) attribute for 'observation.'
      
      All this 'observationalist' stuff is positivist old hat and can be 
      demolished quite readily.  We can _retrodictively correct_ the 
      observation results.
      
      You then waffle on about the measurements of blue photons from the 
      sky.  All his life, Leonardo da Vinci wanted to know:
      
      "Why is the sky blue?"
      
      We now know the answer.  Rayleigh scattering by the oxygen 
      molecules.  Evaluat this on Tarskian principles and you have a 
      reasonable clear truth.

     Even in Classical times, 'e=mc^2' was perfectly well known, and 
     precededed Einstein by decades.  It requires no 'relativistic' or 
     'quantum' hoo-ha.

    Not according to Richard Feynman in Quantum Electrodynamics.  Not 
    according to the ballistic theory of light.  Not according to 
    observation.

    All of this is crap.  Strictly, Newtonian physics is a subset of 
    Classical Mechanics -- the three Force Laws, plus 
    instantaneously-acting gravitational force.  If you blend in the 
    ballistic theory of light you instantly explain _all_ optical 
    phenomena, starting with Michelson-Morley, where the light source is 
    simply stationary vis-a-vis the apparatus.  A null result is 
    fully predictable.  But people were trying to fit Michelson-Morley 
    into a 'waves-in-the-aether' paradigm.  A ballistic theory was 
    _impermissible_.
    
    Lorentz cooked up his electrodynamics to give a set of equations 
    explaining the M-M result as caused by contraction of the parts of the 
    apparatus, caused by aether-flow compressing the dimensions of the 
    apparatus.  He misappropriated Voight's [1887] Doppler equations to 
    make the wrtched thing work.
    
    All the equations of Lorentz's theory and Einstein's 'SR' theory are 
    _identical_   The theories are _identical_ (except that Lorentz 
    provides physical explanations).  This allowed aether 
    theorists to coexist uneasily with no-aether theorists -- 
    
    Einstein says 'Forget the physics -- just apply Lorentz's equations. 
    _Postulate_ the speeed of light as a constant in all frames of 
    reference ond the sums will add up.  For this to work, you have to go 
    with a new mechanics. Go with that, and the speed of light will always 
    come out at a constant, because it's built into the structure of the 
    theory.  The only problem is that the same object can have 
    indefinitely many sizes simultaneously, and physics is reduced to a 
    chaos."
    
    Neither Special nor General Relativity have given science or 
    technology anything it didn't have anyway.  All the SR/GR 
    'predictions' were _prior discoveries_ -- knwn years previous to SR or 
    GR.  We can do most Quantum Theory work without Quantum Mechanics.
    We can build atom bombs.  We can build thermonuclear bombs.  We can 
    build microprocessors and lasers.
    
    
    Who needs all the SR/GR/QM crap?  >:-}
    

    As Werner Heisenberg wrote:
    
    "Classical Mechanics is everywhere exactly 'right', everywhere it's 
    concepts can be applied."
    
    It's the measuring instrumentation that (temporarily) defines the 
    practical limits of accuracy.  And they get better all the time.

No the software is set only to detect write attempts to the hard drive. Sticking this
floppy in the slot is all it takes for this virus to make a write attempt to the boot
sector of the hard drive.

It does. Believe me, I was rather intrigued about this, and I and my sister (who was
sys admin at Sturm Ruger and is now sys admin at a local hospital) ran a series of
tests on this point, trying to see what the minimum effort was to get this virus to
make an attack. I just wish I had some means of getting this virus in a state where I
could take a look at the code.

Yeah, the main reason I thought that it was was because it made a write attempt to the
boot sector of my hard drive, and the antivirus software database said that virii of
the Stealth C family are boot sector virii.

The FBI arrest rates only measure an average nationwide. Professor John Lott's
analysis of FBI statistics from 1977 to 1996, which he originally worked on for
a study sponsored by Handguns Control Inc., the primary anti-gun lobbying group
(and which fired him when his conclusions directly contradicted their
predetermined prejudices and propaganda needs), shows that there is a distinct
difference in violent crime statistics between states that have passed
right-to-carry concealed weapons laws, and states that have no-right-to-carry
laws. In his expanded study for his new book: _More Guns, Less Crime_ he
examined stats for all multiple death spree type shootings, and found that the
rates for all such violent crimes have been trending downward, and in states
which pass right-to-carry laws, they will experience an average of almost an 80%
drop in such spree shootings within 5 years of passage of such laws in each
state.

Another interesting note is that Prof. Lott found that the death penalty has had
little to no measurable impact on violent crime rates. Hmmmmm....

The Children's Defense Fund is one of thos liberal PACs that erroneously
categorize 'children'.  While Websters dictionary classifies a 'child' as a
person in a prepubescent state, usually less than 14 years of age, liberal
groups like CDF and HCI, in their propaganda, use stats for people of ages up to
19 and even up to 25 years of age. That teen age girls may be malnourished due
to peer pressure/self discipline or eating disorders associated with peer
pressure is not taken into account in these stats.

We have been cutting back on the rate of increase in funding. Actual funding, in
real dollar terms, when adjusted for inflation, has not dropped at all.

Also, what is meant by the term 'time behind bars'? If you call spending a few
hours behind bars while the bureaucracy finally figures out that the bail they
say you are wanted on was actually paid, or that the fine they say you never
paid was actually paid, is actually classifiable as 'hard time' then its obvious
that a propaganda job is going on here. Additionally, at the rate that
government is making more and more daily activities illegal, I can well imagine
that within a few years a majority of the population being members of the
'criminal' class.

The primary targets in this media campaign are not the children, but gun makers
and dealers. The media ignores that these sort of shootings have been going on
for years at a more or less constant rate. They are publicizing them now because
they are prepping the population to support more gun restriction legislation.

Also, from the amount of time the media focuses on people who use guns to solve
their problems in a wrong manner, some children may be developing the idea that
the world pays attention to people who use guns. Children in todays increasingly
single parent family structures are starved for love and attention, and some
will do anything to get it.

On an IBM compatible type of PC (i386, i486 Pentium etc etc) running Windows
(any version) or DOS (any version) there is no way to infect it with a virus
just by 'putting it in the drive' without any other action.

You need to execute a virus in order for it to infect your computer.  Just
putting a disk into a drive on a normal PC will not cause any data on the
disk to be executed.  You need to boot from it or execute it or almost
anything else - but simply putting it into a drive can't hurt anyone.

Or have a look at the Nashsoft Anti Virus Research Center and tell me which
type of virus you believe you have so I can find out more about this
extraordinary feat.
http://www.nashsoft.com/arc.html

If you find that putting it into your drive causes a warning message from
your anti-virus software to appear then clearly your anti-virus software is
running in background and noticed the hardware notify the system of a
disk-change and decided to do a bit of pre-emptive scanning of it's own.

'Ignorance of the law is no excuse'  A stranger walking into a town who spits on the sidewalk could still be ticketed
for violating the towns no-public-spitting ordinance. In court the judge woule probably count his non-residency based

Correct, however, when you purchased your copy from me, I included your public key in its coding, such that if the copy
of your key in my software is removed or altered the software is unusable, and my software has virii built into it to
cause other fine fun things if you try to alter the virii or the code which protects the software with your public key.
THus, you may be able to use the scheme above to copy and distribute pirated versions of my software anonymously, but
since the copies all have YOUR public key embedded in them, i.e. your digital fingerprint, all it takes is ONE of those
recipients of the software to slip up, say, their computers get seized in a drug bust, a hacker bust, or the recipient,
living in a libertarian anarchy, winds up with his computer being stolen, then later seized by a PPA busting the theft
ring, and scanning the computer, finds YOUR public key in the software. They notify me that they found a computer with
my software with your public key on it. If this happens once, you could get away with it. Twice and you are busted.
Three times and my PPA raids your property to serve a search warrant approved by your PPA under the joint operating
agreement my PPA has with your PPA (and if they are the same PPA, they don't obviously need to do that, the can just
raid you for violating your contract with them.....). We then find out how many times your personal bank has received
anonymous 5 cent pieces digitally, and I bill you my $50 licensing fee for the 5,347 copies of my software you sold.
Because you sold so many, I might give you a quantity discount I give to all of my retailers, but I doubt that it would
help much....

Not necessarily. If a product costs x amount to produce, and given an acceptable profit margin, a company would need to
charge, say, $50 for something, yet its demand curve for a competitive market would cause the retail price to be $25, I
could not bring my product to market if anyone at all could just copy it. Preventing a product from coming to market at
all is its own inefficiency.

I've read the textbooks too, sir, and they say you are wrong. The definition of a monopoly applies solely  to product
type markets, not markets for individual brand names. The soft dring market will divide down to the special market for
colas, in which several brand names with recipes with slight differences compete. There are colas which sell for half
of the price of Coke, yet do not command the same market share as Coke does. Use of brand names is legally protected,
not as a matter of IP, but of fraud. Lets say that there was no Coke.

There are a large number of colas that compete on the market. I make a cola called Mike Lorrey's Cola, bottled in
Lebanon, NH. The cola happens to have a distinct DNA marker in it that matches with the DNA in my semen cells. THis is
the fingerprint that identifies the cola as produced by me. Slick Danny Fablich decides that he likes the market share
my cola has, and decides to produce a cola that he labels Mike Lorrey's Cola, bottled in Lebanon, NH.

I can sue him for a number of things which have absolutely nothing to do with my IP rights to my product recipe.

All commodities which are produced in a manner  or method which allows for economies of scale, will in a matter of
time, move toward monopolistic/oligopolistic markets. Any product in which the combined fixed and variable costs cause
the marginal cost curve to become asymtotic to a Y axis value, become flat, or sloped downward will trend toward
monopolies.

Except that once a natural monoply is established with whatever technology is available at the time, it will tend to a)
purposely retard technological development, b) prevent technological developments which do occur from changing its
'natural' status, c) a natural monopoly will tend to cause the spontaneous organisation of statist organizations, which
will threaten the stability of the libertarian society, and will use these statist organizations to help enforce its
continued 'natural' monopoly status.

And the people who do the inventing will be indviduals will other means of material support who do the inventing for
kicks. Just the idea of slowing technological advancement purposely should be enough to make anyone who claims to be
extropian or transhumanist to automatically disavow any support of the anti-IP cause.

Its obvious to anyone who has done inventing before, and actually gone through the work of bringing their invention to
market with a start up company, that given the high capital costs of invention, which when amortized on a per unit rate
on your price/quantity scale will cause your marginal cost curve to asmtote out at a fixed Y axis value, or flatten out
entirely, or even cause it to slope downward, rather than upward. In this manner, a given invention would be most
efficiently brought to market if it is a monopoly product. Failing to protect the IP rights of the inventor will do
nothing but retard the capital supply to invention development, and thus retard technological development.

But you also must account for the law of diminishing returns in this analysis. At some point, your kid aint gonna grow

I can understand that you can see at a glance that one shape is gonna be roughtly larger than another, that is obvious.
What is not obvious at all is how you can purport to just scribble some lines down on a piece of paper as if they
actually are applicable to the real world, without any actual quantitative numbers determining their coordinates, and
come up with a claim of 50% and 40%. If you have no quantitative numbers, what is the 40%, 40% OF??????  40% of nothing
is still 0.

Yes, and you made claims of 50% on one figure and 40% on another, when you stated absolutely NO numbers from which
these percentages are derived. Pure slieght of hand, sir. WHAT ARE THE NUMBERS YOU GET YOUR PERCENTAGES FROM?????

Because with greater and greater levels of technological development, invention requires greater and greater levels of
capital investment, which mush be amortized in your marginal cost curve. Given an advanced enough technology, your
marginal cost curve could even slope downward rather steeply, rather than upward. A downward slope is a natural
monopoly.

Great, but get it right. You only claimed that the change in quantity was the measure of efficiency.

It is unprofitable to produce tamperproof software to help enforce IP laws overseas if the overseas countries do
nothing to enforce the IP laws they have in the first place. It doesn't matter what you do to your software at this
point, The state monpolies who get paid off by their domestic pirates will protect their domestic pirates before they
will observe their treaty commitments under GATT. If we lived in a worldwide libertarian society, where everyone lives
in communities with competetive PPAs, my PPA would have joint operating agreements with other PPAs, such that any one
PPA in the world is  only one or two direct agreement links away from the PPA of the guy pirating my software.In which
case, I would be easier for me to enforce my IP rights in such a condition than it currently is where state monopolies
protect their domestic pirates that copy foreign software and other products.

It doesn't matter how many times you copy my software. My software is TAMPER PROOF, not COPY PROOF. Every copy of my
software you produce is gonna have your public key embedded in the coding of the software, so if I catch just one other
person with software with your public key in it, I can bill you for the license fee for that person. ....and it will
give reasonable cause for my PPA to seek to have your computer assets seized for independent legal investigation.

Sure I can. There are plenty of products on the market which have absolutely no patent protection. Compare those with
products which do have patent protection and you can develop a metric of comparison.

My argument applies twofold. If there is no IP protection, then only big companies will be able to protect their
proprietary information, and out compete anyone who does steal their inventions, due to economies of scale production.
IP protection merely allows any individual to be protected from theft for enough time for the individual doing the
inventing to establish a business that can produce to the demands of the natural monopoly for that given invention

Seeing as how libertarian philosophy is about empowerment of the individual, IP law protects the right of the indvidual
to create their own monopoly without having to have a huge corporation already at hand to produce and protect that
information. Libertarians should be for a policy which gives the economic advantage of opportunity to the individual

It all depends on the ratio of fixed to variable costs. If for example, my invention takes $10 billion to develop, but
only $0.10 to produce each indvidual unit (like many medicines), the capital costs so far outweight the costs of
production that the marginal cost curve slopes downward, rather than upward. In this case, if the drug can be copied by
anyone with a decent spectral analyser and chemical modeling software, and there is no IP protection, no rational
investor is going to invest $10 billion for a drug, when most of the benefit for the investors capital will be to
investors who DONT invest in the company......

No. Everyone will have your PUBLIC KEY. That is definitely NOT key escrow.

SInce you will be using your public key all the time, such that credit agencies will keep copies of your public key on
file at all times, when you license my software from me, your public key will be affirmed by the credit agency, then
embedded in my software. Possibly it could be coded such that only a person with your private key could then actually
operate the software.

Not true. Since we are agreeing that nicreconomic efficiency is the crux of the argument, we need to to get down to
brass tacks in a quantitative manner before we can decisively determine who is right here. Until then, your ideas,
though interesting, are not credible.
