Well, the poor get richer too.

Example:

Joe Sixpack has $1000. A year later he has $1100.

Scrooge McDuck has $1000000. A year later he has $1100000.

Joe is richer by $100, Scrooge by $100000.

Of course, basic expenses are proportionally higher for Joe, he may be only
$50 richer.

It's probably easiest for me to respond to this.  I did some supplemental
calculations on new year's eve after returning from the party.

The correlation between the responses to Question # 7:

(How much do you believe it costs to have your body cryonically preserved?)

and Question # 44:

(I believe that Cryonics is an exciting idea and intend on looking into it
further.)

is:        -.0030      N=507      p = .946

The overall correlation between the two sets of responses are therefore
statistically non-significant.

So I decided to form two groups, (1) those who estimated costs to be less
than $500,000, and (2) those who estimated costs to be $500,000 or more.
There were 422 participants in Group 1 and 85 in Group 2.  A simple ANOVA
sought differences between the groups in terms of their responses to Q44.
The result was an F ration of 1.6  and an F prob. of .205.  Again, nothing
really there to distinguish between the groups suggesting that cost is not a
large factor.

This conclusion appears counter-intuitive, but appears nonetheless.  It may
be that I overstated the importance of costs in my summary.  I was simply a
bit taken aback by how high many of the estimates were.  Then again, there
were a number of very low estimates so, as Robin stated, the median fell
into a fairly realistic range.

I guess it's because it appears several times in the books of David Zindell,
perhaps it's not the only reason ?
Where Zindell has found this term ;)?
I have just made a quick search with Amazon...
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/generic-quicksearch-query/002-1997407-1009030
It seems somewhat related to judaism...
Two other titles have retained my attention :

The Aleph Weaver : Biblical, Kabbalistic and Judaic Elements in Borges
 Edna Aizenberg / Hardcover / Published 1985

Affine Representations of Grothendieck Groups and Applications to Rickart
C-Algebras and Aleph O-Continuous Regular Rings Vol 234
K. R. Goodearl / Paperback / Published 1980

I certainly believe the second one to be more significative, Zindell Being a
mathematician if i remember well. So perhaps a little search on mathematical
resources on the net could quickly give the information needed ;)

	Indeed, I would imagine that the mathematical reference is the
reason for choosing the name Aleph...  The alephs are the infinite
cardinal numbers, beginning with aleph-null and continuing with aleph-1,
aleph-2, aleph-n...

I was obviously being unclear. What I meant, Drexlerian nanotechnology
might be infeasible ('advocatus diaboli, at your service'), and
destructive scan of vitrified tissue and reconstruction in situ, 
including retractable fractal scaffolding for rapid rewarming 
certainly spells out a shitload of hairy technologies. With 
uploading all you need is some kind of a parallel MEMS 
cryomicrotome/scanning stage and an emulation computer made from molecular 
circuitry (nanotechnology made via the macromolecular autoassembly 
paradigm is sufficiently powerful for that), plus some algorithms for 
filtering/segmentation/feature extraction and simulation. There is
lots less of nasty physics laying giant boulders into your path. I
doubt anybody will ever be resurrected in the flesh, it is simply too
expensive, particularly in a future world where biocompatible habitats
would be fully synthetic.

You almost certainly don't need MD level of detail. You might need
that at the beginning/a point of departure of your molecular, or
near-molecular tissue map, as a transient means to destill your custom
higher-order representation, perhaps tailored to the optimal ('omega')
hardware I mentioned ( http://www.ai.mit.edu/~mpf/Nano97/abstract.html
), but there is a hierarchy higher level models. Compartmental modelling,
spiking codes, Darwin amongst cortex columns, whatever (please consult
your resident genie from Thule for a less sketchy explanation). I'm almost
certain comparmental level is enough, and it is a far cry from MD
level of detail.

I was referring to the vitrification artefact removing and
segmentation/tracing stage. These are indeed just some (though pretty 
damn smart) filters. The simulation stage is of course entirely 
different, you dowload the destilled state pattern as resulted from 
the above filter pipeline into dedicated molecular hardware (probably 
mimicking some relatively abstract, highly anisotropic, complex
excitable medium with diffusable gradients), and then pull the big 
switch causing the cell to tick on as choreographed by the molecular 
hardware incarnation of your system Hamiltonian. In a sense, one 
could describe the mapping from your sensorics to the motorics vector 
as a very smart filter, but that would be stretching the analogy a 
bit too far (lots and lots and lots of hidden state inbetween). 
As to MD, that's what supposed to be my academic area of expertise. 
It is indeed nothing like a data filter.

UI'm physically incapable of commenting on every message I would like
to, unfortunately. Some quick quibbles: at 10^9 neurons (ignoring the glia), 
10^4 synapses/neuron, 10^2 ops/synapse and a simulation resolution 
of 1 ms (10^3 events/s), all very conservative estimations for neural 
emulation I rather arrive at roughly 10^18 ops (totally ignoring the
role of glia and dendritic processing here). I'm too tired and drunk 
to estimate the number of Flopses for MD level of detail, so I trust 
your 10^30 Flops, or whatever the number was.

Very smart idea. Indeed one could imagine an upwards-validating
chain of methods reaching as far down as ab initio. Fully
automagically, you destill MD forcefields from ab initio,
compartmental magical constants from MD, etc. Top-down, you could use
rich fingerprints as MEG/fMRI and implanted multielectrode arrays
for validation.

Oh, assuming a 10^4 synapses/neuron, 100 ops/synapse and a 1 ms 
tick you should be able to run a realtime neuron with around 1 GIPs.

I'm a big fun of opaque GA way of doing things. The amount of details

It should be interesting to actually know the amount of modularism in
the brain. We need methods to map neural tissue at nm resolution in
the bulk.

I don't think so, they just seem to be given high doses of growth
factors. Neural regeneration is likely highly controlled in the brain,
and the implanted neurons will become boring, normal neurons
(hopefully) when implanted. I also wonder if just simple implantation
can cure senility, it often seems to involve widespread loss across
the entire brain, relatively hard to fix through simple implantation.

Likely becuase there is no evolutionary pressure for regenerating
brains (most brain damage in the natural environment is deadly anyway)
and a fairly firm pressure against regeneration (upsets old memories,
increased cancer risk). Note that the only places where regeneration
seems to occur are the olfactory bulb (restore lost olfactory sensors)
and the hippocampus (very dynamic place, likely not storing anything
for long anyway).

Perhaps. I'm not sure if added neurons will benefit normal people
much, since all the important stuff is in connectivity. If we can set
up some new long-range connections we might see interesting new
abilities.

It does sound a bit too flimsy, yes. Reminds me a bit of Game of Life
machines like the adder or prime calculator - complex patterns that
will break down if subjected to too much (i.e. any ) noise. But in a
Dysonian asymptotic head death universe noise might indeed be very
low. I would really like to see if we could come up with more
theoretical applied science designs for intelligent structures that
can live in this era, or even in the cold period after the stars.

OK, that is actually fairly easy to explain. Where would another big
bang occur? Note that it was a creation and expansion of spacetime, it
didn't occur inside a pre-existing spacetime. So the closest thing to
a new big bang would be the budding off of a baby universe, but all
models so far suggests that this doesn't change our universe much
(some gravity waves from the collapsing navel wormhole). Conservation
of energy is locally upheld, so you need some rather extreme changes
to our theories in order to get a huge explosion inside our spacetime
(baby universe creation and all that of course gets away with their
stuff due to the weird properties of global relativity, where energy
isn't conserved).

Well, there were several reasons. One evening in 1993 or so, the
members of the Omega mailing list (swedish transhumanism list, still
active) met to have dinner. During the discussions we decided to form
a formal organization to promote transhumanism. The question of names
came up, and we began to play with the original name omega. Somebody
suggested alpha, but that didn't quite strike a chord. Then somebody
8I think it was me, but I'm not certain) suggested aleph instead - it
is the first letter in the Hebrew alphabet. It has a number of nice
resonances:

1. Of course, the pun/antithesis with omega.

2. In the Kabbalah, it represents origin, power, just about Everything
with big E.

3. Borges story (quite fun) where it is a kind of place where the
whole universe can be viewed.

4. Mitch Porter's concept of an Aleph State, a kind of generalization
of an Omega Point.

5. And of course the transfinite cardinals in set theory. 

It is a nice symbol, although we have sometimes been accused of having
a swastika for symbol (amazing but true).

Actually, if historical evidence is analysed this kind of people
rarely seems to drag others with them. Sure, in 999 a lot of people
sold their worldly possessions and began to wander towards Jerusalem,
but i can't recall any reports that they in disappointment tried to
start the apocalypse or kill off others after that event. The same
goes for all other millennialist cults I can recall. There have been a
few ugly incidents, but few trying to start the Apocalypse. Usually
the response is instead that "Our prayers have given us a respite!" or
"Sorry, miscalculated, the date should be the 6th November instead!".

No proof nobody will try immanentizing the escaton, but they are
likely relatively few candidates around. We might be lucky that the
power technology puts in peoples' hands is still fairly limited,
single crazies might become a much dangerous proplem later on.

There are many other groups who also have this goal, so joining up
with them is a good first step. But the people you would like to reach
are also extremely hard to influence (and many of them are likely
slightly insane) so education will just save a lot of fairly ordinary
people the trouble and anguish of waiting for the Millennium.

I should also note that "Alpha" now has a slightly different
contrast-to-Omega meaning.  If there's infinite computing power at the
end of the Universe, there's equally infinite computing power at the Big
Bang - the Alpha Point.  One would expect that if an infinite amount of
information-processing is going on, some Power-like beings would evolve
by pure chance.

What happened to them is a very interesting question.  Probably they
tunneled to new Big Bangs when it started getting cold.  Thus, the
series of Universes created by a Singularity is an "Alpha Line", and the
originator of our Alpha Line is our "Parent Singularity".  (These two
terms are original with me.)  Assuming that a Universe gets "too cool"
no earlier than Planck Time, and assuming a given Singularity inhabits
no more than one Universe at a time, and assuming time rates are
synchronized between all Universes, there would be at least 10^61
Universes in our Alpha Line.  Assuming there is only one intelligent
race per galaxy on the average, and only a tenth of the Universes are
old enough to yield intelligent life, and all the Universes are the same
size and have the same characteristics as our own, our Universe's Alpha
Line would have spawned about 10^74 intelligent races, of whom at least
10^73 would probably start their own Alpha Lines.

Even assuming 10^10 years to start generating intelligent races, so that
our Parent Singularity does not have grandchildren, this yields about
10^134 Universes total having been spawned (directly or indirectly) by
our Parent Singularity since the creation of our Universe, with about
10^116 new Big Bangs every second.

If our Parent Singularity isn't the first there ever was, or it's been
doing this for awhile - if our Parent Singularity occupies pretty much
the same place in Reality as Earth's Singularity will - well, the
numbers get pretty large.

On the other hand, for various complex reasons involving the Anthropic
Principle, the Great Filter, Occam's Razor, Hofstadterian renormalized
game theory, time travel, and SI motivations, I no longer think this is
the correct picture of the Universe.

;))... perhaps i'm silly but since there is an infinite amount of
info-processing the systems of automatic destruction of such beings would
also be evolved by pure chance ;)

A nice line of thought (pun intended :-). 

Related to the "Fast evolution machine" (I think the section was
called) mentioned in Damien's _The Spike_.

Perhaps we could tell the story of such beings... their friends, the friends
of their friends, their enemies, the enemies of their enemies, their
artifacts, their worlds, their thoughts. The great pursuits through universes
between races at war in a meta-universe. Is the SF writer of such a
tremendously difficult story to tell already born ;)? (i mean a good story, a
quite complete description of such a fun and abstract world  in a +150 pages
format ;).

Depending on how abstractly you want to interpret it, allowing for
50,000 plus
years of cultural distortion, Tolkein's Silmarillion might fit into this
genre.

What were those elves up to, with all this gem "creation" anyways?
Mega-scale engineering [Directing geologic processes on a massive
scale]? or merely nonotech computers?

You guys have some interesting thoughts about uploading, but I think we're
still talking past each other a bit when we get down to actual scenarios.  I
can see several reasonably possibilities, depending on how fast different
technologies evolve.  However, I think some of the options that have been
mentioned rely on combinations of capabilities and limitations that are
self-contradictory.

To do an upload requires advanced computers, advanced sensors, and knowledge
about how the brain works.  To get a reasonably upload scenario you have to
project advances in all three of these fields at the same time, and see what
you come up with.

Now, the traditional proof-of-principle for uploading is obviously never
going to actually be used.  It assumes no knowledge at all about how the
brain works, which results in enormous computation requirements.  Unless you
think the Omega hardware will be built tomorrow, and everyone in the biotech
industry is about to jump off a cliff, that doesn't make sense.

A simulation at the cellular level, relying purely on advanced knowledge of
biochemistry, lets you reduce the computational burden by several orders of
magnitude.  It still isn't very likely, however, because it matches a modest
increase in medical knowledge with a fantastic improvement in computers and
sensor technology.

A much more probable scenario would project medical advances forward until
there is hardware fast enough to run the sim, and sensors good enough to
gather the data.  That implies at least a moderately good understanding of
the brain - something better than just an understanding of biochemistry, but
probably not good enough to just model the brain's data processing.

You make a good point. Some people predicted that the universe will slow down
it's expansion but not enough to collapse,  others said it would collapse, but nobody
predicted it was accelerating, the very idea is ridiculous but apparently that's
exactly what is happening. In its year end issue the Journal Science says the
discovery of an accelerating universe is the most important science story of 1998.
If the leading  cosmological theory can't find a feature that important it makes me
wonder if we really have any idea what the hell is going on. I quote from Science
"Cosmologists have become less confident about declaring the fate of the
 universe hundreds of billions of years hence."

hello extropians...i have been on the list before and now
happily rejoined to the stimulating discussion here, and 
have a question that i was curious about about extropian-
ism...

does the singularity involve uploading people's emotional
and spiritual lives? as these seem to me to be as important
to the human organism as its mind...or is everything con-
ceived as neurological, and therefore an extension of the
western psychological paradigm of freud?...this question is 
asked for information only...not meant confrontationally to 
the list...

i receive the list in digest form, so may be slow in reply-
ing...

Freedom in Chains
Publication Date:
February 22, 1999
ISBN: 0-312-21441-3
Price: $26.95

Contact: Meredith Howard (212) 982-3900 x267

Government and bureaucracies are bigger and more controlling than ever. A
citizen's own ability to control his or her own life has never been less
than it is today. How did we get to this point? Jim Bovard, bestselling
author of Lost Rights: The Destruction of American Liberty, looks at the
development of the State into a behemoth that threatens to destroy the
individual at the cost of preserving the idea of "statism" - the belief
that government is inherently superior to the citizenry, that progress
consists of extending the realm of governmental compulsion, and that
vesting more arbitrary power in government officials will eventually make
citizens happy.

Reading through the history of the state and its war on the citizen, Bovard
looks at thinkers as diverse as John Locke, Etienne de la Boetie, James
Madison, and Bernard Bosanquet among others. He explores the original
version of the idea of the state, the development of the welfare state, the
progress of the state's judicial system from the original province of the
courts into the lives of men and women and the ultimate fraud that is
perpetrated as the state's benevolence. Freedom in Chains is must reading
for anyone trying to understand how far we've come from our eighteenth
century roots as a community of impassioned patriots to our sorry positions
as wards of the state at the end of the twentieth century.


James Bovard is a journalist who has written for The New York Times, The
Wall Street Journal, and Newsweek.

He is the author of Lost Rights: The Destruction of American Liberty (St.
Martin's Press, 1994)

Perhaps a complete model of the brain in fine-grained detail will be used
simply to reassure potential uploads that no 'essence' will be lost in the
translation. Or maybe some mad genius will come along and start uploading
dogs (puploads?) using the technology of the remarkably near future as a
proof-of-concept. Since the majority of scenarios are used to explore the

neighbourhood pets in their dank underground secret laboratories) realism is
probably not the most important factor.

I agree, idealistically, this is the way it should be.  All human
persons generally want the same thing -- food, health, happiness, love,
shelter.  As technology increases the human race should be able to
provide  the material necessities to sustain life for all people
regardless of race, creed, gender, or national origin.  It seems logic
and reason point humanity in one direction and one direction only.

However, many transhumanist, including myself, will want to belong to a
super intelligence governed by some type of principles. I believe
freedom to allow an individual to possess an unique sense of identity
will be one such principle.

I think the following list member discussion is highly appropos:

I think this is only natural. At the end of the millennium, we have surely
a lot more hard data at our disposal than Lem & Co-visionaries in 1960's,
but nevertheless this is still highly speculative terrain. If at all,
uploading is thought to become feasible in a few decades, where future
histories are already very warped by the curvature of the nearby
prediction horizont.

Our ability to model dynamics of (macro)molecular systems at low to medium
energies far outstrips our capabilities to create, and, especially, to
mass-produce them.  Due to the bootstrap bottleneck and the intrinsic
simplicity of optimal hardware as artefacted by basic physical laws
constraints the design space could be already very well sampled prior to
the advent of the very first assembler. If analogies to compiler bootstrap
are valid, the second-generation assembler (in extreme case, only few
fabrication hours away) will be already very useful, and due to the
immediate availability of very formidable computational resources as
product of the second-generation assembler, the almost immediately (years
to months) avaliable third-generation systems should be truly optimal. Of
course heavy regulation (nanotechnology simulation software and assemblers
to be declared munitions, with a simultaneous implementation of an
executive strong enough to enforce that) could delay that, which may or
may not result in a prognosis from beneficial to the catastrophic. 

I doubt that new sensorics is at all necessary for a feasible destructive
scan: recently available methods as cryo AFM of freeze-fracture vitrified
tissue cryosections already allows imaging at near-molecular or molecular
resolution, and in principle, the technique should be scalable to imaging
in the bulk through introduction of abrasion, automation and massive
parallelism to attain adequate processivity. I think problems like
creation and tight integration of sufficiently dense and fast memories for
interim voxelset storage and algorithms for the processing of the latter
into the scanning pipeline are significantly more complicated.

The current state of the art of computational neurobiology is not exactly
negligeable, and due to the advent of sufficiently large computer
performance fully bottom-up automatical knowledge extraction should become
feasible, using 'ab initio' methods utilizing total genome sequence data,
accurate structures from protein folding prediction and abovementioned
molecular-resolution maps of vitrifed animal cells.  The same applies to
top-down approaches with multiple-million channels microelectrode arrays
for in vivo recording and manipulation, and sufficient computational
performance for their analysis as made possible with the advent of
molecular manufacturing of any flavour.

For the reasons I mentioned above, I do indeed think that the Omega
hardware will become avalable relatively early, i.e. in a few decades, if
things will indeed pan out as expected (but nobody never expects the
Spanish Inquisition, of course).

The whole of the humanity could jump off the cliff in a hard-edge
Singularity if somebody is foolish enough to create the boundary
conditions for a SI before we can do uploads on a broad scale. You need a
lot less ops and knowledge to grow an alife Golem with excellent
juggernaut potential. (Yes, Dr. Scott, an accident has made it happen).

I agree with you that such a model is extremely valuable, especially for
bootstrap purposes, as the lowest, or second-lowest tier in an
automagically progressive learning hierarchic simulation. (I wouldn't want
to define a framework for such a tour de force in software design though,
perhaps no one who goes on two legs could).

> increase in medical knowledge with a fantastic improvement in computers and

For about 10-20 k$, using off-shelf commodity components, you could now
build a conventional MD system capable of probing the dynamics of
biological system roughly one million atoms large in a time window few ns
long. Even if lacking breakthrough to reduce the computational task for
PFP, forcefields will grow a little faster and great deal more accurate in
the coming decade or two, while Moore's law should not yet run into
saturation yet, particularly if development of molecular circuitry will
start early enough to become smoothly available when progress in
semiconductor photolitho will fail suddenly, having run out of steam.

The problem with imaging is less a sensor problem than a problem of
scaling existing technologies (nanorobotics/abrasive AFM, SNOM, vacuum
sublimation, excimer and plasma etch) into micro (MEMS) and meso
(diamondoid systems)  domain, using massive parallelism and automation. 
In a sense, the task is much tougher than simply coming up with new
sensors.

The impetus for new imaging comes from basic research, some of which is of
course medical. Medical funding could increase dramatically once the
potential of nanomedicine is fully understood by the mainstream. Hardware
good and fast enough will come from the mainstream, probably specifically
from the multimedia demands, and then perhaps consumer and service
robotics, the next big thing after industry automation.

I don't quite follow you here. If you can model the neural tissue in
machina, all you need is too watch the movies and to abstract. The process
of abstraction can be made automatical. What is the problem, then?

Most of us here categorically reject the idea that anything we do as
human beings has any root in anything outside the realm of the physical
universe. We embrace the classical liberal idea that science is the
single best tool capable of studying, testing, and explaining any
phenomenon that exists in this universe or within our minds. We also
rely on the scientific method as a means of differentiating between real
phenomena of the greater universe, and phenomena which are merely the
creation of our mind's inner perceptions.

Because of this, we feel that any uploading of human minds will
reproduce the qualities of the human mind that are popularly known as
'intuitional' and 'spiritual', but at present are not completely
explained by the scientific method, in the constructs which we upload
minds to.

While I don't feel any particular desire to change sex, the general
ability to do so quite easily like Iain M. Banks' Culture humans carries

I'm working on it... :)

As Anders noted, this line of thought is explored briefly in THE SPIKE.
It's also implicit or explicit in various sf novels, such as Pratchett's
STRATA, Stapledon's STAR MAKER, and some of the books by McAuley, Steve
Baxter, and perhaps the latest volume of Brin's Uplift sequence (which I
haven't read).  Here's a few bites from THE SPIKE (apologies to those
who've seen bits of this posted a year or two back):

========

If the prospect of the post-Spike condition sketched in this book is
correct - awesome, truly godlike powers wielded by Powers - then in another
billion years our descendants will surely have plaited the stars into
braids of their own design, if they wish to.79  Tipler and Barrow, as we've
seen, argue that an AI deity might, even must, emerge in the final
nanoseconds of the Big Crunch after its predecessors have redesigned the
dying cosmos.  By reverse engineering, can we gaze outward now and see that
the stars already bear the marks of cosmic engineering?

The Very Fast Evolution Machine

Here's an even more startling conjecture.  Tipler's Omega Point deity,
plunging into the forever of infinite compression, has an effectively
infinite number of discrete clock ticks within which a `god' may Do All
Things.  But similar conditions existed during the initial 10^-43 of a
second when time and space were smeared together, or so Stephen Hawking
assures us.  Might life of some quite different ilk have crystallised in
the strange, terrible epochs before our kind of matter settled out in the
inflation rush of the expanding cosmos?80  

In the earliest zillionths of the Big Bang eruption, time was effectively
multiplied to infinite speed, but it slowed fast as spacetime expanded and
cooled.  Inconceivably vast numbers of exchanges occurred almost instantly
in a densely compacted and connected spacetime where the four known forces
of physics only `slowly' decoupled from a unitary force now lost forever,
or at least until the Big Crunch at the end of the universe.  Might not
there have been virtual time enough, effectively, for a superintelligence
to evolve from scratch?  Even a whole bunch of them, but perhaps they would
inevitably remain merged in a swarm-mind until the cosmos was big enough
for light-transmission delays to disrupt module communication...

It is a suggestion that eerily resembles the teachings of the ancient
Gnostics, in a way.  The Gnostics held that our world is not the creation
of an original supreme deity, but is the rather botched handiwork of a less
god, a demiurge.  Imagine not one but many angelic demiurges, the
first-evolved minds in our cooling universe, tumbling from the furnace of
the Big Bang, cast out into the freezing dark.  Perhaps placing their
impress upon the new regimes of matter and light.  Yes, now there is a
god...  

But, if so, that was then.  What of today?  Would such `angels' still have
any impact on the universe?81  Would their works persist in the fabric of
spacetime?  The galaxies extend into space in colossal strings made of
billions of stars wrapped about dark bubbled gaps, an arrangement that
deeply puzzles cosmologists.  Might this strange architecture be the
remnant of some ancient design of the earliest life born of the Big Bang?
More to the point, is the evolution of such `angels'remotely possible in
the light of current physics? 

Could any kind of high-level structure emerge under such appallingly
volatile conditions, however many virtual steps or epochs it contains?
It's one thing for life to persist into the Big Crunch, as Tipler proposes,
using `shear energy' (the gravitational ebbs and flows of shockingly
twisted spacetime).   Presumably it's quite another for complex `life' to
bootstrap into existence from nothing under the same conditions.  Or is it?

Mitchell Porter agrees that the main barrier to Big Bang superintelligences
is the absence of structure in the fantastically hot primordial plasma.
`But conceivably,' he notes, `there may have been epochs of structure in
the course of the many phase transitions which are part of modern
cosmological models of the early universe, and perhaps things were evolving
rapidly enough for replicators to evolve.'  That catches it exactly.  The
contrast has been pointed up by Charles Stross, a British writer and
software specialist: in Tipler's scenario the pre-Omega entity deliberately
sets up oscillations in the collapsing universe, extracting usable energy.
But did the Big Bang have equivalent energy gradients, available to drive
such computational processes?  

The cosmos shortly after the Bang was a homogeneous soup of radiation
looking the same in all directions, Stross notes.  On the other hand, the
Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE) detected ripples in the
background radiation that suffused the universe.  These are the enduring
traces of lumpiness left in the pervasive radiation residue from the Big
Bang.  Recent data from the COBE satellite suggests that they are, indeed,
fractal in nature, ripples within wrinkles - perhaps enough to provide the
gradients necessary to jump-start a primordial replicator.

The earliest ages of the universe

The opening fractions of a second in this universe contained ample variety.
`GUT Age, Quark Age, Hadron Age, Nucleosynthetic Age, Plasma Age,
Fireball...'  Jonathan Burns, a La Trobe University computer scientist,
suggests with a certain whimsy that, given these phases, `the blindest
watchmaker would have had opportunity enough.'  He adds:

	What are the odds for an intelligent ontology?  On Darwinian grounds one
seems to need:
	(1) A substrate stable enough for some Selfish Form to persist and
multiply in competitive variation.
	(2) A phenomenon which can be coded, and decoded, into a genotype which
replicates the code.
	(3) Time for enough iterations that the code space can be explored by the
population, long enough to find the breakthrough points to higher
organization.
	(4) Time enough for the higher organization to explore its environment,
and exploit the opportunities for technological enhancement.
	(5) A radically uncertain measure of good luck.

And Burns took up the idea of ancient demiurges with a poetic burst of his
own: `The Benefactors... skating the contours of zero tidal force... their
wingtips deep in blazing quicksand...' 

Could such a selfish code-string persist though the fires of the Big Bang,
and in the cooling cosmos left as its ashes?  For a selfish signal to
survive in a sea of noise, it has to perform its own noise reduction.
Emergent exotica might stabilise briefly   vortices, frequency bands, phase
boundaries   to form a first substrate.  Efficient signal self replication
would use digital encoding, the simplest possible but sufficiently rich to
do the job.  After all, we know that populations of data structures inside
computers can already evolve, exploring combinational spaces efficiently,
turning combinational complexity to advantage.  

Is this kind of digital evolution plausible for the primordial universe?
`The bulk properties of Grand Unified Theory plasmas are speculative, to
say the least,' Burns notes.  `Electromagnetic plasmas, yes, there are
stable structures, Alfven waves, in the right conditions.  And in cold bulk
matter, we get quantized magnetic flux tubes, and liquid-helium quantized
vortices.'

Physics has only vague ideas of how quark-gluon plasmas might behave.  `One
place to look for a clawhold might be at the point where the quark-gluon
plasma is breaking into clusters. In the "big bag" of the plasma, one gets
incursions of vacuum, which acts as a superconductor for colour charge.
For a sufficient epoch, just maybe the plasma is riddled with quantized
chromodynamic flux tubes in bunches. Asymmetry.  Structure.  Bistability.
Gates and switches.  Chemistry.  New tubes being generated all the time,
those which don't match our patterns discarded, the rest assembled into new
entities.' 

Similarly with a conjectural breakup of the GUT plasma, or the
compactification of the hidden dimensions.  Emergent novelties, as Nobel
laureate Ilya Prigogine argues, are often found at phase boundaries where
energy is being exported into the environment.  But still we wouldn't
expect to find an infinite number of successive phase changes from the Bang
to very shortly afterward, the literally uncountable sort required for a
Tipler scenario.  At the smallest scale we can image the universe existing
at the start of time, quantum theory tells us we would find
everything-at-once, space and time smeared together and confused.  If you
can't count the ticks between one interval and the next, or determine one
place from another, it is impossible to create the structure needed for an
intelligence. 

An infinite number of steps might not be required.  After all, life has
evolved and flourished on Earth in less than four billion years - which is
quite a lot of separate clock ticks, but not a good deal fewer than
infinity.  The ancient minds might have evolved and left their mark.

Traces of primordial engineering?

What legacy might such demiurges leave for us to find?  It could range from
the very large, such as cosmological gravitational waves, or the very
small, such as strange matter in pulsars.  `If the angels broke through to
the mid range, they could build just about any material structure,' Burns
comments.  But is there anything in our stellar environment that can't be
accounted for by available science?  Well, there remain those mysterious
cosmological features, the vast empty voids, and the so-called Great
Attractor that appears to be dragging all the local galaxies toward a
particular place in the heavens.  And dark matter, up to 90 percent of the
mass of the cosmos, remains an unsolved question.  
		`If I were an angel,' Burns remarks wryly, `I'd be inclined to look out
for my own skin.  Maybe I could replicate myself on the cooler, rarer
strata of the heat death.  But in my epoch, the alternative of forming
exotic black holes and maybe impressing myself on a new universe, if that's
possible, would seem a lot more practical than it does to us atom-age
relics.' 

Still more delightfully bizarre is a conjecture based on Tipler's
cosmological deity, advanced by Anders Sandberg:

	life evolves towards the Omega Point, but in the vicinity of the final
moment `angels', life based on back-propagating causality (which Tipler's
theory seems to imply) are created and move backwards through time.  They
are unobservable in the present, since they are acausal from our
perspective... and probably very thinly spread (possibly `extinct').
Eventually conditions become better and better for them, they spread across
the universe and use the shear energy to create the Alpha Point - which is
isomorphic to the Omega Point and creates `angels' moving forward in time.
Note that if the backwards-moving beings use shear energy from the
`collapse' of the universe they see, this may explain the homogeneity and
isotropy of the universe despite the chaos of the Big Bang - from our
perspective they smoothed the early universe!

In terms of scientific cosmology this entire arabesqued line of thought is
strictly unnecessary, since science does not lack in more modest
explanations for its outstanding conundrums.  Still, improbable as it is,
it does bear a piquant resemblance to the issues that might arise when
Powers in a post-Spike history start to reformat their virtual and real
environments.  

[...]

Re-writing the cosmic laws

Polish polymath Stanislaw Lem once made a similar suggestion.84  Then why
don't we find all those archaic galactic civilisations?

	...because they are already everywhere...  A billion-year-old civilization
employs [no instrumental technologies].  Its tools are what we call the
Laws of Nature.  The present Universe no longer is the field of play of
forces chemical, pristine, blindly giving birth to and destroying suns and
their systems...  In the Universe it is no longer possible to distinguish
what is `natural' (original) from what is `artificial' (transformed).

The primordial cosmos might have possessed different laws in different
regions (a notion common to current claims by Hoyle and Linde).  If so,
only in certain remote patches might life arise.  Attempting to stabilise
its environment, each early Spiked culture would jiggle the local laws of
physics to its taste, until in their hungry expansion for living space they
begin to encroach upon each other's territories.  

Vast wars would follow: `The fronts of their clashes made gigantic
eruptions and fires, for prodigious amounts of energy were released by
annihilation and transformations of various kinds... collisions so powerful
that their echo reverberates to this day' - in the form of the 2.7 degree
Kelvin background radiation, mistakenly assumed to be a residue of the Big
Bang.  It is a charming cosmogony - an explanation for the birth and shape
of the observed universe - and it fits all too neatly with the colossal
intergalactic filaments and voids first detected years after Lem published
his jape...

This universe of Lem's, torn asunder in conflict over its very architecture
by titanic Exes and Powers, is saved from utter ruin by the laws of
game-theory, which ensure that the former combatants must henceforth remain
in strict isolation from each other.  The chosen laws of physics that
prevail, as a result, are those restrictive rules we chafe under today: a
limited speed of light, an expanding spacetime (good fences make good
neighbours, don't you know).  We live upon a scratchy board abandoned by
the Gamers.  The Universe observed and theorised by science is no more than
`a field of multibillion-year labours, stratified one on the other over the
eons, tending to goals of which the closest and most minute fragments are
fragmentarily perceptible to us.'

This delicious logic was not a bid by the distinctly atheistic Stanislaw
Lem to reinstate a religious perspective in his then-communist country -
something that the triumphant revival of Catholicism has done in the
meantime, no doubt to Lem's chagrin.  Nor am I seriously suggesting that
this is how our universe really began.  But the scenario does sketch out
rather brilliantly just the kind of universe we can expect this one to
become, following the human Spike - and long after its advent, of course,
perhaps millions or even billions of years later.  

On the other hand, it's bracing, I suspect, to acknowledge in due humility
that, for all we know, actually there are other Powers in the cosmos, right
now, who have passed through the veil of the Spike.  And perhaps they do
move upon us, vast and heedless, as fire moves across the tops of a field
of cropped and stubbled wheat...85

There most certainly are, one way or another.  Intelligence left to
itself would have populated the Universe long ago.  Some races would
probably have the discipline to deliberately not create Singularities...
at least one in a thousand, I should guess.  They still aren't here.  My
guess is that as soon as even an unSingular civilization runs across a
Singularity (like land mines scattered across the galaxies), or even as
soon as radio transmissions reach Them (and Earth puts out as much radio
flux as a small star, the photons on the way even now)... they vanish.

It's the only set of SI actions that can explain the Great Filter, I
think.  Causing the native sun to go supernova (while building a
wormhole?) isn't enough.  There would be species that avoided
Singularities, enough to populate the galaxies.  Only a deliberate
effort to ensure a silent sky could create the silent sky we see.

I can't begin to imagine what set of SI motives could result in such
actions.  Where are the Von Neumann helpers?  If the Powers want
something from mortals, why don't they have drones orbiting every star? 
Deliberate interference on the part of Singularities presents an even
greater puzzle than the Great Filter; if an SI wants something from
normal space, why don't they expand in all directions at lightspeed?

I think that the paradox results from our misunderstanding of causality.
 Suppose that the black hole at the heart of our galaxy is an SI or an
SI drone, spanning time (after the fashion of a Tipler cylinder) to the
beginning of its creation.  When our radio signals reach the black hole,
our civilization is... whatever they do with civilizations... possibly
thousands of years before the first radio.  One drone is sent; no Von
Neumann reproduction is necessary, and it arrives with plenty of time to
spare.  It's an intuitively unappealing answer, with nonabsolutes in the
wrong places, but it's the best answer I have.

What does a "goal" mean when there's no clear distinction between future
and past?  What does "now" mean when it can be changed after the fact? 
Perhaps it's our irretrievably linear analysis of "urgency" that gives
rise to the Great Filter Paradox.  Or perhaps, if we've already admitted
that civilizations are useful for something, this whole civilization is
conveniently simulated.  But then why create the appearance of paradox,
like a gigantic finger pointing at the cardboard props underlying the Universe?

Robin Hanson replied:

Since that phrase refers to rights to the peaceable use of one's real and
personal property, they have existed in abstract form since, oh, at least
Anglo-Saxon England.  That should suffice to show that such rights predate the
FCC's claims, though one might make a stronger claim. As to the claims to
specific property, Robin continues . . . .

>If you bought your

Whether or not it "came with FCC specified limits" resolves nothing on the
validity of the FCC's claim.  I might purchase property knowing that some
local thug *claims* the right to come and steal from my garden, but that has
no bearing on my right to complain that his theft violates my property rights.
Similar reasoning applies to the FCC's highly suspect claims--though the FCC
will often enforce its claims with even less efficacy than a local thief!

At any rate, people *have* been knowingly using the electromagnetic spectrum
for over two centuries.  Recall, after all, that visible and infrared light,
inter alia, constitute part of that spectrum.  It makes little sense to say
that the FCC has no claim over *one* frequency of radiation that I use solely
on my property (say, the light and heat cast by my fireplace) while it does
over another frequency (say, the frequency I use for my garage door opener).

>We could also say that two centuries ago each of us had an implicit right to 
>walk anywhere we wanted on the moon, and so any auction of moon property now
>would violate those ancient rights.  Isn't that a silly argument?  

The counter-argument is hardly apposite, given nobody routinely walks on the
moon in the course of peaceably using their pre-existing property.  But, at
any rate, I *would* regard as invalid the unsupported claim of any terrestrial
body to the whole of the moon.  In other words, I think it quite fair to say
that if you use your property to travel to and improve the moon, you would
stand quite within your rights to thumb your nose at earth-bound bureaucrats
who claim that you are trespassing.  The doctrine of adverse possession, if
nothing else, would count in your favor.

>And even if someone's reasonably implicit rights were at some point in the 
>past violated, it is not clear to me what that implies about current rights.
>As we all know, most land has been stolen many times over in the past.

The relation between the honest owner, the rascal who sells and resells, and
the honest purchaser for value, has been called "the eternal triangle" of the
law.  Suffice it to say that it entails some complications.  But, in brief, I
offer the traditional approach to this problem under common law:  Possession
is good title against all the world but the party who suffered the theft.  The
rule makes sense for both instrumentalist reasons and (for those who care
about such things) basic notions of justice.

  I have just started a similar discussion group for the
Usenet filtering project - see "newsfilter" list on
www.onelist.com

The idea was to create a set of open standards for storage
and transmission of semantic encodings for certain services,
and the first implementation of major architectural components.
This should create an infrastructure that should allow further
rapid development and value-added third party services.
Consider HTML-HTTP-Browser-Spider-Search engine combo for the Web.
After you have the first version of all, further development
of individual services and add-ons becomes possible.
So far, all semantic analysis has been done by humans. Now, build
another level of standards for representing (XML/MCF/...),
processing, and targeting documents based on their semantic
encoding, and you have something new - in fact, you will have
an environment that should hopefully make development of
symbolic AI as profitable an occupation for third-party
services as text retrieval became with the invention of
simple document-storage systems.

I suggested some ideas and perspective technologies in this
direction in
http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/articles/SemanticWeb.html

If anybody is interested in working on such a system,
we should definitely start a project mailing list.
Please email me personally, and we can discuss this further.

I think I see what TOMorrow is saying.  The FCC rights imply that you
can't set up a certain configuration of wire and batteries on your
private property.  If they can regulate radio, why not regulate the
emission of lightbulbs, or walking across the room...

I would reply that your radio waves are going all over my property.  Who
gave you the right to bombard me with radio waves?  You might as well
dump a load of sewage on my lawn!

Imagine a group of Libertarian AIs, faced for the first time with our
physical laws, and the conflicting rights to walk where one wishes and
to do work free from interference.  The solution is to invent the novel
concept of owning a pre-existing physical location, not just
information.  Pretty much all the same arguments apply.  Radio is just a
different kind of limited space.

When faced with inconsistent rights, create a new kind of property.

I believe that conditions at the beginning of the universe are
fundamentally different from those at the end.

The beginning was a very smooth and uniform environment.  The end (if
the universe collapses) is expected to be lumpy and nonuniform.

In Tipler's theory, it is actually necessary for the ending of the
universe to be specially engineered to be as nonuniform as possible in
order for infinite computations to exist.  The universe must be put into
a series of shape oscillations, alternately contracting/expanding along
different directions.  This shear phenomenon causes energy differentials
to continue to exist, which can be used to power computation.  Unless life
is able to direct the universe into this specific, unnatural pattern of
collapse, the universe becomes uniform and nothing more happens.

This would seem to indicate that the early universe, despite being
exceedingly hot and dense by our standards, was not a good environment
for evolution.  Without energy differences there is no way for life to
exist.

I don't believe this is true.  Our kind of life requires energy
differences, yes.  But the laws of thermodynamics aren't really laws;
they're statistical guidelines.  There is no physical reason why you
can't take tap water and produce electricity and ice cubes; it's just
very very improbable.  The laws of physics are time-symmetrical (except
for state-vector reduction); if the atoms are in the right places with
the right velocities, a glass of water can leap from the floor and unshatter.

Energy differentials are a human convention for encoding computations
into large ordered groups of particles.  But I am ignorant of a reason
why computations can't be encoded into single particles bouncing around
in a system of uniform temperature.  The thermodynamic (as opposed to
statistical) definition of entropy is not "complete disorder"; it means
"not 'ordered' in the sense of 'having different average temperatures in
different places'".  In fact, information is directly proportional to
entropy.  The more information it takes to encode a system, the more
mathematically random ("normal") that system is, the more entropy that
system has.  Ergo, maximally efficient information-processing takes
place at uniform temperature.

The question we have to ask is not, "Are there visible computations?",
but "Are there computations?"  How much computing power would it take to
accurately and precisely simulate the Big Bang?  If the answer is
"infinity", then any computation which has a finite chance of taking
place ought to occur.  Actually, there are some caveats to that, since
there has to be an infinite number of interactions between particles;
moreover, there has to be an infinitely long linear sequence of
interactions, with each interaction affecting the next interaction.

Anyway, the question isn't whether there are macroscopic computations
(of the sort we're used to) taking place, but whether arbitrary
computations can be encoded in the physical process of the Big Bang.

certainly... and to sustain life of other peoples and suppress suffering is good also
for you
since you will probably have a positive feedback more important than you investment
after.
Even if you are unaware of... i guess..
Of course, negative feedback is always possible. But i believe that statistically
positive feedback is far more important.

it is also a good principle to, as much as possible, not coerce any part of humanity

if it is their choice, but it would be far better if they have the ability to change
their mind about that after.
As for flesh sculpting it could be good to promote the reversability of decisions and
the information about... when it is possible.

Ha... perhaps i'm dumb and it's late for me but i don't see the connection between my
prior little argument and your somewhat anthropocentric ethical last one...??

Anyway... sure... we will have to be as sure as possible that the actions we will do
will gives the results we are waiting for....

The problem is the probabilities. Life based on improbable events will
be wiped out by the far more probable noise; there are lots of orders
of magnitude between them.
 
One way of seeing why life in a state with no arrow of time is
unlikely is that it cannot evolve, since evolution includes an
irreversible selection step where the unfit are weeded out. In a
reversible world individuals could un-die and and there would be no
evolution. In the same way memory and learning would be impossible,
since forgetting would be just as likely as learning.

Be careful about the word "information", it has different meanings in
different fields. The information in information theory is rather
different from the information concept used in daily life and not
necessarily even identical to negentropy.

But remember that there were particle horizons; at time t only

That is a different questions. There are arbitrary computations
encoded in the thermal vibrations in my desk. Somewhere it is running
my old ZX81 fractal program...

This is one of the paradoxes of the functionalist model for consciousness.
If we believe that running a particular AI program is enough to create
a feeling of consciousness, then it becomes necessary to cleanly define
what constitutes running such a program.  If thermal noise runs every
program, including super-intelligent AI programs, then presumably there
are conscious minds everywhere.  Can we be sure that our own perceptions
and memories are more than just fleeting patterns created by random
vibrations somewhere?

Exactly. I personally have no problems with this, but I can understand
that many regard this as utterly weird, perhaps so weird that
functionalism doesn't seem likely.

I would say that one needs to distinguish between minds running in
permanent systems and minds that just appear without any
context. There will be a near-infinity of the former and a much larger
number of the later, but only the former are able to have ongoing
subjective experience (the others are single "states" with no past or
future, even if they could have memories of a past). But things get
rather blurred, one could imagine the whole universe, complete with
the history from the Big Bang to timelike infinity emerging from some
noise somewhere in a bigger universe as just a single state as seen
from the perspective of anything in that bigger universe. But to us,
there is ongoing history.

Egan has done some fun speculations about this, of course. His story
Transition Dreams is rather disturbing.

Eliezer S. Yudkowsky asks:

>Who
>gave you the right to bombard me with radio waves?  You might as well
>dump a load of sewage on my lawn!

Recall that my discussion of the problematic nature of the FCC's claims dealt
only with cases in which one's peaceable use of the spectrum *does not
interfere with neighbors' uses.*  The question of one's right to transmit
*across* property lines raises other, tougher issues.  Eliezer's comment
suggests that all such transmissions constitute trespasses subject to
injunction.  That approach would, however, largely allow one crank to shut
down all wireless communications.  We would rightly object to that result, and
common law would not demand it.

Common law trademark law offers a better approach to the problem, one in which
the first to use a portion of the spectrum would win the right to enjoin uses
that interfere with third-party communications.  Under this approach, no one
would have any right to control how you use spectrum *on your own property.*
Interfere your neighbors' communications, however, and you might face a
lawsuit.

What about the putative trespass committed when your neighbors' signals cross
over your fence?  Property law would probably excuse the continuance of their
prior communications under easement theory.  Tort law would probably reach the
same result under the theory of nuisance, demanding that the crank build a
barrier to unwanted signals rather than allowing her to shut down all wireless
communications.  Reasonableness always plays a role in shaping injunctive
relief.

>When faced with inconsistent rights, create a new kind of property.

And create new inconsistencies?  That seems an unwise policy.  Rights will
always come into conflict; the law has the hard job of sorting out which ones
will prevail.  Creating new property rights out of thin air merely compounds
the problem.

Let me try an analogy.  Suppose that your computer had all RAM
randomized.  After interpreting these random instructions, eventually a
sort of order emerges where 1s clump together and 0s clump together and
most computational transactions occur when two areas of 1s and 0s mix.

>From the perspective of any systems that may evolve in the 1s-and-0s
world, our computers are so much random noise.  No useful
information-processing could possibly occur with 1s and 0s so mixed
together!  There's no arrow of time, either.

>From our perspective, our system is vastly more efficient than theirs,
which is built on top of several layers of abstraction and uses vast
clumps of near-random data to accomplish operations we could perform in
a single instruction.  As for the arrow of time, that happens when a
system starts out as an unsorted list and becomes a sorted list.  From
the Binary People's perspective, nothing has happened, but that's
because they can't see our kinds of order.

I am using "information" in the information-theoretical sense of "size
of Turing machine needed to produce output".

Yeah, hence the caveats.  I'm afraid I don't know.  I got the impression
that during the very early Big Bang, everything was within everything
else's light cone.  Of course, that doesn't mean an infinite number of
actions could be performed.  What's the function for the radius of the
Big Bang as a function of time?  Anyone know?

All computations are recorded/encoded, but not instantiated, in the
digits of pi.  Let me define "instantiated" a bit more nearly, to
distinguish from "recorded".  For one thing, it's obvious that recording
can't be enough, or all computations would be real and everything is
true, which could possibly the case and certainly explains everything,
but is not useful for making choices.  I once followed this path down as
far as I could, and while there actually isn't any way to define an
"instantiation", there are some partial definitions that will work most
of the time.

Your desk is almost certainly NOT instantiating the fractal program. 
Justifying this would take far more time than I'm willing to spend; my
apologies and feel free not to believe me; by my best guess the answer
is entirely subjective.

For the purpose of Alpha Point behavior, the question is not really a
mathematical point of defining instantiation, but whether the Alpha
"Powers" are powerless digits of pi or active entities (like us) capable
of controlling their environment, and particularly of surviving or
escaping the Great Freezing.

The question is this:  If you were the Singularity, could you set up the
Big Bang in such a way as to encode your consciousness AND your
technology into the initial conditions?  If this is possible without
introducing large-scale anomalies, then it would happen as a result of
pure chance in some region.  Remember, we're talking about infinity
here.  Larger than 3^^^^3 or Graham's Number.

So, by the Anthropic Principle, what are *we* doing in the Long Cold? 
My guess is because the first Power to evolve in that space gobbled up
all the computing power.  Alternatively, consciousness wasn't possible*.
 Anyway, between the two alternatives, you still don't have any way for
mortal races to evolve.  Not like here, where there's a long lightspeed
separation.  (Actually, I STILL don't understand why the stars are
silent, so put it down as part of the Great Filter Paradox.)

* = Mitchell Porter has suggested this is due to the inflationary
scenario, which could have made computing power unusable due to
lightspeed problems.  Our Universe may be optimized so that no Alpha
Powers could exist!

Death is eternity.  Eternity is starlight.  Starlight is silent.
For those who are encoded it is immortality of a sort.

(With apologies to Glen Cook.)

Not in standard Big Bang cosmology, and hence the "horizon problem" 
-- how to explain why distant regions of the universe are in thermal 
equilibrium despite them never having been in causal contact. 
Inflation theory tries to solve this problem by postulating an epoch 
of very rapid expansion in the early universe, so that all that we 
see when we look around in cosmos today originated from such a small 
volume that within that volume things had had time to interact before 
the inflation set in.

It depends on the global topology of the universe. If the universe is 
closed then when it is radiation dominated (as it was in its early 
stages) it expands as

R = sqrt[A^2 + t^2], where t is a time parameter -A<t<+A.

If open, then

R = sqrt[t^2 - A^2], where +A<t<positive infinity

(Note that in the latter case, R is not a radius -- the universe is 
spatially infinite at all times -- but a scale factor.)

Finally, if the universe is flat, then

R = sqrt[2At], 0<t< positive infinity

where again R is a scale factor.

The front end is not the most important issue, the matching mechanism and

My impression was that the problem was how to explain the
mass-distribution discontinuities (that caused the coalescence of
galaxies) when the whole Universe was in causal contact; that inflation
was postulated to provide a period when rapid expansion inflated small
variances into large discontinuities without permitting the system to
equalize.  I yield, however, to superior knowledge.

Doesn't make a difference; the point is that in the standard cosmology
the early Big Bang was in causal contact.

I get the impression that in all cases, the sum of computing power is
infinite.  At time 1/t (t=10^45, for example), distance is proportional
to either 1/t or 1/t^2, so the farther back you go towards the
beginning, the closer things are and the less time it takes to communicate.

If between time t and u light can bounce back and forth once between two
particles, it can also bounce once between t/2 and u/2, or t/1000 and u/1000.
That's in a flat universe; in an open or closed universe, it can bounce
back and forth a thousand times between t/1000 and u/1000.

In either case, it looks to me like you get an infinite number of
interactions in linear sequence.

I'm not sure that it would be necessary to code up an intricate matching
algorithm. I doubt there would be enough responses to warrant one. The most
important issue is coming up with useful questions/sections, efficient
display and retrieval. There aren't going to be such a flood of responses
that the whole archive could not be easily browsed I'd imagine.

Of course there is a certain novelty to computer matching, but little utility.

Inflation would enlarge the regions of causal contact by an 
astronomically large but still finite factor (though there 
are so many versions of inflation theory now that 
it's difficult to be sure that this is true in all of them.) But then 
I don't see how it would give you an infinitely large region of 
stuff that has been in causal contact.

I will show my lack of knowledge on this topic and ask why does it begin
on Jan 1, 2001?  My guess would be because there is no year "0", but I
have never had anyone explain it with that answer so perhaps I am wrong
and that is not the reason.

I would be interested in knowing the line of reasoning used.

I actually have a related peeve which is the way some people keep
trying to correct this. Of course you are right, but who cares?
Obviously the Millenial celebrations are going to start on 1. Jan. 2000,
not 2001. 

People who understand your point already know it, those who don't
will never get it. I am already sick of millenial celebrations. Please
don't add to the angst by starting pointless threads!

Just so.  The first century (and millennium) started on Jan 1, AD1 (because
the ninny who did the calculations for the Pope around the middle of the
sixth century forgot about year zero.  Incidentally, it's generally
accepted, I think, that Christ was born in 5 BC).  Add a century to 1, get
AD101.  Add a thousand, get AD1001.  Add two thousand, get Jan 1, AD2001.
*It can't possibly be anything else*, even if heavyweights like Stephen Jay
Gould get all populist and damp-eyed and go for the ignorant 2000.

The following gambit doesn't offer a very good rate of return (but then you
don't risk your investment), although you might get beaten up.  Go into a
bar, find all the bunnies who insist noisily that the next millennium
starts Jan 1, 2000.  Offer them a dollar for each year that has passed
since the start of the first Christian millennium until the date they say
it ends, in exchange for $2000.  Collect $1 from each of them and run away.

You don't need an infinitely large region of stuff.  (Where would you
get it?  There's only so much mass in the Universe.)  You need a
reasonably large region of stuff, enough RAM to run a Power; a bunch of
particles the mass of a football would almost certainly be enough.  Then
you need it to undergo an infinite amount of subjective time; that is,
an infinite number of lightspeed-limited interactions between all the particles.

It is a very good and relevant argument, but it has yet to be tested that
development will be stopped if patents were stopped. Companies shurely would
not cease to exist, they would spend their money on something else and
shurely they would still do minimal research to keep an edge.
Perhaps r&d would just be more distributed as the wealth made by new
inventions would be distributed too. Curiosity and the small competitive
edge could probably take us a long way.

I don't know, and we will not know until it is tested.

This is not an ideal example, since the thermodynamics of this system
is rather iffy (in addition, whether complex structures appear depends
on the evolution rule). It has an arrow of time (if the rule is
irreversible) but the amount of computation it can do is finite.

The conditions near the big bang was closer to having the memory
constantly randomized; in this system no order can emerge other than
in the functionalist "stones implementing windows" sense.

Now I'm confused. This seems to be more like the second paragraph
above, but your example is a deterministic dynamical system with a
fairly standard dynamics.

That is the algorithmic complexity measure (sometimes called
Kolmogorov complexity); it is measured in bits but it is not what is
used in standard information theory. The definition of bits as an unit
of information is based on Shannon information, "the amount of
uncertainty reduced by the answer to a yes/no question where the
outcomes have 50% a priori probability". 

Suppose you have the string "0000000000...0001000000...." with a
single 1 at position 4711. The algorithmic complexity is different
from the Shannon entropy (which sees it as a sequence of symbols to be
compressed rather than the output of a program). Note that as I move
the single 1 further and further into the string, the algorithmic
complexity grows since the program has to encode the number where to
put it.

This is a truly messy area.

Nick gave you it, but I would like to add that you should really
integrate the light-cones to make sure about the horizons; I think
they get tricky near t=0.

(Actually, Max Tegmark's paper "Is the TOE really the ultimate enseble

this can be useful and actually have explanatory power).

Huh? If the answer is subjective you can't justify it. What I meant is
that there is a function f so that the
f(desk-state(t))=program-state(t) over time. This is fairly trivial.

I'm not quite buying that infinity factor; but even if I accept it,
the Alpha would have a problem with encoding initial conditions due to
the infinity of *other*, different, Alphas co-existing and doing the
exact same thing, as well as the even larger infinity of noise
processes corrupting the data. 

(If Alpha has X bits, it could randomly appear with a good chance in a
field of 2^X random bits. Which suggests that for every Alpha there
are 2^(X-1) bits of noise - the bigger the gods, the noisier :-)

In a similar vein.  I've been pondering a course of action...a strategy if you
will.

Since it has become obvious that the electoral system in this country is
useless ...that voting does nothing other than validate the system to be
further exploited by the parasites....er...politicians and
bureaucrats.....then there ought to be some other course of action.

Obviously there is armed rebellion.  The "shoot all the lawyers" scenario.
While that would be very satisfying it would be extremely messy and
counterproductive in the long run.  (Read the breif explanation of the fall of
the Roman Empire in "The Lucifer Principal")

So my suspicion is that the only other alternative is ridicule and scorn.
That is to make those sucking at the government tit feel extremely
uncomfortable and ashamed of their profession such that they abandon it.  

I'm still thinking on this...but I find Dick's "tone" to be right in line with
viewpoint.

Computers capable of running that fine-grained model won't exist until long,
long after uploading a higher-level model becomes feasible.  A few paranoid
types might wait, but their experience would hardly be typical.

If all you care about is the identity question and other philosophical
issues, then yes.  However, the moment you get into practical considerations
(what will it be like, what will we be able to do, etc), good projections
become critical.  It is very easy to project only one technology while
ignoring everything else, but if you fall into this trap you end up with a
scenario that could never happen.

Generally, I like the idea of being able to change gender, species and other
apsects of myself.  The question arises as to whether you'd have to engineer
parts of the mind to change gender or not.

Well, none of them were that superintelligent. 

A selection possibility: the communicative, reasonable
superintelligent citizens were busy elsewhere and left the exploration
of the universe (such a boring place) to the eight-year-olds in C-Z.

But as the characters remarked, it was only an old tradition.

I don't think you can get uploading without fine-grained models. How
do you make a higher-level model of a mind without scanning it on a
low level? Remember that the only thing we know are possible to scan
are the actual physical processes going on in the head, not the
information processes. And these scanable processes are low-level
stuff like neural firing, neuron types, connectivity and so on, highly
variable and individual.

Borges. I recommend his stories, they are lovely mindbending
stuff. Very much like M.C. Escher.

Well, it took me 6 months to finish Zen and the Brain, with occasional
long sittings (on the bus, on airplanes, in the Grand Canyon - my copy
even has a faint red tint due to the sandstone dust) and usually a few
short chapters each week. It takes time to read and think about, but
it is worth it. I finished it, symbolically, on New Years Eve.

It is rather heavy on the neuroscience, but not technical. Austin has
some fairly nice introductions to various systems, both the elementary
stuff about neurons and how the brain works, and some of the more
thrilling subsystems like the brainstem nuclei. I learned a lot. I
think you could read the book, especially if you at the same time read
some intro to neuroscience or neuropsychology - I really recommend
Biological Psychology by Kalat, definitely a book that should be on
transhumanist reading lists. 

Much of the book is about what Zen is (a rather tricky question), how
it has developed, what it does and what the author has
experienced. Very beautifully written in places. The parts where he
becomes less excellent are where he discuss things he haven't
experienced firsthand or haven't got solid scientific grounding (like
the discussions of ongoing enlightenment), but overall, Austin does a
good job. It is tough going and a long climb, but the view is grand.

It seems like the best way to expose such graft is to have really severe rules on
ethical government, such that nobody would want to work in government because they
do not want to expose their private lives to such scrutiny as we have been seeing
the past few years. However, as we also see, those that stay and thrive in such a
system are so goddam sanctimonious that they think such practices are good for
everybody, and should be applied to private industry as well. I don't think that
this is at all productive, is merely a road to tyranny. Its a good example of the
road to hell being paved with good intentions.

Frankly I don't care how many gifts or favors are going around, so long as we the
consumers of government, get optimal value in goods and services rendered for
price paid. For this reason, I think that all government agencies should be
required to open their books for auditing by independent organizations like
Consumer Reports, etc. so we can see if such agencies are cost effective or not.
Non-cost effective agencies should be disbanded and the markets for the agencies
products should be opened to competition. Congress should not be able to keep
dinosaurs operating in perpetuity...

But it _has_ been tested: the thousands of years of human history
before the newfangled idea of patents were as productive and
creative as today.  Agriculture, construction, toolmaking, money,
clothing, cooking, boats, roads, water power, and countless other
technologies that are so commonplace we hardly think of them as
high-tech were all invented long before patents.

The argument that patents are necessary to support long-term R&D
is circular: long-term R&D only exists because the patent system
makes it more profitable to invest in long-term research in the
hope of discovering something novel and patentable than to invest
in the gradual, step-wise refinement of existing technologies
that was the rule before patents.  Creating an exclusive property
right in "novelty" does precisely what any other similar subsidy
does: it artificially raises the value of novelty at the expense
of other things such as craftsmanship and service.

That may or may not be a good thing; novelty may be something we
think is good to subsidize as part of our culture, much the way
the French subsidize wine production.  Or we may think that such
novelty is so valuable that we want more than the natural amount
of it.  Even Dr. Friedman agrees that patents encourage the
production of novelty; but the question naturally raised by that
is this: we, as libertarians, don't ask what the "right" amount
of bread or cars produced is; we assume it is whatever the market
naturally produces.  Why, then, do we attempt to produce the
"right" amount of novelty by encouraging it with patents, rather
than letting the free market decide that as well?

Worse, they're being pedantic _without_ even being correct.  The
year AD 1 started on March 1, not January.  So there are two choices
for how you choose to celebrate "the millennium" (quoted to emphasize
that this is merely a matter of definition, not substance): January
1, 2000 with the rest of the planet, or March 1, 2001 with a few
historians.  Anyone who celebrates January 1, 2001 is just a pedantic
jerk for no good reason.

On the contrary, it took thousands of years for these inventions to
be developed.  The rate of advancement was far slower in the past
than it is today.

Historical tests like this are not very meaningful, because so many
variables are changing.  We saw an increase in economic growth rates, from
a doubling time of 500-1000 years to one of about 100 years in the 18th
century, with a futher increase to a doubling time of 10-20 years in the
20th century.  Someone who wanted to promote patents could suggest that
they played a large role in motivating this increase, and that without
patents we would be back to 500-1000 years to double our economic output.

That's nothing new.  Everyone in Artificial Intelligence knows that
passing the Turing Test is 20 years away.  Always has been, always will be.

Yes, but you don't need to be able to sim the entire brain at this level.
You can build an abstract, generalized neuron simulator without ever
simulating more than a small cluster of neurons at the molecular level.  Set
up one instance of the simulator for every neuron in the brain, and you've
got an upload.

Of course, you still need to scan at the molecular level to get the data to
initialize those simulators.  The advantage is that you reduce the
computational burden by a gigantic factor.  The necessary knowledge of
neurobiology should already exist by the time we can run even this
simplified sim, so this approach should be feasible long before we could run
the brute-force sim.

More obvious factors are simple population and more efficient
communication.  I would argue that the explosion in development
happened in spite of IP law (which limits communication), not
because of it; but you are right that such historical tests are
dangerous and often misleading.  I would point out, though, that
the increases you mention happening in the 18th century must be
credited to pre-patent ingenuity; patents were not a factor until
the 19th century.

Even if we concede that patents increase the speed of development,
history shows that the argument that development would not happen
at all without them still fails, and the price we pay for this
increased innovation (in things like quality and service) may still
be too high.

A philosophical question to ponder: are novelty and innovation
inherently valuable?  Or are they, like money, valuable only
insofar as they are used to produce more of what we value for
itself (life, pleasure, etc.)?  Patents serve to increase the
production of novelty (that is, things that are very different
from existing things) rather than the gradual refinement and
evolution of natural development, so our answer to that question
is important in assessing their value.

New terminology:

I dub our Universe the "Socrates Universe".
Terra::Sol::Milky Way::Local Group::Virgo supercluster::Socrates Universe

Yudkowsky's Razor:  "That simplest explanation is true which, given the
past, most strongly predicts the present as a unique outcome."

What do you mean, "constantly randomized"?  The only random operation I
know of is state-vector reduction, and we who are built on it seem to
get along just fine.  If all the particles are bumping into each other,
you say "random", I say "interaction".  I will agree that Alpha potence
seems to depend on there being some configuration of particles that can
actively defend itself.  Why is this impossible?

I'm trying to make a distinction about levels of abstraction.  Human
life is built on several levels of abstraction, starting with quarks and
moving up to cells.  As with neural networks, there's a tradeoff between
resilience and efficiency.  If your fundamental operations are
statistical properties of vast groups of underlying particles, you're
less sensitive to blips in the twentieth decimal place.  This makes you
more resilient and less efficient for exactly the same reason.  To
distinguish between active and platonic Powers, we might add the
Hofstadterian caveat that there is top-down ("holistic") causality; the
high-level explanation compactly predicts low-level events.

The point I'm trying to make is twofold:  First, that usable statistical
properties are not limited to "hot" and "cold"; "matter" and
"antimatter" groupings might do as well, for example.  Thinking that no
computation is possible at thermal equilibrium is anthropocentrism. 
Second, that operations can take place at the lowest level without any
statistical grounding at all.

What, you mean that any interaction at all might be impossible since
particle A is inflating away from particle B faster than light?  I
thought of that, but I'm not sure how to compute it.

It has too much explanatory power.  If I sprout wings and fly, there was
some computation somewhere that embodied it.  With Platonic computation,
anything can happen.  The fact that anything doesn't happen suggests
that this is not the case.  Certainly our Universe is predicted along
with everything else, but it is not uniquely predicted.

State-vector reduction is a great ugly blemish on modern physics.  So
why suppose it exists at all?  Occam's Razor says there's no such thing.
 If there was no state-vector reduction, our current world would exist
anyway, right?  So why postulate this additional cause, which screws up
the whole of physics?

(Yes, it's Singularity Analysis, where Occam's Razor doesn't work!)

You need to use Yudkowsky's Razor:  "That simplest explanation is true
which, given the past, most strongly predicts the present as a unique
outcome."

No, I think the Big Bang is analogous to an infinite-speed CPU operating
on a large but finite amount of RAM.  There are around 10^80 (?)
elementary particles around, call it a max of 10^100 to leave room for
error.  So when the first Alpha is born out of 10^10^7 subjective years
of randomness, it is the only Alpha around.  This doesn't apply if
simple self-replicating particle groups are possible; you'd probably get
a bunch of evolved mortal Bang People writing AIs.

The second thing to bear in mind is that if Big Bangs are useful enough
that we would want to make our own, our Big Bang is almost certainly
artificial.  That sentence was incomprehensible.  I dub this the
"Socrates Universe".  If we Terrans (or our SIs) would want to make Big
Bangs, the Socrates Big Bang was almost certainly artificial.

Anyway, the "random chance" argument really only applies to the very
first Big Bang there ever was, which may not have been a Big Bang at
all.  I find the Big Bang and our physical laws to be very contrieved. 
I find it very easy to believe that the actual First Cause was a lot simpler.

I see four possibilities:

1)  Something has kept both the Powers and other mortal civilizations
from walking all over the Milky Way.  (Lightspeed limits plus the
Anthropic Principle?  Infinite space plus the Anthropic Principle?)
2)  The Powers have kept other mortal civilizations from using up the
Milky Way because they need it (us?) for something.
3)  The mortal civilization obeys the Prime Directive and the Powers
aren't home.
4)  This is a computer simulation.

Take your pick.

I'd go for that in an eyeblink.

However..you know from being in the USAF( just as I was) that the government

But it is being tested, in the Open Source software community. Cygnus Support
and Red Hat are both successful companies that do research and development
of software and then give away the result. They make money on support. There
are manyu other examples in the Open Source community. Most of the massive
amounts of code they provide is being developed by others, but they are making
significant contributions themselves.

Exactly.  It's a good moment for a party.  If you're going to have a massive
party, you'd better let everyone know in advance, and people have known
about this one for a couple of years now.

I'm planning to renumber the years, after my coup, from the agricultural
revolution (call it 8000 BC), to get rid of all those poor people living
backwards:  e.g. Plato/Platon, b. 428, d. 348.

convention lee.  since extropians are nonconventional types, i propose
we fix
an old problem: the century naming convention.  the 17th century is the
16 hundreds.  thats made me crazy since forever, and led to countless
misunderstandings.

i propose we name the years 1 to 99 the zeroth century.  then the 19th
century would be 1 jan 1900 to 31 dec 1999.  then everything makes
sense.  the only thing you need to recall is that the zeroth century had
only 99 years, the zeroth decade had 9 yrs, etc.  spike

Could somone please explain to me how it is that the christians decided to
base the calendar around the birth of christ and then the whole world and
all the other religions ended up saying, "OK, that sounds good to us. . .
we'll just go by your arbitrary decision."  What a persuasive group the
christians must have been!  Does anyone know when the use of the current
calendar went into effect?

The problem is that two particles can't communicate with each other when they're
arbitrarily close together. The smaller the wavelength of light the greater
the energy it has and thus it's mass,  remember E =MC^2 so M= E/c^2.
Thus at some point the wavelength is so small and the mass is so great that
gravitational effects become important and  a mini Black Hole is formed with a
singularity at its center. Today's physics can't say anything about things
smaller than the Plank Length of 10^-33 cm, or anything about  time shorter
than the time light takes to travel that distance, the Plank Time of 5.4 * 10^-44 sec.
On the other hand modern physics can't say anything about what's going
on inside the singularity either so perhaps there is some small hope for infinite
computation there.

Title
  The effect of repetitive
  magnetic stimulation on localized musculoskeletal pain.
Source
  Neuroreport.  9(8):1745-8, 1998 Jun 1.
Abstract
  Current magnetic coil stimulators can efficiently activate
  neural structures without deep electrode placement and the
  local discomfort associated with transcutaneous electrical stimulation used
  in pain control. We tested the possibility of reducing pain
  in patients with localized musculoskeletal processes by applying
  repetitive magnetic stimulation on
  the tender body region. Thirty patients were randomized to
  receive 40 min of real or sham magnetic stimulation. After a
  single session, real magnetic stimulation significantly
  exceeded the sham effect: a 101-point pain
  score decreased by 59% in the treated group and 14% in
  sham-treated patients (z = -3.26, p = 0.001). The pain
  relief attained regularly persisted for several days. Results indicate that
  powerful magnetic coil stimulation can efficiently reduce
  pain originating from localized musculoskeletal injuries.

  Voluntary and involuntary
  weight loss: associations with long term
  mortality in 9,228 middle-aged and elderly men.
Source
  American Journal of Epidemiology.  148(6):546-55, 1998 Sep 15.
Abstract
  Recent studies have suggested that weight
  loss in middle-aged persons antecedes increased mortality.
  Therefore, the authors sought to examine the association between changes in
  body weight and subsequent mortality, according to
  self-reported dieting status. The authors followed 9,228 men aged 40-65 years
  in 1963, for whom weight changes between 1963 and 1968 were
  recorded and extensive clinical, anthropometric, biochemical, and dietary
  assessments were made. Of these men, 2,471 reported being on a diet when
  first examined in 1963, and 636 were dieting primarily to lose
  weight. Mortality follow-up covered an 18-year period
  (1968-1986). Men who lost 5 kg or more between 1963 and 1968 ("extreme
  weight losers") exhibited the following age-pooled risks of
  mortality relative to the stable weight group: for total
  mortality, 1.36 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-1.55); for all
  cardiovascular disease mortality, 1.40 (95% CI 1.16-1.69); for all
  non-cardiovascular disease mortality, 1.33 (95% CI 1.11-1.59); for coronary
  heart disease mortality, 1.55 (95% CI 1.25-1.93); and for cancer mortality,
  0.90 (95% CI 0.65-1.24). After adjustment for differences in coronary heart
  disease risk factor levels and morbidity between these groups at the end of
  the weight change period (1968), the excess risks associated
  with extreme weight loss declined by
  approximately one third. They declined further if adjustment was made for
  1963 (pre-weight-change period) morbidity and risk factor
  levels. Being on a slimming diet, as reported in 1963, was associated with an
  approximate doubling of excess mortality in men with extreme
  weight loss. Weight
  loss in 1963-1968 coincided with an increased incidence of
  coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus and a declining level of serum
  total cholesterol. This and other studies indicate that both
  voluntary and involuntary
  weight loss might be associated with a
  small increase in the risk of all-cause mortality.

Most likely yes. Exactly how and what to change depends a bit on what
you want to achieve, of course. I don't think changing the "gender" of
the whole brain is particularly practical, but maybe sexual
preferences might be interesting to have a setting for (you need to do
something in the hypothalamus, but we don't know where yet - that is
one piece of messy programming, the brain's version of spaghetti
code). But of course, at the time when this kind of automorphism
becomes possible we will have a better idea of what we might want to
change and how.

Let's not forget the obvious, 'boring' possibility: There has never been a
technological singularity, and everything is just as it appears.  After all,
the fact that we are here is pretty good evidence that there were no Big
Bang people.

I'm not sure of the time distances we're talking of here but I doubt the
experience of uploading will be "typical" at all. If we're going to talk
about realistic scenarios we must include social factors. Firstly, will
anyone fund uploading specific research? If not you have to be sure your
technologies have other more mainstream uses. It's possible neurobiology and
artificial intelligence research could reach a point where a "mind
abstraction" algorithm, built to create high-level models for the purpose of
uploading, would become trivial. This would, however, be long after we have
the computer power. Added to this is the lack of willingness of scientists
to treat age-related death as something that needs to be overcome,
especially in such a radical and mind-bending way. Secondly, uploading has
major philosophical ramifications. Although many of us, myself include, have
thought about it enough to see uploading as a reasonable goal it's still the
hottest subject of dispute on this list besides politics. Cloning -
something that's causing massive social upheaval - didn't get much of a look
in on this list; philosophy wise it was a non-issue. Now factor uploading
into the equation. Currently it's at the level "so bizarre I'm not even
going acknowledge the possibility" soon - perhaps when it's done to a
sheep - it will reach the status of "bastard scientists trying to reap our
souls". It is my opinion that these factors will be more likely to shape a
feasible scenario than technology.

We're fairly ignorant about the possibilities. For instance, I could argue
that intelligence cannot be increased, that there is a "window of
intelligence" that results in creatures more intelligent than us being
increasingly unlikely. You cannot currently refute this claim because we
don't have a good explanation of what exactly intelligence is. Yet such a
claim will crush any dreams of super intelligence.  It's possible that much
of the brains power comes from social interaction and physical interaction,
making lone 1,000 speed minds impractical. It's possible that the mind is a
very rigid and fragile thing and making it 'see' in four dimensions (and so
on) is impractical. Again, you can't refute these claims and I doubt you
could give much evidence against them.

HAH! Not so fast! 

Neurons are complicated, and have a lot of individuality. First, they
come in many different types, each having quite different properties;
both shape and size, but also electrochemical properties, receptor
types, ion channels and behavior that interact in a very nonlinear
way. Then each neuron may have tricky internal states, both in the
synapses (concentrations of calcium and at present little understood
proteins and other chemicals that affect their strength) and inside
the cell body. Add to this the individual variations in geometry and
perhaps chemical properties, and you get a very confucing picture. 

This is what you need to simulate to make a somewhat realistic
neuron. Note that we are not talking about actual molecular scale
simulations, just things like calcium concentrations in dendrite <1 2
1 3> or the membrane potential at the soma. So to do an upload we will
need to set up an instance of this kind of simulation for each
neuron. It is not that impossible really, except that we lack the
necessary data for a truly complete neuron model (membrane
conductivity is reasonably well understood, synapse behavior a hot
topic, plasticity controversial and the more subtle or complex
interactions between activity, modulation, geometry and genetic
switches are completely unknown), and that we have too little
computing power yet (both the computers and simulators need to get
better). But it is in principle doable, and I hope to be there when it
happens.

Can we simplify neurons? Probably; this is just how nature made them,
and I think it is possible to create more computationally efficient
input-output mappings retaining the same properties. This is an
interesting problem, both from a research, a theoretical and an
uploading standpoint. What can we do away with without losing the
important? How much detail is needed? Could you upload yourself into
an integrate-and-fire model? Could this process be continued on higher
scales?

The technology for doing uploads will likely at first be developed
just for getting the data for advanced neuron and brain simulations.

What we need now is better data, better models and better computers.

The key enabling technologies are computers, high-resolution scanning
devices and an understanding of how the brain works.  All of these areas are
the subject of intense research for reasons that have nothing to do with
uploading.

Such models would be a logical extension of current work in neurobiology.  I
expect they will be created by mainstream researchers as soon as it is
feasible to do so.

True enough, but will this still be a problem in 20 years?  Major life
extension should be far easier than uploading, after all.  Once the first
big increase materializes, they may become more willing to contemplate the
possibilities.

I agree.  However, a hard look at the technology tells you a lot about the
social parameters.  If dramatic life extension, AI, nanotech, or other
radical innovations come before uploading, they will have a substantial
impact on the public reaction.

Of course we can't 'prove' anything about the future.  However, some methods
of prediction work better than others.

If you think uploading is possible, that implies that the mind is a complex
information processing system grounded in physical reality.  Once you accept
that proposition, there is actually quite a lot we can say about what kinds
of claims make sense.

Information processing systems are ultimately very fluid things - it is just
about impossible for them to exhibit the kinds of rigid limits you propose.
A claim like 'no mind can be smarter than a bright human' makes about as
much sense as 'any mass of gold more than ten miles in diameter will
spontaneously combust'.  Neither claim can actually be tested, but it would
be amazing if either one were true.

If you want to construct a plausible upload scenario, it makes sense to
start by simply projecting current trends into the future based on our
current knowledge.  Once you've got that baseline, its a lot easier to make
meaningful speculations about what a particular unexpected discovery would
mean.

Ditto, though recently I've adopted the alternate approach of just sleeping
less. I think the only long-term solution is to find someone who wants to do
similar things anyway.

I've often thought that it would make sense to start out dating people with
more experience when you're young and switch over to younger people when
you're older. But that goes against various cultural and social factors;
OTOH it seems to have worked well for a couple of friends. Certainly I have
much more trouble getting along with most people of my age than with those
who are significantly older or younger.

That's possibility number 3.  Supposing that our intelligence is the
max, it's still sufficient for us to reproduce and reproduce and
reproduce and fill up the entire Milky Way with Orbitals and then go on
to other galaxies as fast as lightspeed will let us, in a million-year
blink of the eye.  But we see no sign that other races have done this.

Latest astrophysical data suggests that planets aren't all that rare. 
You can make whatever assumptions you'd like about the rarity of
intelligence.  But, as I understand it, we aren't in a particularly
early stage of the Milky Way or of the Socrates Universe.  Suns like
ours have grown old and died already.  Our 4.5-billion-year path to
intelligence was not a noticeable sprint.  So why isn't the real estate
used up?  This set of assumptions yields mortal races, but the vast
majority are born during the early years of the galaxy.

You can explain mortal silence by reference to Singularity, and you can
explain Power silence by reference to unSingularity, but it's kind of
difficult to explain both.

Well, I didn't say we could do it *now*.  A MD-level sim of a few hundred
cells would take, what, maybe 10^20 MIPS?  I was just pointing out that even
that is a far cry from a full-brain sim.

I would think so.  At the very least, you should be able to model the
computation each neuron performs and do away with all the chemical details
of how it gets done.  If you want to get ambitious, you could probably also
replace a large percentage of the simulated brain with ordinary software.
Computer vision, hearing, and other sensory abilities will probably be much
better than those of humans by then, for example.  Of course, setting up the
interface would be a bit of a challenge..

I wouldn't be surprised.

Nature has had billions of years to thoroughly exploit and deepen every
possible quirk that could be used for computing power.  Roger Penrose
thinks that the fundamental units of computation are microtubule dimers,
which would put the brain at 10^26 ops/second.  He furthermore
speculates that the brain uses quantum computing.  I'm not sure I
believe (guess-that) either, but I wouldn't be the least bit surprised.

Christian nuts more or less conquered most of the other religious
nuts over the last ~500 (christian) years.  The islamic calendar
is still used as the official calendar by some muslim states, and
at least the islamic and chinese calendars are widely used for
unofficial purposes throughout the world.  I recall reading that
before a calendar reform was instituted in India shortly after
independence there were a few dozen calendars being used there.

I've noticed that Penrose is long on guesses and short on actual data. Lets
see some microtubule signal studies that show actual computation. We don't
know whats going on in there because we aren't developing any kind of a
database of fine grained neuron to neuron signaling (or microtubule, for
that matter) from which to analyse that actual computation is taking place,
in what format, etc. Our present approach on that scale is tantamount to
moving rowboats with battleships, or using the proverbial nuke to swat a
fly.

When I sit in front of my TV, when it is on, I know that 'something' is
going on in there, but nothing I see on the screen is telling me exactly
what. I cannot infer a video receiver circuit merely from seeing that a
display exhibits information, nor can I trouble shoot the circuit components
on such a basis. I can develop many ideas of how the pictures came to be,
from accurate theories all the way to theories about little men being
trapped in the box, or it being a window to god..... just because I put nice
fancy catch phrases in my description doesn't make it so.

Taking current knowledge conventional theory in biology and cosmology as
starting points:

1) Chemical-based life can't evolve until you have enough supernovae to
produce planets with a decent abundance of heavy elements.  That means no
life until maybe 5 -6  billion years ago, right?

2) Life appears easily, but it takes billions of years to get beyond the
microbe stage.  Worlds with a 5-6 billion year history and no multicellular
life could easily be the norm.

3) We have no basis for determining how fast evolution occurred on Earth vs.
other worlds - there are pretty good arguments for the view that we live in
a very accelerated environment that would be very rare.

4) If light speed limits are real, all we are really assuming is that we are
not in the light cone of another Singularity.  Given the above points, that
is only a few hundred million light years - a small fraction of the
universe.

Speaking of Roger Penrose...

I'm guessing that a large number of people here have read Hans Moravec's new
book, Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind, which features a small comic
strip featuring a certain Roger. I've never read any of Penrose's books so I
don't know if he makes similar comments about Moravec, but I do know he's
working on a new book and I had an idea for a comic strip for him to include
in it. It's extremely unsubtle (featuring Moravec's consciousness residing
in the thermal vibrations of a baboons arse) and I doubt Penrose would
approve. But if anyone can get me in contact with him I'd be grateful.

Incremental leaps in life extension may prepare us, as long as there are no
'quantum leaps' (these tend to create problematic knee-jerk reactions). AI
before uploading is the only route to social acceptance in my view, as long
as AI isn't seen as an automating job-destroying menace. And only if AI is
sociable, it could turn out that invisible computers are better than talking
ones (I'd bet money on it).

If you make a high-level abstraction (that is, a piece of code that
recreates the exact input and output) of a neuron do you preserve subjective
experience? If you make a high-level abstraction of the entire brain do you
preserve subjective experience? What is identity? How much is different?
Even if you do think uploading is possible you're still faced with hundreds
of currently unanswerable questions.

Why do we have such small brains? To me it suggests that the level of
complexity achievable is *very* close to the achieved level.

Since we're talking about plausible future scenarios it might be fun, being
in the midst of millennium fever, to come up with some. No dates or
predictions, just how you think the next few major technologies will
pan-out. How about it? (And fifty years from now, when we're all six
centimetres tall and living in habitat domes on the moon, we can have a good
laugh at them.)

Actually, the christian calendar was adopted as the standard calendar for
scheduling air travel worldwide after WWII (just as English is the standard
language for air traffic controllers and pilots, and almost all daily clocks are
more or less oriented on Greenwich mean time). Prior to that, it had gained
quite a bit of dominance thanks to the wonderfully benevolent help :) of empires
like the British Empire, the Spanish Empire, the Russian Empire, and, to a
lesser extent, the German, French, Dutch, and Italian empires.

While it may be fashionable to blame the US for all of this cultural
imperialism, most of it was already underway for a long time with the British
and others. We just picked up the pieces and moved on when the last, Brittania,
busted....

Oh, no, not the dreaded identity question! :-)

I'm not getting into this one - in my experience, everyone who cares has
already made up their mind.

I'm not sure what you're getting at here.

OK, I'll bite.  Here's my current best guess:

Computer speeds undergo a very fast exponential growth over the next few
decades, as the doubling time continues to decrease.  Non-sentient AI turns
out to be pretty easy once you have a fast enough machine, so automated
engineering devices can be built.  Limited forms of nanotech arrive pretty
soon, but Drexlerian wondertech takes another decade or so - we have to wait
for computers to get fast enough to design this stuff.

That gives us two major branches:

If non-sentient seed AIs are relatively easy to make, Eliezer's program (or
one like it) becomes an SI between 2010 and 2030.  In this case we'd better
make sure it grows up sane, because its going to decide all of our fates.

If not, we have a period of about a decade in which our entire technology
base improves with the speed the computer industry displays today.  Real
intelligence enhancement should become possible towards the end of this time
frame, using neural interface hardware and fancy software.  The conquest of
aging and disease should also fall into this period - neither problem is
hard enough to require full nanotech.

After that, the rate of change becomes too fast for unenhanced humans to
keep up with.  Advanced nanotech and uploading arrive within a few years of
each other, and megascale engineering projects (Jupiter brains, Dyson
spheres) become practical a year or two later.  By then there are lots of
Powers around, and I have no idea what they will be doing.

Hmm, the Y2K bug is clearly the self-inflicted punishment for not
listening to the word of Allah and not dating the calendar according
to the Hidrja (sp?). When the corrupt West falls for this reason, the
faithful will rule the world. 

(If I'm right I owe Allah an excuse :-)

No, it just explains why we aren't surrounded by billion-year-old elder
races.  If Earth's evolution is exactly average, and life is fairly common,
we would still expect there to be lots of other races that beat us out by a
few tens of thousands of years.  So, at least one of those assumptions must
be false.

Nature doesn't optimize for computing power, it optimizes for
survival. Instead of making much better neurons it makes more of
them. It certainly exploits a lot of odd properties, but we don't know
how odd yet. Ephaptic influences (where paralell axons induce
synchronization by electromagnetic induction) are right now at my
outer edge of weirdness in the CNS; I don't believe in it, but it
could be possible.

I would be surprised, since the noise levels in the brain are far too
high for microtubuli coherence and computation to make any real
difference.

Exactly. But the experiments leading up to uploading and uploading
itself will answer many of these questions. The final answer will of
course be when you upload yourself and a certain digital mind begins
to experience whatever it experiences.

I have the impression that you are not seriously proposing any upper
limit on intelligence, but anyway: the brain is definitely not small,
rather it is as large as it can be given our current biology. It
consumes a significant percentage of our energy; most likely it is
close to the maximum possible size given a hunter-gatherer diet (one
factor affecting its evolutionary growth may have been more food
availability). In addition we have all sorts of purely mechanical
problems with our large brains.

But large brains are not impossible, just look at the blue whale
(whose cerebellum, interestingly enough, appears to be human sized
while the rest of the brain is huge). Lots of neurons isn't the same
thing as intelligence.

My guess is that the Big Things the next 50 years will be
nanotechnology / biotechnology (both areas will likely merge rather
than remain distinct), the understanding of the brain and the
resulting neurotechnologies, and finally the Theory of
Complexity. No. 1 feels fairly straighforward, the other are a bit
more risky speculation.

Nanotech would simply emerge and cause a lot of revolutionizing
changes; it is too broad, too useful, too normal in some sense (making
and manipulating things isn't something utterly *new*). Expect
quarrels over the applications and fears once the nanosystems start to
become truly powerful, but in the end it is the same question as has
plagued the last two centuries: how to distribute the wealth and means
of production, and to what ends.

Neurotech is going to be the controversial thing. What does "human"
mean when you can alter it? Not just enhance memory or change sexual
preferences, but add *new* structures to the brain like the ability to
do something like episodic memory for muscle movements? Lots of issues
here, and biotech will contribute with problems. 

Complexity is the subtlest part. If my guess/feeling is right Kaufmann
and the others are right and there are "laws of complex systems". It
will be an invisible revolution, first in the sciences, then in
technology (such as the above areas) and slowly also in human
thinking. Remember that the Newtonian view took several centuries to
spread, and that most people still don't have digested evolution,
quantum mechanics and Godel. Complexity would likely be even more
profound.

A molecular simulation is probably utterly beyond us right now, we can
hardly simulate a single protein, let alone a cell. But I doubt that
is necessary, if single molecules mattered so much we would be wildly
unstable for the least disturbance. In an ordinary action potential
there are around 10^5 ions jumping around, that is likely the minimal
scale necessary (modulo certain highly significant molecules like PAF). 

A fair cell simulation today eats perhaps 10 MIPS, but it depends on
the level of detail. The scale is a few first order (somewhat stiff)
differential equations per isopotential compartment; a real neuron
would likely have many thousands of compartments but it is unclear how
important the exact solution is.

Exactly, although this is non-trivial and suggests the tricky
questions about whether conscious experience is changed if you
transform the computations into something equivalent (I would say no,
but then again I'm a functionalist).

Yes, and our higher level systems reach in into the low level systems
at a very early stage and interact with the "raw" data. In the lateral
geniculate nucleus, for example, the visual signal from the retina
gets mixed with signals from the higher visual cortices and *then*
moves to the primary visual cortex.

If I'm not mistaken, strict Islamic Law dictates a rather severe punishment
for someone who screws up the timing of the call to prayers from the
minaret, eh? How many automated minarets are gonna fail on January 1st
cause they are run by satanic running dog Yankee computers..... I see a
holy war coming...

As for our own Y2K, its obvious that the sinful managers who decided
against four digit year programming years ago in order to meet their
performance windows to get their stock options are being punished for their
pride and arrogance, while the pious programmers who originally warned of
this but were scorned and ignored are reaping the rewards..... $150.00+ an
hour anyone? I think Scott Adams had it right that Hell and the Accounting
department are pretty much synonymous.....from whence Satan sends his
demons, devils, and imps to tempt the stupid and despoil the righteous from
acheiving capitalistic nirvana on earth....

Hey, I'm pretty good at this fire and brimstone stuff....

Not necessarily.  You could have multiple, redundant, averaged-together
computations taking place that still require single-molecule-modelling
to simulate.  We lose individual neurons all the time, and no single
neuron is decisive; but I doubt you can simulate the brain without
simulating neurons.

Unless somebody can do a "quick kill" in AI, I expect us to head into a
major storm within the next 15 years.  Call it the Horizon Storm, or, if
you're being pessimistic, the Horizon Wars.

The next Big Thing, on the order of the computer, will be collaborative
filtering.  This will spark the transition to the next Speed Phase, a
doubling time of about two to five years, where things will probably
remain until Singularity or extinction.

Around the same time collaborative filtering starts to exert substantial
stresses on the social fabric, the Age of the Neurohackers will make its
debut.  The first major application will be (what I've named) Sunlight,
systems for taking off the evolved shackles on mental energy.  There
will be a major fuss about neurohacking, extending into religious riots.
 The majority of governments, including the U.S., will ban it.  The
neurohackers will oppose in the first major confrontation with the
government, using collaborative filtering to rally the populace.  I
don't know how this will turn out, but there is a substantial chance the
technical community will secede from the United States, or that major
scientific centers will be reduced by mobs, or both.  It might (or might
NOT) be a good idea to first provoke an artificial confrontation on
better ground.

Nanotechnology is a wild card that could stay unplayed or enter the game
at any time.  Nanotech's first applications will be entirely
destructive.  The researchers at Zyvex or Foresight will naively release
the information and someone will reduce the Earth to grey goo.  I don't
see a good way to bring in enough researchers to do anything interesting
without one of them trying to take over the world.  If nanotech has
useful applications, it will be more powerful than anyone has predicted
and in different ways, just like electricity and computers.  The instant
nanotech can create the computer hardware to run a seed AI, a
Singularity must be attempted immediately, before anything can go wrong.
 However, the existing seed AIs will not have enough sophistication to
Transcend, and the ones designed to run on unlimited power will need
months of debugging and twiddling, during which someone will reduce the
Earth to grey goo.

At present, I expect nanotechnology to be developed before genuine
intelligence enhancement via neurohacking can overcome the
infant-to-adult lead times needed to create true Specialists. 
Humanity's primary hope of survival lies in a quick kill via AI, and the
best way I see to do that is an Open Source effort on the scale of
Linux, which I intend to oversee at some point.  Some IE via
neurohacking may be developed fast enough to be decisive, and the
existing Specialists (such as myself) may be sufficient.

Nanotechnological destruction can best be prevented by strong security
precautions at Zyvex, researchers required to work in triples (pairs
isn't good enough), everyone required to submit to the best truth tests
available, and (unlikely) the actual nanotech equipment on the Moon next
to a nuclear weapon.

Major technologies:  Collaborative filtering; neurohacking; nanotech.
Our best hope:  A seed AI.
Most probable kill:  Grey goo; nuclear war provoked by a nanotech threat.
One way or the other, it should all be over by: 2025, 2005 min, 2040 max.

Lets run a simulation.
Keep in mind that all stars in our local area of the galactic arm that are
stable main sequence stars like ours are roughly of samilar age and size. Lets
say that there are 1000 other civilizations that have arisen within 10 million
years of each other in time in this area of the galaxy, which has some 20-50
million stars in it, is rougly 20 million light years in diameter. Also assume
that each time a group colonizes from one star to the next nearest habitable
star system (lets say one every 50 light years), traveling at sublight speeds,
taking an average of 53 years objective time each jump, but also 100 years to
terraform the new planet, and 200 years to build up enough industrial base to
support launching the next large colonizing jump. This gives us an expansion
rate of 0.14 c.  It takes a race that emerged 10 million years ago in the
center is still only 13% of the way from the center to the edge of the stellar
cluster.

Also assume a relative level of coexistence when spacefaring races meet and
intermingle. The densest center of the stellar cluster is the most likely point
where the earliest races would erupt and eventually contact and intermingle.
Their intermingling would slow things down a bit, and the edges of the stellar
cluster would be least likely to see early civilizations emerge. We must also
see that the gaps between galactic arms are really rather wide and are a
hindrance to expansion.

Now, what about civilizations which die off? its an interesting thing to think
about, but also think that the radio silence has a net positive evolutionary
benefit to the existing starfaring races - since pre-starfaring but radio
capable civilizations have no evidence of other races out there, they would be
less motivated to become starfaring than if there were a measurable level of
radio communications across the stars. This tends to dampen out the number of
spacefaring races emerging a bit, especially the reducing the number of more
agressive and violent races who would be more likely to self annihilate before
reaching stardrive capability.

Now, considering that we were emitting measurable radio signals for some 40
years before we actually decided to start listening with any amount of focus,
we gave starfarers a 40 year head start to set up jamming stations capable of
nulling out their own emissions in our local area, while not interfering with
the broadcasting elsewhere... Its really simply a matter of real estate. If I
were them thats what I would do if I were even here yet.

Nobody does pessimism like a countersphexist, hmm?  We could argue all day
about the potential for gray goo, but I can at least assure you that the
Foresight people don't take it lightly.  They've put a good bit of thought
into how to avoid it, and I expect they will continue to do so.

As far as the puny stuff goes, nukes won't end civilization.  This is a myth
perpetuated by people who haven't studies the numbers.  It would be feasible
to build enough high-yield weapons to do the job, but even at the height of
the cold war we never came close to doing it.  Today, the best we could do
would be to knock ourselves back to a pre-WWII industrial base for a couple
of decades.  The death toll would be huge, but we would still end up with a
Singularity.

Where do I sign up?  You've seen my own projection by now - I want to make
sure that if you get hit by a truck halfway through the project, the damn
thing still has a decent chance of being sane.

Who cares what "human" means? Why does that keep getting asked
(as a reason not to do it) when people start talking about
becoming transhuman? Too many Star Trek memes?

With all due respect to the people at Foresight, active shields are a
pipe dream.  I don't dispute that they might be able to defend against
malfunctioning assemblers, but military red goo will win every single
time.  The only halfway sane analysis I've seen is "Nanotechnology and
International Security", which lists many of the major destabilizing
factors.  Nanotech is far more destructive than nuclear weapons, can be
developed with less of a visible lead time, has better first-strike
capability, and larger benefits for use.  MAD won't work.  Threatened
nuclear powers may decide to strike first.  So the world will blow up. 
This is the logical consequence.

That's reassuring, but the question is whether we would stand a better
chance of survival the second time around.  My guess is that the
resource base for nanotech would pop back up faster than the Internet,
and that major technophobia would strike at nondestructive IE more than
destructive nanotech.  Stupid, but so what?

I should like to ask everyone, regardless of their personal evaluation
of the effect of a nuclear war, and regardless of their personal
preference with respect to the Singularity, not to deliberately start a
nuclear war.

You sign up a few years from now, actually.  I'm still trying to build
the resource base.  I'm not going to ask for time, even though I'm only
19, because Zyvex won't wait; but I still think that a brief detour may
be my fastest route to the target.

Sanity is mostly a matter of not doing stupid things than specific
precautions, and most of the major precautions I believe I put down in
_Coding_.  If I get hit by a truck, you can probably build a _sane_ seed
just by referring to the Page.

I tried #transhumanism and there was no one there, so I must be on EFNet.

Greg Egan's discusses that in _Distress_.

Aside from that, I shall mention an old Yiddish saying:  The God of the
triangles has three sides.  "Insofar as _I_ am a human, it is obvious
that being a human is the highest state to which any being might aspire,
and any change from that exalted condition can only be an unholy threat
to all that is good."  It's human nature screwing them up, in other words.

Thus it's built into the language.  Use "human" to refer to the few good
qualities of the human race, and "inhuman" will mean emotionless,
merciless, sadistic.  As opposed to altruistic, intelligent, powerful,
self-aware, energetic, perceptive, self-controlled - some of the correct
connotations of "transhuman" or "posthuman".

Furthermore, the only things available for contrast are monkeys and
other creatures of lesser intelligence.  So the extensional definition
starts with beings who eat the babies of their enemies.

The best reply is probably:  "There is good in human nature, but there
is evil as well.  Transhuman is human plus, not human minus."

it is almost too sad to contemplate, but the grey goo scenario explains
as well as anything i have ever heard the baffling observation that the cosmos
are not buzzing with communications.  the theory would be that whenever
any civilization discovers radio communication, that nuclear holocaust or
nanotech grey goo always result within 100 to 1000 years.  {8-[

depends on the speed of the can.

when the start 2 agreement was signed, we were left with a number of reentry
bodies with no nukes to carry.  (thank you george bush).  i was on a team
that was tasked to think of alternate applications for these stunningly
expensive devices.  we thought of making them into "kinetic kill vehicles"
or very sophisticated very fast moving cannonballs.  the notion was to
use them to destroy underground bunkers.

turns out, at very high velocities (higher than about 5 km per second) a
curious phenomenon occurs known as the hydrodynamic impact regime.
above this velocity, the energy released on impact is much larger than
the heat of vaporization of the target, and so it doesnt even matter what
the target is made of, only the speed of sound in that target.  as i
understand
it, at the instant of impact, the projectile vaporizes at the speed of sound
in
that projectile, while the target vaporizes at the speed of sound in the
target.
so, above a certain velocity, you dont continue to punch a *deeper* hole,
but only a *wider* hole.  which explains why the craters on the moon
are wide shallow things, some big, some small, but none really deep.

so it turns out, even if you can get one accurate enough, a kinetic kill
vehicle is not so great for detroying deeply buried targets,  unless you
can get them to follow one after another into the same crater.

a spinoff technology was a project we called spears from space.  we derived
some, uh... well, spears, made of tungsten.  we had great fun with tungsten
because it is so dense.  nothing in one's ordinary experience is like tunsten.

imore than twice as dense as lead, way denser than gold, yet looks like any
gray
metal.  if you have a block of it the size of a brick, it takes a real effort
to
hoist the item, and even then it is not advisable for if one were to drop it
upon
ones lower extremities one would surely damage oneself severely.  {8-[

the idea was to drop one spear after another into the crater made by
previous impacts, thereby discouraging those who would seek refuge
in deeply buried bunkers.  the system was never deployed.  {8^D  spike

Stanislaw Lem --  in the 'World as Cataclysm' (One Human Minute, 1986) --
argues  that the early solar system spent time in a galactic arm where
stellar explosions were common (and which he argues were a necessary
precursor to life), but then shortly thereafter left for the quieter spaces
between arms. By being in the relatively empty spaces ensured that life was
not too quickly snuffed out by nearby supernovae (which would have occurred
if we were near the center or stuck within a spiral arm).

Anyone want to voice an opinion on how this argument has stood the test of
time? I find its most interesting feature that it contradicts the
underlying belief that we are on a very average star in a very average
point in the galaxy. On the contrary if Lem is right its only in particular
places (approx. 34k light years from the center - where stars pass through
the arms on a regular, but not too fast pace) that life-bearing star
systems can emerge.

If we follow the principle of reductionism to its logical end then we are
not properly classified as "humans" but instead "conscious intelligent
minds".  Our classification as homo sapiens is due to the organic prosthesis
the forces of evolution have developed over time.  The success of uploading
or instantiation would be the ultimate proof of this viewpoint.  If we are
able to preserve our identity without any of the past organic trappings
developed by the forces of evolution then we will confirm this approach.

However, I do not believe "human" is used in the term "transhumanism" in the
exact biological sense.  The term "human" has developed a considerable
amount of alternate meanings in general vernacular, i.e. the idea that to be
"human" means to be conscious or possessing a certain degree of intelligence
or a subscribing to a certain set of ethical or moral standards.  In that
sense, I believe, transhumanism finds its meaning as a vehicle to explore
being "human" without being confined by the prosthesis I mentioned earlier.

Would they necessarily bother?

Might they not instead decide to concentrate their energies on making their
home planet more habitable and increasing their local quality of life rather
than heading out into the rest of the galaxy?

Lots of people care about it.  Lots of people are very attached to being
human.  'Normal' people (unlike us educated types) use words like 'natural'
and 'unnatural' and 'good' and 'evil' and 'wierd' and 'inhuman'.

Why do you think there was the problem over cloning?

If you don't think about the opinions of the majority and try to massage
them into the opinions you want them to have, you can get in very big
trouble.

I have heard it suggested that if you had vastly improved technology, you'd
still want to introduce it to the public slowly, so as not to get shut down.

I take it you know the metaphor of the boiling frog?

While I would normally shirk from a philosophical discussion in this sort of
forum - could you please define 'good' and 'evil' in absolute terms?  I'm
curious as to wat you mean by them.

Title
  Prospective study of
  coronary heart disease
  incidence in relation to fasting total homocysteine, related genetic

  study [see comments].

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy), low B-vitamin intake,
  and genetic polymorphisms related to tHcy metabolism may play roles in
  coronary heart disease
  (CHD). More prospective studies are needed. METHODS AND
  RESULTS: We used a prospective case-cohort design to
  determine whether tHcy-related factors are associated with incidence of CHD
  over an average of 3.3 years of follow-up in a biracial sample of middle-aged
  men and women. Age-, race-, and field center-adjusted CHD incidence was
  associated positively (P<0.05) with tHcy in women but not men, and CHD was
  associated negatively (P<0.05) with plasma folate (women only), plasma
  pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (both sexes), and vitamin supplementation (women
  only). However, after accounting for other risk factors, only plasma
  pyridoxal 5'-phosphate was associated with CHD incidence; the relative risk
  for the highest versus lowest quintile of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate was 0.28
  (95% CI=0.1 to 0.7). There was no association of CHD with the C677T mutation
  of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene or with 3 mutations of the
  cystathionine beta-synthase gene. CONCLUSIONS: Our
  prospective findings add uncertainty to conclusions derived
  mostly from cross-sectional studies that tHcy is a major, independent,
  causative risk factor for CHD. Our findings point more strongly to the
  possibility that vitamin B6 offers independent protection. Randomized trials,
  some of which are under way, are needed to better clarify the
  interrelationships of tHcy, B vitamins, and cardiovascular
  disease.

Title
  Potassium bicarbonate reduces urinary
  nitrogen excretion in postmenopausal women.
Source
  Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.  82(1):254-9, 1997 Jan.
Abstract
  Previously we demonstrated that low grade chronic metabolic acidosis exists
  normally in humans eating ordinary diets that yield normal net rates of
  endogenous acid production (EAP), and that the degree of acidosis increases
  with age. We hypothesize that such diet-dependent and age-amplifying low
  grade metabolic acidosis contributes to the decline in skeletal muscle mass
  that occurs normally with aging. This hypothesis is based on the reported
  finding that chronic metabolic acidosis induces muscle protein breakdown, and
  that correction of acidosis reverses the effect. Accordingly, in 14 healthy
  postmenopausal women residing in a General Clinical Research Center and
  eating a constant diet yielding a normal EAP rate, we tested whether
  correcting their "physiological" acidosis with orally administered
  potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3; 60-120
  mmol/day for 18 days) reduces their urinary nitrogen loss. KHCO3 reduced EAP
  to nearly zero, significantly reduced the blood hydrogen ion concentration (P
  < 0.001), and increased the plasma bicarbonate concentration
  (P < 0.001), indicating that pre-KHCO3, diet-dependent EAP was significantly
  perturbing systemic acid-base equilibrium, causing a low grade metabolic
  acidosis. Urinary ammonia nitrogen, urea nitrogen, and total nitrogen levels
  significantly decreased. The cumulative reduction in nitrogen excretion was
  14.1 +/- 12.3 g (P < 0.001). Renal creatinine clearance and urine volume
  remained unchanged. We conclude that in postmenopausal women, neutralization
  of diet-induced EAP with KHCO3 corrects their preexisting diet-dependent low
  grade metabolic acidosis and significantly reduces their urinary nitrogen
  wasting. The magnitude of the KHCO3-induced nitrogen-sparing effect is
  potentially sufficient to both prevent continuing age-related loss of muscle
  mass and restore previously accrued deficits.

Abstract
  BACKGROUND. In normal subjects, a low level of metabolic acidosis and
  positive acid balance (the production of more acid than is excreted) are
  typically present and correlate in degree with the amount of endogenous acid
  produced by the metabolism of foods in ordinary diets abundant in protein.
  Over a lifetime, the counteraction of retained endogenous acid by base
  mobilized from the skeleton may contribute to the decrease in bone mass that
  occurs normally with aging. METHODS. To test that possibility, we
  administered potassium bicarbonate to 18
  postmenopausal women who were given a constant diet (652 mg [16 mmol] of
  calcium and 96 g of protein per 60 kg of body weight). The
  potassium bicarbonate was given orally for
  18 days in doses (60 to 120 mmol per day) that nearly completely neutralized
  the endogenous acid. RESULTS. During the administration of
  potassium bicarbonate, the calcium and
  phosphorus balance became less negative or more positive--that is, less was
  excreted in comparison with the amount ingested (mean [+/- SD] change in
  calcium balance, +56 +/- 76 mg [1.4 +/- 1.9 mmol] per day per 60 kg; P =
  0.009; change in phosphorus balance, +47 +/- 64 mg [1.5 +/- 2.1 mmol] per day
  per 60 kg; P = 0.007) because of reductions in urinary calcium and phosphorus
  excretion. The changes in calcium and phosphorus balance were positively
  correlated (P < 0.001). Serum osteocalcin concentrations increased from 5.5
  +/- 2.8 to 6.1 +/- 2.8 ng per milliliter (P < 0.001), and urinary
  hydroxyproline excretion decreased from 28.9 +/- 12.3 to 26.7 +/- 10.8 mg per
  day (220 +/- 94 to 204 +/- 82 mumol per day; P = 0.05). Net renal acid
  excretion decreased from 70.9 +/- 10.1 to 12.8 +/- 21.8 mmol per day,
  indicating nearly complete neutralization of endogenous acid. CONCLUSIONS. In
  postmenopausal women, the oral administration of potassium
  bicarbonate at a dose sufficient to neutralize endogenous
  acid improves calcium and phosphorus balance, reduces bone resorption, and
  increases the rate of bone formation.

Title
  Potassium preserves endothelial function and enhances aortic
  compliance in Dahl rats.
Source
  Hypertension.  22(3):315-22, 1993 Sep.
Abstract
  It has recently been proposed that in rat models of genetic hypertension,
  supplemental dietary potassium preserves release of
  endothelium-derived relaxing factor independently of its capacity to either
  attenuate hypertension or increase plasma potassium. To test
  this hypothesis in Dahl salt-sensitive rats given sodium chloride (4%) for 3
  weeks, we supplemented dietary potassium (2.1%) with either
  KCl (n = 16) or KHCO3 (n = 16). Compared with unsupplemented rats (n = 16),
  rats supplemented with either potassium salt had a lower
  mean arterial pressure and a greater release of endothelium-derived relaxing
  factor, as assessed from acetylcholine-induced relaxation of precontracted
  aortic rings. However, the maximum relaxation response to acetylcholine
  correlated inversely with blood pressure (r = -.82, P < .001), not only in
  the KCl (r = -.68, P < .002) and KHCO3 (r = -.77, P < .001) groups but also
  in unsupplemented rats (r = -.86, P < .001). With potassium
  supplementation, plasma potassium concentrations measured
  between 4 and 6 PM did not increase, but those measured between 4 and 6 AM
  did increase (P < .05). In isolated ring segments, aortic compliance was
  greater in both the KCl and KHCO3 groups than in unsupplemented rats (0.015
  and 0.017 vs 0.009 mm2/mm Hg) (P < .01). This greater compliance could not be
  related to differences in blood pressure, plasma potassium,
  or collagen or elastin content of the aortic wall.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

Title
  Increased plasma bicarbonate and growth hormone after an oral
  glutamine load.
Source
  American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.  61(5):1058-61, 1995 May.
Abstract
  An oral glutamine load was administered to nine healthy
  subjects to determine the effect on plasma glutamine,
  bicarbonate, and circulating growth hormone concentrations. Two grams
  glutamine were dissolved in a cola drink and ingested over a
  20-min period 45 min after a light breakfast. Forearm venous blood samples
  were obtained at zero time and at 30-min intervals for 90 min and compared
  with time controls obtained 1 wk earlier. Eight of nine subjects responded to
  the oral glutamine load with an increase in plasma
  glutamine at 30 and 60 min before returning to the control
  value at 90 min. Ninety minutes after the glutamine
  administration load both plasma bicarbonate concentration and circulating
  plasma growth hormone concentration were elevated. These findings demonstrate
  that a surprisingly small oral glutamine load is capable of
  elevating alkaline reserves as well as plasma growth hormone.

As far as I know the sun passes through the spiral arms in its orbit,
so there should be a few passages every galactic year (250 million
years, if I'm not misremembering). So Lem's idea haven't held up well,
although he might still argue that it is likelier for intelligence to
evolve on stars in quieter areas sinply because of a lower risk of
mass extinctions (but on the other hand, they tend to cause
evolutionary radiations).

DOH! Such an obvious technology that I forgot about it myself. Note
that we don't need super-AI to have information technology transform
the world utterly. Just imagine the effect of global communications
with huge bandwidths coupled with wearables / ubiquitious computing
and net-based information, knowledge and skill services. If you then
assume we actually make information and knowledge management useful,
things will become rather extreme.

Why "it"? Wouldn't it be "they" - I hardly expect the first SI to
emerge in a single basement lab in Xiang or so, rather there will be
AIs turning into SIs around the world at research institutions,
corporate and government projects, distributed efforts on the net
("fear the cow and penguin"? :-) and in other places. The idea of a
singular godlike SI among ants is unlikely unless the advancement
curve becomes extremely steep beyond a certain point (which also
implies that a second, third and so on SI aren't that hard to
make...); more likely we will be seeing a normal distribution whose
upper tail grows without a bound.

Wearables and information services will be starting this process
within a decade, I'm fairly sure. Add agile manufacturing, and you can
get nanotech-like surprises in production even before nanotech
(imagine if the effects of microfactories spreading and cutting out
the middleman between sales and raw materials, as well as
transportation: micro outlet stores in every mall).

They'll be writing books like "Singularity for dummies", "I'm >H,

I have not heard that our sun is such a wanderer. I was under the impression that
most of the stars in this local area are rather homogenous and communal.

We'll see about that. I'm working on an analysis of active shields
with Henrik hrstrm, and the outcome seems to be much trickier than
our previous debate on the list suggested. Effective red goo and
effective immune systems are both rather nontrivial, it turns
out. I'll get back with more in while.

Ah.  I thought you meant accidental grey goo.  Military action is indeed
another matter, and analysis on the subject tends to be pretty naive.

<putting on military theorist hat>

I see two very different scenarios, depending on how fast the takeoff turns
out to be:

If we solve the automated engineering problem well in advance of the
creation of the first assembler, then whoever first turns nanotech to
military use instantly becomes the world's dominant military power.  They
will probably have a few weeks of lead time, and that's long enough to
achieve such overwhelming dominance that the second nanotech power would be
hopelessly outmatched.  Unfortunately, given the memes currently dominant in
the scientific community, it is unlikely that they will act so decisively.
The likely result is a very short arms race followed by a nanotech war -
probably the only survivors would be some military personal and leaders on
the 'winning' side.  Of course, they would have the tools to reconstruct
civilization..

If primitive nanotech and automated engineering emerge at the same time,
we're in much better shape.  There will be time for the political structure
to adjust to the new rules, which lowers the probability of stupid panic
reactions.  There is a good chance of avoiding nano-war on this track,
because the nations most likely to get there first aren't interested in
either suicide or world conquest.

I say 'it', because I expect human-equivalent hardware to arrive several
years before human-equivalent AI.  That means the first self-enhancing AI
that doesn't bottleneck will have the hardware to go from transhuman to SI
in a matter of days, at most.  At that point humans are far to slow to
interfere with it - it can invent general-purpose assemblers, use someone's
automated lab equipment to build one, and migrate itself to rapid
infrastructure in a matter of hours.  A few hours after that we've got a
full-grown Power on our hands.

Don't forget the biotech revolution.  Exponential advance gives us a
revolution in pharmacology in the coming decade, and cyberpunk-style body
modification in the decade after that.  The economic effect is not as
pronounced, but the social effects would be huge.

OK, this is the standard SI apotheosis scenario. But note that it is
based on a lot of unsaid assumptions: that it is just hardware
resources that distinguish a human level AI from an SI (i.e, the
software development is fairly trivial for the AI and can be done very
fast, and adding more processor power will make the AI *smarter*),
that this process has a time constant shorter than days (why just this
figure? why not milliseconds or centuries?), that there will be no
systems able to interfere with it - note that one of your original
assumptions was the existence of human-level AI; if AI can get faster
(not even smarter) by adding more processor power, "tame" AI could
keep the growing AI under control - that this SI is able to invent
anything it needs to (where does it get the skills?) and will have
easy access to somebody's automated lab equipment (how many labs have
their equipment online, accessible through the Net? why are you
assuming the AI is able to hack any system, especially given the
presence of other AI?). And finally, we have the assumption that the
SI will be able to outwit any human in all respects - which is based
on the idea that intelligence is completely general and the same kind
of mind that can design a better AI can fool a human into (say)
connecting an experimental computer to the net or disable other
security features.

As you can tell, I don't quite buy this scenario. To me, it sounds
more like a Hollywood meme.

The biotech effects will be slowed by a very thick systems of
regulations and controls (not all bad, mind you): just because your
sub-AIs invent anti-Alzheimer and anti-cancer drugs each minute
doesn't mean your pharmaceutical corporation can sell them
immediately, they have to go through a few years (more likely a
decade) of testing before approval. It might be easier with body
modification, actually.

Why do people assume that an AI will arrive fully formed and ready to take
on the world.  Looking at the human mind, it takes us years, if not decades,
to understand the world around us and become adept at manipulating it in
complex ways.

The first AI may well be highly intelligent and a quick learner, but it will
also almost certianly have to be spoon fed knowledge in its earliest stages
and should be spottable as it 'grows up' .  The chances of an AI
spontanteouslycoming into being fully formed seems pretty low, as does the
chances of an AI coming into being at a low level and increasing it's
intelligence without tipping off the people around it (imagine managing to
grow up from a baby to teenager whilst fooling the people around you into
thinking that you only had baby-level intelligence - Especially if you
didn't know that you had to make them think this.

He seems to be assuming that once you have any nanotech, you have ultimate
nanotech, rather than starting with the ability to create small basic
designs and working up from there.  I suspect that nanotechnology (at least
to start off with) will consist of delicate, specific devices and that
general purpouse robust models will take quite a while too evolve after
that.

I see that A Deepness in the Sky, Vernor Vinge's prequel to A Fire
Upon the Deep is coming out in February from TOR books.  From Amazon:
"Readers will marvel at Vernor Vinge's science fiction creation about
Qeng Ho who awaits planet Arachna's awakening into a Golden Age of
technology while other traders lurk nearby."

I didn't think I'd like this Qeng Ho angle.  A primitive culture, trapped
in the Slow Zone?  What I forgot is that this was the perspective of the
Beyond.  From our POV the Qeng Ho is a super-advanced civilization, with
technology comparable to the advanced travellers in Marooned in Realtime.

The prologue is online at http://www.tor.com/sampleDeepness.html.  It's good.

Regarding future scenarios:

Many hotly-anticipated technologies take much longer to occur than
expected.  Nuclear fusion, AI, and space colonization have all been
twenty years away since the 1950s.

What has happened instead is that an unanticipated technology, the
Internet, has arisen and transformed the world.

I suspect that the same thing will continue to happen.  Nanotech will
keep running into problems which will keep it 20 years away.  (Current
consensus from the FX game is early 2020's.)  AI will also stay at
the horizon.

With biotech I am more optimistic, because that seems to be making
accelerating progress, similar to computers in the 1970s.  Maybe this will
be the field with an unexpected breakthrough, like suddenly discovering
how to prevent aging.  Immortality in a pill by, say, 2015, would be
revolutionary.

First, let me state that I don't think this is the most likely scenario.
Automated engineering is not progressing very quickly, so it is quite likely
that we will get the first assembler before we can really do much with it.
However, the situation could easily reverse in the next few years.

If it does, then we will have a substantial library of nanotech-related
designs before the first assembler can be build.  We will probably also be
able to build conventional hardware using nanotech-based fabricators without
a lot of expensive re-work.  Finally, I would expect battlefield robotics to
be significantly easier to program than general-purpose assemblers, so the
supply of human military personnel is not a hard constraint.

Given those assumptions, the first general-purpose assembler would have a
sudden, dramatic impact.  Spend your first few days building fabrication
systems, then start diverting resources to producing supercomputers and
conventional military hardware.  The computers can run engineering AIs to
accelerate your tech advance, while the military hardware guards your
borders.

Given Drexler's estimates of nanotech construction rates, you can build
enough hardware to eclipse pre-existing conventional resources in a matter
of a few weeks.  At that point anyone else who builds an assembler is on the
same curve, but well behind you.  Unless they have some overwhelming
advantage in design ability (i.e. better AI), they will be unable to catch
up.

Because they don't share our bandwidth limitations.  Pre-human AI will
probably require laborious spoon-feeding of knowledge, but that is standard
for current-day AI projects.  Nobody is going to recognize it as
human-equivalent until it is smart enough to learn by reading a book.

At that point the advantages of computers over organic systems come into
play.  It should be able to learn as fast as it can process data - and if it
can deal with real-world events the way we can, that makes it orders of
magnitude faster than a human.

That's not what Billy Brown is assuming.  He's assuming software
development is _harder_ than hardware development, so that by the time
we have a working seed AI the available processing power is considerably
larger than human-equivalent.  I happen to agree with this, by the way.

> fast, and adding more processor power will make the AI *smarter*),

I'll speak for this one.  If we could figure out how to add neurons to
the human brain and integrate them, people would get smarter.  (I deduce
this from the existence of Specialists; adding cognitive resources does
produce an improvement.)  Similarly, I expect that substantial amounts
of the AI will be working on sufficiently guided search trees that
additional processing power can produce results of substantially higher
quality, without requiring exponential amounts of power.  Anyway, I
think we did this during the Singularity debate.

Actually, I think milliseconds.  I just say "hours or days" because
otherwise my argument gets tagged as hyperbole by anyone who lives on
the human timescale.

Centuries is equally plausible.  It's called a "bottleneck".

1)  This is an Asimov Law.  That trick never works.
2)  I bet your tame AI has to be smarter than whatever it's keeping
under control.  Halting problem...

If you dropped back a hundred thousand years, how long would it take you
to out-invent hunters who had been using spears all their life?  Skill
is a poor substitute for smartness.

And if it's stumped, it can get the answers off the Internet, just like
I do.

There's some lab with a Scanning Tunneling Probe that's made
"selectively" available to students on the Internet.  I thought that was
hysterical when I read it.  All along, I'd been assuming the fast
infrastructure would start with hacking automated DNA sequencers and
protein synthesis machines.  But this way is probably faster.

If the intelligence is roughly human-equivalent, then there will be
specialties at which it excels and gaping blind spots.  If the
intelligence is far transhuman, it will still have specialties and blind
spots, but not that we can perceive.  So yes, I make that assumption: 
An SI will be able to outwit any human in all respects.  I'll go
farther:  An SI will correctly view humans as manipulable, deterministic
processes rather than opponents.

> As you can tell, I don't quite buy this scenario. To me, it sounds

Not really.  Hollywood is assuming that conflicts occur on a humanly
understandable level - not to mention that the hero always wins. 
Remember the Luring Lottery, when Hofstadter received a large collection
of Vast numbers, all using different specification schemes?  Determining
which was largest would be a serious mathematical problem, but I feel
quite confident in announcing that one of the numbers was far larger
than all the competitors raised to the power of each other.

The forces involved in a Singularity are Vast.  I don't know how the
forces will work out, but I do predict that the result will be extreme
(from our perspective), and not much influenced by our actions or by
initial conditions.  There won't be the kind of balance we evolved in. 
Too much positive feedback, not enough negative feedback.

Likewise, the first SI timescale that isn't too slow to notice will be
too fast to notice.

Yes, it does.  I didn't buy it myself at first - but the assumptions that
lead to that conclusion are the same ones that make a Singularity possible.
Taking the objections one at a time:

Actually, I assume there is a significant software problem that must be
solved as well.  That's what makes it all so fast - the first group that
figures out how to make an AI sentient enough to do computer programming
will be running their experiment on very fast hardware.

> that this process has a time constant shorter than days (why just this

The time constant for self-enhancement is a function of intelligence.
Smarter AIs will improve faster than dumb ones, and the time scale of human
activity is much harder to change than that of a software entity.  In
addition, an AI can have a very fast subjective time rate if it is running
on fast hardware.  Thus, the first smart AI will be able to implement major
changes in days, rather than months.  I would expect the time scale to
shrink rapidly after that.

No, my assumption is that the first human-level AI will become an SI before
the second one comes online.

> that this SI is able to invent

I presume it will already have a large database on programming, AI, and
common-sense information.  It will probably also have a net connection - I
would expect a program that has access to the WWW to learn faster than one
that doesn't, after all.  By the 2010 - 2030 time frame that will be enough
to get you just about any information you might want.

> and will have

Again, by this time frame I would expect most labs to be automated, and
their net connections will frequently be on the same network as their
robotics control software.  You don't need to be able to hack everyone, you
just need for someone to be stupid.

Besides, the AI could expand several thousand fold just by cracking
unsecured systems and stealing their unused CPU time.  That speeds up its
self-enhancement by a similar factor, which takes us down to a few minutes
for a major redesign.  I expect a few hours of progress at that rate would
result in an entity capable of inventing all sorts of novel attacks that our
systems aren't designed to resist.

I don't think intelligence is entirely general - my own cognitive abilities
are too lopsided to permit me that illusion.  A merely transhuman AI, with
an effective IQ of a few hundred, might not be any better at some tasks than
your average h    .

An SI is a different matter.  With an effective IQ at least thousands of
times beyond human average, it should be able to invent any human cognitive
skill with relative ease.  Even its weakest abilities would rapidly surpass
anything in human experience.

Okay, here's a diagram:

BIG BANG! ------------------------------------------> Infinity
             ^
             |
        We are here

See that vast infinite space to the right, as cool and unyielding to life as
it may be there is a far better chance that life (that's us!) would be over
there. Thus, finding life so close to the Big Bang is unlikely. However, two
problems. Problem number one, as with the doomsday scenarios there's the
question of identity (sorry) and all that "is a rock an observer" crap will
persist. Problem number two, it seems to me that life would be unlikely
anywhere along this line. I have a feeling there's a problem in my line of
reasoning but my brains refusing to look for it, anyone?

Btw, Amir D. Aczel shows why we may be among the most advanced civilisations
in the universe using the 'inspection paradox' in his new book _Probability
1_. Basically you're more likely to be in one of the long-lived races (and
thus extraordinarily lucky) than a short lived one. (Could this also be a
counter to the doomsday scenario?)

The question still remains as to how others will know it's me, and so on. I
have a feeling no one here really wants to dredge up identity issues again,
so I'll leave it alone.

Friends and family might argue that I've never proposed anything serious in
my life, but I'm in two minds about this. There's a beautiful coherent and
hopefully quite brilliant concept in the making but I can't get my brain
around it at the moment. Later in your post you mention a Theory of
Complexity, that's where I'm going with this, only I'm shying away from
using the term 'complexity' because I'm worried I might abuse it.

Let's say there is a parameter of the universe called 'complexity' and it
defines how easy it is to make a complex structure of any kind. Now if this
parameter is set to low (complex structures are unlikely) life would not
have evolved. If this parameter is set too high (complex structures are
highly likely) and complex structures formed very easily then the
generalisations (systems like DNA, protein, intelligence, etc) that we call
'life' would not have evolved. For instance, if complexity is easy then a
new solution can be found to every new problem and the 'building blocks' of
(what we call) life do not get produced. Now - and this is where it gets
really sketchy - I'm imagine something similar for 'intelligence' but I have
absolutely no idea how to explain it at the moment. Fundamentally I don't
think it's wrong to suggest that there might be an upper limit to
intelligence, the way I imagine it is a graph with 'generalisation' and
'specialisation' plotted against each other and diagonal line travelling
between them.


    Generalisation
          |\
          |  \
          |    o We are close to here
          |      \
          |        \
          ------------ Specialisation


And this all corresponds to the limited complexity of the system.

logic on my part.]

"The protosolar gas cloud, moving along an orbit at an angle of seven or
eight degrees to the plane of the galaxy, entered the arm for the first
time about 4.9 billion years ago. For 300 million years the cloud underwent
the stromy conditions of passage through the entire width of the arm; since
it left the arm, it has been traveling through calm space. The trip has
lasted much longer thant he passage through the arm, because the
corotational circle, along which the sun moves, intersects the spiral arms
at a sharp angle, making the arc of the solar orbit between the arms longer
than the arc within the arm.".

It seems that large scale meteor strikes are all we need to occassionally
shake things up (if evolution hasn't created space-farers in this
evolutinary cycle lets crash-and-burn and start again!).

I said:

"Since we're talking about plausible future scenarios it might be fun, being
in the midst of millennium fever, to come up with some. No dates or
predictions, just how you think the next few major technologies will
pan-out."

And only in a perfect world would it be polite to ask others to do this
without doing myself:

Several months ago I tried to explain my views on Artificial Intelligence
without much success, but I shall persist: We all agree that alien
intelligence would be very different to human intelligence, but tend to
liken artificial intelligence to our own. Firstly, it's important to
remember that AI will not evolve on the Savannah and will never swing
through trees. Secondly, the evolution of AI will be unique in the sense
that it is directed evolution. If man could play a part in the evolution of
an intelligent species it would evolve slaves. We have directed the
evolution of many animals to our own needs with great success. Despite many
"out of control" scenarios depicted in science fiction AI offers an
unprecedented level of control, and some might argue (wrongly) an
unprecedented ability to screw up. The eventual shape of AI can be found by
weighing human need against our template for intelligence, the human brain.
Thus AI will be shaped more by human users interaction needs than any
science fiction pipe dreams; and I find invisible 'go-between' interfaces
more likely than 'in-your-face' conversational interfaces.

Is human-level AI achievable? I don't care. The majority of AI will evolve
in an environment alien to even our physical laws. The majority of AI will
not know who we are, what we do, and why we do it. An AI's dedication to
doing it's job will not be like our enjoyment of an occupation or even a
moths attraction to a flame - people can get bored and moths can evolve. AI'
s will be dedicated in the same way that we have an unquestioned dedication
to our existence in the universe. I cannot guarantee that bad AI will not be
made but that is very different from an AI "going out of control" - an event
that has such a small chance of happening as to have no chance at all. In
the laboratory simulations of human-like intelligence will be routine and no
doubt much effort will be put into improving them, I have outlined reasons
for doubting this ability in other posts. If universal super-intelligence is
achieved in the laboratory then it will replace us, but it will not 'emerge'
from our domestic appliances. Whether it replaces us or not will be a
largely social and political decision. If I'm wrong and 'in-your-face'
conversational (or social) interfaces are preferred then people may well be
ready to embrace their 'mind children' but I doubt it.

Information technology will evolve to a point where we can discover the DNA
of knowledge. Storing knowledge by deviation and linking bite size
conceptual chunks of it by mutation will not only create a network of
unprecedented power but will allow us to automate knowledge acquisition. And
who needs intelligence when knowledge discovers itself? First we will have
interfaces that display our knowledge symbolically and allow us to mutate it
through many dimensions (these may be too many for practicality) and see new
pieces of knowledge and their place amongst current accepted knowledge. Some
time after this it will not be two much of a stretch to automate the
production of knowledge about knowledge (and analogies between analogies)
that can find quicker ways to create more knowledge. Thus intelligence will
be superseded by self-replicating knowledge and the fate of sentient life
will become a question of philosophy. This small paragraph covers a lot, and
I in no way want to suggest (heaven forbid) a Singularity - I imagine this
happening over centuries, if not millennia. But I do see semantic network
and hypertext having large and far reaching social effects in the meantime,
and social change is far less conservative a prediction than technological
change.

Nanotechnology:  Thwarted by complexity issues; gets here eventually.
Neurotechnology: Will make us closer to our computers (and this will make
                 human-like AI even less likely).

A quibble.  If the first successful seed AI gets a x100 speed boost from
fast hardware, and its programming is another two orders of magnitude faster
than human due to the AI advantage, it still needs almost an hour to do a 1
man-year programming job.  Since major architectural changes are likely to
run to several man-years of effort at that point, the next few iterations of
the enhancement cycle should still be slow enough to watch.

Depending on how hard the software problem turns out to be, its actual speed
boost could plausibly be anything from x10^-3 to x10^9 or so.  Of course, my
bet is on a late takeoff with very fast hardware, which gives exactly the
result you predict.

As I recall, the current explanation for the spiral arm structures is a
standing wave phenomenon. Any individual star moves in and out of the
arms as it orbits the galactic center, but gravitic interactions cause each star
to linger a bit in the denser arm areas and hurry a bit in the less dense parts.

But if that's true, wouldn't all that gray goo--indestructable and
ravenous by definition--have long ago spread from its origins to
devour most of our observable universe into clouds of elements and
goo?  You can't have it both ways: if life is common but always
destroys itself with gray goo, then we must explain the apparent
absence of the latter rather than using it to explain the absence
of the former.

I don't see any reason why the first goo powerful enough to destroy our
race and/or all multicellular life would necessarily have the capability
to survive in vacuum, resist cosmic radiation, operate on solar power,
and build spaceships with reentry capability.  Anything that
well-designed isn't an indiscriminate killer.  It isn't "indestructable
and ravenous by definition"; it just needs to be indestructable and
ravenous enough to kill us off.  There was a time when wolves came close
to being that indestructable and ravenous.

That having been said, I doubt spike's Gray Filter scenario.  I can see
many races, even the majority, destroying themselves that way.  But zero
survivors?  Not even one in a thousand?  I don't believe it.  Not even
the Singularity has that kind of kill ratio - hence my guess that
Singularities also suck up any other visible races.

*------------cut here/end--------------------------------------------*



CATALOGUE VERSION CHOICES:

1.  This version can be read by everyone, no matter what type of
     computer you use, or what type of software you use.  It is a simple
     format, with just our entire catalogue pasted into the body of a
     single email message, 316K in size.  If you use pine or elm on a unix
     system or an advanced software version such as Eudora Pro 3.0 or
     later, you will most likely receive it as a single email message.
     However, if your software limits incoming email messages to a
     certain size, say 32K or so, then your software will split it into
     multiple email message parts.   Whether you receive it as a single
     email message or multiple part email messages, you can easily
     paste it into one whole text document with your word processor, in
     about 10 minutes or so.
2.  For more advanced computer users:  attached plain ascii text file
     ~316K - you must know how to download an attached text file and
     then be able to locate it on your hard drive or system home
     directory;  it can then be opened with any pc or mac word processing
     software.  If in doubt, don't ask for this version.  This isn't for
     internet *newbies.* Better to order option 1 and spend a few minutes
     pasting them into one whole text document with your word processor,
     than to waste hours trying to figure how to deal with this option.
     This version is great for doing keyword searches and jumping around
     within the catalogue with your word processing software, if your
     normal email reading software doesn't allow this.


VERY IMPORTANT DIRECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT YOU GET A REPLY:

1.   you must call from an "unblocked number," ie. one that is not blocked
from caller id.  We are very sorry for this requirement, but our fax
software requires this before it allows an incoming fax call to connect.
If you have a blocked number, you must first unblock it.  In most cases
this means dialing *82 from a touch-tone phone (or 1182 from a rotary
phone) before you dial 1-718-227-9125.     NOTE:  If you are not sure if
your number is blocked, just try dialing our fax # normally.  If you don't
get a recording telling you your number is blocked, your number has been
transmitted and you may press the start button on your fax when you hear
the fax tone from our fax.
2.   no reply forms can be accepted by email....only via fax or smail.
3.   your form must be typewritten or printed out on your computer printer
before you fax it;  sorry, but *no* handwritten forms will be acknowledged.
If you can't find someone with a typewriter or a computer printer, we
apologize for not being able to reply to you.
4.   faxes with cover pages will be rejected.  You must send *only* the
reply form.
5.   forms not *completely* filled in will not be acknowledged.
6.   you will receive a reply within 1 business day directly from the
company making the offer via email.  Therefore you must have an email
address.  If you read this message, then you must have an email address, or
access to one, at least.   :-)
7.   your fax must not exceed 1 page in length.   Faxes of 2 or more pages
will be sensed, then auto-terminated and deleted.  Your fax goes directly
onto our 5.0 gigabyte hard drive and we must limit all incoming faxes to 1
page.
8.   all faxes must begin with:
*------------cut here/begin-------------------------------------------*
and must end with:
*------------cut here/end--------------------------------------------*
9. Any fax not conforming to this format will be sensed by our software,
then auto-terminated and deleted from the hard drive, before any human ever
gets to see it.
10. The type on your fax must be dark and legible.   If in doubt, please
print it out darker before faxing it in.  If we can't read it, we can't
reply to you or send you our FREE catalogue.     :-(
11.  If this all seems too complicated for faxing, just do it the old
fashioned way via smail!!!


WHO WE ARE:

Tempting Tear-Outs is an advertising company that brings potential new
customers to the companies they advertise for.

MORE ABOUT THE COMPANY MAKING THE FREE OFFER:

The company making the offer is a magazine subscription agency based in the
USA.  They have over 1,100 popular USA titles available to be shipped to
*any* country, including of course, to anywhere in the USA!    They offer a
FREE 1 yr. subscription to your choice of over 200 of the titles in their
catalogue to any new customer using them for the first time.       The
dollar value of the freebies, based on the subscription prices directly
from the publishers, ranges from $6.97 all the way up to $50.00!

For new customers in the USA, there is no charge for FPH (foreign postage &
handling), so the freebie is 100% free!   For new customers living
overseas, the only charge on the freebie would be for the FPH (foreign
postage & handling).

Their president has been in the magazine subscription business since 1973
and they are very customer-service oriented.   They will even help you with
address changes on your magazines, even if you move from one country to
another country.   They have thousands of happy customers in over 59
countries.

Their price guarantee is very simple:       they guarantee that their
subscription prices are the lowest available and they will BEAT any
legitimate, verifiable offer before you pay them or match it afterwards, by
refunding you the difference in price PLUS the cost of the postage stamp
you would use sending in the special offer to them, even 6 months after you
pay them, as long as it was current at the time of your offer.    Does that
sound fair?       Wouldn't it be great if everything you bought came with
that price guarantee?

Sometimes they are less than half of the next best deal out there,
sometimes just a little cheaper, but always you get the lowest rates
without having to shop around.     With 1,100+ titles on their list, they
would like to think that they have also the best selection around!

Within the USA, for their USA customers, they are cheaper than all their
competitors and even the publishers themselves.  This is their price
guarantee.         The 1 yr. freebie that you get with your first order is
completely free!

Overseas, (even after you factor in the cost of the FPH (foreign postage &
handling) and the conversion from USA Dollars to your currency), on the
average, they are generally around one-fourth to one-half of what the
newsstands overseas charge locally for USA magazines.  On some titles they
are as little as one-tenth of what the newsstands charge.  They are also
the cheapest subscription source for delivery overseas, including directly
from the publishers themselves!   Some publishers don't even offer
subscriptions overseas.........but overseas subscriptions are this
company's specialty!  They feel that magazines should not be a luxury
overseas.   In the USA, people buy magazines and then toss them after
reading them for just a few minutes or hours.  They are so cheap in the
USA!   Well, this company would like to make it the same way for their
overseas customers.  They are also cheaper than all their competitors in
the USA and overseas, including the publishers themselves!   It is also
*highly unlikely* you will find any of their USA competitors calling you
overseas, in order to offer that personal touch, just to sell you a couple
of magazines!  But that is what this company specializes in and loves
doing!     Around one-half their business comes from overseas, so they are
very patient with new customers who only speak limited English as a 2nd
language.    Subscription prices quoted for overseas consist of the
subscription price, plus the FPH.   You add the two together and that is
your total cost.   The exception is the 1 yr. freebie you get with your

greg and other interested extropians, the above statement
i pasted from the roton site

http://www.rotaryrocket.com/com/com.html

this is the critical statement on the whole site.  my task, before
i start buying roton stock, is in determining exactly what the
comment means.  if it means an empty roton is 5% heavier than
an empty atlas, while holding 24% more fuel by mass (the only
logical interpretation of the statement) well, then im impressed.
i grant that it is possible, since a kerosene tank is much smaller
and lighter than a tank that could hold an equal mass of liquid
hydrogen.

next i must do the calcs.  i have weights of the empty atlas, so
from the info given, weight, size and specific thrust (i will assume
they really did somehow figure out how to get 350 seconds vac isp
out of kerosene and lox with a 400 psi chamber pressure) i can
estimate (optimistically) drag coefficients and see if they really do
have a chance of getting to orbit that way.

as for using an autogyro reentry system, i have gone even crazier
trying to figure out how they could make that happen.  every
version of that i can imagine would be nowhere near handling
the heat load of even a no-payload reentry.  at best, i could imagine
blades that would deploy very late in the reentry event, after going
subsonic.  this creates the need for a heatshield, which defeats most
of the advantage of the autogyro system in the first place.

on the other hand, the system could perhaps be made so simple and
cheap it would not be so critical to recover anything.

the whole exercise gives one a new respect for how deep a gravity
well we are in down here.  spike

no, because the most dangerous form of grey goo would be the
replicator running the ultra simple program

10  eat
20  make copies of self
30  go to 10

if successful, this revenous simpleton would be dangerous as

GBurch1@aol.com wrote: Aurora "evidence" -- I sense you're a skeptic, too...

greg, i have an explanation for that sighting by the av week editor: here
was a very credible witness, an airplane expert, not easily fooled, who
saw this totally unfamiliar aircraft traverse from horizon to horizon
in 35 seconds.  other witnesses reported a buzzing sound, as one
might expect from a pulse detonation engine.

heres my theory on that: in the desert, one occasionally enjoys a
windless day where the air is so clear and calm, dust free, nearly
moisture free, that distant objects seem to be close enough to touch.
for those who have never been in the american western desert, it is
a unique experience.  go far out in the desert and enjoy something
extremely rare: total silence.  no cars, no people, no birds chirping
or bugs buzzing.  one can hear one's heartbeat.  this is no exaggeration:
you really can, given the right conditions.  you might get days like that
down there in texas.

one sighting was over the tonopah range.  if it was a day like the one
i describe, there would be no way to determine the distance to an
aircraft flying overhead.  now, suppose somebody developed a drone
with a wingspan of about 2 meters, driven by a pulse det engine,
made entirely of flat plates to scatter radar (like the f117).  if he
assumed the normal sized aircraft, he would overestimate the distance
to the tiny aircraft by a factor of 4 or more, and would also goof the
speed by the same factor.

a radar scattering drone could be flown over tonopah range, there are
receivers and transmitters all over the place out there.  the pilotless
vehicle would not need to be large, so it would be a good candidate
for pulse det propulsion. on the other hand, pulse det is highly unlikely
to push any aircraft supersonic, so this is why i suspect the observer
must have underestimated the size and distance to the aircraft.

nowthen, the mysterious part is that the observer did not report the
angle between the velocity vector and the vector from observer to
aircraft at the moment of hearing the sonic boom.  this angle is the
arcsin of the inverse of the mach number:

alpha = arcsin (1/m)  where m is the mach number of the aircraft
and alpha is the angle between the v vector and the aircraft direction
at sonic boom arrival.   or m = 1/sin (alpha) if you prefer.

this equation works regardless of the size of the aircraft or its distance.
the pulse det engine would have made a hell of a racket at mach 3
(if it somehow got going that fast) but would have been silent until
alpha was about 20 degrees regardless.  an experienced aircraft watcher
would know this, so i cant explain how it was reported that the "aurora"
was travelling in excess of mach 3.

i can see why the government would intentionally create a small
recon drone and fly it all over the desert, hoping many observers
would greatly overestimate its speed capability, thereby providing
a smokescreen for what it is *really* developing.

have you any ideas?  spike

Humans, when they are first created need spoon-feeding.  They need very high
repetition of information to spot the basic patterns in it and learn to
recognise things around them.  Later on, they can learn in leaps and bounds,
but at the beginning  they learn slowly.  It seems likely (to me, anyway)
that an AI would start off learnnig slowly and then pick up speed as it went
along.  Certianly, early AI's would learn slowly enough for this to be
spotted.

We also learn as fast as we can process data.  Admittedly we don't force
ourselves to learn as fast as we possibly could (most people aren't that
enthusiastic), but we still spend months/years building those first levels
of our neural network into recognising basic objects and hte relationships
between them and it's only years later that we become able to spot the fine
detail of the relationships and can make accurate theories about them.

Admittedly, you could make your AI's backwards compatible, so that the
learning that and early AI makes can be uploaded into a later AI, but
backwards compatibility always slows invention - and neural nets may be
impossible to make backwards compatible (at least if they are general
enough).

Only if it's travelling at very high velocity.  And grey goo does not have
to be entirely invulnerable.  It would not, for instance, be able to survive
lava (can anything?).

Oh, and most of the universe is in big gas clouds/dark matter.  Maybe it's
been goo-ed.

Hsa anyone considered that there are likely to be people who do not wish to
eb affected by a singularity.  I would estimate (not wishing to state
anything categorical about a singulairty) tht there would be certain sort fo
singularity that would not have to be inclusive of those people that do not
wish to eb affected by it.

Any thoughts?

Hardly. The fundamental problem with grey goo is 'how do I stop myself
eating my copies?', just as the fundamental problem with computer virii
is 'how do I stop myself infecting programs I've already infected?'. If
a virus doesn't check for prior infections it pretty quickly destroys
the computer it's running on, and kills itself in the process. If grey goo 
doesn't have some means to detect other grey goo then it will soon eat
itself up along with everything else.

But, of course, if there's a way to detect a virus you can use that to
pretend your computer is infected and stop it (AFAIR this technique was 
used to slow the spread of the Internet Worm). And if there's a way to
detect other grey goo nanobots you can use that to pretend you're a grey
goo nanobot and walk safely thru a sea of grey goo.

Personally I think this identification problem will be extremely hard to
solve in any manner, which is one reason why I'm not very concerned about 
grey goo.

In order to make human-equivalent AI we will have to have a larger knowledge
base than any one research group is likely to want to code.  Sharing
knowledge bases between projects is perfectly feasible, and I expect it to
become more common as AIs become more complex.  The key point is that once
you have a body of information encoded in one AI program, you can export it
to another one.

No, we don't.  The human brain deals with a constant data stream of tens
(maybe hundreds) of megabytes per second.  You remember only a tiny fraction
of that - maybe a few bytes per second if you're paying close attention,
otherwise even less.  An AI that can handle the same sensory data would be
able to store a much larger fraction of it, because its memory operates in
the same time scale as its CPU.

It also doesn't get tired, and it won't get bored or distracted unless you
want it to.

But Grey Goo doesn't mind if it kills it's host.  It doesn't even mind if it
eats other grey goo.  If you have an expanding sphere of grey goo, the
inside goo can feed on itself while the outside goo eats other things.

I could maybe believe in refueling by digesting organic life.  Eating other
nanomachines, however, is going to consume energy.  If the goo wastes energy
fighting itself, its going to be at a sever disadvantage against anything
with IFF capability.

Depends on the precise parameters; for example if a grey goo nanobot can kill
ten other grey goo nanobots in the time it would take to make one, then the
sphere will soon die out. Of course it could do a lot of damage in that
time. The important point is that these detailed implementation issues are
entirely ignored by the nanotech doomsayers; just as many similar issues
are ignored by the nanotech utopians.

If this is one of the first things we build with nanotech, then yes.
Otherwise, no.  If you have military nanotech at a similar level of
sophistication, its the equivalent of a mob of nuts with rifles.  You just
sterilize the area with directed energy weapons, then dust it with military
nanobots to mop up.

The funny thing is, I think the military equipment is easier to make.  It
doesn't have to survive in the wild, refueling from natural sources and
replicating itself.

It would be wonderfully ironic if there was some law that there is an
upper limit to intelligence, and all intelligences are too weak to
truly understand or prove the law.  :-)

(seriously, limits and hindrances like this may correspond to the
"toposophical barriers" discussed in Lem's Golem XIV. I think they may
exist, but they are not necessarily impermeable)

Don't worry, everybody is abusing the poor term. :-)

This assumes that the complexity parameter affects all levels. It
sounds a bit like the "border of chaos" idea: "interesting systems"
(i.e life) are possible only in the zone between too much order (low
complexity in your terminology) and too much chaos (high complexity in
your terminology). In the chaotic domain patterns are not stable
because new patterns continually form, and in the ordered domain new
patterns have a hard time emerging or surving.

Note that your complexity parameter is system dependent: some systems
(like gases) have low complexity, you can't build anything interesting
from them, others are too complex (turbulent plasmas?). And
metasystems formed from other systems (like molecules of atoms or
clumps of matter from molecules) can have quite different
complexity. The *BIG* questions are if there is some kind of "master
complexity parameter" that affects all or most levels of the universe,
or if it is just physics that allows different systems and their
complexity parameters could be calculated (somehow) from the
interactions.

Suppose you have a limited amount of mental resources to put into
learning and applying your knowledge. Should you specialize or
generalize? The answer depends on your environment and goals - on a
primordial African savannah being a generalist when it comes to
survival is essential, in a pampered western world you get richly
rewarded for specializing narrowly (at least I, as a graduate student,
gets rewarded for it). We might have biases left by evolution, which
has of course set some basic level of ability and interest suitable
for our evolutionary past.

Yes, he has an interesting point and I think something like that may
become very useful if it can be built. We are already getting there
with mobile phones. At the same time, when I read it I felt that good
old Dyson is getting old - he never even mentioned nanotechnology, and
seemed somehow stuck in a Stapledon world. Very odd.

I'm not sure I agree with this.  Every neural net is different.  Beyond a
very simple level, they will all learn information slightly ifferently and
the structures in their brains will be different.  It may be very hard to
export data from one AI to another unless backwards compatibility is one of
the design requisites of the new AI, in which case you won't be able to put
any funky new features in it (any more than putting monkey neurons in your
brain would work - the structures are almost certianly far too different,
and the arrangments caused by learning will also differ vastly).

Certianly they will learn faster.  They will be more efficient.  But the
first one to reach 'consciousness' will do so at a slow speed - because it
will have had a head start over the next one to be created.  We will almost
certianly be running tests on a variety of AI types and the ones that look
like they are succeeding will be the ones that are run on the fastest
machines.  These are also the ones we will be watching the closest.

Remember also, that it's a lot easier to learn whilst interacting - and
while it's learning to interact, it will be noticeable to the people it is
interacting with.

I don't. If there are any sentient aliens of a similar technological level
to us, I think there's probably enough commonality of experience that there
would be less difference between the average human and average alien than
between the average human and the average resident of a mental hospital.

I may be wrong, but we don't all agree on this.

The ones on the edge will also be happily dismantling each other, and being
dismantled by the ones in the middle. They also have to spend time making
more grey goo nanobots to form the new outer shell, while they're being
dismantled by the other nanobots, and while other nanobots are busily
dismantling the new nanobots that they're trying to build. It's far from 
an easy task; nanobot reproduction will be hard enough in a stable 
environment, let alone when other hostile nanobots are dismantling what
you're building as you're building it.

This whole idea seems an obvious non-starter to me as soon as you think
about these problems.

IFF?

Oh, and it doesn't matter if they are wasting energy attacking each other,
as only ones surrounded by other grey goo would be spending more energy
dissassembling each other, the ones on the edge would be happily digesting
more non-grey-goo.  It doesn't matter if the ones in the middle 'die' as
they aren't within attacking range anyway.

Yes... they are great... the building of the cat by Genobyte is a several

would like to buy one when they will be available at the local toys store

Ah, I see.  You assume that AI must be based on neural nets.  Hang on while
I shift gears...

My previous comments apply to algorithmic AI - more advanced versions of
today's expert systems, for example - or to systems that can use either
approach as needed.  For a purely neural net system the parameters are
different - I'm not sure if it would transcend or not.

However, it still don't share our learning disabilities.  Check out the
links Doug Bailey just posted
(http://www.news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_250000/250343.stm if
you missed it) for an example of modern neural nets.  A brain built on their
system can exchange knowledge with any other brain based on the same system
via what amounts to a direct data dump - in other words, you can copy skills
from one brain to another.  It also learns very fast - each module can go
from blank to fully optimized in less than a second.

Such systems may or may not be capable of a fast self-enhancement process,
but they can go from childhood to adolescence almost instantly.  Once you
get a human-equivalent version and teach it to read, it will be able to
learn technical skills as fast as it can process data (which is likely to be
very fast indeed).  Social skills will take longer, since you need
interaction to learn, but it will still be much faster than a human.

I agree with you.  Out intelligence would almost certianly be similar, our
emotions, on the other hand, may well be very, very different.

I'd second this. The sentient aliens might (would?) have an evolutionary
history wildly different than ours, but I'd expect them to be familiar with
concepts such as mathematics, economics, game theory and logic. Their
*data* (e.g., logical assumptions) may also differ from ours, but I think
we'd have the frameworks in common.

Even if you don't buy mark's objections, this is a fatal problem the instant
you run into defensive nanobots.  The frenzied goo is simply a thin shell,
while the smart defenders have a rear area where they can muster reserves,
mass-produce new units, and so forth.  An organized force will defeat a
frenzied mob easily.

Another problem is energy supply.  The gray goo is limited to organic matter
and solar power for energy supply, so its growth rate can't be too much
faster than ordinary microorganisms.  A defensive system can mass-produce
nanobots in industrial fabricators running off the electrical power grid.
Thus, the defensive system can have a far higher reproduction rate.

Hmm, I was assuming a high enough level of diffusion for the grey goo that
most of the time it wouldn't have to worry about other grey goo.  If it
doesn't have this (or at least some way to avoid being instantly killed by
the new goo it has just produced) it will cause problems.

Atlas did not use liquid hydrogen...it was Kerosene/Lox like the Roton is.
Roton saves empty mass by widespread use of advanced composites instead
of the stainless steel the Atlas body/tank was made of.  And Roton stock
is not available to the public (unless you have several hundred thousand
you want to invest to make it worth their while to push it through the
SEC).  I think there may be an IPO after testing.

I thought they were running at higher pressure than that, but I could be
wrong.  Even at higher pressure and aerospike altitude compensation, it
will be a tough goal.  If 350 sec is an average for the whole flight, 9300
m/s delta-v (which is a good estimate including drag and gravity losses)
the mass ratio is 15 or so.  Even if the averaged specific impulse drops
to 320, the mass ratio stays under 20.

The rotor blades will deploy upward before reentry (like an umbrella blown
inside-out) and stay in the lee of the shock way, minimizing heating.
There, they will make the vehicle passively stable (so that loss of the
reaction control system won't result in the vehicle losing control) but
they won't be spun up for lift until the vehicle slows to sub-sonic.  The
heat sheild they are designing will be water transpiration cooled (think
of it as an ablative heat shield, where the ablative material is water and
it's replaced every flight).  They expect to use rotors for hypersonic
lift on later vehicles (both take-off and re-entry) but they now expect to
have to actively cool them.  That is more risk than they want to take on
for a first generation vehicle.

Doubtful.  True land that sucker, fuel it up, kick the tires and fly again
reusability is the only way they will be able to take on the big boys.

Actually, I've been growing more and more appalled at how the cost and
difficulty of spaceflight has been over stated over the decades.  Only a
government monopoly would think a disposable spacecraft reasonable (for
other than the most basic test purposes).  But once NASA established the
status-quo, no one was able to buck it until now.  I think Rotary will
pull it off, if they have the financial ability to weather the loss of one
or two vehicles during testing.  A lot of "rocket scientists" will have a
lot of explaining to do.

Oh, almost certainly; we have a lot of baggage related to our evolution as
pack animals which aliens may or may not have. But any other technological
species will probably have to adopt the scientific method to get there, and
will have similar philosophical concerns, etc. Non-technological aliens 
could be very different to the average human; though possibly not that
different from some 'insane' humans.

Personally I think that 'alien-ness' is more a software issue than hardware;
I've known a few clinically crazy people and they're far more alien to me
than most extraterrestrial life in SF stories.

 There is no consensus that the current model says that. Lee Smolin has
a nice theory that implies an unlimited number of big bangs - each black
hole produces a new one.

 I think most of the libertarians you are trying to criticise will admit
if pinned down carefully enough that their axioms are derived from
consequential analyses. At least they don't seem to have any competing
justification for their axioms.
 I think your main disagreement is that they misjudge what part of their
reasoning is being rejected - they typically assume without evidence that
most people understand the kind of arguments Epstein makes in his book
Simple Rules for a Complex World, when it isn't clear that even most
libertarians understand those arguments.

Actually, you don't need to invest that much, you just have to have a minimum
net worth to qualify for a level of investment in such private stock
instruments. There are several net worth thresholds for different levels of
capitalization. I don't have copies of the SEC regs on me, but I had dealt
with this issue with the startup I was involved in in Seattle earlier this
decade. People that meet the threshold requirements (it can be a net worth
amount or a gross income amount) are called Qualified Investors. You can also
get stock in pre-IPO companies as compensation for work done for them, either
as an employee or as a contractor.

Has anyone checked on the latest from the various rocketplane companies?
Pioneer Rocketplane seemed to be moving along pretty well a while back.

I've also seen some good performance from some amateur projects which are
using a peroxide(90%)/tar type solid/liquid hybrid fuel system. This
apparently allows a real minimization in the mass of the vehicle, and the
solid fuel is really dense, while the high concentrate peroxide is extremely
reactive.

I know that Pioneer was looking at a 95% peroxide/JP-4 system earlier. Now
they are drifting toward a more conventional oxygen/kerosene system.

I've been in the list since november 1998 (pretty recent). I don't read everything from the list in my mail, but I try to when possible.

It is sometimes hard to find someone to share avant guard ideas in a place where people are so conservative. I call them mono people 'cause they think in mono acoustic, mono chromatic, mono dimentional, mono etc.

Have you ever thought that this kind of ideas being exchanged here  might be read in the future as Plato's Dialogues?

I do thik so, since it is not just trivial stuff.

Well, the original reason for this message was just to say hello and keep this warm in a human sense.


Regards from Mexico City,

Antonio Marquez.

I've only known one insane person, but she was characterised by a likelihood
for making arbitrary decisions that bore no relation to reality (or at least
only by accident).  I would expect any race that achieved space travel to be
able to think rationally (at least some of the time) and be able to
cooperate (I find it hard to imagine a space faring race that had
individually attained space travel with no help from each other).

yeah. Its called an aerospike engine. Heard of it? Yeah, you work at Lockheed,
so of course you would, as its the engine that will be used on the VentureStar
vehicle. Come to think of it, Lockheed also builds all of the classified planes
that are flown at Tonapah as well ....hmmmmm.....

Now, it is possible to build a ramjet system which uses the rearward surface of
the vehicle and the shockwave that is captured at a crease in the airframe
surface, thus acting as an aerospike.

The thing that makes me think that such technologies ARE infact in use by
Lockheed vehicles, is that I find it HIGHLY unlikely that NASA would agree to
invest several billion dollars in building a vehicle which will be commercial
from the get go but will be dependent on an engine technology which supposedly
has never been used on another vehicle. The fact that Lockheed already had
testbed engines running on the test stand immediately after the first public
announcement of the VentureStar program indicates to me that the technology is
already developed, and possibly already proven on another vehicle, possibly one
nicknamed 'Aurora' either accurately or inaccurately.....

But you never know with black project people. I remember that the stealth
fighter program was publicly called the F-19 program by people who claimed to be
in the know, and this was the program the soviets tried so hard to find info
about, when the real program was the F-117 program which supposedly was just a
research project using mothballed century series jets as remotely piloted
drones. When the public was being fed the tripe that the Stealth Fighter was
called the 'Wobblin Goblin', and Tom Clancy called it the 'Frisbee' in Red Storm
Rising, its actual name was the Nighthawk.

Yes and no. The assumptions below certainly make a Singularity
possible, but the reverse is not true. Vinge's original (vanilla?)
Singularity was simply that the effective intelligence-enhancing
ability of mankind as a whole increased, and thic could happen through
far less dramatic means. 

I must admit that I'm disturbed by the *faith* many seem to put into
the Singularity. It is not a necessary part of transhumanist thinking,
it is just one wild prediction among many.

Well, one thing a fellow researcher told me was that the world-class
lab at a famous American university where he did his postdoctoral work
had worse computers than we have in our student labs (and our
institute has little money compared to the university). So excellence
in programming doesn't give you the best hardware. But you are talking
about hardware in general, so let's continue.

I think I understand your point but I think you miss mine: making a IQ
X AI requires effort E. Making an IQ 2X AI, does it require effort
0.5E, E, 2E or E^2? And will twice the intelligence double the
programming ability? You seem to assume something like this, the
ability times the available subjective time (large due to fast
computers) will make the next step happen very quickly. But if
development becomes quadratically harder, the AI, even when it devotes
all its resources, will make slower and slower progress.

I agree with some of the above assumptions (time constant depending on
intelligemnce, smarter AI can likely improve faster, human have a hard
time changing timescales). But just because AI *could* be very fast
doesn't mean it *will* be very fast - that is the assumption you are
trying to prove. Can you give any support for why an AI program would
have a specific speed?

In addition, the human-level AI might be significantly slower than
humans, so that even if it can build a better AI it will be faster to
use humans. AI will only speed its own development if the number of
collaborating AIs times their ability divided by their speed is
smaller than the number of collaborating humans times their ability
divided by human speed. Collaboration of course introduces logistic
problems.

Why is the human level so critical? Self-enhancement might be doable
by less complex systems or perhaps require significantly more advanced
systems, depending on form of intelligence and designability. And
system security could definitely be efficiently provided by
less-than-human level AI to an extent that hampers even a very bright
mind (ever tried to silently sneak past a watchdog?).

Even *skills*? Wow. Somehow I'm not entirely convinced. And if you
really can learn skills through the net in this scenario, then the
*humans* will be well on their way to SI.

There is a difference between data, information, knowledge and ability.

OK, you are simply assuming nobody notices what appears to be a super
worm or virus on the net? A program that not just takes of processor
power, but also hogs net resources to send dense data (its thoughts)
everywhere. In a world that is obviously highly dependent on the net,
where many important systems appear to be net-connected and the
majority of people have grown up with the net and its pitfalls? 

Personally I think this is another big Hollywood meme: the
crackability of systems. Somehow it seems so simple in movies to crack
mothership computers... Sure, security will always have flaws. But are
they really so exploitable that somebody can take over a lot of
systems easily without making any fuss? (remember things like anomaly
monitoring software - I have seen a neural network classify what the
users are doing and what kind of people they are; that program would
immediately notice something amiss). Most likely you could run SATAN
and its derivatives to get a few accounts, but in the process a lot of
system operators would go on alert.


Notice that you seem to be assuming that as soon as the good AI that
so far has spent its existence single-mindedly programming better
versions of itself notices a lack of computing power, it quickly
teaches itself to crack all sorts of systems (without anybody
noticing) and then goes on with a career as engineer. Sure, it is
smart, but *that* smart, flexible and able to find applicable skills
without anybody noticing anything?

But you are assuming what you want to prove, namely that the AI can
grow into an unstoppable SI. But you have not managed to show that the
human-level AI will reach SI level just by being in the
AI-researchers' big computer.

It seems to me that grey goo will destroy us simply by being the source of far
too much wasted bandwidth by people jabbering about it on mail lists.

Well, for now it's just a hack so I don't get overwhelmed by the complexity

Of course, our ability to choose whether to specialise or generalise comes
from the fact that nature came up with an excellent general solution to the
problems of the savannah. Looking at my graph again I think it's important
to say that peak generalisation would correspond to low complexity and peak
specialisation would correspond to high complexity. This I think seems a
little counterintuitive due to the ambiguity of terms. The idea that complex
meta-systems can't form in high 'generality' or high 'speciality' is the
key. (I'm not sure if it was obvious that we couldn't be intelligent while
way up there on the 'generalisation' scale - the most general solution is no
solution at all.)

Yes, that is not unlikely. But note that this is a problem for the
scenario, since if you assume that software development is hard, then
the AI will have a hard problem to solve (obviously on the order of
many man-years with a diverse skillset and diverse outlooks)

<ROFL!> Sorry, but I disagree as a neuroscientist. The number of
neurons obviously place a ceiling on information content in our
brains, but it is the connection structure that makes us
smart. "Integrating" them is the problem, since I assume what you are
meaning is equivalent to "connecting them in the *right* way" instead
of just connecting them randomly (the later is quite possible; brain
transplants are being researched, and there is a gene in the mouse
that causes enormous brain growth - I wonder if they called it
Algernon? :-)

Actually, I doubt milliseconds because of the hardware limitations
even on nanocomputers, unless it turns out that self-enhancement is
well suited for massive parallelism without too much internal
communication.

Hmm, it took mankind hundreds of thousands of years to go from "Oook!"

As the other response indicates, the watchdogs do not need to be
asimovs to do their job. You can have loyal, barking and biting
programs defending your system without having to worry about them
starting to discuss abolition. 

And yes, an intelligent invader will still have a problem with the
security measures since it will likely (if it is designed well) not
have enough information about them, they have the advantages of a home
game and they can protect their system by cutting the net connection
if things turn out bad.

I wonder how well I could build all those waterwheels, metal melting,
steam engines and Volta cells. Have you tried to recreate technology?
And the interesting thing in this example is that in the end it hinges
not on me being a super-genius, but on me knowing things already (and
then needing to somehow implement them, which is the hard part!). 

It would be interesting to drop you off on an isolated island together
with a randomly selected but stupid survivalist. Would your superior
intellect bring you more food? 

I would rather say smartness is a poor substitute for skill, which is
why we tend to rely on learned skills rather than problem solving for
most tasks we do.

OK, here is a question: how do I design a good robot body? Assume no
prior knowledge beyond a common sense database about the world,
including no experience with being physical, no scientific education,
no engineering education.

Why assume we can't see them? There doesn't seem to be any reason for
one way or another.

I agree with the word Vast. But remember, positive feedback
*amplifies* small differences, which means that the result is
influenced by our every action - the problem is whether it is chaotic
or just exponential. In the first case, we cannot predict anything. In
the later case, we can try to aim in a direction and hope things go
right.

Personally I prefer setting up the feedback loops instead. Why bet on
the outcome when you can try to write the rules?

The question is, do we want some Aristotele to edit them?  My guess is
that there were quite a bit of stupid flames and ill-considered

Seriously, future historians might have real fun reading old mailing

almost all the discourse in certain groups. Let's just make sure they

He has a good point. But he still doesn't seem to realize the profound
effects of agile nanofacturing.

The nice thing about Drexler's approach is that he can show what is
allowed by physical law, and then we can look for it using biotech.

I'd suggest that the E^2 case is plausible.  You can think of the problem
faced by an organism as a search tree.  The branches of the tree are the
possible actions, and the nodes are the corresponding states.  You want
to search down the tree and find nodes which lead to favorable states.

Organisms evolve many heuristics for pruning the tree, discarding unlikely
branches.  We see this very clearly in the studies of chess masters.
There the tree search problem is made explicit, but the masters don't
perceive the problem in quite that way.  The pruning is, for them,
subconscious.  They see only a few possibilities at each branch, so that
they are able to follow the tree very deeply.

It is plausible that a similar phenomenon occurs in all areas of life.
We get the tree pre-pruned for us, so that at any moment we can make
our choices unconsciously, or face only a few possible options.  Then
to evaluate those options we consider outcomes, possible further actions,
and so on, always pruning away unfavorable branches using our heuristics.

Better intelligence can come from either faster tree search or better
heuristics.  But either of these is still going to be of limited value
given the exponential nature of tree growth.  A processor speedup of
a factor of n allows you to look a fixed number of steps deeper.  A
new heuristic which prunes better by a factor of n allows you to look
a factor of n deeper, but those are probably going to be much harder
to come by, at least unless they are a lot more expensive.

The exponential growth of the possibility tree makes it hard for
improvements to gain much ground.  Looking twice as deep is going to
take the square of the effort.  The conservative assumption is that we
will face increasing difficulty in improving intelligence.

This is consistent with our experience in industrial research.  We keep
putting more and more effort into it, but doubling times have remained
pretty stable for 100 years or so.  That's because we are facing
increasingly harder problems.

First, I know very little about Mr. Dyson...

I skimmed that Wired article, and perhaps I'm wrong, but I got the
distinct impression that Mr. Dyson is not very interested in
capitalism, and maybe that he is enamoured with communism or at least
collectivism.

Is this old news?  

If he's a socialist/collectivist, I'd have to take anything he says
with a HUGE grain of salt.  Looters aren't to be trusted, ya know.

Anders Sandberg wrote a number of cogent objections to the 'SI apotheosis'
scenario.  Rather than doing a point-by-point response, let me restate my
case in more detailed terms.

First, I don't think the super-AI scenario is inevitable, or even the most
likely one.  It becomes a serious possibility only given the following
conditions:

1) Humans can build an algorthmic AI capable of writing software at a human
level of competence.

2) The first such program is not developed until hardware much faster than
the human mind is available (between 2010 and 2020, by my best guess).

3) The first such program is developed before human intelligence enhancement
gets going at a good rate.

4) It is possible for beings far more intelligent than humans to exist.

5) Higher intelligence does not require some extraordinary explosion in
computer power.  Getting IQ 2X might require speed 2X, or 10X, or even 100X,
but not X^X.

5) It is possible for slow, stupid beings with greater resources to defeat a
smart, fast being.  However, the resource advantage required grows
exponentially as the differences in IQ and speed increase.  At some point it
simply becomes impossible - the superior intellect will outmaneuver you so
completely that there will never even be a fight.

Discard any one of these, and you no longer have a problem.  However, if all
of these assumptions are true, you have a very unstable situation.

Our SI-to-be isn't some random expert system or imitate-a-human program.
Its Eliezer's seed AI, or something like it written by others.  Its an AI
designed to improve its own code in an open-ended manner, with enough
flexibility to do the job as well as a good human programmer.

Now, the first increment of performance improvement is obvious - it writes
code just like a human, but it runs faster (not smarter, just faster).  It
also has some advantages due to its nature - it doesn't need to look up
syntax, never has a typo or misremembers a variable name, etc.  Together
these factors produce a discontinuity in innovation speed.  Before the
program goes on line you have humans coding along at speed X.  Afterwards
you have the AI coding at speed X^6 (or maybe X^3, or X^10 - it depends on
how fast the computers are).

At that point the AI can compress years of programming into days, hours, or
even minutes - a short enough time scale that humans can't really keep track
of what it is doing.  If you shut it down at that point, you're safe - but
your average researcher isn't going to shut it down.  Eliezer certainly
won't, and neither will anyone else with the same goal.

At this point the AI will figure out how to actually make effective use of
the computational resources at its disposal - using that hardware to think
smarter, instead of just faster.  Exploiting a difference of several orders
of magnitude should allow the AI to rapidly move to a realm well beyond
human experience.

Now we have something with a huge effective IQ, that is optimized for
writing code and thinking about thought.  Any human skill is trivial to a
mind like that - it might not be obvious, but it won't take long to invent
if it has the necessary data.  From here on we're all talking about the same
scenario, so I won't repeat it again.

So, is it the assumptions you don't buy, or the reasoning based on them?

<snip>

This all makes perfect sense, except for one nagging question - why do we
seem so much smarter than apes?  We have larger brains, but not by enough to
make much difference if this argument holds up.

I would suggest that there are two ways to improve one's intelligence.  The
easy way is to use faster hardware and/or improved heuristics to getter a
deeper search tree, which suffers the problems you suggest.  I will point
out, however, that increasing your search depth by 1 or 2 increments is not
a small change - it seems to be a decisive advantage in chess, for instance.

The hard way is to reformulate the problem in simpler terms, thus replacing
a combinatorial explosion with a solvable problem.  Evolution may have
managed something like this with humans - we have a higher-order
representation of the world that an ape, so we can solve much harder
problems with only a modest increase in processing power.

I just checked the site, and they've apparently got their designs to a 'can do'
level and are ready to build a test vehicle. It will use turbofan engines to take
off from a normal runway, be fueled with LOx by a tanker plane in the air, then
use an RD-120 rocket engine to burn kerosene and LOx to reach a suborbital
trajectory where it will deploy a liquid fueled upper stage to launch a 2000 lb
cargo into orbit for less than $7 million a ride. This means their cargo launch
cost will be $3500.00 per pound, which is still too high in my opinion. If the
chinese can launch reusables for under $2000 a cargo pound, then they need to
work on trimming costs or increasing payload, or both. However, it looks like
their system has high reliability, and it is man rated as well, which I consider
important.

Yes, by all means, let's apply this political litmus test and reject
everything said by socialists.  We can start with people like Robert
Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein.  Everybody knows that they're a bunch
of no-nothing looters, not to be trusted, right?

Albert Einstein, the looter.

Imagine Albert Einstein breaking a store window and grabbing the
merchandise, running away with a boom box on his shoulder, his wispy
white hair flying in all directions as the German physicist anxiously
looks back over his shoulder for pursuing cops.

That's the kind of morals and ethics he had, right, Terry?

In my experience, many if not most pure scientists and mathemeticians
lean towards socialism.  In fact, I once read a eulogy in a mathematics
magazine where the author went to some lengths to apologize for the fact
that the deceased was *not* a socialist.  He had to explain that there
were personal reasons why the man hadn't become a socialist, that he was
still a good person, etc.  Apparently it was quite an embarrassment not
to be a socialist in those circles.

"I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils,
namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by
an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals."

Yeah -- I used to have a theory that Tom Clancy was actually a Naval
Intelligence "construct": It was just too improbable that some insurance
salesman from Kansas who'd never steered a boat in his life or written a word
of fiction could come out of nowhere with "The Hunt for Red October".  So I
figured he'd been "given" the novel by Naval Intell because it was full of
convincing disinformation, especially about SOSUS.  Then, along came "Red
Strom Rising" and his detailed description of the "F-19 Frisbee" that turned
out to be like what we THOUGHT the stealth program was creating, but was in
fact all wrong (it actually sounds like what the F-22 will eventually be).

So now, we have "Spike", a propulion engineer from Lockheed, who tells us just
enough about aerospikes to be convincing . . . .

Actually we have a lot more brains. When you're comparing humans to other
animals, you need to consider several things. First, what is the amount needed
just to run the body, etc. If you do a brain mass to body mass curve comparing
humans to other animals, you'd find a good sized difference in the ratios that
we have versus other animals, even other apes. Its the extra brain mass that has
no other purpose than to think that gives us a basis to develop genius. Now, one
of the reasons why there are no other apes near our intelligence is because we
killed all of them off a long time ago. TIme was in our early history that the
late homo erectus was one of the prime predators on the early homo sapiens.
Erectus was a pretty good predator, with some good tool use and strength like
that of a chimp, and was about halfway between us and chimps in brain size.

Another way to increase intelligence is to only allow  smart people to breed.
The disheartening thing is that it seems like only the morons are breeding these
days...

Because any excess brain capacity developed now is only needed for thinking, not
for sensory or body management tasking, it goes exclusively toward creative
tasking...

Well, if one is to be consistent in applying moral judgment to
everyone, then yes, those were his morals.  That he chose to steal
with votes rather than a mask and gun is no excuse to me.  I can,
however, separate the genius and scientific integrity of the man
from his lack of personal integrity.

> In my experience, many if not most pure scientists and mathemeticians

A consequence of definition: "pure" scientists and mathematicians
are those in academia rather than in productive enterprise.  Since
our system socializes education and a lot of research, it is
expected that those who do well in that environment think of it as
natural and normal.  If you look at scientists and mathematicians
who actually work for a living--say those doing R&D in big industry,
insurance actuaries, bookies--I'm sure you'll get a different picture.

I good freind of mine was a sonar tech in the Navy, and when THFRO came out, he
had a copy down in the black room with his buddies, saying,"Is that classified?
No? OK, well, how bout that? No... no anymore. Oh ok..., etc etc".

Maybe.  But why do you presume that cognitive elements are likely to be
similar while emotional elements are likely to be dissimilar?   In the book,
Descarte's Error (D'amasio, Antonio, R. (1992) Descarte's Error; Emotion,
Reason, and the Human), a neuroscientist discusses the pivotal and critical
role of emotions in effective decision-making.  I guess it's possible for
aliens to have unheard of emotions, but I would expect them to experience
anger, fear, sadness, joy, and the other basic emotions . . . pretty much
the same way we do.

Yes.  I remember thinking about this after watching "A Connecticut 
Yankee in King Arthur's Court" with the Bing-meister.  I would want to 
take along my four volume set of "How Things Work".

Good Question.  First off,  I would want to be able to fly, very fast if I 
wanted to.  I would also want to be able to breath either air OR water.
I guess I would generally want to be as mobile as possible.  I would also 
want to greatly increase my sensory range . . . visually, auditorally, etc.

I'm no engineer so I can't imagine how this can be arranged, but I prefer 
to continue to experiece the good Earth, rather than upload into a virtual 
existence.

Pardon me?  "Lack of personal integrity?"  That's a rather strong
phrase, don't you think?  Let's not Atlas overboard.  The strong exist
to serve the weak - but I consider myself one of the strong, and would
never dream of enunciating that theory for my own benefit, or for that
matter of using force to compel any person A to serve person B.  Does my
defiance of Ayn Rand's morality make me a looter?  And for that matter,
there is a long way between saying "I have a right to your new stereo"
and stealing it.  One can believe in that right, while still believing
that your property rights take precedence.

I don't think that socialism/Libertarianism has anything to do with lack
of personal integrity.  It is possible to be a socialist and still have
plenty of personal integrity; it's just stupid, because socialism has
been demonstrated not to work.  Personal integrity is defined by your
unswerving adherence to high ideals for deeply altruistic reasons, not
the intelligence or stupidity manifest in choosing those ideals.

If Libertarian countries were squalid, criminal, poverty-stricken,
fear-ruled countries, and socialist countries were wealthy,
technological, educated bastions of opportunity, I would be a socialist.
 Does this reflect my lack of personal integrity?

of course, interstellar space is about 5 orders of magintude larger than
interplanetary space.  i need to do the calcs, but intuition tells me
a meteor could not punch material out of the sun's gravity well, and even
if so, the simple relicator would not survive the jillions of years of
wandering thru i.s. space.  guess that would explain why we have
never had one fall on this planet.

a grey-gooed double star might be able to goo its neighbor perhaps.  spike

yes, michael, it is.  extreeeemely reactive.  {8-[  the temptation is to use

there are some huge advantages in this.  im hoping my own version

are they proposing the aerospike with roton?  i didnt see it on the site,
but it sounds like an ideal application.  i was having trouble seeing how
one could make a traditional nozzle stand up to the aero loading caused
by the spinning.

well, not down low.  thats surely their vacuum isp.  i would be interested
in the isp profile, given aerospike altitude compensation.

i was using 9500 delta v, but i will buy 9300.  the mass ratio for the atlas
is about 17, so if the rotoners can hit that, ill have some butts to kiss.
on the other hand, the cross sectional area of the roton makes it more
draggy, so im not sure a mass ratio of 17 will be sufficient.  more on that
later.

well pardner, the old land, fuel and fly scenario is most probably
not doable with single stage to orbit.  its asking too much.   but there
are many interrim technologies, even with throwaway hardware that
could stomp the big boys flat.  our modern launchers all require standing
armies at staggering costs.  if we managed to get a design that is way
simple, we could throw the stuff away every shot and *still* be waaay
cheaper than a recoverable system that requires hundreds of full timers.

ya, ill be one of em.  {8^D  consider this tho: i have a version of a roton,
been making sketches and calcs for a few months now.  it is a two
stage, both rotary, with no recoverables *but* it is verrry simple.
given economies of scale, the parts could be mass produced and
still beat up on the big boys.  my version has lox/methane first stage
and lox/hydrogen second.  i am trying to calculate my way out of
liquid hydrogen for the second stage, as it introduces so many handling
difficulties, but i give away a lot of performance without it.  i fear
even my 9500 m/s delta v is a bit optimistic.

i tried to make it work with no despun section, but couldnt figure out
how to guide the turn, so, i end up with a despun platform forward
that holds the payload.  problem im having is that the cross sectional
area is large, so i lose an awful lot to drag.  i wonder if i could get
a mountain top launch site?  a high one could get me out of half
the atmosphere.  the environmental types wouldnt like it tho.  spike

Both nano- and bio-tech are just ways of making specific piles of atoms, that

   DISAPPEARED NEWS - THE ORWELLIAN NIGHTMARE

   One of the more disturbing issues surrounding the 
   TWA Flight 800 crash has been the claims made by 
   some people that on the night of the crash they 
   saw reports on TV that confirmed a missile hit, 
   yet the reports apparently disappeared into an 
   Orwellian black hole. NOW a news cameraman has 
   spilled-the-beans on one of these disappeared 
   TV reports, indicating that what people have
   been saying they saw on TV really was on TV.

I have to disagree, partially. While I agree that sentient, technology-using aliens at roughly our technological level would be intelligible, I'm not sure such beasties exist. Not within our galaxy, possibly not within the Local Group.

Notwithstanding my personal belief that the evolution of life beyond unicellular non-eukaryotes is a fantabulously rare event, we only have to look at the timescales involved. 

Given that it takes approxiamately 4-6 billion years to synthesize spaceship builders from amino acids, and that we spent 3 of that 4 billion evolving nuclei, and that becoming multicellular is very difficult, rare and complicated, I'd be very surprised to find any aliens whose development is within 100 million years of us, much less 100 years.

And wouldn't 100 years be enough for extreme differences anyways? 100 million years ago we were what? Squirrels? Or amphibians? 500 million years before that we were cells. 100 million years from now, we'll either be dust or Powers. Call it a lack of imagination but I don't see a third alternative.

My personal suspicion is that there are exactly 2 types of aliens out there; paramecia, and Gods. :)

It is not really a question about ideology, but engineering. We
already have working bionanotech in the world around us, but reverse
engineering it is tricky and the resulting systems tend towards the
squishy side. Drexlerian "hard" nanotech doesn't exist yet, but would
have a lot of desirable properties and can be analysed
mathematically. The problem is that these two fields (despite a mutual
interest) have little overlap and talk different languages, making
cooperation hard.

I would call Dyson a bit of an european-style humanist, perhaps a
transHumanist so to say. That makes him somewhere left of Lenin to
some of our list members, I suppose :-)

Actually, in _Imagined Worlds_ he has a chapter about technological
failures that clearly shows that he really understands the importance
of spontaneous orders and the failures of the control mentality. His
view seems to be closer to "small is beautiful, and can conquer the
universe". He cares about people rather than institutions.

More what they would be emotional about.  A more pack orientated animal
would likely be more socialist, a more independent animal would likely be
more libertarian.  They may well attach value to different things (At the
risk of sounding facetious, take Klingons as an example, a race which
believes that honour is the most important part of life) in differentr ways.

I'm going to assume this is humour.  If not, then possibly you should learn

The space of all possible programs is very large, and execution of a given

I did some interesting work on this topic a while back - all very
back-of-the-envelope stuff, but the potential seems promising.  If you
assume advanced biotech, primitive nanotech, and good automated engineering,
you should be able to do really neat stuff.

A biomechanical body capable of surviving any environment on Earth should be
feasible (just stay away from lava flows).  Using a diamondoid skeleton and
layers of diamondoid mesh below the skin you could be pretty much
bulletproof, too.

Flying is a big power hog - you could use folding wings with arrays of
micromotor fans for lift, but I don't think you can run it for long without
a nuclear power source.  Of course, you probably aren't worried about modest
radiation levels at that point, so a radioactive decay battery might be
feasible.

The only real problem with sensory enhancements is that you need to modify
your brain to be able to handle the extra information.  If you can do that,
you should be able to pack an active/passive sonar system, wide-spectrum
omnidirectional vision (wavelengths from several cm to somewhere in the far
UV / soft X-ray region), and very acute taste/smell into a humanoid body
with no problems.  Wearing clothing would interfere with the vision, of
course - you need to use most of your body area as a sensor for the longer
wavelengths.

If you want to get really fancy it should be possible to add some completely
new senses as well - magnetic field 'vision' and mass detectors would be
obvious candidates.

This time, a mixed bouquet of phramacology, psychoepidemology, EEG,
computer graphics, anthrocomology and a few twigs of particle physics:

	Sneaking neuroprotectants through the blood-brain barrier
	Social class in childhood affecting health in adulthood
	Brain-wave recognition of sentences
	Modelling of plant ecosystems
	A virtual-reality interface for a scanning tunneling microscope
	Is the strong anthropic principle too weak?
	Decay of protons and neutrons induced by acceleration



Neuroprotection with noninvasive neurotrophin delivery to the brain
Dafang Wu and William M. Pardridge Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences USA, Vol 96 254-259 January 1999

Neutrotrophic factors are known to have neuroptrotective properties,
and might be candidates both for treating ischemia and dementias (as
well as nerve damage). Unfortunately they have to be injected
intraventricularly to have any effect, since they do not cross the
blood brain barrier. Wu and Pardridge manage to sneak BDNF into the
brain anyway, by polyglycosylating the protein so that it isn't
absorbed by the peripheral tissues, linking it with another protein so
that it is actively transported through the barrier and adding biotin
which seems to enhance the process. They tested this on rats, and the
treatment (given intravenously for two weeks after ischemic damage to
the brain) managed to keep the number of neurons in the CA1 region
near normal. Very nice, and the possibility of "smuggling" other drugs
into the brain is promising.


Social class in childhood and general health in adulthood:
questionnaire study of contribution of psychological attributes
Hans Bosma, H Dike van de Mheen and Johan P Mackenbach, British
Medical Journal 2 January 1999, 318 18--22
http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/318/7175/18

A tricky but interesting subject: how does social class affect
attitudes and health? The article suggests that childhood social class
affects health more than adult social class. Adverse personality
profiles such as external locus of control, neuroticism, parochialism,
lack of future orientation and negative coping styles are more common
for people who grew up with a low childhood social class, and they
might make people more susceptible to illness; this seems to account
for half of the association low social class and bad health. These
results seems to suggest that the memes you acquire as young might
actually have health effects later in life. Yet another reason to
spread dynamical optimism, and especially among the young.


Brain-wave recognition of sentences
P. Suppes, B. Han and Z. L. Lu
Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 95:26 15861--6 Dec 22 1998

It seems that it is possible to at least partially detect the
brainwave patterns of words and sentences a subject hears. The authors
measured the electrical and magnetic brain waves from two subjects
hearing 12 test sentences (of the type Subject-verb-object; "Bill
loves Susan", "Mary sees John", ...) a number of times, and then used
averaging to create prototypes that were in turn fourier transformed,
filtered and inverse transformed into filters. Recognition rates
varied a lot, but the average recognition was around 40-50% (the best
was 86.7%). Electrode location, the use of bipolar electrodes and
various transforms of the data improved recognition. They tried to
paste together the EEG of individual words, in order to see if one
word has a standardized EEG representation or if it changes depending
on its position in the sentence; it turned out that recognition was
still possible. Overall, this paper shows some interesting
possibilities for us interested in EEG-interface, but it is clear that
a practical interface might be rather tricky. 


Realistic modeling and rendering of plant ecosystems
Oliver Deussen, Pat Hanrahan, Bernd Lintermann, Radomr M&ecaron;ch,
Matt Pharr, Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz
SIGGRAPH '98. Proceedings of the conference on Computer Graphics, pages 275-286
http://www.acm.org/pubs/citations/proceedings/graph/280814/p275-deussen/

A lovely paper about how to model a realistic plant ecosystem. They
start with setting up a terrain model, both interactively and with
pseudorandom features. Then they calculate the amount of water in the
soil in different regions, since this affects what plants will
grow. Then they "seed" different species (again, partially
interactive, partially random) and let them grow according to a
competition model (self-thinning: if two plants get too close
together, the weaker will die and vanish; since the strength of plants
depends on the environment the model naturally makes plants grow at
the "right" places). Then the plants themselves are modelled as
L-systems, and some simplifications in order to keep the specification
files manageable (without them the specification files would be
several hundred gigabytes!). The results are wonderfully realistic.

Transhuman relevance? I don't know, but it is a lovely paper and
beautiful graphics. Well worth remembering when we as uploads want to
take on gardening :-)


The nanomanipulator: a virtual-reality interface for a scanning
tunneling microscope
Russell M. Taylor, Warren Robinett, Vernon L. Chi, Frederick P., J
r. Brooks, William V. Wright, R. Stanley Williams, Erik J. Snyder
SIGGRAPH '93. Proceedings of the 20th annual conference on Computer
graphics, pages 127-134
http://www.acm.org/pubs/citations/proceedings/graph/166117/p127-taylor/

A head-mounted display and force-feedback manipulator arm connected to
a STM - nice! The user can view the surface and move around on it,
feel it and modify it. Maybe not really useful yet other than
interactive exploration, but it definitely sounds like a tool that
will be used when nanotech gets truly underway.


Is the Strong Anthropic Principle Too Weak?
A.Feoli, S.Rampone
to appear in Il Nuovo Cimento B
http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9812093

Something for the discussions about the Great Filter, I suppose; I'm
personally not that fond of this realm. The authors revisit Carter's
formula for the expected time between the emergence of intelligent
life and the end of the biosphere (either interpreted as "we're very
unlikely and the biosphere will soon vanish!" if you assume many
unlikely steps in our ontogenesis, or "we're surprisingly likely!" if
you start from the estimated lifetime of the biosphere). They show
that if the steps are not independent but chained the formula gives an
overestimate of the time. In addition, if you assume a large universe
with many planets where life can develop, the number of improbable
steps in our evolution is balancee large number of planets producing a
longer time between the emergence of intelligence and the end of its
biosphere, and this grows with the number of terrestrial planets in
the Universe. In the end they propose a stronger form of the Strong
Anthropic Principle, the Mediocrity Anthropic Principle: "The Universe
(and hence both the fundamental parameters on which it depends, and
the amount of places where the evolitoon can take place9 must be such
as to admit the creation of observers on some stage, and to assure
them a not trivial living time". Well, we have the WAP, SAP, FAP and
now the MAP.


Decay of protons and neutrons induced by acceleration
George E.A. Matsas, Daniel A.T. Vanzella
http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9901008

Apparently accelerations can help induce proton decay in the standard
model; the authors calculate that for accelerations around 11MeV (I'm
not sure how they convert energy into acceleration) the proton
lifetime becomes roughly equal to the neutron lifetime. Maybe useful
for matter conversion.

Seems like it ought to still get a bit warm to me, too.  However, they
*are* doing extensive computational aerodynamics and are relying heavily
on hypersonic rotor wind tunnel work that NASA did in the 60's.  Amazing
all the stuff gathering dust in their libraries.

Watch me back-peddle...  Wouldn't take much to build a simplified
expendable that could beat the big guys in a fair contest.  But I'm not
sure you would get a fair contest.  I think you need something
overwhelming superior and difficult for them to duplicate to survive the
economic/legal/political power they can bring to bear.  Don't get me
wrong, I'm not talking secret conspiracies...just good old fashioned
hardball.

But doesn't the concept more or less require the fuel and oxydizer to be
closely matched in density?  That's one of reasons they use kerosene, and
also one reason they use LOX for engine cooling (the pressure drop through
the cooling system brings it to the same pressure as the less dense
kerosene).  Wouldn't there be a 10 to 1 pressure difference with the LOX
and hydrogen?

Is it because the low denity fuel requires a large diameter?  Higher
density fuel can make it much more compact.  And I would think that
rotating the feul tanks are more trouble than they are worth...slow, low
pressure rotating seals aren't *that* hard.

"BOOST YOUR SEX APPEAL AND CHANGE YOUR SOCIAL AND SEX LIFE FOREVER. 

Scientists have isolated the natural Human male/female Pheromone attractants and

[snip]

Pheromones are natural chemicals which play an important role in sexual
communication. 

       Animals, including humans release chemicals in tears, saliva and
perspiration. These chemicals send signals relating to mood and health to the
subconscious awareness.  One theory is that the dominant male will exude more of
these chemical attractants than a submissive or weaker male.
This chemical attracts more females to him.  It is similar for woman
attracting men. This natural attractant can also contribute to more intense
excitement during love making (sexual foreplay and sexual intercourse). Pheromones
may also contribute to the dating phrase, "chemical attraction" that we all talk
about.  WSVN-TV (March 3, 1998)

pheromones, Alpha-Androstenol and Alpha-Androstenone." 

(complete message available on request -- or did everyone on
this list get it?)
======

I'm not sure about the effectiveness of this particular product, but
the underlying idea certainly seems logical: use pheromones to
score (this is just one of many potential applications, of course). 
Very transhuman. Why rely on chance and bother with cumbersome 
mating rituals when you can simply splash on some pheromones 
and go stand next to your desired partner. "Ahem".

Well, that's the theory anyway. Obviously there must be a glitch 
somewhere, or else (synthetic) pheromones would be "bigger" than 
Viagra by now. Anyone know more about this?

*------------cut here/end--------------------------------------------*



CATALOGUE VERSION CHOICES:

1.  This version can be read by everyone, no matter what type of
     computer you use, or what type of software you use.  It is a simple
     format, with just our entire catalogue pasted into the body of a
     single email message, 316K in size.  If you use pine or elm on a unix
     system or an advanced software version such as Eudora Pro 3.0 or
     later, you will most likely receive it as a single email message.
     However, if your software limits incoming email messages to a
     certain size, say 32K or so, then your software will split it into
     multiple email message parts.   Whether you receive it as a single
     email message or multiple part email messages, you can easily
     paste it into one whole text document with your word processor, in
     about 10 minutes or so.
2.  For more advanced computer users:  attached plain ascii text file
     ~316K - you must know how to download an attached text file and
     then be able to locate it on your hard drive or system home
     directory;  it can then be opened with any pc or mac word processing
     software.  If in doubt, don't ask for this version.  This isn't for
     internet *newbies.* Better to order option 1 and spend a few minutes
     pasting them into one whole text document with your word processor,
     than to waste hours trying to figure how to deal with this option.
     This version is great for doing keyword searches and jumping around
     within the catalogue with your word processing software, if your
     normal email reading software doesn't allow this.


VERY IMPORTANT DIRECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT YOU GET A REPLY:

1.   you must call from an "unblocked number," ie. one that is not blocked
from caller id.  We are very sorry for this requirement, but our fax
software requires this before it allows an incoming fax call to connect.
If you have a blocked number, you must first unblock it.  In most cases
this means dialing *82 from a touch-tone phone (or 1182 from a rotary
phone) before you dial 1-718-227-9125.     NOTE:  If you are not sure if
your number is blocked, just try dialing our fax # normally.  If you don't
get a recording telling you your number is blocked, your number has been
transmitted and you may press the start button on your fax when you hear
the fax tone from our fax.
2.   no reply forms can be accepted by email....only via fax or smail.
3.   your form must be typewritten or printed out on your computer printer
before you fax it;  sorry, but *no* handwritten forms will be acknowledged.
If you can't find someone with a typewriter or a computer printer, we
apologize for not being able to reply to you.
4.   faxes with cover pages will be rejected.  You must send *only* the
reply form.
5.   forms not *completely* filled in will not be acknowledged.
6.   you will receive a reply within 1 business day directly from the
company making the offer via email.  Therefore you must have an email
address.  If you read this message, then you must have an email address, or
access to one, at least.   :-)
7.   your fax must not exceed 1 page in length.   Faxes of 2 or more pages
will be sensed, then auto-terminated and deleted.  Your fax goes directly
onto our 5.0 gigabyte hard drive and we must limit all incoming faxes to 1
page.
8.   all faxes must begin with:
*------------cut here/begin-------------------------------------------*
and must end with:
*------------cut here/end--------------------------------------------*
9. Any fax not conforming to this format will be sensed by our software,
then auto-terminated and deleted from the hard drive, before any human ever
gets to see it.
10. The type on your fax must be dark and legible.   If in doubt, please
print it out darker before faxing it in.  If we can't read it, we can't
reply to you or send you our FREE catalogue.     :-(
11.  If this all seems too complicated for faxing, just do it the old
fashioned way via smail!!!


WHO WE ARE:

Tempting Tear-Outs is an advertising company that brings potential new
customers to the companies they advertise for.

MORE ABOUT THE COMPANY MAKING THE FREE OFFER:

The company making the offer is a magazine subscription agency based in the
USA.  They have over 1,100 popular USA titles available to be shipped to
*any* country, including of course, to anywhere in the USA!    They offer a
FREE 1 yr. subscription to your choice of over 200 of the titles in their
catalogue to any new customer using them for the first time.       The
dollar value of the freebies, based on the subscription prices directly
from the publishers, ranges from $6.97 all the way up to $50.00!

For new customers in the USA, there is no charge for FPH (foreign postage &
handling), so the freebie is 100% free!   For new customers living
overseas, the only charge on the freebie would be for the FPH (foreign
postage & handling).

Their president has been in the magazine subscription business since 1973
and they are very customer-service oriented.   They will even help you with
address changes on your magazines, even if you move from one country to
another country.   They have thousands of happy customers in over 59
countries.

Their price guarantee is very simple:       they guarantee that their
subscription prices are the lowest available and they will BEAT any
legitimate, verifiable offer before you pay them or match it afterwards, by
refunding you the difference in price PLUS the cost of the postage stamp
you would use sending in the special offer to them, even 6 months after you
pay them, as long as it was current at the time of your offer.    Does that
sound fair?       Wouldn't it be great if everything you bought came with
that price guarantee?

Sometimes they are less than half of the next best deal out there,
sometimes just a little cheaper, but always you get the lowest rates
without having to shop around.     With 1,100+ titles on their list, they
would like to think that they have also the best selection around!

Within the USA, for their USA customers, they are cheaper than all their
competitors and even the publishers themselves.  This is their price
guarantee.         The 1 yr. freebie that you get with your first order is
completely free!

Overseas, (even after you factor in the cost of the FPH (foreign postage &
handling) and the conversion from USA Dollars to your currency), on the
average, they are generally around one-fourth to one-half of what the
newsstands overseas charge locally for USA magazines.  On some titles they
are as little as one-tenth of what the newsstands charge.  They are also
the cheapest subscription source for delivery overseas, including directly
from the publishers themselves!   Some publishers don't even offer
subscriptions overseas.........but overseas subscriptions are this
company's specialty!  They feel that magazines should not be a luxury
overseas.   In the USA, people buy magazines and then toss them after
reading them for just a few minutes or hours.  They are so cheap in the
USA!   Well, this company would like to make it the same way for their
overseas customers.  They are also cheaper than all their competitors in
the USA and overseas, including the publishers themselves!   It is also
*highly unlikely* you will find any of their USA competitors calling you
overseas, in order to offer that personal touch, just to sell you a couple
of magazines!  But that is what this company specializes in and loves
doing!     Around one-half their business comes from overseas, so they are
very patient with new customers who only speak limited English as a 2nd
language.    Subscription prices quoted for overseas consist of the
subscription price, plus the FPH.   You add the two together and that is
your total cost.   The exception is the 1 yr. freebie you get with your
first order.   On that title, you pay *only* the FPH for the 1 yr. term.

Their prices are so cheap because when you deal with them, you cut-out all
the middlemen.


HERE IS HOW YOU CAN GET MORE INFO AND GET STARTED WITH THEM:

Simply fax or smail back to us the reply form listed at the top of this
message.   We will then forward your form on to the subscription agency.
They will then email their "big and juicy" catalogue to you, in whichever
of the two formats you chose.   The catalogue is FREE and makes for hours
of fascinating reading, on its own. It includes the complete list of
freebies, a complete list of all the titles they sell, as well as detailed
descriptions on most of the titles, along with lists of titles by category
of interest and their terms of sale.

They will then give you a friendly, no-pressure, no obligation, 5-minute
call to go over how they work and to answer any questions that you might
have, as well as give you up-to-the minute price quotes on any titles you
might be considering.     They will call you in whatever country you live
in, taking the time difference into account.        As they like to
emphasize the personal touch they give to each new customer, all first-time
orders can only be done via phone, so they can answer all your questions
completely and personally.   Once you have placed your first order via
phone, you will be able to place future orders and make inquiries on your
account, get price quotes, etc., all via email, if that is most convenient
for you.

Within the USA, they accept payment via check over the phone, Mastercard,
Visa, American Express, Diner's Club and Carte Blanche.    Overseas, they
accept Mastercard, Visa, American Express, Diner's Club and Carte Blanche,
even if your credit card is a local one in local currency (that most
merchants in the USA would not normally be willing to accept).

That's our introduction of our client that we represent.   We hope that we
have piqued your interest and that you will take the next step to get their
free catalogue!   Thank you for your time and interest.

A survey of plausible scenarios for the next century:

Scenario 1 - AI Transcendence
Assumptions:
Sentient AI can be implemented by humans.
Open-ended IE is possible for such an AI.
Such an AI will be implemented before human IE becomes a major factor.
Outcome:
The AI becomes a Power, and decides the fate of humanity.

Scenario 2 - Nanotech Doomsday
Assumptions:
Automated engineering is much easier than nanotech, and will thus be
implemented substantially sooner.
Computers fast enough to design advanced nanotech will exist years before
the first general-purpose assembler is built.
Result:
The first nanotech immediately overturns our entire social/political system.
Chaos and nano-warfare probably follow.  There may or may not be survivors.

Scenario 3 - The Hard Takeoff to Singularity
Assumptions:
Automated engineering and nanotech are problems of similar difficulty, and
will develop together.
Computers fast enough to design advanced nanotech will exist years before
the first general-purpose assembler is built.
Open-ended IE is possible if you have a whole society working on it.
Result:
The first nanotech pitches almost all forms of technology into a fast
improvement cycle similar to the modern computer industry.  The first Powers
arise  within a decade - possibly much sooner.

Scenario 4 - The Soft Takeoff to Singularity
Assumptions:
Either automated engineering is harder than nanotech, or nanotech appears
before we have fast computers, or both.
Open-ended IE is possible if you have a whole society working on it.
Result:
The first nanotech is very specialized, and it matures very slowly (no
faster than the computer industry).  It takes decades to go from the first
assembler to mature nanotech, and we get to play with lots of neat toys for
awhile before we figure out how to become SIs.

Some implausible (IMO) alternatives:
If open-ended IE isn't possible at all, we get scenario 4 with no
singularity, and advanced nanotech takes centuries or millennia to arrive.

If gray goo is really easy to make, scenario 1 is the only way to avoid
getting eaten.

If sentient AI is really, really easy, we might get a variation on scenario
1 where a whole population of AIs grow into SIs as computer speeds improve.

For the record, my money goes on scenario 3, with a side bet on #1.

Does anyone want to add another option to the list?

Hold on.  7 million is their *price*, not their cost.  What that is is a
deep, dark secret, and rightly so.  7 million just happens to be about the
price where satellite companies sit up and take notice.

Personally, I'm not sure about their being able to compete in teh
satellite launch business, but I think their design is very well suited to
fast package delivery.  "When it absolutely, positively has to be in Tokyo
*yesterday*" (ain't that International Date Line great?).

Depends on what you mean by 'affected'.  If you don't want to become an SI,
or even transhuman, there are lots of potential scenarios where no one would
force you to change.  However, the people who take advantage of the
technology will be the ones running everything.

Actually, they just name ("Mediocrity Anthropic Principle") something
that I and probably everyone else has been assuming:  The Strong
Anthropic Principle doesn't force a large chance of sentient life on any
particular planet, just an awful lot of planets.

Not that I believe in the SAP - what I believe is that _given_ an
abundance of A, improbabilities up to 1/A can be invoked to explain the
existence of observers.  Call it the Improbability Anthropic Principle. 
(This works in reverse; sufficient improbabilities suggest a large
abundance generating them.  Thus, even if our solar system was
surrounded by a dust cloud, we might eventually deduce the existence of
other systems from evolutionary biology.)

What's relevant to the Great Filter Paradox is whether the abundance is
such that we'd expect lots of sentient races in our past light cone.  I
certainly get that impression.  Self-replicating chemicals may be far
more improbable without all the heavy elements, but is it really
impossible enough that NO life at ALL would exist in early galaxies? 
And we can see (= in our light cone) galaxies so old and burnt-out that
they have far higher densities of heavy elements*; why haven't the
inhabitants come knocking?

I'm not so sure the two are separable.  I have no beef with those
who /desire/ things like egalitarianism, altruism, and other such
silly things; but to actually advocate the use of force to bring
them about does indeed reflect upon one's personal values.  If one
advocates mandating irrational social policies, then one's
commitment to reason in other matters is called into question.

Einstein did not merely long for a socialist world; he actively
called for government to bring it about by force.  He can perhaps
be partially forgiven by the fact that in his day, socialism had
not yet proven itself the abject failure we see so clearly today.

I'd reverse the outcomes.  Primitive nanotech results in destabilizing
competition and wars fought with half-baked weapons (sc. 3).  Instant
omnipotent drextech lets the winner take over the world without much
fuss and even evacuate the planet in case of emergency.  Problem is, I
think nanotech will start primitive.

I honestly didn't know that Al was a looter.  That's a shame.  Are
you, though, defending him or just stating that a great mind was a
looter?  Anyone who promotes or advocates the theft of earnings for
"redistribution" is also advocating violent force against members of
society.  I fail to see the moral distinction between advocating
someone else do the looting and doing the looting yourself.  At least
the fellow looting a retail establishment has gotten off his fat ass
and done something.

I still admire Al for his contribution to science, but that doesn't
change the fact that advocation of socialism makes him a looter. 
Perhaps, I can just prefer to think that he didn't understand the full
ramifications of what he was advocating.  I'll read the paper you
quoted and make up my mind.

Boy, that really disturbs me.  

*sigh*

Being an admirer of the late Prof. Einstein, I paid this link a visit,
hoping to find a thoughtful, or at least fresh, perspective by an
incomparable intellect. Alas, I was gravely disappointed. He does little
more than repeat the standard litany of groundless assertions that had
already been discredited when he wrote the piece. The flaws are so
transparent, it's obvious to me that he never gave any real thought to the
subject.

All this article proves is that Einstein was no economist, had learned
little from political history, and was uninterested in critically examining
the assumptions he acquired from his upbringing and academic background. I
expected better from such an otherwise brilliant thinker.

As has been pointed out, whatever his stated ethical standards may have
been, he in fact favored institutionalized thuggery.

Ok.  I can buy into that, as long as those views are rational and
objective.  I find it incredible that one can have rational and
objective scientific views and completely irrational and subjective
social views.  Oh well.

If you advocate the use of violence and force to take away (steal)
that which was *earned* by an individual then yes, you are a looter. 
I see no distinction.  Wishing you had something that someone has
earned is different.  So is demanding that that person gives it to
you.  But, when you point a gun at that person's head (or have someone
else do it), then you've crossed the line and become a looter.

I don't see any grey areas.  Maybe I'm blinding myself, but I don't
think so.

We can forgive him for advocating the use of violence against the very
ones that support society (those that produce)???????  I'll have to
think very hard about that one.

Hmm.  Depend on what you mean by 'primitive' and 'advanced'.  I don't think
instant mature nanotech is probable - the computers you need to design it
can't be built without primitive nanotech or many decades of top-down
evolution.

In general, however, I think you are correct.  If we consider a range of
possible innovation speeds, there is a distinct danger zone in which
technology advances faster than our institutions can adapt, but not fast
enough to allow the inventor to solve all problems himself.  This
environment is likely to panic governments and other powerful organizations,
and has a high probability of leading to irrational, cataclysmic abuse of
nanotech.

On the high side of the danger zone, the leading power advances so quickly
that nothing anyone else does can threaten it.  On the low side the rate of
change is slow enough that the social order can adapt, or at least avoid
being suicidally stupid.

The scenarios I listed would fall out like this:

slow advance                        danger zone                fast advance
<------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------->
   <----4---->   <----3---->    <---------2--------->

I suppose we could put in a '1.5' for very fast advance, but it seems very
unlikely - if automated engineering is that easy, a seed AI should also be
feasible and we're back to scenario 1.

I don't expect you to believe anything your preconceptions won't allow you
to.

Imagine you are a uperior being.  As far above man as man is above ants.

Why would you go looking for other civilisations to interact with, when they
would be made up of (effectivley) ants with nothing to offer you?  You may
use some (as yet unknown) method of communication with similar
intelligences, or you might decide that sicne you now have a Grand Unified
Theory of Everything, there's nothing these other people could teach you and
you'd be as well off running your own ineffable experiments that don't
require you to spend aeons travelling between remarkably similar star
systems.

Socialism/Capitalism are both ethical/moral views.  Ethics is purely
emptional, based upon what one _wants_ to happen.  All right and wrong are
subjective.  If Dyson stresses (as an example) equality over property
rights, he will be more likely to be a socialist.  It's not irrational, it's
just a different moral choice that you disagree with.

ludicrous statement.  Either rape is right or it is wrong.  Either it
is ok to strangle babies or it's not.  Your argument of the
subjectiveness of morality is the biggest sham of irrational
collectivist/socialist/looters in history.

If you believe that morality is subjective then you can justify
anything at all - genocide, murder, anything!

It is either good or bad to steal from those who produce.  It is
simply bad.  Evil.  Not good.  Period.

Maybe he came to his conclusions because he never really profited from
his grand discoveries, while lesser mortals got rich selling widgets and
hitting home runs. A purely capitalistic economy would have enriched
him. Then he probably would have been a capitalist. The inequality of
the system might have simply pushed him towards socialism. Maybe he
never gave it as much thought as most assume.

You're saying burglary is ok?  Are you saying that redistribution is
not violent?  Please tell me what's rediculous about equating theft
with violence...

I know that you don't believe that men should be allowed to keep what
they earn (property), so I guess the argument is pointless.

Rare is the man who can see one false meme in his own upbringing.  Rarer
still is he who sees more than one of them.  No one can spot them all.

If we condemn Einstein because he failed to see the fallacies of the
mainstream of thought in a field he did not even practice, we are expecting
perfection.  We might as well condemn all ancient Athenians who didn't rail
against slavery, or all medieval scholars who failed to fight for women's
rights.

I'm sure future generations will see laughable fallacies and cruel injustice
in practices that we find unobjectionable, as well.  I hope they won't hold
us to your standard.

It isn't that good either, so it will likely take them at least

The danger zone begins here. Note how the internet causes panic
reactions in society? And it still grows over the span of *years*. I
think the timescale society manages to adapt lies on the order of half
a decade, maybe a decade (with variations for culture, neophilia,
planning etc), and faster growth causes irrational reactions -
including positive reactions like hype and a naive embrace of the new.

I don't think there is an upper end to the danger zone, simply because
I regard the "...and then the owners of the technology take over the
world" solution only work if they are *far* ahead of everyone. And if
there is anything we are learning from current technological
development is that the differences are *shrinking* rather than
increasing between the cutting edge groups, since they all rely on the
same pool of collective data, need to buy in know how and share
ideas. You need to postulate a radical shift in development (like
automatic AI design), and even then it is by no means clear how this
would mesh with the economic and social factors underlying the
development of the technology. And finally, taking over the world (for
whatever good reason) is nontrivial since by assumption there is
technology around that is extremely close to breaking your
power-monopoly, and if you fail to round up it *all* (including
completely non-obvious avenues of research and activity) you might get
a nasty (and possibly irrational) surprise. If omnipotence of
different kinds can pop up arbitrarily fast, you will not remain god
for long. This is an extremely unstable situation, and I would
definitely say that the danger zone never ends.

(Wow! I managed to avoid calling it a Hollywood Meme! :-)

What I, and perhaps some of the other posters, object to is not that
Einstein was partly a prisoner of the memes of his time (we all are), but
that he attempted to affect society by pontificating on a subject that, as
you say, "...he did not even practice". I suspect Einstein would have
savaged a physics paper written by someone as ill-informed about that
subject as he apparently was about economics, and rightly so. Einstein's
brilliance as a physicist does not give his opinions in other areas any
special currency.

Well, since I'm the limbic systems guy on this list, I'll try (there
are likely many others who have pieces of the puzzle).

The problem with pheromones is that they are subtle signals, and that
they have to mesh with our other psychological factors to work. The
signals from the vomeronasal organ get into the olfactory systems and
likely get mixed up with a lot of other information before affecting
the hypothalamus, amygdala and other important sites. This means that
the effect is not necessarily reliable, and likely can be
"reprogrammed" at least partially by upbringing and experiences. In
women there is even receptors that trigger depending on HLA immune
type, presumably to select for the right genetic diversity in
offspring. 

In short, all this adds up to that just dousing yourself with
androstenol and androstenone will not make the ladies swoon at you. It
will introduce a subconscious signal that *likely* suggests "Big Male"
to the limbic system, but that might not necessarily produce a
positive reaction...

Then there is the flip side: you will yourself smell a lot of
pheromones. I have heard that one perfume manufacturer actually sells
two gender-specific perfumes where the pheromones have been switched -
the male one has female pheromones. The idea is that you feel better
if you have the smell of the other sex on your skin, it suggests to
your limbic system that you have just had sex, and this will
contribute to creating wellbeing and likely a more charming
behavior. If you add the power of placebo to this, it will likely have
some effect.

I wonder how homosexuals react to these pheromones? The only things I
could find on medline were fly, worm and rat experiments, and they are
a bit too simple in this regard.

Of course, one can look at it in the other direction. A friend
suggested actually removing the vomeronasal signal, so that he could
remain more rational and less influenced by mere body chemistry. But
then again, few are as rational as him in partner choice.

It seems to me a bit of an abstract stretch to say that if one induced any 
form of radiation on one's property, one therefore had implicit absolute 
perpetual rights to to use all forms of radiation, including say neutrinos, 
gravitons, Higgs particles, etc.

Then by your preferred approach, unless you are one of the original people you 
claim the FCC stole these spectrum rights from, you seem to have no standing to 
complain.  We all seem to accept that the FCC seems to be in "possession" of 
these spectrum rights.  You just accuse them of having stole them from someone
else.  

Furthermore, even if you did represent one of these initial supposed losers of
spectrum rights, you'd need to show that these people didn't implicitly accept
the juristiction of the government that empowered the FCC.  That is, if these
people accepted that their property was not absolute, but instead subject to 
constituionally-valid government choices, then it is not clear what their 
complaint is.   Were they not adequately compensated for the "taking"?

We could burn a lot of electrons arguing about where the borders of the
danger zone fall - that's why I didn't offer any numbers.  IMO, we actually
have a zone of steadily increasing danger as the rate of change increases.
Right now society doesn't have time to fully adjust to new developments, but
we at least have time to wonder what to do about them.  More importantly,
there is time for the feedback mechanisms of free markets and various social
institutions to have some effect on the course of events.  The faster the
rate of change, the less chance there is for such forces to operate, and the
more unstable things become.

I agree.  However, you can generate a scenario where that would happen if
you mix the right assumptions together.  What we need is:

1) automated engineering is very easy
2) nanotech design is manageable
3) computers are very fast
4) nanotech is very hard to actually implement for some reason

That creates a situation where you have designs for very advanced devices
that no one can build.  The first group to get an assembler can use it to
implement those designs, giving them a huge instant jump in power.
Ordinarily we would expect other groups to duplicate the feat and catch up,
but nanotech also lets you make faster computers.  So, the leading power
whips up a huge mob of supercomputers and sets them to work designing even
better hardware.  Their computers will be on a faster improvement curve than
anyone else's, so no one can catch up until they hit the limits of what is
possible.

Now, I don't think that could actually happen, but that's because I think
assumptions are contradictory.  You can't get computers fast enough to
design smart matter and utility fog unless you are already using less
advanced nanotech to build them.  I also don't think you can design
computers more than a few generations in advance of the ones you already
have, for essentially the same reason.

  IAN: I think Einstein's thinking on economics measures
  the degree to which the masses have been "entrained" to 
  think emotionally when it comes to economics, so people 
  think more about ideal outcomes (how it should be) than 
  the scientific inquiry of WHY is it the way it is, of 
  what causes social wealth -- Adam Smith's inquiry.

  If people stop long enough to notice that places like 
  Hong Kong defined wealth expansion across the boards,
  they would see that to get the outcomes most of us
  want (overall wealth), all we need is a Taoist-
  style government that pretty much does nothing.

  Look at this statement by Einstein: "Production [in a
  capitalist society] is carried on for profit, not for 
  use." Huh?! Let's just do a little thinking: How can 
  a product in a free market be profitable if consumers
  don't think it's somehow useful to them? Uh... oh ya. 
  Not that I don't admire Einstein, but, like, geez!

Well, yes and no. Socialism is a political philosophy; insofar as political
positions embody ethical questions and solutions, you're correct about it
being an ethical/moral view.

"Capitalism" is somewhat ambiguous. Viewed as economic science
(catallactics, or market theory), it's (ideally) value-free. However, most
proponents of capitalism do include an ethical dimension in their
arguments, i.e. it's not only what works, but what's right. Nevertheless,
market freedom can be, and often is, defended on purely practical grounds
apart from ethical considerations. The same doesn't seem true of socialism
(at least not any more).

If no objective standard is possible, how are we to come to any agreement?
Fortunately, most of us are able to get along reasonably well with each
other most of the time. Why is this, do you suppose?

I'd feel distinctly uneasy around anyone who actually believes that not
conking me over the head to take my watch is just an arbitrary personal
preference.

C'mon, Samael, let's play fair.  What do you think the government is going
to do if I don't pay up?   Give me a lecture on civic virtue?

Just because our society is genteel enough to have lawyers doesn't mean the
guns have gone away.  If you lock the door and ignore the government's
agents, they will break it down, handcuff you, and drag you off to jail.  If
you try to defend yourself, they will either beat you senseless or shoot
you.  The only reason this doesn't happen more often is that most people
recognize that it is useless to put up a fight.

You may believe that the government is justified in using force to achieve
social goals, but don't tell me the force isn't there.

What "constitutionally-valid government choices"?  Does anyone really think
that RF regulation has anything to do with interstate commerce?  I certainly
don't see anything else in the U.S. Constitution that could be construed as
authorizing the FCC.

If the states want to create RF spectrum property rights, great.  If they
want to regulate radio transmissions, well, most of them are authorized to
do so.  But the Federal Government?  It has no Constitutional authorization
to be involved in such matters.

I came across this link earlier today.  It's a propaganda poster that
ought to be near and dear to all those
looters/collectivists/socialists out there.  Remember, when you
advocate the "redistribution" of wealth, this is what you'll
eventually end up with (or worse).

Suppose you set up a radio system on your property, just for personal
use, such that not much radio energy leaks onto your neighbors.  But the
guy next door is trying to build a radio telescope, and his equipment
is so sensitive that your low power transmissions interfere with his
observations.

He ought to be able to come to you and pay you not to emit radio waves of
a frequency and power level which will interfere with your observations.
I'm sure that we will all agree that this would be a legitimate contract.

Furthermore, so that he does not face the risk that a new owner of your
property will disrupt his work, he would like to make this contract pass
on to future owners.  It can be a restrictive covenant in the property
deed, so that any future owner is bound by the same restriction.  Such
covenants are commonly used and should not be objectionable.

Another way to think of this is that you have sold him the right to
use this part of the EM spectrum in this way on your property.  This
view of the transaction is compatible with the contractual approach,
I think.

However the property-based perspective offers more flexibility.  It
suggests the possibility of further selling the EM emission rights,
or packaging rights purchased from a group of people so that they
can be sold for greater value.

It seems that the view of the EM spectrum as property is consistent with
the view that people have the right to do what they want on their own
property, as long as you set up the initial allocations correctly.  Start
off with the rights in the hands of individuals, and let them sell them
as they wish.

After a short startup period, you'll end up with the same situation
you'd have today if the FCC auctioned off the spectrum, to a first
approximation.  The spectrum would be bought and sold on the basis
of economic value rather than political influence, and you'd get the
benefits of increased efficiency.

I bought & read parts of this book this last weekend.
It seems highly relevant to speculations about the economic
impact of future techs like nanotech, AI, space travel, etc.

---------------------------------------------------------
    General Purpose Technologies & Economic Growth
            editied by Elhanan Helpman 
   320 pages, Nov, 1998, MIT Press; ISBN: 0262082632

Most economists have viewed technological progress as an 
incremental process. A few have focused on the role of 
drastic innovations - those that introduce a discontinuity. 
The contributors to this volume are concerned with the 
type of drastic innovation called general purpose 
technologies (GPTs). A GPT has the potential to affect 
the entire economic system and can lead to far-reaching 
changes in such social factors as working hours and 
constraints on family life. Examples of GPTs are the 
steam engine, electricity, and the computer. The study 
of GPTs is relatively new. A universal theoretical 
framework for dealing with GPTs does not yet exist. The 
essays in this book both further our understanding of 
GPT-driven economic growth and lay the foundation for 
further developments of the available frameworks.

On the "it can't hurt to ask" theory, here's my plea:
Hire me!  (Resume at: http://hanson.berkeley.edu/vita.html)

I'm on the academic job market now, and within two months
I'll decide where I'll spend the next six years plus.  I 
just did conference interviews with 19 schools (UC Berkeley, 
Columbia U, U Michigan, UT Austin, Vanderbilt U, U Maryland, 
U Arizona, Case West Res U, U. St. Thomas, SUNY Stony Brook,
U Illinois Chicago, George Mason U, U Wisconsin Whitewater, 
Indiana U So Bend, U Mississippi, UT Arlington, U Arkansas 
Fayetteville, U No Dakota, Naval Postgrad School) and where 
I end up at will determine a lot about my research career.

Now what I'd really *love* to research is "economics of future 
technologies" (see http://hanson.berkeley.edu/econofsf.html).
However, while I have allowed myself to spend some time on 
this recently, that will soon end if I get a standard academic 
job.  My time will be filled up with teaching, family, and
building a reputation in some more established research area.  

So if you'd like to see me spend time on future economics,
help someone invent a position for me somewhere, say where
I spend half my time doing whatever they want, and half my
time following my research interests.   Yeah, it's a long
shot, but it can't hurt to ask, can it?

Agreeing to a law isn't just about agreeing to some words.  It's also about
agreeing to a process to adjudicate disputes.  If people accepted the U.S.
constitution as contraining their property, then they also accepted the 
process the U.S. constitution defined for adjudicating disputes.  That process
has clearly run its course regarding spectrum rights, and the judgement was
for the FCC.  It has even more clearly run its course regarding states rights.

The same sort of thing is going to happen in the best legal system you can
imagine.  Some people will think some legal decisions should have gone the
other way.  At some point the world ignores those complaints and moves on.

There is no certainty that a purely capitalistic economy would
have enriched Einstein.  Perhaps he would have found it easier

Because there are many seemingly objective facts about our
environment, including the fact that most of us hold
similar, though subjective, opinions about what is right
and wrong.

We have 1) and  3), at least to some degree now.  At least progress has been
dramatic in recent years, but of course will increase exponentially more in
eht future.  Design tools that allow design of chips with 0.18-0.25  micron
features is massively complex, and by necessity highly automated.  Massive
computers are being used to make more powerful computers.  This is happening
now.  I just bought a P II with 7.5 million transistors.  The design
complexity is massive, geometric data, logic, simulations, electromagnetic
models.  
2)  we are short on this one and 4) may be actually true.  So we are getting
close to the described scenario.

At any stage of technololgy you can design beyony your production technology.
Leonardo drew tanks.  I am biased, I am a HW guy, design is SW, you have good
ideas, you can make something.  In fabrication, you are up against physics,
entropy, mother nature,  and her dog Murphy.

Ordinarily we would expect other groups to duplicate the feat and catch up,

but nanotech also lets you make faster computers.  So, the leading power

whips up a huge mob of supercomputers and sets them to work designing even

This exact scenario took place in the world geopolitical/technological sphere
1940-1990.  The US dominated technology, computers, and with government
investment, technology was applied in the most advanced ways to military
hardware.

Yup, designing too far ahead is interesting but not useful.  A balance of
effort between design and fabrication is needed.

Had I said that (I didn't, but let's suppose that I did), it would have been
quite an abstract leap, I grant.  But it would have been abstract only because
nobody puts those exotic sorts of radiation to everyday use.  If we used, say,
gravitons to work our TV remote controls, you would still have to grapple with
my observation that,

>It makes little sense to say

>on my property . . . while it does over another frequency . . . .

I followed with a counter-argument, by way of example, to Robin's claim that
the FCC can establish its rights to the spectrum by mere declaration.  Then,
separately, I answered Robin's question about good title by summing up the
common law rule.  Robin replied:

>Then by your preferred approach, unless you are one of the original people
you

to

someone
>else.

No, that confounds two separate lines of argument.  Recall that I have
throughout argued *against* establishing property rights in the spectrum.  The
good title rule thus does not apply (I raised it only in an attempt to clarify
a point of law).  When you buy real property, you do not get *title* to the
spectrum used thereon.  You get the right to use chattles such as transmitters
and recievers in any manner whatsoever so long as you do not interefere with
your neighbors' like uses.  By way of analogy, your right to keep a journal
follows from your rights in paper, ink, and a private study.  You do not get
title to "journal space."  The FCC can no more claim all the spectrum than a
Federal Records Commission could claim the right to all personal notes.

That response moves too quickly from mere implied consent to "people
accepted."  For an explanation of the various modes of justification of
political and legal authority, and of their relative weights, see "Why Obey
the Law," available off my homepage.

But set aside the question of justification.  I trust that I have shown that a
good faith (if not convincing) argument exists to the effect that the FCC has
acted unjustly and unconstitutionally by claiming sole rights to the spectrum.
One does not end the argument with, "But the people implicitly agreed!"
Presumably, in a constitutional republic such as the U.S., good faith
arguments about public policy play a role in shaping the functions and scope
of the State.  So to "the people implicitly agreed . . . " I reply, ". . . to
subject FCC functions to ongoing critical scrutiny."

An AI that didn't know when it should be bored would not be much of an AI.
Boredom is a wonderful thing, when it's working properly it keeps you from
"exploring" endless loops. I would even go so far as to say that if you found a
way to give a machine good boredom detecting skills then you'd be 80%
of the way toward a true AI because then it would know the proper area to
aim its finite mental firepower at.

billy, ive sure spotted a hell of a lot of em in my own.  {8^D

many of you have patiently seen me brain barfing over launchers and
how difficult and expensive it is to climb out of this gravity well we
evolved in, but this is what got me interested in nanotech to start with.
if we admit orbit is inherently difficult and there are no royal roads

it helps greatlyif they are.  the spin rate is determined by the less dense fuel,
so one would need to drop the pressure of the denser lox across a regulator
of some sort.  i have given up hydrogen as hopeless for this reason:
the low density requires spinning almost 3 times faster with hydrogen
as you would with kerosene.  (the spin rate varies as the inverse square
root of the density of the fuel, all else equal).

> Is it because the low denity fuel requires a large diameter?

no, its because if one goes with the "spin tanks and all" scenario, one
must arrange for the moment of inertia about the spin axis to be greater
than the moment of inertia about the other two orthogonal axes, this
for max stability.  unfortunately, this causes you to have a lot of area to
push thru the wind.  this might cause the tanks-and-all notion to be
impractical.  {8-[

im starting to think you are right, but i have one more round of
calcs to do first.  i might have become too infatuated with the
notion of a launcher with almost no moving parts.  my last scenario
has a spherical lox tank with tow torroidal ethane tanks around it.

> ...slow, low pressure rotating seals aren't *that* hard.

i have an idea for rotating seals, now that you mention it,
that use laminar flow compressed air at the dynamic interface.
if i convince myself completely that the tanks-and-all notion
is hopeless, perhaps i will look into that.  spike

It's possible that by capitalist, he meant people who's only definition of
good was capital - ie those who worship money rather than using it as a
means to an end.  I'm very happy to use money as a means to an end and as a
useful tool and abstract concept.  I have a strong dislike of people to whom
the only good is money.

Again, according to my dictionary, an agnostic is one who holds no opinion
on the existence or lack thereof of god(s).

ie a-gnostic = without knowledge.


This is also what I was taught whilst studying philosophy.

Even 8 year olds?  10 year olds?  4 year olds? 15 year olds?  When does a
person know enough to relaise what effect they are having?  People don't
understand short term consequences when they are very young (very young
being an age between 7 and 70 depending on the person in question).

It is of course likely that all of these will have have erros in them
because they weren't based on the correct principle of nanothechnology
(which we will only undrestand properly when we actually get nanotechnology
working).  After all, if we understood the principles well enough during the
design phase, we';d have the bloody thing working a lotfaster.

I'm not sure that you need a minimum voting age, more a minimum voting
competency.  Ask voters to name the president, vice president and leadrer of
the opposition.  Name the country to the south of you and the last war you
had with them.  Show a general knowledge of politics.  If you're going to
play the game, you ought to know the rules.

I would think there are lots of micron-sized particles leaving our
solar system now. A gray goo capable of passive or even active solar 
sailing or of other, active means of panspermia would obviously seem 
to have lots of evolutionary advantages. Due to co-evolutionary 
pressure you can obviously get arbitrarily complex autoreplicators, 
up to the level of sentience. (As autoreplicators can't emerge
spontaneously, they will obviously have potential for advanced 
infoprocessing capabilities right from the start. Since brittle
autoreplicators are containable, the emerged autoreplicators will be
nonbrittle in respects to evolutionary optimization).

The idea of a military autoreplicator is to autoamplify by converting
organics. Anything else is just distracting bells & whistles. Whatever
is needed, will be invented by the evolution along the way.

Photovoltaics means about 1 kW/m^2 peak, and there are a lot of these
m^2 out there. However, the color of the goo is grey, not green.

And what does electrical power grid run on? Magical fairy-dust? 

Where is reconaissance, planning, production, transportation,
deployment, action analysis, all in an co-evolutionary scenario?

Non sequitur.

Why should a grey goo be disassembling diamondoid? The only reason
would seem to keep down the blue, which would require
recognition. Notice that blue is static, as autoreplicating blue
would seem to be basically undistinguishable from grey. Blue is
brittle, and more complex than grey, so it will be outperformed anyway.

Why 'shell'? This is free environment. The grey grow as a thin
layer over organical materials. Grey cannot function under anaerobic 
conditions. Of course distinct erosion pattern, or even cooperative 
behaviour could evolve, which transports oxygen actively within volume

If the capability to erode diamondoid has evolved, the capability to
thrive in unstable environments will not be long to follow.

Funny, I think the problem is at least nondecideable with our current
knowledge. My intuition even tells me that grey has a slight or even
noticeable advantage, which makes it fundamentally uncontainable once
beyond a certain autoamplification stage.

It is interesting to ponder whether there is a connection between
boredom and attention. Both aim mental resources, although the
timescales seem to be different.

	Under pure capitalism, use of ideas without compensation would be

Thats not necessarily the test. A survivalist, by definition, is trained to
SURVIVE, not to PROGRESS. Anyone's first concern in a crisis situation like
that is obviously "how am I going to make it through the day", then how am I
going to make it though this month or year". Once these survival concerns are
addressed and fulfilled, the question then becomes "how am I going to acheive
as close to a 20th century lifestyle as I can?" which is where the engineering
comes in and survivalism is far less usefull.

Combine survivialist training with engineering knowledge, and that person could
go extremely far back in time and have a decent 18th century community going
within 10-15 years. Teach some primitives written language, the scientific
method, some ethics/philosophy, and record as much as you can of what
technologies are possible and how to acheive them, and you'd have a 20th
century civilization going within a few generations

I've been looking for a CD-ROM set of that. Does anyone know if it's digitized

Why is it that its ok for someone to be a looter if they are weak, but not if
they are strong, or to be strong and opposed being looted by the weak? What
is the moral justification for such hypocrisy?

Examine the words there: "personal integrity", i.e. the integrity (i.e. the
undivisable consistent strength of the one) of the person (i.e. person =
not-society). The term implies individualism, not socialism. A socialist
would beleive in societal integrity over personal integrity, which is why
they put greater priority in the whole rather than the individual, in the
rights of the group over the rights of the individual, etc. Moreover,
integrity implies strength, so the it obviously follows that the weak lack in
integrity of some sort.

Since such a situation would only exist if with an entirely different species
than human beings, your question is meaningless. Its like positing if the sun

Actually, its a matter of proportions, obviously. A 10 ton meteor impacting a 1 ton
meteor will obviously impart such energy that peices of the second meteor which are
repelled along the path of the first meteor will have more than 3 times the
velocity of the first meteor.... which should be in excess of the sun's escape
velocity....

If you assume that the goo is actually a goo, rather than a more solid structure,
then impacts will obviously be absorbed with far less ejecta than a similar strick
on a solid structure like a ferrous or cabonacious(sp?) chrondrite meteor.

Yes. This is where we transhumanists can do a lot of good by spreading
our more useful views, and help create systems for very quick adaption
in society.

(on the other hand, fast adaption also causes fast changes - the
quicker the markets become, the more unpredictable they become).

Would they? Note that somebody has to pay for all this (by assumption
expensive and hard) research. And they will want a return on their
investment. Having the nanotech advantage would be a wonderful
investment, but they would have to divide their resources between
profiting from the breakthrough and going further. Going further is
fairly easy and cheap (by your assumptions) so most resources will be
used for applying the new technology.

There is some kind of unsaid assumption in the scenario, and that is
that this is the end of the story. But there will be a second group
doing the breakthrough fairly soon (helped by the knowledge that it is
possible and the hints they will get by looking at the first group),
and soon there will be many others with the same capabilities. Here
comes the assumption Eli and others seem to make, that the first group
will try to monopolize the technology totally. This is a rather shaky
assumption, since it assumes that we can predict exactly what the
originators do. But in reality the nanotech breakthrough in this
scenario will be part of a complex web of economics, social
interactions, politics and technology. Would the board of directors of
3M decide to take over the world, in a literal and very military
sense? What if somebody dont likes it and leaks the assembler? And so
on; interesting to think of, definitely worth writing a few sf novels
to explore it, but hardly anything you should base policy on. 

In fact, if the acceleration beyond the threshold quickly leads to the
physical limits, the difference between the first group to pass and
the others will vanish. The only thing that would remain is whether
they got other advantages, like an entrechned market position,
successfully monopolized the technology or immediately began to
develop something different the first technology couldn't give.

Another possibility is the seamless transition - Moore's law seems to
be pointing to a nanotech transition around 2020, around the same time
others predict it too. So it could just be a quiet shift in
technology.

There is an amateur program using balloons, and one using a peroxide/asphalt
hybrid motor was launched from a balloon to set an amateur altitude record just
this past year. I beleive the record was set somewhere around 135,000 feet
(about 25 miles altitude).

As for aircraft, the Pioneer Rocketplane's project, called the Pathfinder
program, will take off from a runway with the kerosene loaded, and will only be
fueled with the liquid oxygen at 35,000 feet by a specially equipped tanker
plane. The takeoff will be with two turbofan engines recessed in the wing roots
of the Pathfinder craft, and once it is fueled with LOx at altitude, it will
then fire off its RD-120 engine. This not only optimizes the use of current
technologies, with no need for development of a special balloon or ferry
aircraft, but it allows the Pathfinder craft to ferry itself from landing site
to its next launch site as a normal aircraft. I personally think that of all of
the private reusable launcher programs that this is the most likely to succeed,
provided sufficient financing.

If I was a military planner, I wouldn't trust evolution one bit. If it
evolves to penetrate any defense, can't it evolve to penetrate *our*
defense? A weapon is only useful if you can threaten *others* with it,
not if you will be destroyed by it yourself (the exception is doomsday
devices, which work by making everybody very keen on their non-use).

So the threat isn't by rational military red goo (which might still be
quite nasty) but other sources.

The problem is protection against UV; you need some kind of protective
shielding or the units will break too often. Perhaps a layer of
photovoltaics on top of the real goo? Termite goo.

Actually, this is also where the defenders have an advantage. Goo
doesn't just randomly appear (unless you really believe in the sudden
breakthrough scenario), there is a period before you meet the goo you
can plan (even without nanotech). A good defensive structure would
have the above abilities, but it is not clear that even autoevolving
goo would be able to do it (the fitness landscape has some pretty wide
deserts in this area where intelligent pre-planning can jump ahead a
lot; the goo will not be very good at planning, or the brainy nanites
will have a too low replication rate to be big threats).

Yes, the heat from reentry is mostly in the shock wave. The reason the shuttle
needs its tiles is that so much of its surface is at the shockwave. A longer
leaner vehicle will keep most of its surface away from the shockwave.

This is why I like the solid liquid hybrid motors, it allows for a very small
cross section, and the fuel provides structural support just as normal solid fuels
do. A small cross section with a dense fuel allows for a small vehicle size, and
the aerodynamic savings of the small cross section are enormous at transonic to
hypersonic speeds.

rotating seals are ok, because the pressure is generated by the centrifugal forces
of the spinning blades, so at the point where the blades and the tanks meet, you
can have a very low pressure seal, because there should be a significant vacuum
pressure inside the seal.

I disagree. Calculations are forthcoming, but basically the blue
doesn't have to be autoreplicating but could rely on a factory
production such as the one scketched by Josh at the latest foresight
conference; the replication rate will be extremely much higher if the
blue doesn't have to autoreplicate, and one can imagine a hierarchy of
immune-nodes: level 1-nodes producing lots of blue goo and throwing
them around, level 2 nodes spreading level 1 nodes very quickly, and
so on.

Blue can be extremely simple - antibodies comes to mind. If you can
just sabotage the replication of the grey, like by sti cking their
surfaces together, they will be in trouble. More complex devices,
without the need of carrying around autoreplicative capability, could
also finish grey goo a lot.

What to worry about is of course intelligently designed grey goo
intended to do a lot of damage, but I don't buy that just randomly
evolving nanites will be unstoppable. The question is rather how much
damage all this is going to do in a realistic scenario.

One kilogram of finely powdered virus crystals will overwhelm any
human immune system. But that is not the kind of threat we usually
face, and it does not emerge naturally.

In the same way a huge, diverse amount of goo is likely hard to stop,
but if we can prevent such things from emerging by dealing with the
small amounts of goo the nanoimmune world stands a chance. Most likely
the only survivable states are a nano-free world or a world with
overlapping /or bordering) immune systems of various kinds, fighting
occasional skirmishes against goo outbreaks (wild guess:
self-organized criticality of the size distribution).

Considering that women's rights was not even a recognised issue during medeival
times, but is a product of the industrial revolution of the 1800's (indeed, even
the first world women's rights convention in London had a hard time passing a
resolution for women's sufferage).

That Einstein was able to pierce the veil of propaganda in Nazi Germany (run by
a 'National Socialist Party' enough to flee very early on, but not the
propaganda of the Soviet Union, when there was far more evidence of the falsity
of the message of the Comintern, indicates a distinct amount of mental laziness.
Ayn Rand was well known when Einstein wrote 'Why Socialism?', but he was not the
only victim of socialist sympathy. Nicola Tesla, father of AC, radio, and the
induction motor, was a croatian immigrant with distinct socialist sympathies,
which did not hurt him until JP Morgan found out that he wanted to use his power
broadcasting station concepts to give energy away free, and promptly cut his
financing. Tesla made lots of money off of his inventions, despite a pathetic
lack of business savvy.

Failure to hold people to standards higher than their societal norms is asking
for regression. Einsteins weakness for socialism is merely evidence that he was
no god, but merely a man. Genius is not a constant state which one applies to
all parts of one's life. You only have to think great thoughts once to be
considered a genius by many. Keep in mind that even in physics, his "God does
not play dice with the universe" quote demonstrates that even his 'genius'
became outmoded in his area of expertise by the 1930's.

Please excplain what you mean by this?

Do you honestly believe in objective, universal standards of  right and
wrong?  If so, please state where objective unioversal standards of eright
and wrong come from and what makes them so.  You may well revolutionise a
large chunk of philosophy (I doubt it, but I'd love to be proved wrong).

He did get the Nobel Prize, did he not? That prize comes with it a cash award of
about $1,000,000.00 in today's money, which should have been around $100,000.00
back then. Not a bad return for some doodling in a patent office in one's off
hours....

Not to mention the nicely paid position at Princeton with plenty of grant money
flowing in. The grant scam is a great business to be in, where its easy to
scream poverty while caching away huge chunks, reselling old lab or field
equipment to a new grant project, that has been used in other research several
times and paid for each time).

How many plain old socialists get a chance to bend the President of the U.S.'s

Subjectivity only exists as a consequence of each individual conducting analysis
with incomplete facts, and purposely excluding commonly obvious facts that
conflict with one's prejudices, while rationalizing that denial. Both are errors
of logic.

   IAN: Not necessarily. There's a school of thought 
   that argues from libertarian axioms (or purports
   to do so) that copyright, patents, and trademarks
   are artificial-government-fiat monopolies that are 
   contrary to strict property rights.  For example,
   this libertarian school argues that to copyright 
   your book decrees that I can't arrange my property 
   (ink and paper) in a given way, and telling that 
   to me is a violation of my property rights. I'm 
   not an advocate but an opponent of that school,
   and am just noting its existence for the record.

   Suppose that a person invented (or "discovered") 
   an equation that resulted in fusion energy, would 
   they properly have a right to claim a fee from 
   any who profited from that equation? Maybe not.
   Which is not to say it wouldn't be appalling if
   the guy enriched many others and died a pauper.

this is not so michael.  imagine a stationary 1 ton meteor struck by a 10 ton
meteor travelling at 1 km/sec.  imagine that these meteors are made of a
substance that is perfectly elastic, so that no kinetic energy is lost in the
collision.  after collision, the 1 ton meteor travels away at close to 2 km/sec.
now let the impacting meteor get arbitrarily large.  the 1 ton meteor's velocity
approaches 2 km/sec after impact, but cannot exceed 2 km/sec, regardless
of the size of the impacting 1 km/sec meteor.

if this is not obvious, look at the situation from the point of view of the
large meteor.  it sees a perfectly elestic small meteor coming down at
1 km/sec.  after impact the small meteor bounces back up at 1 km/sec.
the smaller meteor cannot bounce away faster than its original velocity
wrt the larger one, even as we cannot create an elastic ball that bounces
higher each time it hits the floor.  too bad for us.  {8^D

i will back pedal on the original statement however.  a meteor could punch
material out of the sun's gravity well, if the meteor is going fast enough to
start with.  its mass isnt the critical factor, its velocity is.  spike

Objective universal standards of right and wrong are based upon the observed
laws of nature. Man is not separate from nature (despite how much
subjectivists would like to claim) and is bound by its laws. These laws are
not subjective. Some are based on relativity, but are so at macro scales far
beyond the usefullness of society. While due to relativity, there is some
subjectivity in the macro universe, causality is not broken except in the
heart of a singularity. The whole of human civilization exists in such a
narrow range at low end of the scale that using physical relativity to justify
moral relativism is merely a form of cargo cultism.

I have no desire to revolutionize a large chunk of philosophy which merely
exists to justify the self indulgent moral relativist looter mentality of the
intellectually lazy baby boomer generation.

Here's a good test:  If the person in question is aware enough of
consequences to want to press charges against you for using 
force to prevent their own drinking, then they are old enough to
drink.

This has the interesting property that it works for everything 
else, too (like smoking, driving cars, etc), and would achieve
the desired result that usually only those people who really
cannot understand would be kept "safe".

An idea is not a "thing", and cannot be property without
coercive enforcement of the monopoly.
I agree that Einstein would probably have prospered; I just
don't think that pure capitalism will include property rights
in other people's minds.

Okay, well if you actually meant that deconstructionism ins't valid in a

The laws of nature can show what happens in certain circumstances, they
contain no such things as morals.  Morals are entirely an invention of man
to justify their wants and feelings.

>Man is not separate from nature (despite how much subjectivists would like

Of course not.  Nothing is seperate from nature.  Nature is everything -
everything that is or can be is natural.

These laws are not subjective. Some are based on relativity, but are so at
macro scales far

I wasn't referring to physical relativity (either on a quantum or near light
speed basis) more on the fact that ones morals are subjhective - merely ones
wants and feelings.  I do not want to be killed, I do not want you to take
away my com,puter, I want you to not lie to me, etc., etc.

If you have some hard data on how to extract right and wrong from nature,
I'd still be interested to see it.

The majority of extropians on this list are in favour of perfect human
inviolability (ie people never have the right to affect another person
without their permission - except in self defence).

I'd be interested to hear peoples opinions on the rights of animals.  Do you
believe that animals have no rights and can be ignored, that animals have a
sliding scale of rights based upon their intelligence, or some other system?

All of the following is IMHO.  The value judgments here are my own and
might not agree with those of the list-owner or its other members.  No
insult is intended to anyone.  Here goes...

I recommend to reduce the amount of noise on the list, we adopt two
simple rules, which can be automated so that no one need moderate
the list.

The fist is a post per day per member maximum.  This could be, say,
three posts per day.  By doing this, I think people who chime in on
everything would choose what to respond to more wisely.

A potential problem with this is people who use multiple email addresses
(like me, but not to this list:) would be able to circumvent this rule.  I
think list-owner intervention might stop this, though I would hope list
members would obey the rule without such.

The second is a limit on the size of each post.  This enforce trimming
posts, so that members don't quote the whole post, but only the part
they wish to respond to.

A problem with this is that combined with the post per day limit, the
length of a member's daily contribution would be very limited.  Even
so, if someone has something lenthy to post, he or she could post
a (temporary?) URL with the material or ask members to email him
or her for copies of it.

I also suggest that if we do plan to adopt either or both of the above
rules, we do so for a probationary period just to make sure that list
quality and participation don't drop.  I wouldn't want to make the list
barren by enforcing such rules.  A probationary period of one month
might be good, then we can poll members to see if they think quality
has gone up or down.

Cheers!

Daniel Ust

P.S.:  Someone might have suggested the above before, but, if so,
I do not mean to steal her or his ideas.

pods are.  This gets rid of the need for intake shutters and eliminates the
structural weakening caused by mounting the jets in the wing roots. (Remember
how the early British jet designers were anamoured of engines in the wing root
-- don't see much of that now . . .)

We should start a bet on this. (Actually, the X-Prize folks have.)  My money's
on the Roton, although I think both Pioneer and Kistler will make it soon
after. Is this a great time, or what?

You are asking for something we don't have for anything *else*
that we accept as objective, such as the relative strengths of
electromagnetism and gravity.  Where does *that* "come from"?
It is true that there is no universally accepted theory of morality
yet, but such a thing might be possible, right?

I tend to agree - armed rebellion tends to just produce new leaders out of
the rebels (I can't think of any situation where someone has destroyed a
government and then instantly rteplaced it with themselves).

Telling people you don't understand the concept of government sounds like a
better response:

"So, you mean to tell me that just because you wear that uniform, you get to
tell me what I can do in the privacy of my own home?  Are you sure?"

"So I'm allowed to ingest some chemicals, but not others???  Doesn't sound
terribly likely."

"So these people just take 40% of my money whether I liek it or not?  I
don't remember signing anything that said _that_ in it!"

And so forth.  Don't rebel against the government, just deny it exists.  If
you just treat each member of the government as a separate person who is
trying to do things to you (it's their free will to go along with it or not
after all), you may even get your point across.  You could even point out
that "I was just following orders" didn't work at Nuremberg, so you don't
see why it should work now.

(BTW - I personally like some form of government, but i can (just)
understand that some other people don't.)

Nicely and succinctly put. In my mind, the basics are these: socialism
is unlikely to work in the long term because its primary means is force.
Assuming that some intelligent people, when forced, do things that they
would not otherwise do, it follows that a socialist government sometimes
forces intelligent people to behave unintelligently. Assuming
intelligence is better than stupidity, the more people who are forced to
behave unintelligently means more people doing stupid things. That
stupidity is undesirable is a personal a priori. 

However, and this *may* be something that occurred to Einstein, the
weakness of this line of thought is that some people aren't that
intelligent. In fact nearly all people aren't geniuses. Einstein may
have been hoping that the intelligence of a rule-making body might be
greater than the combined intelligence of most people. Today, we can see
that modern democracies don't seem to be attracting the best and the
brightest to government (how many politicians do we have here? ;), but
it remains to be seen whether government is dumber than most people. 

Anyway, regardless, it's a stupid idea to force intelligent people to do
unintelligent things. All intelligent people should be free. But it is
also the case that unintelligent people can be forced to do intelligent
things. I'm sorry, but until we have some foolproof method of deciding
who's who, it's better to let them all do what they want, with the hope
that intelligent people can figure out how to reach a Singularity
quickly, so we all can be intelligent.

A rub:

Who am I talking about when I say 'intelligent people'? Few people are
intelligent enough to ignore their memetic script entirely and reason
from first principles, and hardly anyone (no one?) is intelligent enough
to ignore their genetic script entirely. This may be one of the commonly
obvious facts that Mike was talking about. An hypothesis: all incorrect
facts are either genetic or memetic, often both, but never neither. If
'intelligence' can be defined (for the moment) as one's actual or
potential ability to know what is the case, then anyone suffering from
genetic or memetic imperatives (which deflect them from actual or
potential knowledge of what is the case) is unintelligent to some
degree. This arguably includes every last bit of pink goo.

The most unintelligent reality (assuming human life) occurs where no one
can ignore their memetic or genetic script at all. Here we are
guaranteed, assuming that some of the facts known are incorrect, to be
unable to assess what is the case. In this situation, there is no
possibility of anyone changing their mind about anything, even if the
apparent idea is perfectly true. I know that I have changed my mind on a
few things in my lifetime, so this is not the world we live in. 

The most intelligent reality occurs where everyone can ignore their
genetic or memetic script as necessary or desired. In this case we would
expect a convergence over time toward agreement on what is the case,
maybe even quickly. The advent of AI/neurohacks will surely speed this
up as the ratio of augments to gaussians increases. But today, this may
or may not be happening, so unlike Liebniz I will not suggest this is
the best of all possible worlds.

One nice thing about transhumanists is that we (I?) understand
transhumanism as an evolving world-view, ready to be modified or changed
as the facts roll in. There is a memetic flexibility to varying degrees
among transhumanists that I see missing in many of the people around me
who purport to be intelligent. However, what about (for the sake of
symmetry) 'genetic flexibility'? I don't mean changing our genes just
yet, I mean letting memes rule genes as much as possible. Memes are
arguably much easier to acquire and get rid of than are genes. We have
these genes that tell us to want happiness and pleasure, to avoid
sadness and frustration, and to compete with each other. We don't have
to use these genetic imperatives as the starting point for our
philosophies. In fact, I would argue, if we do it without thought, we
are just being unintelligent. We are hindering our actual or potential
ability to know what is the case. 

One thing that does seem apparent to me is that a lot of people do use
genetic imperatives as the starting point for philosophies, and I'm only
speaking of people who have something that can be called a 'philosophy.'
The rest just live. A good-sized chunk of Western philosophy, from
Epicurus and Lucretius, to Hutcheson, Bentham and Mill, assumes
happiness as part or parcel of the 'good.' I see this need for happiness
as a biological limit that needs to be overcome in order to know what is
the case. Of course, it may be that happiness is indeed the good, but it
must be rational to think so. If it is rational then it can be
demonstrated logically. Otherwise, one is merely thinking what cannot be
otherwise thought.       

And this has at least one implication for views of posthumanity. Given
no genetic pressures, and near-perfect memes, what will a posthuman do?
We have no idea what it is like to exist without genetic pressures, and
we have no idea what perfect memes are. In fact, logic itself may not be
sufficient to know what is the case. Anything not logical is illogical
so would the posthumans, in order to know what is the case, think
illogically? 

It makes my head spin.

Perhaps I was unclear.  Let them press charges, if they wish.
I can *threaten* all I like, but actually choosing to do it (which is
what I meant by "want to" above) is another thing.  Most kids
will press charges only once, and will probably drop charges
as soon as they see the consequences.  Then it won't happen
again unless they are serious, and they'll *understand* what
liberty can cost (in this case, only a comfy place to crash and
the support of parents, but you get the idea).

>How do you know if they actually understand?

I don't.  Of course, I don't know if *you* understand,
and I know many people whom I work with who don't
think about consequences, and are less responsible 
than many 10-year-olds.  After some point, people
either get it or don't, but I think that inducing the trauma,
however trivial in the big picture, of seeing their parents
or big brother/sister in court, on the opposite side, will
help many become more responsible and thoughtful who
otherwise might not be.  

>It's a tricky situation, most people will shy away from making children

Yes.  My position is simply that people (children included) are
responsible when they choose to be, or when no one else is
willing to be responsible for them any longer.

We had quite a discussion of this subject here (or was it on the old
"Transhumans" list?) a couple of years ago.  You might try hunting (ugh) in
the archives. 

I think there are two questions here: (1) Do animals have "rights" and (2) How
should we behave toward the natural environment.  I've written a little on the
latter subject.  You can find a brief discussion of one take on "extropian
environmentalism" at

      http://users.aol.com/gburch1/exenv.html

As for the former, one first has to have a clear idea of what the term
"rights" means.  I find it hard to conceive of a "right" without an entity
capable of asserting that right, so I don't find it useful to speak of
"rights" in connection with animals that can't at least let out some kind of
squeak of protest.  However, with that first squeak comes some minimal
"rights".  Ultimately, though, I agree with the second alternative you
indicate, i.e.a "sliding scale" of rights based on the sophistication of
mental apparatus and the level of self-awareness.  On this scale animals like
primates and cetaceans rank pretty high.

Yes, I'd agree with that.

I would say that entities are either persons or property, and that
the difference is that persons choose to be responsible.  I don't
have any problem with a sliding scale, but it should be an
individual decision, not imposed from outside.  That is, if the
parent or owner is willing to agree to the demand, a child or
pet should be able to insist that he, she, or it is *not* eating 
that stuff, but continue to be irresponsible (i.e. not a person, 
legally) in other ways.

Hmm, I can respond to an opinion on Dyson, or the comment about
singularities, or the one regarding new methods of uploading - but not all
of them!  Which one is more important!  Damn!  I already replied to a post
this morning, so I can't reply to this one that's just arrived in response
to it!

I try to do this, but frequently (especially in a cogently argued post)
there is not enough context unless you include several layers of argument
back to the original post

I'm not sure what the problem with list verbiage is.  I would like to try
and keep subject lines relevant when topics change during conversation (so
people can ignore those threads they aren't interested in), but I'm
interested in seeing as many opinions as possible, so I don;t see a problem
with many posts.  Similarly with emails, I'd prefer that each one was long,
but stand-alone (so that when it arrives I can read it as a single argument
and not have to go back through my deleted folder to try and find the email
it's a reply to in order to understand it).

I do think that sometimes this sort of thing might work better as a
newsgroup (we do appear to have the volume) and if I had a permanent
connection to the net (as soon as ADSL comes in) I would run a news server
with a couple of news groups on it.

Comments from the floor (walls, ceilings, etc.)?

So it seems that if we were to find a definition of "good" you would
accept the possibility of an objective morality?
Would an example of something that *everyone* considers "good"
do, in the absence of a formal definition?

Once we were agreed upon a definition (or example, per above)
for "good", any such theory could be tested to see whether it
produced more "good", no?  So this problem reduces to the 
previous one.

I explicitly said otherwise.  I said that the naive people at Foresight
will publish their breakthroughs and that someone else will try to
monopolize the technology totally.  Does the US embargo prevent Saddam
from visiting Foresight's Web site?

The term "naive" is strong.  I began using this term when, during a
debate on red goo vs. blue goo, I pointed out nobody had proposed any
sort of active shield that would stand up to nuclear weapons, and
someone said, quote, "That's not fair."  Fair?  Whoa.  "I never thought
of that", says the Universe, and everyone comes back to life.  I suppose
that dropping 20 megatons on an undefended city is fair.  Fact is,
offensive technology is running far enough ahead of defensive technology
to blast civilization right now, fair or unfair, and I think the problem
will only get worse.  An honest assertion that active shields can stand
up to fusion weapons is one thing.  Pretending that nobody will try to
use nanotech for military attack and world domination is naive.

  IAN: Most humans find the mass murder and 
  exploitation of animals to be very enjoyable 
  and profitable, and therefore find it "good."

  But advances in technology could be the best
  things for animals. For example, one day tons
  of meat could be grown from one square inch of 
  meat, thus meat could be acquired without murder.

 You certainly have an incentive under current law, and a slightly greater
incentive if shareholders are fully liable, to evaluate GM's competence.
But changes in your liability limits aren't likely to dramatically alter
the optimum strategy for reacting to those incentives.

>were the law, believe me that I would never put another dime into the equity
>market and I would advise my clients to also refrain from doing it.

 No, you would be perfectly comfortable with equity investments in such a
legal system, because you could achieve virtually the same risks and rewards
as under the current system simply by buying equities and simultaneously buying
the corresponding put options with a strike price of zero. In practice, most
people would find they could live with the risks even without buying the puts.
 If you look carefully enough, you will see that current law assigns more
liability than most people assume. For example, if a company that pays out a
dividend which later turns out to cause it to default on a debt, shareholders
can be liable (I suspect up to the amount of the dividend). Also, when the
Bank of United States collapsed in 1930, shareholders were asked to pay
some money to help pay off depositors (I'm not sure if this was justified
by dividends that had been paid to shareholders, and at any rate few
shareholders paid other than those who were depositors and had it deducted
from their deposits.)

 While I assume that you would be allowed to argue your own case,
it would be more efficient to accept whatever result GM's lawyers are
able to get.
 Brokers usually keep good enough records that enough of the stockholders
would be tracked down at tolerable costs, but the costs of transferring
money from stockholders who don't have enough readily seizable liquid assets
are probably reason enough to avoid this kind of system.

An atheist may deny that there is a god, but this isn't necessary. a-theism
= lacking theistic belief. If you lack a belief, it doesn't necessarily
follow that you deny the existence of the thing involved in that belief.
Someone who has never heard of the idea of a "god" would be an atheist. An
atheist could also be someone who sees no reason to believe (lack of
evidence), but doesn't necessarily think that they have sufficient grounds
for denying the belief.

Dictionaries are often poor at clarifying these theoretical matters, and
usually give several different definitions. I don't dispute that many
people may use the terms this way and so these definitions are in the
dictionary. But they are poor definitions.

As you note, an agnostic is one without knowledge. Now, logically, that
does *not* imply one who holds no opinion on the existence of a god. Many
people have beliefs and opinions without knowledge. Believing on the basis
of faith is an example. Most religious beliefs are really religious
agnostics -- they believe, but they lack knowledge. (Very very few
believers really believe because of some empirical or logical argument. I
know this not only from general experience, but from having taught numerous
classes in Philosophy of Religion. The rare individual who genuinely
believes there is god because of some argument such as the Cosmological or
Design argument, is not an agnostic, since they can claim to have grounds
for knowledge. I would claim that their arguments are defective, but at
least they would be using reason, not faith, and so can claim to know.)

Agnostics come in weak and strong forms. A weak agnostic says they do not
know if there is a god. Perhaps they haven't reached a conclusion yet, or
they are interested in thinking about it. A strong agnostic claims that
they *cannot* know, since if there is a god, it would be outside the realm
of empirical experience.

A point that far too few appreciate.  Happiness is a state that
theoretically occurs when all problems are solved; happiness is not
necessarily the best way to solve problems.  From my personal experience
I can only say that there is intelligence in sorrow, frustration, and
despair; but presumably other "negative" emotions have their uses as well.

I have a story on the boiler where a bunch of immortal uploaded (but not
mentally upgraded) humans burn out their minds like twigs in a flame
over the course of a mere thousand years of happiness, for the very
simple reason that human minds are no more designed to be immortal and
happy than human bodies are designed to live to age three hundred and
withstand nuclear weapons.

Another point, grasped so easily by this one, impossibly elusive to
almost everyone else.  Yes, the qualia of pleasure are the most
plausible candidate for the ultimate good that I know of - but you have
to assign a rational probability to that, not assume it because it feels
good.  Happiness may be good, or it may be irrelevant; and the
possibility that it is good does not mean it is the only possible good.

Cease thy disorientation and consider this:  That the logic we know is
only an approximation to the truth, as the hard rationality of Euclidean
space was only a superb but untrue physical theory.  I think that our
evolved logic holds only as a high-level description of most of our own
space, but not for anything deeper, such as the laws of physics or
consciousness or the meaning of life.  That's what I mean when I talk
about non-Turing-computability, and I believe it because logic
disintegrates into self-referential observer-dependent definitions when
you try to reduce it to basic units.  In other words, I wound up with
basic elements of cognition rather than mathematics.

There are certain circumstances under which SIs might be illogical, and
it is enough to make my head spin, and these are they:  If the logical
thing for SIs to do is wipe out the mortal race that gave them birth,
and the mortals can perceive that logic, they will not give birth to the
SI.  It would therefore be to the SI's advantage not to be visibly bound
by that logic, to be illogical.  However, once the SI is created, it can
do whatever it wants; it cannot influence the mortal reasoning used, so
how can it be bound by it?  However, the mortals know that, so whatever
illogic the mortals think the SI can use would have to transcend it.

Ah, Singularity analysis, where Occam's Razor doesn't work, logic is
mutable, and bargains run backwards in time.

As would I, of course -- but the Devil is in the details.  That is, as
David Friedman points out, the tricky part is defining what counts
as "to affect another person."  Friedman takes (what I believe is) 
an intuitionistic approach, and suggests that the threshold falls 
somewhere between shining a flashlight at them and shining a 
laser beam, but that's an awful lot of room.  I'm not an intutionist, 
although (per Bruce Ackerman's comments in _Social Justice in
the Liberal State_) I have a lot of sympathy with *libertarian* 
intuitionism; my suggestion is to use the Principle of Reciprocity.

I agree with you about how to handle sliding scales, but it
doesn't deal with the question of what happens when an animal,
child, or adult wants full rights but others don't agree.

Certainly it does.  If any entity wants full rights, and expresses
that desire, it should have them.  I fail, however, to see how an
"animal" (as differentiated from a person) could desire full rights.
If an entity can so desire, then I would say that it is a person.

        That is a tough question.  I think that domestic animals such as
dogs, cats, cattle etc. could be considered "property" of a sort.  As a
general rule, domestic animals are bought for a price and treated in
whatever way the owner wishes to treat them.  Most of the time it is in a
decent and humane fashion, though there are certainly exceptions.  If the
animal is treated well, it will provide years of enjoyment --a good
investment.  And, like any kind of "property," if it is treated poorly,
then it will have less usefulness --poor return value.

        It seems that, compared to humans, most animals have only a minimal
ability to reason with and comprehend events, and are ultimately unable to
assert themselves in any non-physical way.  Furthermore, animals are either
dependent on humans (domestic) or are predators or prey.  If they are
predators and they attack, there is little choice for a human but to defend
his life...if this means killing the animal, so be it (many on this list
would not hesitate to kill another human in the same situation.)  But that
is the nature of *any* animal --humans included.  Survival of the fittest.
By attacking, the animal has temporarily revoked its basic right to
life...it has exposed itself to the (often necessary) risk of being killed
to survive.  As for prey such as cattle etc., the same is true.  A cow has
the ability to kill a human if provoked, though a cow's disposition is
usually placid.

        The crux of the matter is that there is no real need for a human to
kill an animal unless it is for food, or out of protection.  Animals have
their own "rights" which are shades of those possessed by humans: territories,
nourishment, procreation, survival.  Unless an animal is domestic
--property-- or game --prey-- then the way they deal with their "rights"
should be within the species and not on a human scale.

I have a problem with this, rooted in the difference of effect possible
between individuals and large corporations.  If a factory decides to
pump their toxic waste into a waterway or aquifer, is it really either 
proportional tit-for-tatness or even within the realm of feasibility for
all the affected individuals to shit on the factory's land?

  IAN: The desire for full rights is expressed by animals
  in their efforts to avoid pain and physical harm/death,
  and in their making of claims to physical property.

  One could not use force to subdue an animal in order to 
  kill it and also claim it never asserted a right to life.

Samael, please explain how you can, in good faith, follow a philosophy
which can be construed to justify anything.  Your subjectivist
philosophy implies that it may, under certain circumstances, be
morally okey dokey to nuke a newborn in a microwave.  Hey, there's no
wrong or right!  We can do anything!

I'm not a philosopher and I have no grand justification of objectivism
other than the fact that your subjectivism can justify all of what
most of us consider evil in the world - genocide, murder, rape, child
abuse, etc etc.

Generally, shareholder liability is capped to equity investment.

I did not see the initial points in this argument but limited liability is a
hallmark of the corporate form.  There are significant disadvantages to the
corporate form to partially balance this limited liability advantage.  The
most significant is double taxation on corporate earnings.  Corporations (at
least under subchapter C) are taxed on their taxable income and shareholders
are taxed on dividends distributed by the corporation.  In most situations
this state of affairs amounts to an effective tax rate of 61% on corporate
earnings.

Additionally, the corporate form is not a device for committing crimes and
avoiding responsibility.  The corporate form allows for a large number of
investors to combine their capital without the fear of significant vicarious
liability for the actions of the group or of individual shareholders.  If a
corporation is found to be a device to perpetrate crime then the corporate
veil will be pierced.  In closely held corporations (corporations with a few
large shareholders), the corporate veil is often pierced when a
minimally-capitalized corporation incurs signficant liability.  This is the
hallmark feature of limited liability entities.  The firm I work for is a
limited liability partnership.  This choice is not designed to allow
partners of the firm to avoid liability.  Instead, it is a choice that
allows only the partners responsible for a situation where the firm incurs
signficant liability to be liable for those sums.  I certainly do not want
to become liable for what a less-than-scrupulous partner in Mauritius
decides to do.

Theodore Drange has an excellent essay where he "unweaves" atheism and
agnosticism.  Some "flavors" of atheism are as dogmatic as theism.  Drange's
essay entitled "Atheism, Agnosticism, and Noncognitivism" can be found at
http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/definition.html

Drange defines the different viewpoints on the question of God (or any other
god) in relation to the proposition "God exists".  For example:

"An atheist is someone who allows that the sentence [i.e., "God exists"]
expresses a proposition and who classifies the proposition as false or
probably false.

A theist is someone who allows that the sentence expresses a proposition and
who classifies the proposition as true or probably true.

An agnostic is someone who allows that the sentence expresses a proposition
and who grants that he/she knows what the proposition is, but who is
noncomittal about its truth or falsity on the grounds of insufficient
evidence.

A noncognitivist is someone who declares that the sentence does not express
any proposition at all."

Seeing your above example, I noticed you could've trimmed words

I still believe we should try my suggestions, even if only for a few weeks.
After that, we can keep (one or both of) them or go back to the old way
of doing things.  Such a brief trial would, I think, give us a chance to see
if quality goes up or down without doing much damage if the latter.

Of course we can do anything.

Only our meme systems stops us from doing these things.

Your meme system defines some acts correct and some incorrect.
The correct behaviour according to your meme system it labels "right".
The incorrect behaviour according to your meme system it labels "wrong".

Other humans may have other meme systems that define some behaviours
"wrong" which your meme system defines "right" and vice versa.

A clash of meme systems occurs.  Wars have been fought to decide memes
(Jahve vs Allah, Catholics vs Protestants, Free Market vs State Capitalism,
etc. ad nauseam).

Cultures which value humans who work as concubines highly have no problem
with prostitution.

Cultures which consider consentual sexual activities the correct behaviour
between adults and children have a lesser "child abuse" problem (defining
it as violence).

By giving the same act different names (such as "murder", "execution" ,
"slaughter" and "war") our meme systems makes us do things others find
abhorrent.  As an example you might wish to read the memoirs of Rudolf
Hss, "Commendant in Auschwitz", in which he describes how he and his
collegues self-sacrificingly fought to remove the undesirables. His meme
system differs considerably from yours and you will probably find his acts
abhorrent, but seen through his meme system it was the logical thing to
do.

The Christian crusades seen through the Muslim eyes were a genocide.

The list goes on and on.

I suggest rational thought to dynamically decide which meme systems have
the best merits in a specific situation as well as in a longer perspective.

The postulates for such a thought system should be specified explicitly
and why they have been selected.

Um, how exactly do you decide what "best merits" are without a meme
system?  Undoubtedly the Catholic meme system holds that it is the best
meme system for all possible situations.

> The postulates for such a thought system should be specified explicitly

Ah, but in _my_ meme system, rather than selecting the _best_ merits,
you should select the _worst_ merits; and moreover, explicitly
specifying postulates is a terrifying crime.  Also you're supposed to
drop napalm on your local K-Mart.

And what do you mean, "why they have been selected"?  One meme system is
as good as another.  Explanation implies some way of choosing between
meme systems, that one meme system is objectively right and the others
are wrong.

im with samael on this.  i dont follow the politically oriented posts much on

Since humans and transhumans consider ourselves the more advanced of the
species, and the question of "rights" which we, as a species, understand
the meaning and consequences of, animals are not privy to this question and
cannot openly debate their rights.

So, I think your question is one of our *ethics* and *conscience of
actions* in giving consideration and respect to animals outside our species.  

Since most humans and transhumans have pets living with them, (we may own
legally and are responsible for them, but we don't own our pets as
"objects" like living room chairs), it our ethical choice to give our pets
respect and consideration for their well being.

We now can afford to be vegetarian, and the foods produced these days for
vegetarians are substantial and contain the necessary nutrients, we no
longer need to hunt and kill animals for food.  Regardless of meat eaters
excuses that there are farms that breed animals for food and that is their
purpose and justify this as necessary for human nutrition, I have
difficulty in understanding the defense.  The cow has nerve endings and
feels pain.  The cow also reproduces and cares for its young.  The look of
horror on the cows face when it is sent to the slaughter house is a vision
I try not to draw up from my memory bank.

The sport of killing animals for fun, not for food, does still occur and is
legal, unless the animals is a protected species.  This type of sport is so
foreign to me that I am deeply saddened by this type of activity and
represents a sub-human psychology in killing life just for fun.

Thus, to answer your question, I believe that animals are not cognizant of
rights.  They are aware of their well being because of their heightened
senses and they themselves have innate boundaries for their own survival.
Pets are under the owner's protection and he or she is the guardian of the
animal.  The human and transhuman have an ethical responsibility to
consider what the animal needs and to provide it as best she/he can.  There
is indeed a sliding scale based of how humans and transhumans view animals
which is a hierarchy (based on such things as: intelligence, cuteness,
sensuality, strength, or storybook characteristics)  imposed on them by us
and also by nature.

"Happiness" is one of those fuzzy terms than covers a range of phenomena.
So I'm not exactly going to disagree with you, because I might agree
depending on just what you mean. It strikes me as either wrong or
misleading to say "Happiness is a state that theoretically occurs when all
problems are solved". For many, happiness tails off when all problems are
solved. For many of us, certainly me, happiness of one important kind,
results is embodied in that "flow" state when you are absorbed in tackling
difficult (but not too difficult) problems.

Perhaps you will disagree with the above, though I doubt it. If so, perhaps
we can use a more precise vocabulary. "Happiness" can refer to pleasure,
joy, ecstacy, satisfaction, enjoyable engagement. "Pleasure" itself can
refer to quite a range of things, from passive enjoyment (watching a good
movie, absorbing solar radiation), to active physical and intellectual
pleasures.

Personally, my experience seems to be the opposite of yours, Eliezer. I am
most productive and intelligent when happy--that is when actively engaged
in creation, production, and enjoyment. I do think an important issue for
transhumans is what kinds of moods we should want to engineer. Maybe one of
the sessions at EXTRO 4 will focus on this.

Onward!

In the context of wishing to become a posthuman superintelligence you would
wish to avoid meme systems that told you "avoid medical help and die a
natural death since Moloch the Great wants that".

When you select a meme system you should take into account the ramifications
of adopting the meme system.  After you have done it, you will find it much
harder to change from it.

As a hypothetical example of why we select the rule of avoiding killing:

"If we adopt the meme system that we should avoid killing then we need not
put lots of resources on avoid being killed (cf. Bosnia).  Therefore, we
should avoid killing."

I see.  So, in other words, you're walking a totally predetermined
trajectory where your current meme system determines the meme system
you'll adopt next.  (As adjusted for your innate instincts, of course.) 
Your walk takes into account no sort of objective right or wrong
whatsoever, just your current set of prejudices.  If your meme system
told you to adopt a meme system that told you to nuke Cincinatti, you'd
basically have no defense.  If you'd been born a worshipper of Great
Moloch, you'd stay that way until the end of time.  You don't claim that
the truth has anything to do with what you believe, so why should I lend
credence to your beliefs, why should I think your beliefs are covariant
with the truth?

You could do anything, kill me or kiss your worst enemy, and deny that
reasoning has anything to do with it.  It appears as if your meme system
makes you a sentience to avoid, maybe even to terminate with extreme
prejudice.  Thank you for the warning.

But even if it is most of you (us?) it is still not objective. I think it
is quite likely that Hitler and other fellow nazis of the time would have
agreed to genocide, murder happens relatively frequently so i'm assuming
there are is a sizable (0.001%?) chunk of the population that doesn't find
murder to be evil.  Rape, i might have even talked to some people that
agree with this form of conduct, and about 15% of parents worldwide seem
not to be offended enough with child abuse to stop practising it (this is
a wild guess/extrapolations from local statistics/rumours/easily
memorisable slogans ("1 in 8, etc") but even if this is out by an order of
magnitude, which i'm pretty sure it's not, it is still a huge amount of
people).  So according to objective morality, do these people not exist?  
are they explainable as noise in the data?

Objectivity does not imply universal agreement.  Evolution is no less an
objective fact because there are sizable populations who violently
disagree that it is true.  While I do not consider myself an objectivist,
I do not believe that objectivity can be established by vote.

The Oxford Companion to Philosophy likewise says "Atheism is 
ostensibly the doctrine that there is no God." This seems to be the 
common way the term is used, and you get it if you parse 
atheism: (a-the)-ism.

> As you note, an agnostic is one without knowledge.

The Companion states: "Agnosticism may be strictly personal ond 
confessional -- 'I have no firm belief about God' -- or it may be the 
more ambitious claim that no one ought to have a positive belief for 
or against divine existence." So this is about belief, not knowledge.

If you define an agnostic as one without knowledge about God, it 
follows that there does not exist any agnostics (since knowing that 
P implies that P is true), so that is a bad definition and not in 
agreement with common usage.

I used to say that I was an atheist, but I've changed my mind and now 
I'm just an agnostic. This is partly because of the possibility that 
our world is a simulation; the posthumans running the simulation 
could well be said to be gods. There is also the possibility 
that all possible worlds exist; then gods would exist since there are 
gods in some possible worlds. Or if the universe is spatially 
infinite, which it is on the simplest topology if it is open (which 
it seems to be) then random fluctuations should lead to the 
existence of godlike physical creatures somewhere (but would these 
be real gods?). And there is the possibility that there might be a 
kind of neoplatonistic god, a "creative principle" which might 
explain why the world exists (though I think that looks highly 
problematic).

samael, i was a vegetarian for about 7 yrs (ages 15 to 22) and now i
am seriously considering returning to that diet.  first i must resolve this
issue: cattle and swine are slaughtered in the prime of their lives to
provide humanity with victuals, however, if we did not devour the
beasts, they would have no life at all.  so having some life is better than
never being born to start with.  fish, on the other hand are taken from
the wild, so i am close to deciding to never again scarf one, which is
a tough stance for one who loves sushi.  {8-[  of course, carrots too
are living things.

I passionately believe in my standard of right and wrong and think it should be

they're universal. Everybody is certain but somebody, perhaps everybody, is wrong.

Good point, we'd end up condemning virtually every historic figure that ever
lived for some failure to live by modern moral principles, and there doesn't
seem much point in that. Besides, the important thing about Einstein was his
science, his politics is about as important to me as his cooking skills.
Likewise, whatever Castro's opinion of General Relativity is it would not make
him less of a tyrant.

With terms like these, several differing definitions are possible. As you
will know, Nick, I'm offering a precising definition and a definition that
I think makes most sense. I'm not offering a lexical definition. Clearly,
most people use "atheism" to mean an active denial that there is a god.

I don't understand your parsing of the term. What does the "the" mean in
(a-the)-ism? The term relevant here is "theism". Presumably then an atheist
is one who lacks theistic belief.

Perhaps the idea is that atheism is still an "ism"--that is, a thought out,
specific *belief*. If the term is being used that way, that may rule out
those who have simply never heard of any idea of a god.

It should also be noted that before anyone can say they are or are not an
atheist, they need to specify what god they are talking about. I am an
atheist about the standard god (of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), since
I lack belief in such a being, and I have some positive reasons to think it
unlikely that such a being exists. However, I completely agree with you
that it is *possible* that our universe is a simulation... or an accidental
creation by something hardly anyone would call "god"--such as in Gregory
Benford's recent novel, Cosm.


So, I think "atheism" can be legitimately defined several ways. My
insistence is that it's a mistake to say it can only mean an active denial
of belief in any god. I just checked The Dictionary of Philosophy (ed.
Peter A. Angeles) and three definitions are given, including a positive
belief that god(s) do not exist, a "disbelief" -- which doesn't clearly
specify whether that is active belief or lack of belief, and, thirdly,
simply "the lack of belief in a particular god".

>The Companion states: "Agnosticism may be strictly personal ond

I can't agree. "Gnosis" is definitely related to knowledge. The common
usage is "someone who isn't sure whether there is a god". The Dictionary of
Philosophy says: agnosticism 1. The belief (a) that we cannot have
knowledge of God and (b) that it is impossible to prove that God exists or
does not exist. Gnosis relates to knowledge, not belief. The Gnostics were
an early sect who thought they had a special means of *knowledge* about the
divine plan. The Companion's definition is unfortunately, in my view,
because of what it leaves out. Agnostics generally think that "no one ought
to have a positive belief for or against divine existence" precisely
*because* they think this is not a possible object of knowledge.

>If you define an agnostic as one without knowledge about God, it 
>follows that there does not exist any agnostics (since knowing that

I'm not sure what you mean by "without knowledge about god". When I used
that incomplete formulation, I was noting what you had said, not offering a
definition, which I think did elsewhere. An agnostic is one who thinks that
they do not or cannot know whether there is a god. (Which implies what the
Companion said--if you think you [or anyone] cannot have knowledge of this,
then presumably you will think no one should have a positive belief before
or against.)

Whether you are an agnostic or atheist about any specific god depends on
your view of what's required before you think you know something. I don't
equate knowledge with certainty, which is why I call myself an atheist and
not an agnostic, at least when we're talking about the
Christian/Islamic/Jewish God.

Secularly,

But evolution exists independent of what humans think (barring any silent
tree-felling kind of arguments), while morality is solely a creation of
this activity (unless a god exists, but i don't think that is what Terry
Donaghe was suggesting), therefore suggesting an objective morality is
suggesting that this human creation has some features which are
independent of the specific human and common to all.

Yes.  However, I would disagree that morality *must* be "solely"
a creation of thinking.  For instance (to use the evolution example),
evolution can't happen without something to evolve, but would this
imply that the principles that directed evolution did not exist until
evolution actually occurred?  Similarly, a correct morality could
conceivably be built into the universe in the same way that
complex processes are, given the right circumstances in each
(living things for evolution; thought for morality).

Let me hasten to add that I am not *sure* that an objective
morality exists, but I do think that trying to discover such a
thing is a proper activity, unless and until it becomes apparent
that no such beastie exists.

>If you believe that morality is subjective then >you can justify

wrote Mr Donaghe.

This is precisely the case throughout history.
Do you think most otherwise normal (I won't say
rational or civilized) people would actually go out & commit these acts
if they were not justified in their own minds (& when does anyone need
more than that, especially if the get to write the history books?).
Most people do not think of themselves as the Bad Guy.

Morality & ethics are as subjective as love, honor & justice;  they are
only real insofar as we believe in them & work to make them real. There
is no moral calculus or physics or chemistry, nor can there be any moral
law to be considered in the same class as physical laws,
unless one refers to some Ultimate Creator,
some Jehovallah or Urizen  Who has set down 
The One True Way (TM).

I believe that rape, murder & genocide are wrong, but I cannot point to
some Book & demand that sinners repent.  At best I can point to economic
analyses that show these things to be inefficient, but what are the odds
that a rapist/murderer/genocide will be moved by such?  I can only work
to make a world where they are wrong because *we make it so*, just as we
work to make our Transhuman/Extropian
goals real.

We have chosen to make our own worlds, so we are responsible for them.
To call something Evil 'just because' is to fall into the blind faith
mentalities we seek to overcome.  It's not EVIL,
it is something we *choose* not to allow, for whatever reason;  but
please let's not appeal to some Moral Absolute, because there are none
save what we have made.

I doubt it, at least not in any sense of deity recognized by modern
theologians (although it might fit with the plural and anthropomorphic gods
of Greek, Roman and Norse mythology, not to mention Xena and a lot of Star
Trek eps).  If you build a snazzy alife sim and its GAs construct
intelligent CAs, you'd be a kind of bridging `first cause', and might even
have the power to intervene in their lives - even obliterate their entire
experienced cosmos - but that wouldn't make you a god in any interesting
sense.  Gods are ontologically distinct from creatures, or they're not
worth the paper they're written on.

Again, I think this is an abuse of language.  In an infinite universe there
would be very powerful beings by that path; there could not (I think, but
my set theory isn't remotely up to this) be a quantum fluctuation that
yielded an infinite volitional entity coextensive with *all* those infinite
worlds.  And even with Gott-like (ha) closed timelike curves, I doubt that
there could be a fluctuation that took the form of the logically earliest
volitional entity that *preceded* itself and its own ontic context (unless
it is the universe in toto).

Moreover, I suspect this line of thought is self-refuting: shouldn't there
also be (1) an *infinite* number of distinct gods so produced; and (b) at
least one catastrophic transcendental event, perhaps accidental, perhaps
done by a Mad Mind, that obliterates all these infinite universes?  Or
would such obliteration, like a vacuum catastrophe, have to proceed from a
center outward at the speed of light?  If so, any god postulated as its
cause is crucially limited, and fails the definition accepted by most
(Western) theists.

This sounds something like the array of current sub-theological
representations of deity (as far as I know; I'm hardly an expert in gods)
that is adduced by scientists such as, say, Paul Davies.  I don't see how
it makes sense as a proposition (so I guess I'm a noncognitivist in Max's
terms, although it sounds like a nasty label to accept), but that might be
a limitation of imagination.

So everyone owns the spectrum over their property?

What's the oint of buying the spectrum for a large area if it doesn't
include Bob's house right in the middle (because Bob doesn't want you
broadcasting over his house).  Yiou can't selectively broadcast over a large
qarea, after all.

Depends what you mean by violence.  If you mean physical violence then it's
perfectly possible to redistribute without it (I'll just pop in when you're
out).

As I stated numerous times in the previous argument (which I stopped
participating in becaue it was causing more heat than light), I do believe
that people should be allowed to keep the vast majority of the money they
earn.  I just don't believe in "rights" as an absolute.  I believe rights
are assigned by society or taken by a person.  I certianly don't believe
that the right to property is an absolute (although I beleive it's extremely
useful so it should be protected in numerous ways).  I just believe there
are greater goods than property protection (life protection, for instance).

After reading "Superior Beings:If They Exist, How Would We Know?:Game
Theoretic Implications on Omniscience, Omnipotence, Immortality and
Incomprehensibility" by Steven J. Brams, I became a retired agnostic (I
don't know, and don't give a tinker's damn anymore, because it's not

world).

Because much of mankind shares similar wants/likes at basic levels (no
organism likes being attacked, we all understand that being reasonable
towards people increases the chance that they will be reasonable towards us,
we like people to behave in trustworthy ways, etc.).

I felt the same way for a while.  But then I also felt teh same way when I
realised that money was just bits of paper that people had agreed to
exchange for things people can actually use.  When nothing nasty happens and
people continue acting in a reasonable way, the feeling goes away.

You have seen Furbies and beanie babies haven't you?
Collectables (you must have these because the more you buy the more they
will be worth!)?

Large amount sof marketing dollars sare spent persuading people they want
something which is in fact entirely useless to them.

Not that I have anything against this, it seems to keep people happy (well,
collectors seem to enjoy it anyway).

But lots of things have no utility until people are persuaded that they must
have it.

Why?  Where do you get your definitions from?  Prove them.  Show me their
derivations.  Show me they are more than your prejudices and lieks/dislikes.

You have stated that rape is wrong.  Now prove it.

You mean grey goo can't dismantle diamondoid? Then what's the problem? It's
clearly no threat; we just surround it with a diamondoid shell. The whole

*everything* that it comes into contact with.

Because the original poster was talking about an expanding sphere of grey
goo starting from a small initial colony. Only the exterior shell would be
a problem for us.

Yes, but you've made it nondecidable by redefining the problem, and limiting
the grey goo's capabilities. Your grey goo would be a threat to humans, but
not to any diamondoid creatures; or any transhumans with diamondoid skin.

Isn't the group still arguing about whether or not there should be such a
thing as intellectual property and if there is, where it should include
patents on ideas or just devices?

There appears to be disagreement over what pure capitalism would actually
involve.  (Which seems reasonable - after all we're applying it to people,
who aren't simple at all).

And we have to live with the consequences.  If I microwave a baby, people
are liable to get extremely upset at me and wreak horrible revenge.  Also,
most people have no desire to microwave babies (I certianly don't.  Not even
the noisy ones).

Can you tell me how I can, in good faith, follow a moral code when I believe
there is no logical reason to do so?
Especially when nobody has yet even managed to come up with a logical
objection to rape (which pretty much everyone on the planet admits is an
abbhorence (sic)).

It doesn't justify anything.  Justification occurs when people attempt to
say why what they did fits with a particular moral view.

I don't have a moral view, I have an aesthetic view (I like technological
advance, I dislike rape, etc.)  Anything I do fits into this aesthetic
framework.  I just don't all it 'moral' and then say that everyone else
should do the same thing as me because it's "right" (whatever that means).

Maybe I'm getting something wrong, but I thought that socialism was a
practical method of increasing equality and that any increase of meterial
wealth overall would be a cool side-effect but not vital to the excercise.

This of course is a huge problem, because expansion is vital to the survival
of any system (unless your system is a perfect recycler - ie a perpetual
motion machine) and therefore unless you are producing excess wealth your
society will fall apart after a while (which is what happened to the USSR -
it wasn't even remotely self sustaining).

Exactly. But at that point I think Eliezer would have starved to
death. If you cannot meet the survival needs well enough, you will
never get the surplus necessary for progress. And the basic survival
stuff is more about skills than being intelligent, which was the real
point of the example.

Remember Jules Verne's _The Mysterious Island_ (or whatever it was

Uh, yes. Socialism is a practical method of making everyone equally poor.
Capitalism is a practical method of making the rich richer and the poor
richer than the rich would be under socialism.

OK. But monopolizing something that a lot of others may have also
downloaded is quite tricky. Just look at the Scientologists hunting
the Fishman papers - if their beliefs were actually true and they had
the aid of thetan powers, would they still be able to keep the lid on?

I think the problem is that you move the problem from a question about
how to counteract hostile nanosystems to a problem of counteracting
anything your enemy might throw at you. That is a bit like asking that
the security systems of an elevator should work against somebody
blowing up the building.

The important thing is to do a threat analysis, and try to see what
countermeasures (including the 36th stratagem, running away) are
useful in a hostile situation. But to do that you ned to understand
the different kinds of threats and the available countermeasures well,
and not claim that countermeasures against A are useless because they
do not work against weapon B. An active shield is useless against a
nuclear explosion, but a nuclear weapon is useless if you don't know
where to aim it or the political repercussions on you will be more
severe than you can handle. What is needed is a better understanding
of the threat matrix of weapons and countermeasures; where are the big
holes, where are one side at a noticeable advantage, and what
strategies can both sides take to maximize their utility.

To have rights, a being must understand the concept of rights, communicate its
understanding to others, and hopefully take action based on that understanding
to protect those rights. If any being cannot do these then it is just meat. That
being said, other beings must be able to understand what is being communicated.
Our own developing ability to understand the more primitive forms of
communication of other species (and some which may or may not be more complex
than our own) is only a few decades old, so it is logical to leave a bit of room
at the upper end of the brain mass / body mass scale free from predation just to
be safe.

By 'automated engineering' I mean an AI that can turn "build be a widget
that does thus-and-such' into an actual design.  Silicon compilers and
similar systems took decades to evolve - what we need for extreme nanotech
design-ahead is better systems that are developed much faster.

By 'fast computers' I mean machines capable of doing fast MD sims on systems
of millions of atoms - obviously well beyond current capabilities.  However,
I do agree that we'll meet this condition pretty soon.

IMO, #2 is too close to call so far - no one has had a chance to try
anything more complex than basic mechanical components.  I don't think #4 is
especially likely - pushing atoms is complex, but no more so than any other
emerging technology.  There is no obvious, huge barrier to overcome that
could hold up implementation for decades.

Could Leonardo have designed a space shuttle?  Nanotech implies a major
complexity barrier - advanced nanotech routinely uses systems far more
complex than anything we have build in the real world.  That's why we need
some kind of automated engineering to get beyond baby steps with it.

The 'automated engineering' component is crucial here, because it would mean
that a sudden increase in computer power would give you a sudden increase in
design ability.  That in turn would let you implement more complex nanotech
faster, including more complex computers that run even faster.

We are obviously talking on a species by species basis. Moreover the only human
beings that I am aware of who cannot communicate on a consistent basis at a
minimally acceptable level are in a coma, are severely autistic or in the last
stages of Alzheimers. Almost all of these people will, at some point in their
lives, be able to state their personhood, even the autistic individual, given
the proper treatment. The intelligence of man at his most degraded level is
still far above that of any animal, excepting the complete vegetable. Sure,
some animals can be trained, but fery few learn anything on their own, and
extremely few remember what they learn.

I can't speak for others, but my opinions are the result of reasoning based
on my knowledge of engineering, military science, and the theoretical
potential of molecular manufacturing.  If you think my reasoning is flawed,
show me where.

However, if you really want to examine the issue in detail I think we would
need to fill in some background first.  It appears that we have different
fundamental assumptions about the relevant technologies and how they work.

Not necessarily. While it is now a crime to shine a laser beam at a person (given
that lasers are used also for aiming firearms, thus playing a laser beam on someone
is a threat, tantamount to assault with a deadly weapon), there are significant
amounts of property rights cases where property owners are protected from neighbors
who use too bright or too many broad beam spotlights at night. There is a case
progressing right now a couple miles north of me in Hanover, NH where Dartmouth
College wants to put 80 foot high towers with spotlights over one of its soccer
fields and be able to keep them on until after 11 pm.

Similarly, noise pollution cases abound in the case books. If there weren't a law
here in NH that grandfathered all outdoor firearms ranges from noise control regs,
the gun club which I sit on the board of directors of would have been shut down
long ago by city folks who moved up here to properties near our club without doing
due diligence as to the existence of our club and the noise we produce. Even then,
we still get letters from the City Council whenever some flatlander claims in a
complaint that we were firing off automatic weapons at 5 am, even though that is
outside the hours that we permit our members to use the facilities at, and ignoring
that it is always other neighbors of theirs doing the shooting on their own
property.

What does Ayn Rand say about rights as far as humans are concerned? 
Something about us being the only animal capable of rational thought
(any arguments on that point?), and without certain rights such as the
right to ourselves (no one own's us) and the right to keep what we
earn, we're unable to excersize rational thought which reduces us to
the realm of animals (those without the capacity for rational
thought).  That's a very abbreviated version, but close, I think. 
Correct me if that's wrong.

That said, our only "rights" are the right to self and the right to
property.  All other "rights" either flow from those two (like gun
ownership, police protection) or are bogus, nonexistent rights (rights
to medical care, "fair" wages, protection from "evil" monopolies, etc.).

If animals are incapable of rational thought, then do they deserve the
right to themselves, i.e. can we own them?  Should we free heards of
cows to fend for themselves?  My opinion is that animals which are
incapable of rational thought can and should be treated in any way
wished by those who own them.

Animals certainly can't earn things of their own volition, so I don't
think there's a question of animal property rights.

Are there any other "rights?"  If I can own an animal, then I can
treat it as I wish.  If you (or government or whatever) decides that I
can only treat my property (an animal in this case) in certain ways,
then I don't truly OWN it.  I'm just borrowing it from the government
which is nice enough to let me use it for certain pre-approved
functions...

There is a strong argument that under the conditions that we now live in,
that the biological form is close to optimum. If a simpler nano machine
could develop the infinite reproduction loop, it would probably allready
have happened. wouldn't it?

If grey goo is simple, shouldnt it happen spontaneous in nature or at least
in the complex chemical compounds in living creatures?

>From the evidence available it seems that "life" is the simplest form of
reproducing grey goo, that can function in the atmosphere, and there seem to
be some kind of minimal complexity for a system that can reproduce. the
simplest system we know of is probably the virus, and even it needs a
biological host mechanism to function.

Probably something that has been engineered can be better than what nature
has stumbled upon, but we simply don't know how much. Perhaps grey goo is
impossible because of complexity factors. I hope so.

This doesnt rule out the development of extremely dangerous viruses of
course. Which can equally as dangerous as grey goo from a human perpective.

Probably nonbiological nanofabrication has to take place in controlled
enviroments. Just like we living creatures has skin to protect us from the
enviroment, an advanced nano facility will exist in a nano-womb.

I just had a debate on hunting with a person the other day so I'm primed for this
topic. Here is a rough synopsis of the debate:
Other Person:"While I think that its OK for people to hunt for food if they need
to to survive, anything else is just for sport and is wrong."
Mike: "Well, I think than anyone who eats meat at all but does not participate at
some point in their life in the killing of the animal and preparing the carcass is
a hypocrite. Moreover, I think that hunting is far more humane and respectful of
animal's rights than a slaughterhouse, which I associate with Nazi death camps.
All animals should be shot on the run and given a sporting chance to escape."
We were having a bite to eat, and the girl was eating some french fries, she held
one up and said,"Does that mean that since I have never picked a potato that I
should not eat french fries?"
Mike:"Have you ever picked a flower?"
Other person:"Yes, of course."
Mike:"well, then you can eat plants, can't you then?"
Other Person:"ok, thanks"
Mike:"No problem, and by the way, picking flowers is just for sport, too....."

Computers to pass on tricks of trade - From Yomiuri Shimbun

The International Trade and Industry Ministry plans to develop a computer
system to record and analyze the techniques of highly skilled workers in
action, so that they may be passed on to trainees, ministry sources said
Sunday.

According to the plan, computers will be used to analyze minute movements of
the eyes, limbs and muscles of welders, turners and other skilled workers.
The recorded data would then be analyzed and digitally and graphically
processed so that young trainee workers could learn the techniques of
skilled masters of their chosen trade.

Don't worry, Terry Donaghe.  Even for those who aren't philosophers,
defending objective morality is easy.  Any argument against objective
morality also applies to objective reality.  Watch.

People have wars over opinions.  Does this obviate the existence of
objective reality?  To be specific, there have been wars over whether
Jesus was the Son of God.  Do you think that there is no correct answer
to this question?

You might wish to inform us whether the Sun goes around the Earth or
vice versa, which Galileo and the Church had so much trouble about. 
Since there's a conflict of opinion obviously there's no objective right.

(Actual answer to above:  The objective right, in this case, is almost
certainly that the question is false.  Even if eating one side of the
egg results in a hurricane in Australia due to the Butterfly Effect,
then the answer is not the same on all occasions and will almost never
be to bite into the egg exactly along the axis.)

Morality is important, civilization would be impossible without it. Far from
denigrating morality I celebrate it, but it needs no approval from inanimate matter
to justify it,  such a thing would be an insult. Morality has a much more
illustrious bloodline. Calling morality subjective is the greatest compliment
you could give it because it means it's the product of the most important
thing in the observational universe, intelligent sentient beings. The only thing
that fits that bill are humans. Hydrogen gas has no say in the creation of ethics
and that bothers me not at all.

...and we like these things because of our evolutionary heritage. It's not
a matter of personal whim at all, but an objectively verifiable nexus of
instinctual responses. In humans, of course, these instincts are usually
regularized by the application of reason, resulting in codes of conduct
whose relative wisdom can be ascertained by observing the results with
reference to our biological imperatives, i.e. objectively. Thus, we have
both an objective basis for formulating ethical standards and an objective
means of verifiying the worth (workability) of a given standard.

You're begging the question of _why_ people continue to act in a
"reasonable" way. (Note that you've just vitiated your own argument, since
if it's reasonable, then it's not arbitrary, i.e. not subjective.)

The fact of the evolution of life provides profound insight into why we
consistently, as a species, choose certain values and reject other things
as "evil". As such, I consider it the only firm basis for ethical theory.
Sort of the "missing link" in the natural law tradition.

Dick

Samael makes a puzzling comment:

>I just believe there are greater goods than property protection
>(life protection, for instance).

Are you saying that your life is not your property?

You can't divorce your life from the resources that make your life
possible. It's nonsense to write as if property weren't part and parcel of
your existence.

Since property includes life itself, there can be no higher good than
protection of property.

(?)  I do have to worry about that, since I'm still a mortal.  But I
don't think so.  I'll pay you a sincere compliment and assume that you
were genuinely trying to make a point of evolutionary psychology, at the
same level of facility I had a few years ago, rather than using a
debating tactic.

I was simply echoing a point you made back at you; that if you feel
threatened by a specific set of memes ("Nuke K-Mart"), then there's also
a threat in any meme system which assumes a random trajectory.  I'd feel
nervous around someone who insisted that reality is only a matter of
opinion, wouldn't you?  He might decide that sulfuric acid was good for me.

Not in the slightest.  There are people who follow predetermined walks
with respect to their opinions; we call it "blind faith", not "Free Opinion".

But you don't use that meme system to determine the truth of supergoals,
only of opinions and subgoals.  I use that meme system to determine what
I do as well as what I say.

I suggest that the meme rules of conduct be commutative.

Commutativity: If the rule is "X shall not perform act P on Y"
	       then also the rule "Y shall not perform act P on X" shall hold.

Simply put: "A rule apply to all in the same manner."

If you postulate this basic rule of commutativity
then you would conclude:
     "If X does not want Y to perfom act P on X
      then X should avoid to perform act P on Y."
      [e.g. to avoid retaliation]

Simply put: "Do not to others what you do not wish them do to you."

Avoid microwaving children. Others may dislike it and microwave you in turn.

Organized agriculture imposes far greater harm on the environment than either
subsistence or sport hunting or fishing. Just because agriculture does its deeds
by slowly, methodically tearing up the wilderness, burning the flora, tilling it
under, then poisoning it to death with artificial fertilizers and pesticides,
which drain off into undeveloped wildernesses within the same watersheds makes
it no different, and even more heinous and underhanded than the sporting contest
of animal (who happens to be human) hunting animal. The major part of transhuman
sentiment which I object to is the continued insistence that man is separate
from nature. It is not, nor will it ever be. We evolved as bilateral omnivores,
(male hunters, female gatherers), so being carnivorous is as much a part of our
nature as eating plant matter.

Vegetarianism also damages the environment because it displaces other species in
the pyramid of life. The prairies which could be supporting millions of buffalo,
prairie hens, quail, wolves, coyotes, and eagles are instead feeding millions of
city dwelling corn flake eaters. This practice decreases diversity, creating
monocultures both in the species being preyed upon (the plants, as hybrid wheat,
corn, etc) and in the species doing the preying (homogenized humanity).

I have often thought that the reason why vegans are so opposed to carnivorous
humans is that they feel the instinctual fear that the herbivore has of the
carnivore, and are merely trying to legislate the 'threat' out of existence.

It will be interesting to see if, in our desperation to fill every natural
niche, we use our technology to develop humans that photosynthesize. If so, I
imagine that as more of the population shifts to such a lifestyle, there will be
increasing calls to outlaw the eating of plants by vegans, they will argue that
it is immoral to prey upon innocent plants (who can feel pain, as even current
science has shown, are territorial, and defend themselves with poisons, both as
irritants and toxic pesticides) with arguments like: "This type of predation is
so foreign to me that I am deeply saddened by this type of activity and
represents a sub-human psychology in killing life just for fun."

Okay, the basic fallacy here is that anybody knows what the Objective
Morality is.  I ain't got a clue.  If I did, I wouldn't be building SIs
to clue me in, I'd be building them for quite different reasons.

The three rules of my philosophy, Externalism:

1.  Morality is an objective, observer-independent reality external to
ourselves.  Questions of right and wrong are questions of true and
false; there is no ontological distinction between "what is the mass of
this particle" and "what should I do now".

2.  I don't know what the objective morality is and neither do you. 
Anything we say on the subject is a guess, just like any other
scientific statement.

3.  Since objective morality is real and external from our opinions, our
instincts can have no influence on it; thus objective morality is
probably as strange and unintuitive as quantum physics or general relativity.

Spoken by Death.  And if I, too, may quote:

  "Are you too *scared* to change the world?"
  Death turned.  The very sight of his expression made Susan back away.
  He advanced slowly toward her.  His voice, when it came, was a hiss.
  "YOU SAY THAT TO *ME*?  YOU STAND THERE IN THAT PRETTY DRESS AND SAY
THAT TO *ME*?  YOU?  YOU PRATTLE ON ABOUT CHANGING THE WORLD?  COULD YOU
FIND THE COURAGE TO ACCEPT IT?  TO KNOW WHAT *MUST* *BE* *DONE* AND DO
IT, WHATEVER THE COST?  IS THERE ONE HUMAN ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WHO

And the answer of "Is it good or evil to kill someone" is that the question
is meaningless, since there is no objective definition of the terms
involved.

Reality will determine whether the sun travles around the earth of
visa/versa, it will tell us the exact goings on in any particular situation,
it will tell us whether an item is longer than another, or who killed
another person.  But it will not tell us whether any of these is a 'good' or
a 'bad' thing, because these two words denote opinions and have no relation
whatsoever to reality, except as filterered through a persons brain.

Okay, we've taken it back a step:  Rape is wrong because it's a violation of
our bodies.

Now, why is violation of our bodies wrong?

(who can keep saying "why?" until people realise that there isn't a moral
that one can't say "why?" about and therefore isn't a logical foundation to
morals, the only foundation we have is emotional)

Oh, and before you accus me of being a nasty man, I don't want my body
violated either, thank you very much and don't intend to violate yours
(except in certain limited circumstances).  Just because I don't see a
logical reason to avoid something, doesn't mean that there isn't an
emotional one.

You have more or less enunciated Kantianism.  Kantianism has various
problems, however.  Take killing, for example.  We normally regard killing
in self-defense as OK.  Must I simply relent if someone tries to kill me?
Similarly, attacking another person is usually considered wrong.  Must I
turn over my wallet to an armed thug so as to avoid a fight?

IMO, the only act type that makes sense is consequentialist in nature; thus
there are only two act types:  maximizing the good, and not maximizing the
good.  (Note that I haven't yet enunciated what the good is; I'm just
trying to give an example of a coherent "commutative" or Kantian structure.)

So if it's a biological imperative it's "right".  Boy is your life going to
be odd!  Oh and you're still going to have to work out which bits of the way
people are is defined by genetics and which bit is cultural.

Sorry, replace the word reasonable with 'polite', that's what I meant
(reasonable behaviour over here in England is a euphemism for polite
behaviour)

Evolution only show what is necessary for survival, which mostly appears to
be the ability to bop your neighbour over the head and steal his country as
rapidly as possible, while shaggin as many of his women as possible.

I don't recall any natural societies of any species in which animals refrain
from stealing from each other when each others backs are turned, or from
indulging ion all sorts of conduct which would seem to be anti-libertarian.

OK, a kind of digital taylorism. Fortunately for my argument this
isn't the kind of skills I was arguing about (hacking skills,
engineering ability, controlling an assembler or factory robot).

I don't think of my life as an object.  It's a feature of mine a 'property'
in the same way as 'dark hair' is.  It's just a feature I've grown very fond
of.

>You can't divorce your life from the resources that make your life

There are things I use during my existence and things I 'own'.  My life is
of a different quality of any of them and could continue (at least
temporarily) without any of them.

>Since property includes life itself, there can be no higher good than
>protection of property.


Since carbon compunds include life itself, there van be no higher good than
the protection of carbon compunds.

I don't think you're stringing together a coherent argument here.

Sure, why not?  If we OWN property then we can do anything with it
that we wish.  Either the cow is my property and I can do as I wish,
or you (government, mob rule, whatever) give me a list of what I can
and can't do with the cow - then it's no longer my property.

How many sane people will torture animals anyway?  Why would I wish to
harm my own property which I have earned (worked, sweated, etc. for)? 
I would guess that the only practical reasons for owning a cow is
either milk or meat production or both.  In both cases, tortured cows
probably produce poorer products.  So, in the long run, those who
torture their cows will lose.  Therefore, individuals can torture
their cows, but in the long run, they'll either lose for it or gain
nothing.

I don't think that's valid logic:
(A is good) and  (A in B) => B is good  ???? i don't think so

What seems to me more cohesive logic follows:
(A is good) and (A in B) and (bad bits in B kill A) => cut up B into
little bits and discard toxic bits into nearest river

Well, Samael you must make the determination of whether or not we have
the natural right to our own bodies.  Either we do or we don't.  If we
don't then who owns them?  And whoever does own them is/are our
master(s).  That makes us slaves.

Are you a slave?

I'm not.

It depends on the rules.

"X does not want to be killed therefore X should avoid killing anyone else"
seems reasonable.
"X does not want to be tickled therefore X should avoid tickling someone
else" also seems reasonable, unless you consider that Y may _wish_ to be
tickled and in return is prepared to give X ice cream.  Two people may have
very different likes and dislikes.

I dislike absolutes in morals, as they frequently contradict situations that
are incredibly complex and do  not fit simple rules.

Thou shalt not steal seems reasonable enough, but I'd prefer someone to
steal a loaf of bread to feed a starving child than allow them to starve to
death.

  IAN: Well, I don't believe animals are really so
  irrational, in fact, their thinking is good enough 
  to have ensured their survival for millions of years,
  allowing the evolution of the animal called "human."

  If degrees of rationality define rights possession, maybe
  we could beat up on some demented people, or use them in 
  experiments... "greater good" and such. Imagine that we 
  have an unbroken chain of primates before us, from tree 
  monkeys to humans with all the missing links, it's like 
  a morph from tree monkey to man with an individual for
  each step of the way. Which individual would you declare 
  the right to saw off their leg against their will and why?

  For those in the primate chain that area only a little 
  "less rational" (a claim I dispute) could you only saw 
  their leg part way off? The human the saw can't touch, 
  the next guy it can touch, the next it scraps a little, 
  and by the time the rights-allocation gets down to that 
  tree-climbing dude, he can have his whole leg sawed off.?

  It's a fuzzy-logic scale of primate rights allocation.

  Of course a few humans might declare the right to saw all
  their legs off (Hitler et al), and some would declare NO 
  right to saw any legs off (nice folks), which is inherent
  in the fact that rights are ultimately what any one being 
  declares they are and what others can or can't stop, which
  means that in the final physical fact, "might makes rights,"
  which is not the preferable basis for an ethical ideology.

  IAN: Animals can't earn things? If no animal earned
  a living, the human race would never have occurred.

  IAN: There is a fringe school of libertarians who
  adopt that SAME philosophy with respect to children,
  such that they argue that they could kill their kids
  if they wanted to, and if anyone came to save them,
  the parents would have the right to shoot those
  coming to the child's rescue (one advocate of that 
  ideology actually threatened to shoot me as I was
  harshly critiquing that idea, which says something).

  That line-of argument fails to see an individual 
  being as an inherent self-owner, and seeing them 
  as such, to save a tortured child or animal is to 
  liberate a self-owner, not necessarily to claim 
  to own that self-owner, as your analysis states.

  IAN: But the existence of sentient beings with 
  subjective concepts has everything to do with 
  objective physical things such as Hydrogen
  (there's no concept free from a physical being),
  and therefore rights are the product of physics;
  and a right is a claim made by a physical being.

Morality, ethics, and so on appear to be little more than
contrivances of a society attempting to codify the evolutionary
advantage of altruism.  Instinctually, we attempt to maximize
the survivability of our genes.  Anything that does this is
viewed as right.  However, it is not as simple as doing things
that directly contribute to survivability.  Bob may rationalize
that robbing a bank would increase survivability.  But if such
an act goes unpunished, a precedent that stealing is ok emerges
and such a society becomes intolerable.  Thus, the benefit the society
receives from a society where stealing is intolerable outweighs
the benefit the society receives from an increase  to Bob's wealth.
Benefit being how such an act increases survivability of the group.
Society is the final arbiter in determining whether something
promotes the overall survivability of the group.

I'll try to find the exact Rand quote about humans and rationality and
we can argue from her quote instead of my limited memory.

  IAN: The massive hole in that argument is that 
  over 70% of agriculture land is devoted to the 
  production of food for livestock, for meat! So
  the argument you make against vegetarianism is
  in fact properly directed at meat eating. I did
  a detailed report on this years ago and can dig
  it up (plus other research) if that's disputed.
  The stopping of meat eating would reduce the 
  overall use of lands for food production.
  Also, cattle eat 9 lbs of protein for every 1
  lb they yield. Meat eating is a wasteful luxury.

If X does not wish to be killed, then X would try to avoid killing Y.

If Y tries to kill X anyway, then X would lack the reason to avoid killing Y.
Therefore, if Y tries to kill X, then X would feel free to defend itself
using deadly force until such time that the threat of being killed Y no
longer exists.

Would Kantianism define this the correct behaviour?

The commutative rule defines a framework for other rules, but it would not
define the whole system.  Readers might have made this assumption, however.

Perhaps the above rules would better be described as part of game theory.

Even accepting (as I do) the Humean assertion that normative
propositions are unprovable, once one has chosen any value or
norm for any reason, one /can/ logically deduce which set of
actions support that value and which do not.  Once one has
accepted, for example, that continuing one's own life is a value,
it is absolutely and objectively true that placing a loaded
gun to your temple and pulling the trigger is BAD /with respect
to that value/.  Similarly, if you express values such as "the
absence of suffering in other humans", then it is perfectly
rational to argue about which political systems are likely to
support or hinder that value, so long as you do not try to sneak
in other unrelated norms in your argument.

> Especially when nobody has yet even managed to come up with
> a logical objection to rape...

The "suffering" norm works easiliy here, but I can do better:
(1) Rape increases the population of persons with genetic
  qualities that women would not have rationally chosen
  in their mates.
(2) Rape may impose a great economic cost on the victim other
  than suffering: pregnancy, disease, etc.
(3) The act of sex is of economic value, so rape is a theft
  of valuable services (laws against theft being in turn
  justified as economically inefficient).

Note that while (2) and (3) apply both to male and female
victims (though not equally since pregnancy is a cakewalk
for the male involved)  (1) applies only in the case of
men raping women.  This may be a rational justification for
the legal double standard that we see in practice, and also
may explain why evolution has shaped female brains to
experience more suffering from the act than male brains
seem to.

Yes, I've grown very fond of my head, I should be very sad to part with it. That
is my right to the property known as my head. Similarly, I need my car to do my
job, to earn my living which buys my food, shelter, and energy. Therefore, I am
very fond of it (no matter what a pain in the but it is to take care of, that is
a different issue), and I should be very sad to be deprived of it. In both
cases, losing either property will have a significant impact on my life, one a
bit more than the other. My posessions, including my head, afford me a greater
measure of liberty in the world which I find necessary to my pursuit of
happiness. Greater amount of property provides greater liberty, I have found. If
we are to promote increased liberty for individuals, we should also promote
increased property in the hands of individuals.

I might continue to live as a slave as well. It is hardly of acceptable quality.

People whose only end is money do a lot more good for the future of
humanity than those who use money as a means to irrational ends.
They may not inspire our respect, but I am grateful for their
contributions.  In a relatively free market such as ours, at least
a majority of wealth is made by people doing things other people
want enough to pay for; therefore earning profit is inherently a
morally and socially responsible act (I use the weasel words above
like "relatively" and "majority" because it is still possible in
our society to make money by legal theft--corporate welfare, farm
subsidies and price supports, government contracts, etc.)

Irrelevant. What is relevant is whether an individual was told by another
individual that they did not like being tickled, but they tickled them anyways.
This is as much a violation of the second person's rights as refusing to tickle
the first person because you knew that NOT tickling them brought them pain....

Absolutes in morals do not usually contradict, they are just difficult for the
squeamish and weak to practice. Where there are consistent contradictions, then
there should be no moral for that situation.

Ah, so the child lives, never learning how to bake his own bread, just stealing
bread, and reproduces, and teaches his offspring how to steal bread, because it
is apparently a positive survival skill. Because it takes hours to bake bread
but only seconds to steal it, the theif has much more time to spend reproducing,
and eventually outpopulating the bread bakers and everyone starves to death....
so, which is the greater good, letting one child starve, or postponing it such
that millions starve?

God, or divinity. If you regard the "a-" as attaching not to 
"theism", but to "theo", then you get "no-god". And then you 
attach "ism" and you get "the doctrine that there is no-god".

But you just cited a definition that begins "The belief ..."! Thus an 
agnostic is not one without knowledge, but one who believes either 
(a) or (b).

You was noting what Samael had said. I assumed that you and Samael

In that sense I am likewise an atheist.

I've been discussing this with a friend who is doing his PhD on the 
concept of God, and he is sympathetic to calling such entities gods.

(Frank Tipler's Omega Point is another possible type of naturalistic 
god.)

plus: you might be "omniscient", and immortal; exist on a "different 
level of reality";  be "omnipresent"; you might have a purpose with 
the simulation; you may have granted the inhabitants "free will" 
(i.e. not decided explicitly what will happen, just set the 
simulation up to wait and see what they turn out to do); your ways 
may be inscrutable to humans, etc.

Oh what do you expect from a humble god! This impressive 
list of attributes should be enough to qualify anybody for 
divinity (in an interesting sense). Ontological distinctness is not a 
necessary requirement. Pantheists believe that the divine is 
identical with the universe. And beside, you would indeed have 
some sort of ontological distinction between the simulation and the 
computer on which it is running.

No, but there are legitimate ways of using the word "god" that do not 
imply that the being is all-encompassing. 

As I see it, whether to call certain posthuman forms "gods" is not a 
question of correct or incorrect usage -- it's a question of 
marketing strategy. It's not clear what is the best choice.

Here is a consequentialist argument for eating animals: cows lives are 
overall worth living, even if they are slaughtered at the end.  What happens
if you convince the world that you from now on you will no longer eat cows,
and instead spend the same amount on fancy vegetable foods?  The demand for
cows goes down and the demand for veggies goes up.  Farmers will choose to
grow fewer cows to meet that demand, and will choose to plant more fancy
veggie crops.  People who used to have jobs processing cow meat will switch
to jobs processing veggies.  And so on.  

So unless you do something else in switching from meat to veggies, like 
donating money to charities that raise cows which are never killed, the 
direct effect of switching is to reduce the number of cows who ever live.
In order to eliminate that bad end-of-cow-life experience, you elimate
the entire cow life experience.  If that whole cow life is "worth living"
in some sense, this wasn't necessarily a kind thing to do.  (Unless you 
think those veggie lives are more worth living, even though they get 
killed in the end.)

I'm reminded of a story  Ted Nugent like's to tell:

Ted and the members of Damm Yankee's were staying at Ted's place in
central Michigan. Ted invited the boy's to go out hunting with him.

Tommy Shaw gently pointed out to Ted that he was a vegetarian...

"Hey no problem Tommy !!" replies Ted "We'll just go out back and
whack some cabbages !!!" (makes bow drawing motion) "Quick, get it
before it jumps!! "

Actually I like the symbiosis idea....economical, efficient.

Consider the analogy of altitude.  Just because people have long had control
over the space a few meters above and below the ground, does that imply
that they have absolute rights to the space hundreds or thousands of kilometers
above and below the ground?  By the same argument you make against spectrum

I'm not sure what you mean by "establish."   Would you object if people 
who owned property of the form you approve of wanted to contract to redivide 
their property, creating "property" in spectrum in the process?  Hal
had a recent post where he elaborated this sort of scenario.  Would you 
seek to prevent the enforcement of such contracts?  If not, you would seem
to accept the concept of this sort of property, and we're just back the 
question of whether we got to that point without someone stealing something
from someone else.

OK, let's not quibble over intangibles; how about your body then? Would you
at least agree that your body is your property? If so, then doesn't your
property right in your body entail a right to keep that body alive (using
your own resources)?

Huh? In what possible sense do carbon compounds "include" life? Certain
types of compounds make life as we know it possible, but saying they
*include* life is as sensible as saying that the electromagnetic spectrum
"includes" _Deep Space Nine_. Can't you think of a real analogy?

If you have to search for a quote to tell you what you think,
you've already lost the argument.  Not that you're wrong, you
just lose the game when you admit that you haven't actually
deliberated, considered, and understood the point you are trying
to make.

I'm as much a fan of Rand as anyone, but there are a few things
she got just plain wrong: (1) The human mind is not "tabula rasa"
at birth; it is littered with predispositions instilled in us by
eons of evolution.  (2) Blind chance plays a far greater role in
individual success than she admits.  (3) There are no bright-line
distinctions sufficient to define "force" or "reason"; the diff-
erence between the reasoning of a dog and a human is one of
degree, not of kind.  Likewise, the distinction between tapping
a stranger on the shoulder to ask the time and punching him in
the nose is one of degree, not kind.  (4) Her analysis of
homosexuality is laughable, but in fairness she probably would
have done a better job if the psychiatric literature of her time
had been better.  (5) The "objective necessity" of patents and
copyrights is, like all arguments claiming necessity, a result
of her lack of imagination of the alternatives, combined with
her esthetic prejudice toward writers and inventors.

Given (3), I am likely to have more sympathy for the suffering
of non-humans than a strict Randian might, and I think it is
quite rational to do so.  I would be uncomfortable eating primates
or cetaceans (though I have probably dined at many restaurants
that serve mahi mahi), and I do feel revulsion at the unnecessary
torture of higher mammals (I rarely eat meat).  I certainly
wouldn't codify any of those feelings into law, and I lose no
respect for those who don't share my feelings in the matter, but
I just can't justify confidently asserting a moral position here.

You're right, I'm guilty of sloppy logic here. How about this:

If property entails the right of exclusive control, then your basic
property consists of your (living) body. All other property can be
considered a sort of extension of this fundamental property.

Thus the fundamental good - insofar as you value your own life - is the
acquisition (or retention) and protection of property, both the property
you were born with and the property necessary to maintain it.

Robert Wright speaks to this issue in "The Moral Animal":

"It is only a slight exaggeration to say that the prevailing moral 
philosophy within many philosophy departments is nihilism."  
Due in part to..."the one-two punch Darwin delivered: the
Origin's assault on the biblical account of creation, followed 
by the Descent's doubts about the status of the moral sense."

"Sympathy, empathy, compassion, conscience, guilt, remorse, 
even the very sense of justice, [snip] - all these can now be viewed 
as vestiges of organic history on a particular planet."

"By the lights of the new Darwinian paradigm, a moral code is 
a political compromise.  It is molded by competing interest groups, 
each bringing all its clout to bear."  Moral values..."are shaped 
disproportionately by the various parts of society where power 
resides."

*************

Ridding myself of religious beliefs was a liberating and empowering
experience for me personally.  Part of that cleansing was the letting go
of the notion of objective moral values.  I highly recommend it.

Put your mind at ease, Lee. Mahi mahi is _dolphinfish_, not dolphin as in
"small cetacean". Dolphinfish is sometimes confusingly called "dolphin",
but it's a fish, not a mammal, just the same.

Eh?  X does not lack the reason to avoid killing Y: the reason not to kill
Y is because the commutative rule is correct (by assumption).  Y shouldn't
kill X, so X shouldn't kill Y, even if Y does what Y shouldn't do.  The
reason X is to avoid killing Y simply IS the commutative rule, (ie the
categorical imperative) which doesn't go away when Y breaks the rules.  If
it did, then when Y stole from X, it would be OK for X to steal from Y, etc.

>Would Kantianism define this the correct behaviour?

Kantian deontology is not in perfect agreement here.  <guess>Kant himself
probably would have disagreed; that even if your own life or the lives of
others are in jeopardy, that this does not make it right to break the
rules.</guess>

>Perhaps the above rules would better be described as part of game theory.

Again, if you're going for game theory, the commutative rule will often
result in inefficient outcomes for both parties.

For example, the categorical imperative, it is often said, tells us that if
you are at home and your mother is upstairs, and a madman comes to your
door armed with a shotgun and asks "Is your mother at home?  If she is, I
will murder her," you should answer "Yes," because she is, and lying is
always wrong.

Now suppose you've got two players, Alice and Bob, in rooms A and B
respectively.  A madman comes up to Alice and asks "Is Bob in room B?  If
so, I'll kill him."  And another madman comes up to Bob and asks "Is Alice
in room A?  If so, I'll kill her."

Both players must answer "Yes" under the commutative rule, or else your
commutative rule does not rule out lying to someone unrelated to the game,
Cindy.  But if the rule demands that the players answer "No," ie if the
commutative rule eliminates lying, then it results in an obviously
inefficient outcome: in this game, both Alice and Bob die.

So either it's OK to lie, or we must accept an inefficient outcome.  If you
think inefficient outcomes of this kind are sometimes bad, then you must
reject the commutative rule.

Anyway, IMO utilitarianism is the thing you're looking for if you're trying
to couch your argument in game theory.  Kant argued that following the
categorical imperative was right even when it would result in decreased
utility; utilitarianism would never reach that conclusion, and would
naturally and easily conclude that both players should answer "no," because
that would maximize the utility of both players.

I've argued that standards of conduct arise ultimately from our
evolutionary history. Samael objects:

Believe me, it is...

Quite so. We've made great progress in this area over the past few decades.
But bear in mind that even our cultural development is in some measure a
function of our genetic makeup.

Samael replies:

That this is your opinion has a lot to do with our political differences, I
suspect. See below.

BTW, evolutionary success is *not* a matter of mere survival, despite
popular ignorance. Those organisms that *thrive* best, as opposed to barely
surviving, are the ones likely to pass on the most genetic "packages" to
the next generation.

You might want to check out some recent work in the field of ethology (the
science of animal behavior). All social animals tend to avoid "antisocial"
behavior, as those who don't, tend to find their lineages weeded out of the
gene pool.

Unless, of course, you happen to be vastly more powerful. Then
there is no _rational_ reason to restrict your actions.

If a child you created would find their life worth living, you would be 
doing them a favor by creating them.  However, I don't think failing to 
do someone a favor is "cruel."  But I don't see how you can say you're 
being kind to that possible creature by such a choice.   

>  No, since a being that never existed is

To me, it seems that if a creature would, if it existed, prefer
that it existed, then that creature isn't getting what it wants
if it doesn't exist.  Taking things that creatures want away from
them "harms" them.

If a certain group of humans were created for food, I suspect
that the rest of us would fear we or someone we know might
someday become members of that group.  We don't have a similar
fear about cows.

I think this is a good argument.  All else equal, it is better for there
to be more living organisms enjoying life.

However, some food animals do not have lives as good as range-fed cows.
Animal rights activists describe chickens raised their whole lives in
wire cages barely big enough to turn around in, veal calves kept chained
in stalls and force-fed, and other hardships designed to increase the
amount of salable meat.

Robin's argument calls attention to the quality of life of the animals
being raised for meat, an important issue which is often glossed over
in debates about vegetarianism.  We should not be looking so much at
the question of whether we kill and eat animals, but rather at how we
treat the animals while they are alive.

BTW I visited a beef processing plant many years ago, to get some cow
lungs which would be used for dissection in my wife's biology class,
and the treatment of the animals struck me as being very humane.  The
cows were killed instantly and, as nearly as I could judge, painlessly;
the animal's body is then swept away and not seen by the other cows.

It's good terminology. I remember your original post to this list a year
or two ago on 'Neutral Terminology for the Future', or something like
that. I saved it somewhere. Has Anders put it in the >H vocabulary list?

And coupled with an evolutionary analysis we see that the solved
problems that sufficiently cause happiness are likely very few. We are
happy when our bellies are full and we are in no pain and just about to
mate. Then happiness gives way to physical pleasure. What better way to
keep us procreating? Our current way of life tends to complicate the
'about to mate' part. Our mating rituals are intricate, and costly, and
no results are guaranteed. One might say we are the most dejected bunch
of animals ever to walk the planet. Consciousness is a burden.
  
> happiness is not
> necessarily the best way to solve problems.

Any knucklehead can follow an evolutionary analysis from statements that
are nearly universally agreed-upon (such as 'happiness is good') to
'people probably can't help thinking so.' An hypothesis: the more people
agree on something, the more likely it is to be a product of evolution
rather than reason.'

They all had or have at least one use, the use to which they are
probably best suited: causing us to make affirmative efforts toward
seeing our genes into the next generation. In many cases, though, it is
suffering that gets one to self-reflect. The adage is that 'ignorance is
bliss.' I don't know about that, but I do think that bliss can breed
ignorance.

I spent some time reading Bentham and Mill, and they both nod in the
direction of Francis Hutcheson who once wrote (I forget where, offhand)
"That action is best which procures the greatest happiness for the
greatest number."

This is intuitively right to nearly everyone. And that should cause us
to raise an eyebrow. Read the above and replace 'happiness' with
'sadness'. The resulting sentence seems ridiculous, but it's no more
arbitrary than the original. Is there a difference between the two
sentences other than whimsy? Maybe. If there is a difference, then what
causes this difference? I don't think it's wrong to say that we cause
the difference. We just like happiness better. I'm sorry but
that's no standard for a rational person to live by. Or if it is, then
the logic of thinking so ought to be replicable by an equally rational
person.

When you're finished, I'd like to read it. I've been working on a
first-person novella illustrating the Darwin-informed absurdity of human
behavior (I know Camus did something similar, but he suspended
judgment). I'm not really sure I'm the one that ought to be writing it
because it could be decent literature if done correctly. I'm in no
hurry, though. The opening lines are these (approx.): 

"It takes a very clever person to be a good animal. To be a human? That
must take some kind of god."

I envision an implicit transhumanist theme. In defining what man was and
what man is, we define what man was not, is not, and is not yet. This
brings me to a point about transhumanism. Among transhumanists, a group
of people with models that approximate reality better than most, IMO, I
see too many animals eschewing limits and not enough humans. Biological
limits keep us from growing outward, indeed, but they also keep us from
growing inward. My consciousness, surrounded by the universe, seems to
be on the fringes of this deep, dank recess within myself, where all
sorts of stupidity lurks. Some call it the reptile brain, or animal
nature. I just call it unconsciousness. At this point, we don't have the
tech to beat a path across the galaxy, or live forever, or compile
matter, or even interface our brains with a simple calculator. With a
few possible exceptions (you know who you are), the cheerleaders here
are not going to be the ones to make it happen. But there is a lot to do
by even amateurs like myself. There's a lot to do within ourselves. I'm
more interested in man growing inward at this point. We monkeys best
attempt to get the human thing right before fancying ourselves something
greater. If we're going to spill foolishness across the galaxy, we may
as well stay here.

So then the ultimate good must be something along the lines of
'correctly assigning rational probabilities to candidates for the
ultimate good.'

Logically true.

A great and important point. We may regard the set of that which entails
reality to be a complete description of reality, but we have no basis to
assert that the set of all logical truths is a complete description of
same.

It's no wonder that logic implies weird paradoxical conclusions when
applied to things that had no perceptible effect on our evolution. We
evolved in this world of 'macro-sized' objects, where a thing is itself,
and not something else. Some have said that evolution has little
philosophical import, but I can't imagine that it had nothing to do with
the way we reason.

I don't think I've gone this far, and I'm not sure I would know a basic
element of cognition if it thumped me on the noggin, but the idea
resonates. I recall Wittgenstein's attempt to map, principally, the
limits of linguistic ability to express intelligible meaning, and thus
map the limits of conceptual thought. His idea was that if we can't
represent it, we cannot cogitate it. His conclusions basically threw
metaphysics and ethics and aesthetics out the window as principally
meaningless from a logical standpoint, which (through some
misunderstanding it seems) spawned the Vienna Circle and eventually
logical positivism.

Intelligent people, when confronted with (for lack of a better term) a
'philosophical' debate, usually start wrangling over definitions and
terms. I see this all the time, and I do it myself. In some sense, we
are searching for the perfect language of philosophy, the perfect
symbols for our meanings, with an eye toward a self-consistent and
logical body of axioms. For some reason, it's always fruitless. Maybe
you've discovered why. We're arguing about how we think, not what or
why.

If it is logical for the SI to wipe out the gaussians, it is logical for
the gaussians to wipe out the gaussians. If so, and given that we
haven't been wiped out, there is something interfering between this
logical conclusion and actually doing the deed. One candidate is a
strong genetic imperative to survive, and all of the attendant memes
associated therewith. Then again, maybe we have been wiped out
(forcefully uploaded) and are running as a sim in the elsewhere.     

Then again, even if it is logical for an SI to wipe us out, *and* we can
perceive the logic, at least you and I (and presumably others) would
still give birth to the SI simply because logic has no claim to being
the source of objectively true answers. It may be or may not be, but
that's what the SI is for.

Ugh. This is very tricky to follow. The problem here is that what is
logical cannot be illogical, and what is illogical cannot be logical. Or
more to the point, if we know what logic is, we can deduce what illogic
is. So both logical and illogical actions are easily perceptible,
although the set of both together is infinite in scope. You're talking
about something that is neither logic or illogic. That is, logic and
illogic are not flip sides of a coin, but are actually together on one
side, and there is something else on the other side. There's nothing
very helpful about this except insofar as it requires one to admit that
all bets are off.

Here is a consequentialist argument for raising cows not to be eaten:  cows
lives are overall worth living because they produce dairy products that
some people enjoy such as milk, butter, cottage cheese, creme brulee,
tarimasu, not to mention eggnog or a white russian.

Another reason for keeping some Herefords, for example, around would be for
nostalgia, pastoral scenes that people driving down the highway can enjoy
from afar -:)

Fun Problems for Singularitarians:

==

If mortal life is totally meaningless, it would be logical to
exterminate them for their spare atoms.  Mortals, knowing this, will
refuse to create Singularities.  If mortals could bargain with the
Singularity, it would obviously be to the Singularity's advantage to set
aside a quadrillionth of computing power for Permutation-City-style
accomodations, in return for existing at all.  But we can't bargain with
the Singularity until after we've created it and our hold is gone. 
Bearing this in mind, how can you bind the Singularity to the bargain? 
What is the Singularity's logical course of action?

Bonus question one:  Suppose you have a time machine that can ONLY
convey the information as to whether or not the Singularity will happen.
 If you change your plans as a result of the indicator, it resends. 
This is one bit of information and thus can be modulated to convey
messages from the future.  How do you negotiate?

Bonus question two:  In both cases above, it is necessary to plausibly
threaten not to create a Singularity.  The only other option, in the
long run, is exterminating the human race.  This has to be able to
plausibly happen, either as a logical consequence or as an alternate
future.  How do you force yourself to destroy the Earth?

==

If a Singularity is a good thing, why haven't earlier Singularities sent
robot probes to help it happen?  If SIs commit suicide, why isn't the
whole Universe full of mortals?

==

How can you fight your future self, who automatically knows all of your
plans, including the ones you're making right now?  What if the future
self is a transhuman?

==

Is there any way to oppose a Power running a simulation of you?

Me, you, Greg Egan, Mitchell Porter, Billy Brown, Eric Watt Forste and
Lee Daniel Crocker; possibly Anders Sandburg, Max More, Walter John
Williams, Lawrence Watt-Evans, Carl Feynman and Socrates; and quite a
few people I can't think of offhand.  But almost certainly no more than
twenty all told.

No offense intended to those omitted; sanity is a highly specialized
mental discipline, comparable to Zen meditation or lucid dreaming.

Dunno, although 'Algernon' is there.  I was also grateful for the
adoption of "neurohack", which I think is a sufficiently euphonious
buzzword to spawn a dozen startups five years from now, plus an article
in _Wired_.

Exactly.  True statements aren't easily falsified; they drag all their
causal precedents down with them.  If the Sun starts going around the
Earth, you lose General Relativity and the atmosphere floats away.  If
you switch two gods in a creation myth, nothing happens.  There isn't
any logic behind blind hedonism; it's just a blatant assertion.  Anyone
with a memetic immune system sophisticated enough to walk upright should
scream and run away, but apparently there's been some evolutionary
sabotage of the hardware.

Good hook.  My story is on hold until I learn enough cognitive science
and authorship to figure out a personality for the transhuman main
character that preserves plot tension.  Stories are about pain
(particularly emotional pain) and hard choices.  How do you reconcile
that, in a reader-sympathizable way, with a transhuman?

There are two main pieces of advice I can give you:
1.  Catch yourself lying to yourself.  If you can just once perceive the
sensation of knowing the truth but refusing to acknowledge it, you can
apply the lesson and clean out your entire mind.
2.  Study evolutionary psychology, starting with "Man:  The Moral Animal".

That's the Interim Meaning of Life, what you do if you don't know the
External Meaning of Life.  The External meaning, for all we know, could
be some kind of exotic knot of energy.

I think it's because most people, and certainly almost all philosophers,
can't keep track of what's real when they're operating at that level of
abstraction.  I can always keep track of the concrete consequences of
any philosophical proposition; for me the words are only descriptions of
my visualization and not the visualization itself.  I can concretely
define any term whatsoever, as it is actually used - in terms of our
cognitive handling of the word, if necessary.  And that's where
virtually my entire facility with philosophy comes from.  When I talk
about "objective morality", I am talking about an amorphous
(unknown-to-us) physical object which possesses an approximate
correspondence to our cognitive goals and which motivates
superintelligences, not "objective morality".

The "mortals", not the "gaussians".  I'm a Specialist, not a gaussian; I
possess some slight variance relative to the unmodified human race, but
it is not significant on a galactic or supragalactic scale.  I am well
within the mortal side of any mortal/Power duality.  If it comes down to
Us or Them, I'm with Them, but it would be megalomaniac to expect this
to result in any sort of preferential treatment.

We can't see the logic or aren't obeying it.  The SIs aren't here yet.

I'm new to this "extropian zone" and I have no idea if I'm going about 
interjecting to this conversation correctly, but here goes nothing!

Dear Natasha, this isn't so much an objection to your view(personally 
I'm not vegetarian); rather to possibly help inform.  I lived all my 
life on a farm and see where my experience may contribute to this 
dialoge.

I don't know a percise percentage, but I'd say only about half(for sake 
of argument) of the cow population's function is for diary purposes.  So 
that leaves the other half to "deal" with.  My second observation is 
that I agree, It would be nice spare the "post-prime" cows, for 
nostalgia; etc., but on the other hand, this would be INCREDIBLY 
EXPENSIVE!  If it were only one or two cows, a person might be able to 
wing it.  But the vast majority of farms harbor, I don't know, maybe 50+ 
cows.  The feed and medical burdens would, financially, be too much for 
anyone.  Farmers already have enough trouble making ends meet.  Notice  
the disclaimer on news/financial reports, when the average salary for 
americans is displayed; it's only for "NON-FARM PAYROLLS."

Well, I hope that was helpful.  Again, I'm not in the least critisizing 
you; just trying to help.

Eric

A friend sent this to me, thought I'd pass it on.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR LIFE:

 1. Give people more than they expect and do it cheerfully.
 2. Memorize your favourite poem.
 3. Don't believe all you hear, spend all you have or sleep all
you         want.
 4. When you say, "I love you", mean it.
 5. When you say, "I'm sorry", look the person in the eye.
 6. Be engaged at least six months before you get married.
 7. Believe in love at first sight.
 8. Never laugh at anyone's dreams.
 9. Love deeply and passionately. You might get hurt but it's the
only      way to live life completely.
10. In disagreements, fight fairly. No name calling.
11. Don't judge people by their relatives.
12. Talk slow, but think quick.
13. When someone asks you a question you don't want to answer, smile
and     ask, "Why do you want to know?".
14. Remember that great love and great achievements involve great risk.
15. Call your mom.
16. Say "bless you" when you hear someone sneeze.

19. Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship.
20. When you realize you've made a mistake, take immeiate steps

of        luck.
41. Learn the rules then break some.
42. Remember that the best relationship is one where your love for

  IAN: One is neither kind nor cruel to

  IAN: Right, but I think it puts the

  non-birth is not nice to a being we 
  imagine might have existed if born.

  IAN: I think one of the main measures 
  for rights is difference: we're less 
  able to feel for things that are
  different. Bugs are really different
  than us, and the idea of "bug rights"
  isn't too much spoken for. Blacks are
  different than whites, and so historically 
  whites have given them less-to-no rights.

  This is why I think that those that extend
  rights to animals perceive a similarity;
  they perceive that this other entity sees 
  and feels like I do, and a spark of "self"
  is therefore seen in the other being, and
  with that perception comes a compassion.

I think you have a good point.  Too many cows would be expensive.
(Especially for the farmer who has a big headache today with the expense of
pigs).  So, if 1/2 of the population of cows that are used for dairy
purposes were also in the fields grazing aesthetically, then they would be
pre-post-prime nostalgia, and later, in their retiring years, they would
inevitably be, as you say, post-prime.  

>Well, I hope that was helpful.

Well, I'm not a farmer by profession nor a cow eater by trade.  While the
cows may escape my table, not all living creatures do.

Okay, I think that's fine. If you take "atheism" as an ism, then it
requires a positive belief. My main concern was to note that it's just as
legitimate to define "atheism" as simply "lack of belief in a god". Can we
agree that it can be reasonably defined both ways?

You might define "communism" as "the belief that all property should be
owned in common and not individually". Would that mean that communism was
all about belief? The definitions of agnosticism above make *knowledge* the
issue, not belief. It's a belief about whether theological issues are
within the purview of knowledge.

Two points which might help explain why I hold to the view that agnosticism
is about one's views on what is knowable and not about the content of a
belief:

Taking atheism in its more general sense "lack of belief", then I think one
can be an atheist and an agnostic at the same time. This would be someone
who they cannot know one way or the other about the existence of a god, and
who therefore does not believe. (They would not, if consistent, also deny
the existence of such a being, though they might think it unlikely, but be
unable to show it unlikely enough to constitute knowledge of non-existence.)

More controversially, I think one could be a theist and an agnostic. This
would be someone who beliefs, but admits that they do not know, at least in
any normal sense of "know" that they would apply to anything else. They
might say they "have faith" without claiming this to be a special form of
knowledge. While being both a theist and an agnostic is logically
consistent (though irrational), it's probably not common. That's because to
admit that you believe without having knowledge is likely to make you
realize you're being unreasonable. Instead, most theists insist that their
"faith" is really some special foundation for knowledge--such as through
religious experience, etc.

Okay, so I don't we disagree about very much! Probably just the issue of
whether agnosticism is about knowledge or belief. I'm not going to dig into
that further, since it will take us deep into the swamps of epistemology!

So you're saying that society is the definer of morals?  I think that that
statement might find a few dissenters here.

I don't have a right to live.  I have a very strong 'wish' to live.  I want
to live and will do (almost) anything in my power to continue living.  At a
very basic level, I've dimissed morality as a creation with no validity and
based my actions around aesthetics - ie what I liek and dislike.  And I like
living.  And I like having access to things.  And I like other people to be
nice to me, so I tend to treat them in a way which will cause them to do so.

You know, I could have sworn that I read an article in New Scientist over

animals, who try as hard as possible not to get caught.

The problem being that lots of people feel that people torturing animals is
in some way the same as torturing people.  In fact, unless you in some way
see people as not being animals, then it is the same.  Admittedly, a society
that sets itself up as either owners or owned must be definition see huamns
as 'just plain better', but I have to admit that I'd rather not live in a
society where people could torture animals in their own home if they felt
like it.

I thought you were arguing in favour of an absolute morality.  Now suddenly
it's subjective (I get to decide).

If you've decied that morality is not objective and that your morals are
merely your opinions, fair enough, I'm glad your being rational.  If not,
please answer the question.


Or, if anyone else can answer the question....

Until the Singularity encounters an atom-shortage, what is the motivation to
go out of its way, allocating any computation time, to determine the optimal
way to exterminate all sentient life?  If a Singularity is efficient on
every level then the only time it will bother to destroy humans is when they
somehow conflict with the Singularity's objectives.

I'm not sure I understand this question.  The time machine exists in the
pre-Singularity period otherwise its information is useless.  However, how
can such information be useful in negotiating with a Singularity when the
Singularity does not exist?  The more effective machine would send back
information about whether humans will still exist at some distant point in
time.  This machine would evidence the fidelity of the Singularity to the
bargain.  However, such a machine would only ensure survival to that distant
point in time and not beyond.

Since the motivation to not create a Singularity is to preserve the
continued existence of humans, this option seems unacceptable.  We could
probably slay all child molesters by nuking the entire planet but we'd also
kill all the children (and everyone else) also.  The marginal benefit of the
action does not outweight the marginal cost.

The clear truth is that humans can not protect themselves from quantitative
SIs and definitely not qualitative SIs.  The only hope for human minds is to
be an integral part of such entities.

I have a rule of not passing on replicating net-packets, regardless of
how good their contents are. A bit of memetic gardening.

Overall, the idea of gathering together useful heuristics is good, no
need to reinvent the wheel all the time. But packaging them as easily
spreadable memes, as saying or spams, has the risk of putting a
selection pressure on them for replication rather than truth or
usability.

>  1. Give people more than they expect and do it cheerfully.

it can help set up mutual cooperation by showing that you are willing
(and able) to give away good stuff. The drawback is that you make
exploiters aware of the potential victim. Psychologically it is
probably rather healthy, both individually and socially, but one
should remember the exploiter caveat.

>  2. Memorize your favourite poem.

This is good advice. Both a bit of memory training, a way of exploring it further and a way of having something beautiful to say. My latin teacher asked us to memorize two quotes to each lesson - it isn't very hard, and after the course one at least has a large number of quotes.

A good psychological trick.

Why? What is the advantage in this romantic idea? Perhaps to give
people hope. But it is really a very cultural thing.

> 14. Remember that great love and great achievements involve great risk.

Do they always? I think the greatest achievements are those that are
so well done they are unstoppable. Of course, they are rare.

> 15. Call your mom.

An interesting idea to explore is to extend the mom idea of a
supporter/nurturer/adviser into business. Maybe many small companies
(and even more networks) would become more efficient if they hired a
corporate mom.

> 16. Say "bless you" when you hear someone sneeze.

It is amusing that this is in the same list as the other
semi-christian advice since it is really a roman superstition about
getting rid of demons. (In swedish we say "prosit", which is a
shortening of the latin "pro bonum sit", "may it be for good").

> 17. When you lose, don't lose the lesson.

Probably one of the most important heuristics around. Once you start
to see even mistakes as learning experiences, their sting fades and
you become more alert.

Another good point. Amazing how many people don't apply it.

Good time management; leaving mistakes for tomorrow starts a vicious
circle of guilt and procrastination.

Actually true. Very interesting.

"Woe to the unarmed prophets", as somebody said. Also, knowing how to
defend oneself has good effects on self-esteem.

On this list it can be literal :-) (The shareware version Anders will
ship Real Soon Now, right after the Singularity :-)

> 34. Pray. There's immeasurable power in it.

The interesting thing is of course that the psychological benefits of
praying doesn't seem to be linked to any religion; does anybody have
any references to comparative studies? Some of the most quoted prayer
studies have however been found to be flawed, so caveat lector.

The problem is of course what attitude to take.

> 37. Don't trust a man/woman who doesn't close his eyes when you

Another interesting insight, since closing one's eyes seems to be part
of the plasure/smile response; if they don't close their eyes, they
are likely not enjoying it as much as they should, or have other
hidden emotions.

> 38. Once a year, go someplace you've never been before.

Also good advice. New experiences make the synapses grow.

And: you can't break the rules until you learn them.

Of course, character can be changed. Maybe we should look for the
neurobiological and psychological basis of willpower?

This is of course the hook of the meme, but it embodies (despite the
hyperbole) an insight into network economy. The more people
implementing a few of these heuristics, the nicer things will be -
especially for others with the heuristics.

Why not?  Again, as I've said, not too many people are going to
torture animals in the first place.  If you decide to create laws
against it, you're just cheapening everyone's property by telling them
what they can and can't do with it.  If you (or society or whatever)
learns that Joe is torturing his turtle and ferrets, then you know
that Joe is a weirdo and you won't deal with him and he'll suffer
economically for his deeds.  Whose standard decides how to define
torture?  Some people will define it simply as "owning" an animal. 
Other's will define it as slaughtering for eating, other's will define
it as you and I might as causing needless suffering.  Whose standard? 
Whose code?  Whose morals?

Interesting concept.  You're still of course reducing the world to the
owners and the owned, with no room for fuzziness in your descriptions, but
that's up to you.

You still haven't said why it is 'right' that people should not be slaves.
You've just said that you don't want to be one.

It is an interesting point that you cannot make someone a slave who would
rather die than be one.  But then the majority of us don't fall into either
master or slave categories according to most defiitions.

Whoever is applying the decision.  If I see someone torturing an animal for
no good reason, I will treat them in the sameway as I would treat someone
torturing a child for no reason, or torturing a person for no reason.

There are numerous people who believe that animals have, at the very least,
limited rights - in the same way that children have limited rights.  That
they occupy the planet too and while human's take precedence (in most
peoples opinions), they do not take ultimate precedence.

Its unavoidable, once you look at the problem from a certain perspective.
Once you decide to look and see if there is an objective morality, you have
(broadly speaking) three possible results:

1.  You find external, objectively verifiable proof that some particular
moral system is correct.  Then you're pretty much stuck with following it.

2.  You find external, objectively verifiable proof that there is no such
moral system. You can do anything you like, and it doesn't mean anything.

3.  You find that you can't tell for sure if such a system exists or not.
This is where most humans give up, because the problem seems intractable.
However, in our current age the correct response would seem to be: "If I
can't figure it out, I need to improve my ability to figure things out and
then come back to the problem."  With IE already on the horizon, it begins
to make sense to think in terms of preparing to search for a real answer
instead of just contemplating our navels.

As reported in the Washington Post today, Icelands' government has 
agreed to a potential deal with Roche Holding AG and other 
pharmaceutical companies and researchers to utilize a central database of 
their citizen's DNA.  Because of geographical and historical factors, 
Iceland has maintained a genetic uniformity that would allow for easier 
gene prospecting.  Many Icelandic politicians view this as a way of 
cultivating a new national resource to alleviate economic problems of 
high unemployment and scarce natural resources.  

Kari Stefansson, CEO of deCODE Genetics proposed the plan and would 
hold a 12-month monopoly on data marketing rights.  He proposes that 
individual identification data would not be removed from the DNA coding 
within the database, but rather heavily encoded to maintain privacy.  
Individuals have a period of time in which to ' opt out', and after 
that all of their medical information would be recorded in the 
database after blood is drawn.  

As you can imagine, this has precipitated a complex public policy 
debate, with several ethics and privacy groups raising significant 
objections about the structure of the database.  A government committee 
has been established to hash out these issues.  This will definitely 
be a story to follow in the next year.

Rather short-sighted, if you ask me. There are lots of things I don't like

I think prudence makes a much firmer grounding for ethical principles than
does mere pleasure seeking/pain avoidance.

That's certainly a wise heuristic.

Depends on what you call "infidelity". Some species are promiscuous, others
mate for life. In those species where promiscuity is the norm, it's
perfectly "acceptable" behavior. Promiscuity is not infidelity, since no
long-term bond of trust is expected. Individuals of species with a
tradition of "marriage" OTOH are seldom observed to violate the bond--and
those who practice infidelity often face sanctions.

Thanks.  I don't have any arguments with your list.  I would put Eric

Agreed.  You can only build a chain of ungrounded symbols so long, then the
system starts spitting out garbage.  IMO there are at least two limitations
at work here - you can only handle so many layers of indirection, and you
have very little working memory with which to perform mental operations.
Since human memory and logic are fuzzy, overflowing either boundary simply
produces nonsense output - and since people don't normally have error
checking at this level, they usually don't realize they aren't making sense.

I would presume you still have the limited-working-memory problem when

Unless they use rationality to divide people from animals.  Then people who
fit their definition of rational, within the limits of available processing
power, might survive a general extermination.  Not a likely scenario, but
not impossibly unlikely, either.

Is this notion coherent?  Does it make sense to speak of a proof that
a moral system is correct?

Earlier I proposed that a "moral system" was a method of ranking possible
actions.  Given an organism, a situation, and a set of possible actions,
the moral system is an algorithm for ranking the actions in order (or at
least selecting the highest-ranked action).  We interpret the ranking as
being in order of most-moral to least-moral, but mathematically it's just
a ranking.

Expressed in these abstract terms, there is no way to distinguish a
"good" moral system from a "bad" one.  Every ranking algorithm is a
moral system, and they are all on equal footing.  You can then
introduce a "meta-moral system" which ranks moral systems.  Given all
possible algorithms (moral systems), it puts them into a rank order.
Again, we would interpret this ranking as most-moral moral system to
least-moral moral system, but mathematically it is just a ranking.

For claim (1) above to be true, there must be a meta-moral system which
selects a given moral system as the best one.  But of course there are
such, in fact there are nearly an infinite number of such meta-moral
systems.  How do we specify which one is best?

Do we then have to introduce a meta-meta moral system which will rank
meta-moral systems?

I don't see how to ground this regress.  It doesn't even seem to me that
it makes sense to say that a particular ranking is objectively selected.

I'd like to see an example of an objectively-best moral system for a
simple system.  Consider a simple alife program, a simulated organism which
interacts with others in a simulated world, reproducing and eating and
trying to stay alive.  Any algorithm it uses to decide what to do can be
interpreted as a moral system.  What would it mean for there to be an
proof that a particular algorithm is morally correct?

Does it really seem that the problem is that we are not smart enough to
solve this?  It seems to me that the problem is simply that the question
is meaningless.

I have repeatedly stated that I don't believe in objective morals.  So in
the above statement 'valid' and rightfully' do not make syntactic sense.
There is no 'right', 'wrong', 'valid', 'invalid', 'good', 'evil' except
within moral systems.

So, I like Flu shots.  Becasuwe I recognise their long term value.  Liking

i'm not _entitled_ to anything.  I have no rights, except as a social
construct agreed between two or more people.  Rights are an _invention_.
You can't point to one, or hold one up or stick a needle into it.  It's a
theoretical creation of the human minds.


I keep pointing out that I don't believe these things exist and then you ask
me where they are.

I feel like I'm stuck with a bad copy of Eliza:

Me:  I don't believe in morals

You: That's a rather immoral thing to say.

Ack!

Sorry, if I'm causing offence, but I'm still waiting for one example for a
purely logical basis for morals or ethics that does not depend on what you,
I or anyone else thinks or feels.

The article included geese (long thought to mate for life) and found that
they in fact didn't.  They just hid it very well (it used genetics to track
parentage and found it wasn't what it should have been).  It also looked at
primate (I think chimpanzees) and found that some of them were expert at
arranging assignations.  One particularly amusing example was of two
chimpanzees pretending to forage with their top halves while having sex with
their bottom halves, both of them surpressing the normal chimpanzee mating
noises (which are rather loud).

  IAN: I agree. There's an interesting correlation
  between serial killers, like Jeffrey Dommer (sp?),
  and torture of animals, such that a high percentage
  of the most brutal serial killers first tortured
  animals, usually when they were kids. They see
  the similarity between humans and animals, but
  only in the worst ways imaginable. With this,
  we can see that the way person x treats animals
  is a measure of how person x could treat humans.
  A society that was particularly brutal toward
  animals would probably be more inclined than 
  the less brutal society to effect various 
  forms of brutality on the human animal.

I agree with Hal; I think it's easy to find an optimal moral code once you 
make some basic decisions as to what you regard as a good outcome, but you 
can't say that one moral system is objectively better than another because
you have to make those initial subjective decisions. 

For example, I think that taking a short-term loss to make a long-term gain 
is better than taking a short-term gain for a long-term loss, which is one 
reason why I think that libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism are much 
better than authoritarian systems; limited government can't stop people
starving in the streets, but it can't lock you all up in concentration
camps either. But that doesn't mean that I'd be able to prove that 
they're objectively better than socialism, unless the others also agree
with my underlying subjective choices.

Now, you can probably come up with a set of rational, subjective,
transhuman axioms which most of us would agree with and work out an
optimal moral system from that; but it still wouldn't be an *objectively*
optimal system because others have different axioms. They might be
irrational, but irrationality is their choice.

  IAN: But that argument fails to observe 
  the fact that there's a difference between 
  a chair and an animal... owning a self-owner,
  a sentient being, is not the same as owning 
  a chair. An animal is inherently a self-owner
  because it claims to own its body; apart from
  existing, a chair or table make no such claim.

  The fact that sawing the leg off a chair and 
  sawing the leg off a live dog would be drasti-
  cally different events (one being neutral and 
  one being a sight of horror and pain) is just
  the measure that animals are not the same kind
  of property as inanimate objects. "Caretaker" 
  is the proper context of the animal "owner."

That kind of "rights" are just some people's subjective opinion. The
only "absolute" or objective right is that of superior force. So for
example "human rights" are only meaningful when those that
champion them have the power to enforce their will. To paraphrase: 
"(human) rights come from the barrel of a gun". Note: of course
others don't always have to be threatened to accept your world
view; they can also be bribed. However, (as long as there's a
significant diversity of opinion) it still comes down to power,
be it financial or military, in the end.

Tongue in Cheek: Maybe we could have Cow Land up in Wisconsin (pretty
much is already) where you pay $25 and get to drive through the
verdant pastures and gawk at the bovines in their natural environment.
 For another $10 you could have your picture taken standing next to
one of the majestic beasts.

That might help pay for it.  :)

This would seem reasonable, if it were not for the fact that it searching
for morals logically is like asking a computer for the meaning of life (an
idea which Douglas Adams quite successfully took the piss out of in
Hitch-hikers Guide to the Galaxy).  The problem is that we don't know what
the question means.

Asking what is moral effectively boils down to asking "What should I do in
situation X?".  The answer is that the question is meaningless.  A
syntacticalyl similar question that is meaningful is "What should I do in
situation X do achieve Y."  If you do not know where you are going, you
cannot ask for directions.  (Aaaah!  Too much Zen!  Must resist!).

The main problem with most philosophical enquiry at a low/uneducated level
is incorrect usage of the word 'why'.  Frequently if you rephrase the
question without using 'why' in it, you realise that the answer is easier
than it appears.  For instance "Why are we here" can be rephrased as 'what
sequence of events caused us to be here." which can be analysed
scientifically, or it can be reduced to "What were the purpouses of the
people in coming here?" which can also be solved through enquiry.  Most of
the problems that people have in philosophy simply come from asking
questions which don't actually make sense.

But I digress.

"[A]bsolute rights" is a red herring, as I have never claimed that anyone has
an absolute right to use the spectrum.  Your right to swing your fist stops
where my nose starts, and all that.  So the question becomes, if we want to
pursue your analogy, whether the early Federal Aviation Administration would
have violated property rights in saying to someone who had been peaceably
enjoying a 1000m tower before the advent of air travel, "We claim all airspace
above 100m.  Tear down your tower."

You might support the FAA's claim as a matter of public necessity and happily
invoke the takings clause, but tearing down the tower would at any rate
violate property rights.  The question of building a 1000m tower *now* is
distinctly different, given that prior uses of the airspace support a claim to
an easement.  But I never claimed with regard to spectrum that anyone had an

I have yet to hear a description of such a process that would, absent
agreement between all owners of all property in a broadcast area, recreate
something analogous to trademark rights in the spectrum.  At any rate, it
seems like an awfully painful and utterly impractical way to reach the same
result and carries little weight in terms of justification.  Otherwise one
could argue for, say, regulating the peaceable enjoyment of blue bottles on
grounds that *if* all property owners in North America agreed to limit the use
of blue bottles on their property then they *might* thereafter contract to
make that right alone transferable.  What is the point of such an argument?

Yeah, some time ago I saw a very interesting documentary about an American
serial killer from a few decades ago, possibly the same guy; I'm no expert
on serial killers so I don't know when he was caught. His basic problem 
seemed to be that he didn't see any difference between humans and other 
animals; he hunted them, took them home, and butchered them just like the
deer he hunted at other times. It was hard to see him as evil, rather just
someone whose mental programming was fundamentally broken.

On the animal rights front, personally I have no problem with hunting;
but I dislike any kind of torture to humans or animals. When people start
to talk about giving rights to animals it makes me think of the medieval
courts charging pigs with murder, and other such historical oddities. If
animals are smart enough to have rights, then they should be smart enough 
to have the responsibilities too... and how are you going to explain to a 
fox that rabbits have a right to life? This seems to be an example of the
serial killer's problem in reverse; he thought humans were animals, the
animal rights folks think animals are human.

Sounds to me like your premise is strained.  A completely
logical SI would recognize that it's own existence has no
more "meaning" than does human existence.  It would have
to self-destruct if it determined that this was a sufficient
criterion for extermination.  IMO, there's no such thing as
meaning.  There's only relevance.  And if it came to the
point where our existence became irrelevant to the SI,
why would it logically follow that it would then go out of
it's way to exterminate us?

I agree with Justin Jones who succinctly said:

"I dont care if people say there is a certain probability of other
intelligent life out there, I see no evidence of past singularities or other
civilizations so I don't assume there have been any."

You enlist the aid of comrades whose actions will be unknowable by
your future self.  If my future self is a transhuman . . . I'll leave him
alone!  Whatever he's doing will be in my best interest regardless
of how it appears.  :-)

Get your advanced AI that's could become a singularity.  Bargain with it.
Expect it to lie to you.  Give up.

I thought we were just going to allow humanity to die out.  who's destroying
the earth (still beyond our capability, I believe)?

All structures break down in time, unless the singularity finds an endless
supply of energy (not just a very large one, an infinite one), it will
eventually succumb to entropy.  What we need to do is maximise our overall
life worth.  Whether this is 5 million years of 'quite a good time' or a
thousand years of 'extremely good time', if creating a singularity reduces
it to 'fifteen nminutes of being dissassembled', I'm not in favour of it.
Unless being dissassembled is a lot more fun than it sounds.

Too early in the universe?  SI's don't want competition and space travel is
too much of a pain in the neck to be worthwhile?  God doesn't like it and
has put impervious crystal shells around each solar system (cf David Brin
short story)?.  They are out there, but are making too much money
broadcasting the game show "Humans" back to their home planet to interrupt
our fun (cf Robert Rankin - Armageddon the Musical)?

I'm sure I read this somewhere, possibly a very old issue of Warlock, but I
can't be sure.  If your future self can fight you, it implies that the
future is set, in which case whatever happens, happens - it's all
predestination.

>Is there any way to oppose a Power running a simulation of you?

Transfer your simulation into a body outside the simulation and find it's
off switch. (large red button right next to the 'self destruct button')

Humans can no more fight powers and singularities than ants can fight
humans.  Sheer coincidence can once in a while allow an ant to give a human
an infectious disease, but that's about your limit.

I've had this discussion with militant vegetarians before; their argument
seems to be that they're so concerned about the welfare of cows that they'd
rather see them extinct than used for food (and I'm not paraphrasing, that's
what I finally get out of most of them if I keep pushing hard enough).
Personally I find that idea totally irrational, but that won't convince 
them of anything.

If the life of a Power is meaningless, there is no reason to bother
disassembling the mortals.  If it isn't, it would be logical to upgrade the
mortals to a state in which their existence can be meaningful (resource
scarcity might change that, but seems unlikely to actually be a factor).

If that logic fails, I see no way for mortals to bargain with Powers.  There
is no way to enforce the contract, after all.

This is another instance of the identity issue.  Every time you change the
future, you are dealing with a different Singularity.  You aren't
negotiating, you are exploring the set of possible futures - but you have no
way to tell when you hit the one you want.

Important side issue: The future hasn't happened yet.  Any communication
that moves backwards in time, and is important enough to have an effect on
human activities, will significantly change the future it came from.  This
implies that it is impossible to have a conversation across time, even if
you have a temporal communicator - the party in the past is talking to a
different future each time he sends a reply.

Given that you could negotiate, a threat not to create a particular
Singularity would seem to be sufficient.  But if you needed the big stick,
the way to do it is simply to pick the right human to do the negotiating and
give him the controls to the doomsday device.

Of course, IMO we couldn't actually build a doomsday device that would work
reliably the first time  - the only feasible approach would be a series of
gigantic nukes (at least 10^4 megatons, maybe bigger), and testing the
design would be rather difficult.

The only response I've ever seen that fits the observations is that there
isn't anyone out there.  It doesn't seem to make much sense, but then, that
just implies that there are important things we don't know yet.

> How can you fight your future self, who automatically knows

If its important enough, kill yourself.  Less drastically, become someone
you won't end up needing to oppose.  Personal evolution is not a random
process for rational minds.

> Is there any way to oppose a Power running a simulation of you?

No.  A transhuman, sure, but not a Power.  At best, it sees everything you
will ever think of and lots of things you won't.  At worst, it can always
foresee exactly what you will do.  Either way, you can only beat it if the
odds are stacked so hard in your favor that nothing the Power does will let
it win - which doesn't seem to be a likely situation.

BTW, what does it need the sim for?

  IAN: That's really mixing things up. By "human"
  you mean to say "sentient," and as such, animal
  rights folks think animals are sentient (not
  human), and indeed, like humans, they are. 
  So sentence is a shared feature of all 
  animals, including the human animal.

  The case for non-cruelty to nonhuman animals 
  is the case for noncruelty to sentient beings 
  (the set of all animals including humans). 

  The evidence indicates that those willing to 
  inflict cruelty on nonhuman animals are more
  inclined to inflict the same on human beings.
  So seeing the fact of similarities between
  animals isn't the problem (as you suggest) 
  but it's the acceptance of cruelty that is.

You purposely left out that the same study found that people raised as hunters
have an incidence of such violent crime far below the average, which is a
markedly different result than those who torture animals....

Not necessarily, diamond is an excellent material but the biochemistry
found on wet planetary surfaces can't produce it (the forces involved
in its synthesis are likely beyond those proteins can stand). It is
beyond a very big fitness desert.  Life haven't evolved spaceflight,
for the same reasons.

The argument "it hasn't evolved yet" is strong, but only when
referring to what existing inside volume of forms terrestrial life can
reach. It is a good argument against a biological organism overrunning
the entire biosphere (haven't happened at least since the split
between procaryotes and eucaryotes), but not against grey goo.

(It should be noted that evolution is highly contingent; the number of
forms life can take is much larger than the number of forms evolution
can test, so evolution is just a small cluster of species exploring a
huge search space. So there might still be surprises out there.)

I don't think so. In our paper, Henrik and I sketch a diamondoid goo
device that seems feasible - tricky, but not impossible given nanotech
(it is mainly "off the shelf parts" from Nanosystems). But the problem
for goo is that it has to be able to survive well enough in the
environment (which includes hungry bacteria, radiation, weird
chemicals and other nastiness), get nutrients and reproduce. It is not
trivial in the real world, it might work nicely in a test tube. Making
goo that would thrive in the human body turns out to be even harder,
given what the immune system can do with free radicals and other
nastiness.

What I wonder is the relative energy levels between (say) diamondoid
and living matter. Life cannot digest diamondoid (as far as I know),
which means that even a bad replicator could slosly convert the
biosphere to diamondoid without being the unstoppable wave of grey goo
we usually talk about (just bigger and bigger piles of diamond on the
deep sea floor).

Yes, this is the sane thing to do. But what must be studied is the
risks of insane things, so we will know how dangerous the area will
be. If it is safe, great, if it is dangerous we better find ways of
handling it, and if it is nearly impossible to avoid disasters we
should look at escape opportunities. I remain an optimist, though.

For us, now, I agree completely.  The question is this: is the fact that we
can find no firm grounding for morality a fundamental feature of reality, or
the result of our own cognitive limitations?  Is there a way of grounding
that regress, or of reformulating the problem so that you don't need to?  I
don't know, and I doubt that anyone else does - I don't know that I could
even tell the difference between a real proof and a flawed one.

Actually, I doubt we could get even a majority of the list to agree to any
except the most general statements.  At best, we might get a half dozen
systems that draw very different conclusions from similar basic tenets.
That's our second morality problem - given a set of basic axioms, what
choices should we make?

The only way I can see of answering the first question is to create beings
who do not share our limitations, and see what they come up with.  Answering
the second question for any given set of axioms (proven or not) seems to be
a more tractable problem, but it would require a large-scale application of
the scientific method to the field that is unlikely to happen any time soon.

In the meantime, I regard the objective of finding the answers to these
questions  to be a high-ranking goal (though obviously not the only one - I
still have a best-guess moral system to use until/unless a real one is
found).

Let's say that a "reality system" is a method of sorting the space of
all objects into "real" and "unreal" objects.  Thus the Sun would be
real, while unicorns are unreal*.  How can you possibly prove something
is real without reference to a cause or perception previously known to
be real?  The causal regress winds up with the Hard Problem of the First
Cause, while the perception regress winds up at the Hard Problem of
Consciousness.  And yet despite this, our Universe does exist, and we do
have conscious experiences.

If you wish an example of a goal made solid, consider the qualia of
pleasure.  I don't know if that's an objective morality, but it's a good
argument that the probability of objective morality is nonzero.

You could argue that an opinion system assigns rankings to reality
systems, and a meme system assigns rankings to opinion systems, and so
on and so on... but this is building castles on top of air when we
should be digging down.  To solve the problem of consciousness, to
determine what it is about qualia that allows us to be absolutely sure
of their reality, we need to dissect cognition and the brain, not invent
observers of observers of observers.  To solve the First Cause, we need
to probe the laws of physics, not invent Creators to create gods to
create worlds.  To solve objective morality, we probably need to solve
the other two problems, just to grab a handhold on what morality is made of.

> I don't see how to ground this regress.  It doesn't even seem to me that

I don't see how to ground any of the regresses.  The world doesn't make
sense to me at all.  I think I'm on the wrong cognitive level to solve
these kinds of problems.  You wouldn't expect a Neanderthal to solve
them; and I wouldn't expect anyone but me to solve them; and I don't
expect me to solve them.

So would I!

Maybe it is meaningless.  In fact, it probably is meaningless.  We've
proven not only that everything is meaningless but also that we don't
exist and neither does reality.  As far as we can tell the space of
choices is an indistinguishable blur, so is the space of truths, and
there's nobody to decide.  So how can we choose anything, even to walk
across the room?

We're probably asking the wrong question from beginning to end.  We're
lost.  We don't know what the hell we're doing.  We don't know what it's
all for, or why, or whether we're doing anything right, or if we're
asking the right questions, or even if we're capable of asking the right
questions.  We are in a fog.  We are looking through mud.  We are blind.
 We don't even have a visual cortex.  Under the circumstances, there are
two possibilities:

1)  We give up and blindly cling to our current set of priorities.
2)  We start trying to clear away the fog, improve our perceptions,
write a visual cortex, raise the level of cognition.

That's the logic.
Anything more complicated is just a translation.

Hi everyone! Just a first sign that TV99 is on its way. 

We have put up a (very) preliminary page for it at
http://www.aleph.se/TransVision

Right now we are still on the planning stage, and would like to get
feedback from you. We are especially interested in hearing roughly how
many who will attend and what areas you think we should discuss.

Mot likely most of the planning discussions will be on the exi-euro
list.

Who ever said IE was a simple logic-enhancement?  IMO, the biggest problem
with any search for answers is the fact that the question won't fit in a
human mind.  You start searching down ever-more-abstract chains of
reasoning, and eventually find yourself chasing your tail.  If you want to
be an SI-philosopher, the first thing you need is an enhanced ability to
deal with complex systems of abstract, self-referential ideas.

Maybe, maybe not.  All we can really say is that *we* can't see any way of
resolving the problem - but I don't see any way to make a Grand Unified
Theory work, either.  That doesn't mean someone else can't do it.  Now, the
last few millennia of philosophical 'thought' gives us good reason to think
unenhanced humans will never crack the problem, but that still doesn't mean
an SI can't.

Of course, it might be that there truly is no possible way of grounding a
moral system in anything substantial.  In that case an SI could probably
demonstrate that there is no objective morality, and you'd get to say "See,
I told you so."  :-)
Even then, IMO it is important to make the effort to find the answer.

Samael, I'm still waiting for one example for a purely logical basis for
logic. Have you got one? Any modern physicist knows that all that exists is
(1) entities that are neither particles nor waves (2) in spacetime.

Now, use that model of existence to get your car washed. ...to go to the
movies. ...to make a million dollars. ...to get elected president.

MMB

PS: Have you read any William James?

PPS: assuming you're serious, and not just arguing from habit or for fun,
you might want to investigate Pirsig's Metaphysics of Quality. I find it
interesting and provocative. And, potentially, a metaphysics that connects
to physics *and* morality. Given that model, one of the tough parts is
"why" there are multiple regimes (Pirsig says four). But what's moral in
one regime has nothing to do with what's moral in another.

Objective ethics: a group of heuristics which have proven over time (even at
evolutionary time scales) to provide the greatest benefit to the long term
rational self interest of an individual or group that adheres to the heuristics.
Because we live in an objective reality ruled by concrete laws of physics at the
time and space scales at which we as individuals and as a group exist, which
dictate the structure and behavior of the systems or methods called 'evolution',
and 'society', that objective reality dictates the types of heuristics which
fulfill the first premise.

ok, we are getting somewhere. you understand the concept of long term rational
self interest, which is distinctly different from opportunism or hedonism, which
you seem to be more aligned with.

On the contrary. As Aristotle and Socrates have both elucidated, that a being is
endowed with something by nature gives the being a natural right to use that
something. I am given the ability to speak, so I have a natural right to speak.
I have reproductive organs, so I have a natural right to reproduce. I have legs,
therefore I have a natural right to ambulate. I have two hands, therefore I have
the ability to wield and manipulate any object I can grasp, and I have a brain
that can remember, create, plan, imagine, as well as many other things. Since we
were not endowed with any natural weapons to defend ourselves outside of our
hands and minds, but can wield any weapon we create with our hands, we have a
natural right to keep and bear arms, and use those arms in our defense.
Moreover, we are endowed with life, and therefore have the right to keep that
life. While this also says that animals may have the right to life as well, we
were evolved as predators and scavengers (as well as agricultural gatherers),
and therefore have a natural right to kill animals and eat meat.

I have an Algernic disability with respect to symbols; this includes
both chunking and what you call indirection.  I can't work with
abstractions from abstractions at all.  I can't manipulate systems of
systems; only the grounding.  My abilities are all oriented towards
digging down, reducing, asking why; not building symbols about symbols. 
I will never understand most of "Godel, Escher, Bach" this side of the dawn.

I can't get lost in a maze of words; I don't have the infrastructure.

As for limited working memory, most of my thinking is about the relation
between two concrete objects, which - counting the relation, the
objects, and my thinking - takes only four places in short-term memory*.

I don't think that my level of rationality is so far away from an
idiot's, relative to the total width of the spectrum, that a random
division would lie anywhere in the middle of the human race.  The only
major targetable landmark is realizing that your current actions can be
dependent on your projection of the Singularity's behavior and that a
possible causal link exists.

(*) = Not a very good way of looking at it.  The objects and their

facts, or vice versa.  Anyway, I don't run out of RAM.

I think I can now extract the basic point of contention:

Subjectivist: If there were an objective morality, I would have found it
by now.
Objectivist:  I don't even understand the problem.  Recurse on an IQ upgrade.

Does anyone disagree with this stereotype?

  IAN: Why is it necessary to make a personal

  and thus your claim that I am is a lie.
  What I say is based on something I saw 
  on the program "The Justice Files."

  If the study you refer to pertains to modern
  times, I'd note that most raised as hunters
  live in rural areas with lower crime rates,
  so your implication that killing some animals
  engenders compassion for others could be false.

We could call it "Angus Park" or "Steer Wars" or something like that. 
I imagine a two hour movie about a team of really skinny scientists
thoroughly bored on an island over run with gentle cattle and pigs. 
Then someone gets hungry and animals start mysteriously disappearing. 
It's up to Jeff Goldblum to track down the evil meat eater and make
him pay...

I am not a proponent of animal torture.  I would never knowingly
torture an animal.  I suppose re: this entire discussion that
ownership of an animal may need to be looked at as a different sort of
ownership than the ownership of a chair, but I'm not clear as to why.

I'm from Mississippi and I remember my grandparents telling me how
they used to kill hogs by dumping them live into scalding water.  Then
they ate 'em.  Yum.  Was that torture?  

I'm all for the wholesale butchering of cows and hogs and fish and
other yummy animals.  I don't think they should be unnecessarily
harmed, but I have no problem with raising animals for the sole
purpose of killing em and eating em.  We've (humanity) been doing it
for a long, long time.

How many people say they're for ethical treatment of animals and only
mean the cute ones?  How many skittish vegitarians are more than
willing to smack the shit out of a spider or a fly (or have their
boyfriends do it for them)?  How many of us give a damn when we step
on an ant bed?  Who'd feel bad if I shot a snake (or cut it in two
with a machete)?

I'm not sure that non-sentient beings have a right to their own
"selves."  Will have to have a discussion about the treatment of
bacteria and amoebas?

Having grown up in rural Mississippi I have observed the following:

Most people's houses contain small arsenals of hunting weapons - shot
guns, rifles, bows, etc.

Everyone I knew that owned a gun was almost anally obsessed with
safety when they were hunting.  Even Bubba and his buddy Clem
Ledbetter were very careful with their fire arms.

These folks teach their children how to shoot and how to do it safely.
 My grandad taught my mom how to shoot when she was about 8 or 9. 
He'd make her shoot at rocks he threw up in the air until she could
hit every single one (I'm not making it up!).

Hunting is a religion to these people.  Indeed, it almost has to be;
they ran out all the natural predators years ago - if they didn't
hunt, the entire state of Mississippi would be over run with deer.

Almost all of the gun related violence that happened around my
hometown was attributed to the urban savages with illegal weapons.

I hadn't thought about that implication until you pointed it out.  I think I

Damn.  Oh, well - back to the grind.

Its a big limitation for me - I work a lot with complex, self-modifying
abstractions, and my ability to grasp all of a problem at once is a real
limitation on the quality of the work I can do.  I've found ways of working
around it to some extent, but I'm always looking for better methods.

Well, its hardly likely to be a *random* division, but I see your point.

Some other significant mental divides that lie on our side of SI territory:

1) Awareness of environment - almost all life has this.
2) Capacity for internal mental states - probably most creatures that have a
CNS.
3) Awareness of causality - probably most mammals, maybe some other animals.
4) Awareness of own internal mental states - hotly debated.
5) Awareness that other individuals with internal states exist - hotly
debated.
6) Abstract thought, planning ability - probably just humans.
7) Capacity for internal self-evaluation - some humans.

I suspect capacity for deliberate self-modification of meme systems, and of
mechanisms for selecting meme systems, would be next - but that may just be
personal prejudice.  Most people seem to draw a line around #3 or #4.

Of course, an SI might draw the line between people and not-people at item
#3.776x10^7: "Perniction to tasmfit self-gungitation" - which just happens
to lie several steps below its most advanced cognitive abilities.

Just read in Edupage:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPUTER ALGORITHMS CAN BE PATENTED 
The U.S. Supreme Court has let stand a lower court ruling that mathematical 
algorithms used in a computer program may be given intellectual property 
protection as long as they produce "a useful, concrete and tangible result." 
The case in question concerned a program that allowed financial managers to 
pool and calculate mutual fund investments in a way that let them to avoid 
certain kinds of regulatory review. (New York Times 12 Jan 99)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  While this ruling looks like a long-overdue realization that algorithms are 
a natural extension of physical technologies, patentability of algorithms also
promises to extend the legal can of worms that the intellectual property laws
have become, to [further, should I say?] corrupt the academic spirit of many
fields of applied mathematics and computer science, etc. - but then, maybe,
it will bring the IP laws to such a confused state that they will be entirely
abandoned...  (I am not holding my breath here - lawyers can make much more
money if the cases are confusing and controversial, and the legal process in
the U.S. is driven by power clashes rather than desire to provide visionary
guidelines for social behavior that could make further development more smooth
and peaceful).

Infant gets layer of bio-engineered skin

January 12, 1999
Web posted at: 12:36 p.m. EDT (1636 GMT) 

MIAMI (AP) -- Eight-week-old Tori
Cameron was born with a rare and deadly
skin disease that causes severe blistering with
the slightest touch. Patch by patch, she is
receiving a new set of "skin" that doctors
hope will prolong her life. 

"She won't be cured," her mother, Lorraine Cameron, said Monday. "But
she could get better. It won't be an ongoing process where she will die from
it." 

Tori is believed to be the first newborn diagnosed with epidermolysis bullosa
to be given bio-engineered skin called Apligraf. So far, her tiny body is 40
percent covered with Apligraf, and it has blended so well doctors say they
can't tell the new skin from Tori's baby skin. 

"We hope this skin will take over and teach the baby's skin cells to behave
normally," said Dr. William Eaglstein, chairman of dermatology for the
University of Miami School of Medicine. 

Skin created from foreskin cells

Tori is the first to be given the elastic material for something other than
healing wounds or for venous leg ulcers, said Dr. Lawrence Schachner,
professor of pediatrics and dermatology at the university. 

Doctors demonstrated the procedure Monday by applying a 7-centimeter
patch of Apligraf to the blistered right calf of Tori, who is  hospitalized
at Jackson Children's Hospital. 

Apligraf, developed by Massachusetts-based Organogenesis, was
 approved by the Food and Drug Administration in May. 

The skin is made from a baby's foreskin, removed at circumcision, and with
  bovine collagen. Doctors can grow 200,000 units of Apligraf from a
stamp-size piece of foreskin. 

"A single foreskin can give you football fields of skin," Schachner said. 

Baby's disease is painfully serious

Tori was born November 12 with Dowling Meara disease, a particularly
lethal form of epidermolysis bullosa which affects 100,000 Americans. 

Babies afflicted with the disorder are born lacking the necessary cells to hold
 their skin together and keep out bacteria and infections. The  slightest friction
can create painful blisters and lead to scarring, infections and raw spots
similar to second-degree burns. 

Tori's entire body is wrapped with gauze to minimize blistering and her hands
and feet are protected to keep her from hurting herself. 

Doctors have applied between 15 to 20 pieces of the laboratory-made skin
to Tori by simply placing it on her body and holding it in place with Vaseline
and gauze. Each segment comes from the same donor and costs $975 per
patch. 

"This is the best chance for this baby," Eaglstein said.

A Colorado partnership consisting of three people claims to have
developed a technology to turn the Internet into one massive
supercomputer.  I'm a bit skeptical of this claim but the PR
Newswire deemed it fit enough to publish.  It will be interesting
to see the technical specs of this concept.  If tenable, it will
be more interesting to see what, if any, emergent properties
develop due to the implementation of such technology.

Excerpts from the press release at the URL below:

"FORT COLLINS, Colo. Jan. 11.  An invention that will exponentially
increase the speed and capacity of Internet data flow and create the
world's first global "virtual mainframe" was announced today by
Copernicus Technologies."

"Copernicus2 TM uses high-resolution GPS timing signals across the
Internet to create a massive parallel supercomputing system."

"Copernicus2 TM will structure the Internet or any other network to
function as a single supercomputer. This massive parallel processor will
be capable of executing complex programs at extremely high speed.
Virtual modeling of the physical world in real time will be possible
with greater accuracy and detail than with existing supercomputers. It
also could be configured as a neural network, with each user
representing a single node.
'We don't know yet how to write programs for such large computers,'
Johnson said. "But we do know they hold the key to the future of
computing, possible even the key to artificial intelligence."

First of all, I should point out that I do not believe in natural
rights. Nature does not grant you any rights. In fact , if you are
thrown out in the middle of nature you are likely to starve or be eaten
by a wild animal if you do not use your intelligence. Nonetheless,
societies do develop certain legally enforceable rights. These rights
are, essentially, claims that may be backed up with force. They may be
based on any number of reasons, both good and bad. As a libertarian, I
hope that the legal rights of a society are individual rights as I
believe that that regime of rights results in the most satisfactory
state of affairs for both individuals and society in general.

Re: Animal rights. My opinion is that animals should be granted limited
rights depending on their level of intelligence and their ability to
suffer and feel pain. I don't think ownership of any animal should give
you the right to torture it for your pleasure. There was a man in this
area who tortured and killed cats by twisting their necks and throwing
them against walls. This behavior really made me sick and I have a hard
time imagining a good defense for it. (I have two kitties and I love
them dearly.) Any society that would allow this behavior on the basis
that "animals are property and therefore you may do with your property
what you will" is not one that I care to be a part of. Unlike cars or
pens, cats are sentient beings and that ought to limit what you are
allowed to do with them.

I don't.  I don't know it doesn't exist, either.  But if I want to make
intelligent choices, I have to assume that there are differences between
choices.  If I wish to consider the consequences of my actions, I have
to assume that some consequences are preferable to others.  I don't make
an assumption about particular values, which is an old trick of
missionaries; I make only the assumption that some unknown distinction
exists.  That is the minimal assumption needed to yield differential
values in a logical goal system, and no further assumption can be justified.

The alternative is believing in my own prejudices, which is outright
silly.  I know where my innate preferences come from, to wit: evolution,
and I trust evolution's design for my mind no more than I trust its
design for my body.  There is no distinction between doing what
evolution wants and believing everything you read.

If it does exist, I wouldn't know;
therefore my lack of knowledge does not prove nonexistence.

I don't necessarily _believe_ in objective morality, but my best course
is to _act_ as if objective morality.

I don't _believe_ in logic, but I have no alternative but to _reason_
using the best logic I have.

I can't prove this world isn't a figment of my imagination, but it would
be even less useful to reason about any other set of facts.

I don't trust my mind, but I can't think with anything else.

The validity of reason, the validity of choice, or the validity of
knowledge cannot be proven; but there is no better way available.

Well, the original point of debate regresses back to the original land grants.
Some here in the US are pre-Revolutionary, while others are post revolutionary,
and are thus structured diffferently. Most post revolutionary land grants were
specifically surface grants, unless mineral and water rights were included
specifically. Since electromagnetic spectra were not seen as a form of property
(or even to exist) until after many of these grants were made, it follows that all
grants but those which were blanket grants of sovereignty (of which I don't think
we've ever made any, except maybe for some Native American tribes) retained such
rights to the sovereign power, i.e. the federal or state government. Similarly,
since air travel post dates the assignation of most all land grants or land grant
legislation, the atmosphere was not seen as a property that was grantable, however
the ocean was not grantable either, even though the federal government retained
sovereignty out to 3 miles up until recently, merely because that was the farthest
distance that a cannon could shoot a cannonball in the year that the 3 mile
convention was adopted. The airways have been seen merely as a legal extension of
the waterways, which the government retains sovereign control over. They are a
common property which must be maintained but is very difficult to divvy up
privately yet retain maintainability as an ecosystem unless there is a single
owner or owners association which retains some sort of sovereignty over the
members.

Yes. Tesla had built his 400 foot tall power transmission tower on Long Island
long before any federal body deemed it necessary to regulate tower height or
electromagnetic transmissions across property. If it were not for Telsa's
socialistic attitudes ticking old JP off, JP Morgan might have succeeded in making
radio transmission of power the standard method for a time, especially considering
how much of a hold he had on the federal government. We would all have kilowatts
flowing through our bodies at a level much higher than the puny fields generated
by high power lines today.

Well, even the Canadian broadcasting stations on the border have to have an FCC
permit to broadcast into US airspace, though its usually a give and take
situation, where the Canadians give us bandwidth to broadcast into their airspace
as well...

I would separate electromagnetic homesteading from surface property homesteading,
treating them as entirely separate properties, even though in 3d space they
overlap, just as is done now. Your broadcast power describes your territory.

That loud bang was my hype meter bouncing off the ceiling.  Hang on a sec

People have been running custom distributed programs across the Internet for
a few years now.  This looks like a standardized way of doing the same
thing.  It could be useful for solving some types of problem, but it isn't
going to change the carrying capacity of the network.

Cute trick - but that means you need to buy their GPS receiver to use the
system.  That's going to slow down adoption markedly, even if the system
works.

But only if the program is solving lots and lots of small, relatively
independent problems.  If you need one big calculation done, it isn't going
to help much.

Yeah, right.  The latency of the Internet is too high.  You'd get a neural
net where signals take hundreds of milliseconds to move from one node to
another.  The increase in computing power would be largely cancelled out by
the drop in signaling speed.

The full article makes some highly unlikely claims about magical increases
in bandwidth and layering multiple networks on the same infrastructure.  I
think someone goofed an interview and got their information scrambled.

So you admit that raising a human child (typically male) in a vegetarian
and/or urban environment without hunting deprives the child from expressing
his evolved instincts to hunt, and may wind up subliming this repression into
cruelty to humans and other animals?

This is a case where the initial theory - that geese are strictly
monogamous - turned out to be wrong. So the existence of "infidelity" is
largely illusory.

Chimps have long been known to be promiscuous. The main constraint is the
fact that dominant males try to reserve the females to themselves, causing
the subordinate males to be sneaky about mating opportunities. Again this
is not an instance of "infidelity". Fornication is not (necessarily)
adultery.

Yes, I've seen it.  It's a pretty good film IMHO.  The CG is well done and
the plot is unique... 
Towards the end of the film I found myself going over possible ways to end
it.... and if I remember correctly,  there were so many interesting notions
that they just barely touched on that - IMO - they should have expanded on.  

Can I ask what /you/ thought of it?

Both definitions are "reasonable", in the sense that there is a 
lexicographically legitimate usage of the word in both senses.

In the sense I was referring to, yes. -- In contrast to "despotism", 
or "autism", which are not dogmas or belief systems, but other kinds 
of objects.

We are basically in agreement about agnosticism. Our only point of 
disagreement seems to be that I think the most appropriate definition 
of atheism is: "The belief that there is no god." You seem to prefer 
to define it as: "The absence of belief in a god." I think the 
former definition is the one that corresponds more closely to 
general usage among laypersons as well as theologians. But it's 
just a matter of words. Let's move on to debate something more 
substantial!

I don't agree.  The real question is whether there is any meaning to the
term "objective morality".  I don't know a definition which avoids
circularity.

Objective morality: a system for telling which actions are moral.
Moral: the quality of actions in keeping with objective morality.

Cool movie.  Great plot twist at the end.  I liked the subtle twists - like
halfway through the movie when you realize you've never seen the place in
sunlight.  I do wish Hollywood could understand that 'nigh-omnipotent'
aliens should be at least as tough as comic-book superheroes, but that's
probably asking too much.

Of course distinctions exist between choices and consequences.
What does that have to do with the existence of some immutable,
objective morality.  The phrase "I don't know it doesn't exist, either."
is hardly a justification for seeking out some imagined construct
like objective morality.  I don't know that God doesn't live in a ranch
style on my side of town, but I'm not going to start knocking on
doors...just in case he is.

Agreed.  I want to be free of the psychological dictates of evolutionary
processes as well as the more artificial, religious proposals of an
immutable morality.  We are process, and any moral system will
ultimately evolve to reflect changes in that process.

How did you determine that is your best course?  What exactly is wrong
with a rational, functional, utilitarian morality?

I also remember seeing a show that discussed another type of bird.  I don't
remember the species but it was a common North American bird always
thought to be the kind that mated for life.  Turns out the females who did
not
get the primo males on the first round picks went ahead and formed nests
with the less than desirable males.  IOW, they settled.  But when these less
than desirable males were away from the nest on some project, the females
flew to the nests of the more desirable males and got impregnated.  This
was easy to verify when the DNA of the eggs were examined.  Do the
ideas of infidelity or adultery seem "illusory" in this case?

I recall this story because it struck pretty damn close to home for me.

Title
  Effect of L-glutamine supplementation on
  impaired glucose regulation during intravenous lipid administration [see
  comments].
Comments
  Comment in: Nutrition 1996 May;12(5):375
Source
  Nutrition.  12(5):349-54, 1996 May.
Abstract
  In contrast to L-glutamine, lipid emulsions are routinely
  administered to patients receiving nutritional support. The provision of fat
  during intravenous feeding is essential, but the potentially toxic byproducts
  of fatty acid oxidation may have adverse metabolic consequences. In the
  present study, we have examined the effect of L-glutamine,
  an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation, on the development of defective blood
  glucose regulation caused by a 48-hour infusion of 10% intralipid in rats.
  Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-290 g) were anesthetized with sodium
  pentobarbital, the right femoral vein cannulated, and baseline blood samples
  were taken. Each rat was placed in a metabolic cage with access to water, in
  the presence or absence of rodent chow. Two hours after waking, the rats were
  infused with 10% intralipid with either saline (control), 2%
  L-glutamine, or 2% L-alanine. After 48 hours, all animals
  were sacrificed and blood samples were again obtained. The mean +/- SEM
  plasma glucose levels before and after lipid infusion at the rate of 1 mL/hr
  in control rats fed ad libitum, were 125 +/- 13 and 170 +/- 5 mg/dL (p <
  0.01, n = 7). Similarly, plasma free fatty acids (FFA) in these animals rose
  from 0.74 +/- 0.11 to 1.34 +/- 0.32 mmol/L (p < 0.05). Plasma insulin levels
  also increased from 337 +/- 44 to 1278 +/- 88 pg/mL (p < 0.01). Reduction of
  intralipid dose infusion did not prevent insulin resistance characterized by
  hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. However, addition of
  L-glutamine to the high-dose lipid infusion with chow
  feeding prevented changes in plasma glucose, insulin levels, and FFA but not
  triglyceride levels. Also, glutamine but not alanine
  supplementation in intralipid infused rats without chow
  feeding prevented changes in plasma glucose, insulin, and malondialdehyde
  levels. In conclusion, these data show that glutamine
  supplementation during intravenous lipid administration in
  rats prevents the development of impaired glucose regulation associated with
  hyperlipidemia.

Title
  L-glutamine supplementation of a high fat
  diet reduces body weight and attenuates hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in
  C57BL/6J mice.
Source
  Journal of Nutrition.  126(1):273-9, 1996 Jan.
Abstract
  C57BL/6J (B/6J) mice are genetically predisposed to become overweight and
  develop hyperglycemia if raised on a high fat diet. The purpose of the
  present study was to explore the effect of dietary
  supplementation of L-glutamine (Gln), an
  inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation, on the development of hyperglycemia and
  excessive weight gain. Groups of 10 age- and weight-matched male B/6J mice
  were raised on one of four diets: 1) a low fat, low sucrose (LL), studied
  separately, 2) a high fat, low sucrose (HL) diet alone, 3) high fat, low
  sucrose supplemented with L-glutamine (HL+Gln) and 4) high
  fat, low sucrose supplemented with L-alanine (HL+Ala). Energy intake, body
  weight, plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were monitored over time.
  We found no difference in energy intake per unit body weight between any
  groups after the first 2 wk of feeding. However, the mean +/- SEM for body
  weight (27.1 +/- 0.6 g) of the LL group measured at 16 wk was lower (P <
  0.05) than that of the HL group at 37.9 +/- 1.9 g. Also, after 5.5 mo, the
  mean +/- SEM for plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in the LL group of
  mice were 6.9 +/- 0.4 mmol/l and 146 +/- 30 pmol/l, which were lower (P <
  0.05) than those in the HL group at 10.1 +/- 0.9 mmol/l and 438 +/- 84
  pmol/l, respectively. Although both amino acids caused a 10% reduction (P <
  0.05) in body weight compared with HL feeding at wk 16, only Gln
  supplementation resulted in persistent reductions in both
  plasma glucose and insulin concentrations over 5.5 mo. In another experiment,
  when Gln was added to the high fat (HL) diet of heavy hyperglycemic animals
  for 2 mo, body weight gain, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia were
  attenuated. In conclusion, supplementing glutamine to a high fat diet reduces
  body weight and attenuated hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in B/6J mice.

continuously runs using the cpu you're not using, so its always out of the
way, and while you're online it trades informtation packets.  I believe the
purposes consist of cracking codes and things, I'm really not sure what all it
does, but I have it.  Also in April SETI is coming out with a screen saver
that will process their information, the saver has a 3d view of the sound, and
the area of sky it is seeing(hearing), and also the actual sound thats being
processed.  Sounds really cool.

"Rational", "functional", and "utilitarian" are value judgments
as well, so there might be something very "wrong" with them, or
there might not be.  Or there might be no way to judge.

Our epistemologies have improved over the years to the point
where many of us are quite willing to express confidence in and
make a personal /commitment/ to the "reality" of propositions
about the world.  I plant crops, confident the Sun will rise
tomorrow to nourish them; I treat my infection with antibiotics
rather than leeches; I refrain from filling my gas tank with
milk, confident that my understanding of combustion justifies
that decision.  We further have confidence that any two
sufficiently intelligent beings will reach the same conclusions
about nature; we call this "objective reality".

Is there any reason to suspect that our moral philosophies will
not also continue to improve as our natural philosophies have?
Is there some barrier that will prevent future intelligences
from having as much confidence in their choice of action as I
have now in my descriptions of nature?  Is there some reason
that two intelligences /cannot/ of necessity reach the same
moral conclusion about the same circumstances?  Might it not
be the case that our moral epistemologies will evolve to the
point where I can bet my life that any other intelligent being
will reach the same moral conclusion as I, just as I would bet
it on eir reaching the same physical conclusion as I?  I would
call that state of affairs "objective morality".

Objective reality is a powerful concept that allows humans to
do miraculous things, like building bridges that don't collapse
and cars that run.  I do not yet have confidence that there
exists an objective morality, but the potential it would hold
for allowing us to do even more miraculous things demands that
I seek it, for the same reason I must seek objective reality.
Just because I can't see it is no reason to abandon the search.
Until then, I also see value in behaving /as if/ there is such
a thing, and making a personal commitment to behaving in a
manner consistent with my current best guess as to what it is,
because I have no better moral epistemology to use...yet.

I liked the way it approached the thorny issue of defining identity.  
As I remember, the aliens mixed and matched memories and 
dispositions creating a variety of human personalities in order 
to study and understand something about humans that was 
apparently missing (or had been lost) in their species.  

I didn't particularly like the moral of the story, that there is some 
ineffable and unique quality to human nature that's missing in 
aliens and it's so desirable that they'll go to almost any lengths 
to get it for themselves.  What hubris!  The aliens were, in the 
end, chastised for being so reductionistic.  Didn't they know that 
what makes us so special is not our identities but rather our 
human spirit?  Ack!

Hey Anders!  Is THAT a hollywood meme?

All that aside, I loved the look of the film and most of the plot.

Eh?  Try this:  The moral question asks "What should everyone do?"

Thus, a given moral code is a system for telling which action(s) we should
do.  Morality answers the moral question defined above.

Subjective morality is a system that answers the moral question in such a
way that the answer depends on who asks.

Objective morality is a system that answers the moral question in such a
way that the answer does not depend on who asks.

How about "the set of choices made by an SI"?  That's what
Singularitarianism is all about; making more intelligent decisions
through a proxy.  The idea is that either they'll all make the same
choice, or that at least *some* choices will be excluded as being
objectively wrong.

Scott Badger wrote:

Sigh... the trouble with discussing this subject is the verbal
contortions I have to go through to maintain correspondence between the
actual logic and our cognitive intuitions.  (That's casting aspersions
on our cognition, not the theory.  We're nuts; the logic is perfectly straightforward.)

What I meant is "distinctions useful for making the choice".  That is,
distinctions which render some choices objectively better than others. 
If you claim that this only applies within a pre-existing system, then I
just ask whether there are distinctions useful for choosing between
systems.  Is there a sense in which blowing up a K-Mart is actually
_wrong_, not just a matter of taste?  I don't know.  Not knowing, it
seems to me that the results of assuming an objective result have a
higher priority than any results deriving from the assumption that it's
all a matter of taste.

I'm not interested in subjective distinctions.  "Subjective" means
"evolution is pulling my strings."  "Subjective" means "I don't want to
justify my assumptions."  "Subjective morality" is as silly as
"subjective economics" or "subjective physics".  I want rational
justifications.  If you assume anything, I want a rational justification
for that.  I want a chain of logic leading right back to a blank slate. 
And now that I have it, I'm not settling for anything less.

What is the concrete difference between Externalism and utilitarianism? 
In utilitarianism, the morality of happiness is assumed.  In
Externalism, it has to be rationally justified.  Why, exactly, does this
make Externalism *less* rational?  Occam's Razor!

I think we're getting lost in the Great Maze of Words.  Let's look at
what you need to do to program "objective morality" vs. "utilitarianism"
into an AI.  In the second case, you need an initial, unjustified goal
labeled "happiness" with positive value.  Using Externalism, you can
start from a blank state - all goals at zero value.

An immutable morality is no more religious than an immutable reality. 
When science impinges on territory formerly held by religion, whether it
be the nature of reality or cosmology or even making choices, it makes
the issues scientific ones, it doesn't turn the science into mysticism. 
To borrow Greg Egan.

I beg your pardon?  Externalism is as rational, functional, and
utilitarian as you can get and still be a human being.  Externalism is
what you get when you take utilitarianism and prune the unnecessary
assumptions.  We're talking about a philosophy designed for AIs!

One might wish to avoid killing random less powerful entities if one
finds them worth avoid killing for some reason.  As a matter of fact,
one would only kill them if one had a rational reason to do so.  This
assumes of course that one only makes rational decisions.

Personally, I find no reason to kill off less powerful entities unless
they try to hurt me. Their species would hardly become more sentient
by killing off them if they disturb me.  If they do, I could simply
remove them from the premises.

My wiring makes me wish to increase my knowledge of the world.  A greater
number of species and individuals in the world allows for more complexity
and thus makes the world more interesting to me.  This would indicate to
me that I should avoid killing off less powerful entities, since I find
pleasure in increasing my knowledge of the world, and their evolution to
a higher power would make them and/or their species more interesting later.

If you lack this incentive your mileage may vary, naturally.

There is a huge difference between the distributed computing which
organizations such as distributed.net and seti@home do and parallel
processing, which is what the group in the press release appear to be
claiming. 
Distributed Computing is useful for solving a limited subset of problems
which can be decomposed into small chunks, processed elsewhere, and the
results reasembled. It is a 'loosely coupled' system where each machine is
distinct from one another.
Parallel processing is a 'tightly coupled' arcitechture, where there is one
machine, and many processors. For network parallel processing to be a
reality, extremely high network speeds are needed, as the network acts like
a system bus in a single computer.

I really liked the whole atmosphere and orginality of most of the movie, but
I agree that the ending left much to be desired, especially the whole battle
of the cuning power cheesiness...
It could have had a lot better of a ending with that kind of intro.

I suspect that maybe some big holywood execs. may have had some influence in
the cliche ending....

Does anyone ever consider, when trying to base all on some golden rule, that
people do not all like the same things? For example, I would like someone to
make me some sort of Spinach dish.... there are many for whom this would be
only annoyance.

There is more involved in ethics than a simple consideration of one's own
desires.

I'll deal with the components first:

objective, adj., known from that which is the case. 

morality, n., one or more heuristics which limit the possible actions
per circumstance to the correct actions per circumstance.

objective morality, n., one or more heuristics, known from that which is
the case, which limit possible actions per circumstance to correct
actions per circumstance.

To avoid the recursion Hal noted, I've chosen a regressive definition.
All definitions are either tautologous or regressive. For some reason,
infinite regress is more palatable than tautology for a lot of people.
Though I've run into some who, for even odder reasons it seems, like
tautologies better.  

I'm not so sure about my definition of 'morality'. I figured morality
limits possible actions to correct actions, just as physics limits
conceivable actions to possible actions, and intelligence limits all
actions to conceivable actions. I'm more confident about my definition
of 'objective'.

  IAN: No, I don't admit that at all! What I 
  said was there's lower crime in rural areas 
  per se. I doubt that the reason is because 
  rural people kill more animals. I'd suspect 
  that it has to do with rural people being 
  self-sufficient by nature with solid family 
  support and folks aren't so crowded together.
  The close proximity of people in the cities
  maximizes opportunities for thugs to attack
  and makes a life of crime more economical.

  Also, most primates aren't carnivores, and
  as I recall, if they eat any flesh it's less
  than 10% of their diet (the great apes are
  strict vegetarians), and so the idea of a 
  human "hunting instinct" seems debatable.

Thank you for your thoughtful, patient, and articulate response

It sounds like you're saying that if enough people agree on a 
moral system, it can be considered to be an objective reality.  
If everyone on Earth agreed that the Sun was warm, I would 
withhold judgement until unbiased instrumentation repeatedly 
confirmed the hypothesis.  I would then have high confidence,
as I assume you would.  The same goes for the rest of objective
reality.  How are morals to be measured?  Is broad consensus 
across species really an acceptable criterion?  What if the 10,000th
species we run into disagrees?  Do we simply conclude that they're
"unevolved"?

Please explain.  What leads you to believe that an "objective" 
morality is more powerful than a non-objective (perhaps rational, 
functional, utilitarian) morality?  What advantage does objectivity 
offer?  Is it not more parsimonious to hypothesize that moral 
systems are a function of evolution and culture?  Would you 
suggest that moral systems exist without sentience?  Are they 
objective in that sense?  If the existence of a moral system 
relies upon our contemplations of it, how can it be objective?  
I suspect that the laws of natural selection are at work wherever 
sentience arises, but the cultural differences will most likely 
result in differing moral systems from species to species.

Here's a question.  Would you expect an SI from Earth to have
the "exact" same moral system as an SI from Vega?

My guess is that your moral system and mine are highly 
congruent.  I also suspect that alien intelligences have 
constructed similar moral systems to ours.  None of that, 
in my mind, necessarily lends credence to the notion of an 
objective morality.

But perhaps our definitions are misconstrued.  I suspect that 
moral systems between highly evolved intelligences will be 
highly congruent due to the laws of natural selection and the 
laws of social psychology.  If this is the case, does that make 
it objective?

Quite so.  Multiculturalism has made us aware that
the old Golden Rule no longer applies.  The new Golden
Rule is:

"Do unto others as they would have you do unto them."

This is, of course, a more troublesome rule to follow. but I endorse it.

You're absolutely right!  

You know, I'm sure that my question made sense to me when I
asked it, but . . .  

(I dunno, maybe I was thinking of disputes over whether an entity
is actually asking for rights or not, or about how to determine what
each entity's rights are.  Or maybe I just had too much LDS back
in the '60's.)

What are the necessary and essential cognitive and physical conditions for the possibility of language to occur?  I am not speaking here of signals, such as pheromones for sexual receptivity or smoke for fire, but specifically of sign systems, where the relation between sign and signified, the relations between signs in a system, and the means of sign communication are arbitrary and by mutual convention rather than either materially or causally necessary.  This is not to say that sign/sign and sign/signified relations do not mutually impose semiotic (semantic, syntactic and pragmatic) restraints, but rather to say that an indefinite number of such complexes may be created, each containing a semiotic interplay between these two sets of relations.  Such meaningful and symbolic systems include the many written, signed and spoken languages of common discourse, mathematical, musical and logical languages, etc.
It is immediately obvious that the use of such systems in communication requires that the communicants possess a common conception of the particular system in use, in both the relations obtaining between the system's signs and the relations obtaining between the signs and their significands.  Likewise, it is obvious that the communicants must possess both the capacity to perceive the signs of the system in at least one manner, and the capacity to produce /communicate them in at least one manner.  Since, although the capacity for us to possess and use such systems in general is obviously present, none of them is innate in its arbitrary particularity, they must be created, learned and taught.
This characterization of symbolic systems allows us to delineate some sine qua nons (necessary and essential conditions) for their existence.  First, communicants must be able to perceive the intersubjective phenomenal world.  Second, they must be able, based upon mobility and this perception, to act upon it in chosen ways (will must be manifestable).  Third, they must be able to both experience and learn from the consequences of these actions.  Fourth, one must be able to represent to oneself and others what one has learned in at least one intersubjectively comprehensible symbolic form.  In short, there must be a dynamic interrelation between mind and world, and communicable representations of the products of this interrelation.  But what must be true of mind and world for these capacities to inhere?
Before proceeding further, we must clarify the concept of relation.  Relation has its limits, outside of which we speak of nonrelation.  One such nonrelation is identity.  Things are not related to themselves, they are themselves.  The correlative opposite of identity is absolute disparity, which is an ideal limit rather than a real possibility, for all experienced things are at the very least related as perceived or conceived objects.  In the same manner, simultaneity is a real limit of succession, while its correlative opposite, separation by infinity, is an ideal construct (Alfred Schutz, REFLECTIONS ON THE PROBLEM OF RELEVANCE, p. 182).  If A and B are related, we cannot speak of AB as either a unity or a duality/multiplicity, but as a system.  For relation to be dynamic interrelation, there must be threshold, to preclude unity, and exchange, to preclude bifurcation.
Dynamic mind/world interrelation entails that there be exchange between mind and world over lower thresholds and below lower ones, and indeed, that mind and world are neither a unity nor a duality.  Thus the struction (functional structure) of the mind/world interrelation is dependant upon the structions of the poles - mind and world - of the system.  From this we may infer that the struction of this interrelation may serve as a sort of semiologic, and thus inform us as to the characters of the relata so mediated.  The fact that there are several perceptual media of exchange, each with its own peculiar thresholds, complicates but does not obviate this analysis.
Now the question arises, how does one investigate the struction(s) of this interrelation?  Henri Bergson (AN INTRODUCTION TO METAPHYSICS) distinguishes two ways.  He states that one may study something perspectivally and externally, by means of symbols, or nonperspectivally and internally, without symbolic mediation.  The first method results, according to Bergson, in relative knowledge, and the second in absolute knowledge.  He goes on to state that the only possible object of study by means of the second method is the enduring self.  I agree with Bergson that there are these two ways.  I do not agree that only the self may be studied by means of the second method, or that the self may be studied only this way.  Perhaps the world can only be directly interrogated perspectivally, and one's own mentation can only be directly contemplated  introspectvely.  Bergson states that the results of such an introspection are inexpressible symbolically, in any event.  However here it is p!
roposed that both mind and world may be investigated indirectly, by means ofinvestigations into the structions of the mind/world interrelation, and a deduction of what the discovered parameters of this interrelation's structions might entail concerning the structions of both it's mind and world poles.  The struction of the mind/world interrelationship may be studied from both the internal perspective, by means of a study of the structions of perception, and externally, by means of a study of the structions of action (including communication).  The first is the way of phenomenology, and the second the way of science generally, and, as concerning mind, the way of genetic epistemology specifically.  Neither offers absolute knowledge, in the sense of complete, nor do they together.  The first way offers knowledge of an apodictic (self-evident) character; the second offers evidentiary data of a statistical nature, from which may be derived likely consequences.
Nevertheless, taken together, they provide more than either can alone.  For instance, phenomenology cannot offer apodictic knowledge concerning the genesis and evolution of mind's reflection upon the structions of the mind/world interrelation, for it is by means of this reflection that phenomenology proceeds.  It may begin only when one may reflect upon the structions of perception, extract invariants, and abstractly represent them in a common symbol system.  In other words, the phenomenologist must be at the Piagetian level of formal operations in order to philosophize.  Genetic epistemology, on the other hand, can offer us likelihoods concerning this genesis and evolution, which is more than phenomenology can offer, but nowhere can it offer the apodictic certainty which phenomenology can in the cases of reflective descriptions of self, soma, world and society.  The contributions of these two methods of investigation demonstrate a kind of complementarity; phenomenology is a s!
ynchronic and symbolic description of the invariant structions perceptible to the reflective mind, and genetic epistemology is a diachronic derivation, from observed action, of the evolution of mind to reflective and symbolic capacity.

All interesting points.  Most people would agree that people definitely have
rights, ameoba definitely don't have rights and the area in between is
mostly fuzzy.  The problem being that some people would allocate higher
animals the same rights as people (and take protective action if you
attacked them) and some people don't see higher animals as people at all.
Which is why, in my original question I proposed a lsiding scale.

You mention, for instance , that your grandparents used to drop pigs in
scalding water ( and imply you have no problem with this) and then you say
that there should be no unnecessary suffering.  Modern slaughtering
techniques are painless and instantaneous and avoid nearly all suffering
(although some places are better than other at this and transportation still
leaves a fair bit to be desired).

I'm also in favour of the butchering of animals for food, as long as it's
done in the most human way possible.  I'm also in favour of dropping the
technique altogether as soonb as we can vat grow the meat economically (I
estimate 10(ish) years).  The problem being that this is a highly emotive
issue and peoples morals vary wildly.

Thank you.  This is a well thought definition and I'm glad that you're

reads somewhat like a quote, being different to your usual style, but that
they hey, that doesn't mean it's bad!).

I have problems with only two parts of it.
1) The 'long term' seems a bit arbitrary.  Do we come back in 2 weeks to see
how they are getting on, or pop back in a thousand years to see if they're
ancestors are still about?

2) The 'greatest benefit'.  We're back to subjectivity.  Is the greatest
benefit having the longest lives? Having the most money? Having the most
fun? Being closest to God's plan?

I never claimed to be a hedonist (hedonism doesn't interest me that much,
most of the time).
And it's not rational self interest, except insofar that I like living more
than I dislike having needles stuck in me, a purely emotional decision
(albeit a fairly easy one).  Rationalism allows me to spot the easiest way
to get to my emotionally based goals. (I want to live, I'm going to
somewhere that people die of disease X, a good defense is immunisation,
therefore I have an emotional choice between "going without immunisation,
going with immunisation and staying at home."  If I really, really wanted to
go and really, really hated needles, I'd go without the immunisation and
take the risk.

_EVERYTHING IS NATURAL!!!!_

If it exists, it is natural.  Nature includes _Everything_.  There is no
scientific divider between the natural and the unnatural.  If everything
which naturally occurs has the right to happen, then there are rights to
_evertything_, which makes as much sense as there being no rights at all.

One cannot define a system within itself (Godels incompleteness theorem I
think), so you cannot define logic within logic.  Logic is more a arbitrary
system that people agree to use so that they can communicate:

ie, if we all agree to use the logical operator AND to mean that "A is true
AND B is true" is true if and only if both A and B are true.  We can then
use this (and NOT and OR) to build up logical expressions in a language that
all people that use logic can use.  This logic can be tested against reality
(if the premises have been tested scientifically and the logic has been
tested mathemtically then the conclusion should match observed reality).  So
far nobody has shown a case where this is not true, which gives it a truth
rating slightly higher than the law of gravity (which people still
occasionally think might have holes in it).

>PS: Have you read any William James?


Name is vaguely familliar, but I can't remember who he is.  I don't think
I've read anything of his (my mind keeps being redirected towards Henry
James, writer of ghost stories).

>PPS: assuming you're serious, and not just arguing from habit or for fun,


I'm arguing because people making obviously false statements annoy me.

And statements like "This arbitrary statement is the one true moral and
therefore these corrolaries are the way that life should be lived" really,
really annoy me, whether they're coming from Christians, Libertarians,
Communists or anyone else.  I'd be a lot happier if people said "I'd prefer
it if the world worked this way and I intend to make it happen."  At least
that would be intellectually honest and we could work on compromise.

>you might want to investigate Pirsig's Metaphysics of Quality. I find it
>interesting and provocative.

Interesting, yes.  It has a lot of interesting ideas.  Provocative?  Well, I
did throw my copy of Lila across the room at one point. (when he mentioned
that evolution had a plan).

And, potentially, a metaphysics that connects
>to physics *and* morality. Given that model, one of the tough parts is
>"why" there are multiple regimes (Pirsig says four). But what's moral in
>one regime has nothing to do with what's moral in another.

His metaphysics is incredibly arbitrary with no reasons given as to why one
metaphysics is better than another.  His definitions of Quality is that it
is beyond definition and then he uses Quality in different ways in different
contexts.  At one point it seems to be the interface between the observer
and the observed (which was interesting, as similar thoughts have occured to
me about perception before), and then he says that Quality is obvious to
everyone and that it's objective.  When people patently disagree all the
time as to what is high quality and what is low quality.

Which is not to say that there aren't a lot of intersting and well thought
ideas in there, much the same as in RAW's Prometheus Rising, which contains
a lot of interesting ideas, if you ignore some of the obvious rubbish.

I generally find books more useful for the ideas they generate in me than
for the actual ideas in them, but hey that's me.

thanks for the recommendation anyway,

Could you qualify slightly?

For objectivist's answer, do you mean "I don't understand what the question
'what is moral' means."  or do you mean 'I don't see why there is a problem
in working what is moral."

If you mean the former, I'll plump for that.

Hey, as long as it tastes like REAL meat (and I suppose it literally
will be) then I certainly have no problem with it.  Sounds great to
me, though then we have the whole problem of our domesticated animals
becoming extinct because we don't need them.  Can you imagine
reintroducing domesticated chickens into the wild?  Or cows for that
matter?  Well, at least the wolves would have a field day for a season
or two.

I look at criminals as a natural phenomemon of the urban economic ecosystem.
Individuals that are denied skills or opportunity to practice productive skills in
the society will resort naturally to predatory economics, being economically
carnivorous upon the assets of the members of the herd. It does not matter if the
predator is an Ivan Boesky or John Dillinger, it is the same behavior. Just as
with natural predators, criminals will develop a 'drug of choice' or preferred
form of prey, which is why most criminals only practice one or two forms of crime.

Violent crime is similarly a form of repressed predation. Since in an urban
environment, there is no other species besides humans, dogs, cats, and rats, you
will get sociopathic individuals who will express their natural hunting urges
first upon 'acceptable' species to prey upon, then marginally
acceptable/unacceptable species (dogs and cats), then as the individual becomes
more dislocated from society, they may prey upon the unacceptable prey species,
humans. This progression is a visible indication of the progression of their
mental illness, but the hunting urge is not the illness, merely how the illness
expresses itself in an environment of a limited ecosystem.

This is one reason why I view the general urban/vegetarian fear of guns and gun
owners as also an instinctual fear that the herbivore has for the carnivore. We
as humans also have this instinct, which comes to the fore as we practice a
vegetarian lifestyle, since we did evolve from vegetarian/scavengers who were
preyed upon by many predators, including homo erectus, and the great cats. This
fear, when it becomes the core of mental illness, is manifested in haplophobia,
which is recognized in the literature as an irrational fear of guns. It is an
illness of transference, as we have a natural fear of seeing the natural weapons
of predators exhibited.

When attacked, a herbivore will tend to flee, while an omnivore will tend to stand
and fight, which explains the whole debate over right-to-carry vs.
no-right-to-carry concealed weapons, as it is merely a manifestation of the
different viewpoints of the herbivorous (sublimated as an economic herbivore or as
an actual vegetarian) humans who prefer to avoid and flee and that of the
omnivorous humans who would prefer to stand and fight a predator, and would prefer
to be equally matched to that predator in weaponry. Herbivorous humans, as herd
creatures, will depend upon the 'tamed' few deviants they think they have control
of (i.e. police/government) to protect them from the predators, but will also seek
to disarm the omnivores due to misplaced association with the predators.

Uh, not quite. While the gorilla and orangutan are vegetarians, chimps and baboons
are omnivorous carnivores, eating everything from roots to leaves and nuts and
fruit, grubs to lizards, birds and injured ungulates, etc. including, sometimes,
each other.

Now, as for humans, considering that we have evidence of  tool use in the
harvesting of ungulates (proto-horses, proto-bison, mammoths, proto-deer, etc) as
well as other species like the great sloth, cave bear, etc, for several hundred
thousand years, and we have fossilized spears etc which are also several hundred
thousand years old, we know that hunting has been a constant practice of human
beings throughout their history. We also know that the late homo erectus preyed
upon the early homo sapiens, as well as many other species, so the evolved
practices go much farther back than just human history.

We also know from the few cases of 'feral children' that hunting is a practice
which develops naturally if the opportunity is there (i.e. there is ample game
available to develop skills with).

Here's an example of technology advance directed against
the interests of the people. The government is planning 
to develop a genetically engineered strain of fungus
that will destroy one of the most medically active,
safe, and useful plants known to man: cannabis.

While voters around the nation decree that sick people
should have access to cannabis, their own government
is planning to initiate biological warfare on the
source of that medicine to crush the will of the 
people! While technology advance gives people more 
power and freedom, it gives governments more power 
to stop freedoms. The problem of course is not tech-
nology per se but governmental power and the inability
to restrain it or hold it accountable for its actions.

$23 million to develop anti-drug killer fungus

        WASHINGTON, DC -- The United States government is spending $23
million to develop a killer fungus to wipe out marijuana plants -- a
dangerous plan that could cause an environmental catastrophe, said the
Libertarian Party today.

        "This project is the political equivalent of athlete's foot
fungus: It's nasty, it's dangerous, and it needs to be stopped before
it spreads," said LP National Director Steve Dasbach. "The last thing
we need is a bio-engineered killer fungus turned loose on the world."

        Late last year, Congress passed legislation that authorized $23
million for research into soil-borne fungi called "mycoherbicides,"
which will attack and kill marijuana plants, poppy plants, and coca
plants.

        When developed, the fungus could be released in such South
American countries as Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia, said U.S. officials.

        The legislation was guided through Congress by U.S.
Representatives Bill McCollum (R-FL) and Mike DeWine (R-OH), who said
the killer fungus was potentially a "silver bullet" in the War on
Drugs.

        But Libertarians say the tax-subsidized fungus is a "biohazard"
that could have a disastrous impact on the ecosystems of the target
nations -- and, potentially, the whole world.

        "In the government's irresponsible search for a quick-fix in
the War on Drugs, politicians could cause terrifying long-term
ecological problems," warned Dasbach. According to scientists, the
killer fungus could...

        * Attack other plants, wiping out valuable cash crops.

        "For example, a chemical alkaloid similar to the one that
produces cocaine is present in many legal plants -- including tobacco
and coffee beans," said Dasbach. "In an effort to wipe out drugs, this
killer fungus could wipe out the livelihood of millions of farmers."

        * Cause many plants to develop stronger chemical defenses
against the fungus, which could then mutate and spread to other,
harmful plants.

        "According to scientists, mutated plants could pass on these
resistant genes and create herbicide-resistant weeds, which could have
a ruinous effect on farm yields," he said. "With world hunger already a
problem, why risk making it worse?"

        * Wipe out industrial hemp plants, which are legal in every
major industrialized country outside the United States.

        "No fungus is smart enough to tell the difference between legal
hemp and illegal marijuana," noted Dasbach. "This fungus could be the
biological warfare equivalent of carpet bombing -- killing whatever is
in its path."

        What should Americans do about this dangerous program? Tell
their Congressional representatives to apply a strong dose of political
fungicide to "cure" it, said Dasbach.

        "This tax-funded fungus should be treated like any dangerous
mold or mildew -- exposed to sunlight and wiped clean. Congress should
just say no to biological warfare."

        Dasbach also said Libertarians have a better way to reduce the
consumption of marijuana, with no environmental risks: Legalize it.

        In the Netherlands, he noted, where marijuana is
decriminalized, drug use is half that of the United States. In fact, a
new study revealed that while 32.9% of Americans have tried marijuana,
only 15.6% of Dutch adults have done so.

        "Treating adults like adults -- and letting them make decisions
about how to live their lives -- seems to have a stronger anti-drug
effect than any killer fungus," said Dasbach. "Wouldn't it be ironic if
liberty was a more effective anti-drug program than deadly
mycoherbicides?"

As I read the various threads, I am struck by one thing - the written word,
english, human language is very hard pressed to convey sufficiently accurate
and precise meanings. It's as though the "computer" is barred by the
imprecision of its own language. Its like seeing the OZ of language hiding
behind the curtain and he's having a devil of a time keeping up with you
guys...

Many of the conversations go thru an evolution of : an idea, assertion, or
announcement, followed by simple interesting reactions/coments, followed by
secondary reaction/beliefs, followed by rebuttal, then semi-personal attacks
then fracturing of the subject, then attenuation of interest. Very much like
convection currents rising and falling.

Actually, chimps will enthusiastically eat meat when the opportunity
presents itself. They've even been known (very occasionally) to stalk and
kill small animals for food. The other great apes do seem to be strict
vegetarians, though.

Recent article in New Scientist on Turkeys.  Apparently the domesticated
Turkey is pretty much incapable o surival in the wild.  The brain is much
smaller than wild Turkey and it's a lot fatter - the only reason theycan
stand is because someone started breeding for strong legs as well as for
size..  Apparently modern domestic turkey's are stupid enough to drown by
looking up into rain for long enough.    Can't see there being much use to
them at all in the wild.  People tend to forget that most modern food
animals are hugely different to how they were before man began breeding
them.

This sort of problem tends to be caused by the fact that we are tring to
convey internal meanings to toerh people through a bastardised language that
has it's roots in varioujs other languages and has words added willy nilly
from all over the place.  What a word means to me, it frequently doesn't
mean to other people.  I've noticed that many arguments on usenet end when
someone says "so by X you actually meant Y!  Now I agree with your point."


As soon as there's scope for confusion, even more people get upset than
might otherwise.  Add to this that some of the topics have been things that
people hold very dear (like morality and social structures) and you're
asking for a flame war.  This discussion forum is actually a lot better than
some I've been in (Philosophy newsgroups tend to be amongst the worst, but
even theyaren't as bad as Mac/PC advocacy newsgroups).

Of course, the second that people get upset, they tend to say irrational
things.

I say X.
Someone else thinks that I mean Y (like X, only not quite) which logically
entails that I enjoy pulling the heads off of children.
They call me a child-killer, because I think Y is true
I get upset and respond to their criticism of Y and try to defend it,
because I've forgotten that I originally said X, and not Y at all.
Six weeks later, nobody is talking to anyone else and I've found myself
defending pulling the heads off of children as 'a good way to pass the
time.' when I never meant to talk about that at all.

Isn't the net great?

E-motive-mail from an upload 

Having read most of the mail on the subject "Path to uploading" in the first week of the new year I would like to come up with some ideas.

If  I were an upload, one of the first things Id do was trying to establish a friendly contact with all of my human antecessors who so passionately wished, talked and designed me into existence at the beginning of the 21st century.

I would rush through the extropian and >H mailing list archives and kindly review every single idea, imagination and calculation about uploading scenarios. Looking at and thinking about all the compilations of - at that time - latest scientific discoveries and their probable effects on creating an upload device for entities like me, I would give warmcpu-ed comments on them, agree on one topic, disagree on another with every author, confirm hir conviction, if she was right or dispel hir doubts. Maybe I would burst out in the upload equivalent of a thundering laughter at those propositions that were fed by an overdose of enthusiasm, optimism or narrowmindedness. But most of all I would probably be amazed at detecting that strong emotional energy behind the cool and rational thinking of my immediate ancestors and candidates for transhuman states of existence. 

But being equipped with profound Darwinian knowledge, updated by a snuff of Dawkinsian brilliance I could easily produce a quick-motion simulation of the raw body experience throughout mammalian evolution including all that primitive ridiculous behaviour that originated in even older reptilian brain structures. So, it wouldn`t cost me too much computational power to come up with the capacity to really understand the importance of the emotional archetypes in the central nervous system of Homo sapiens. And while watching the rise of my newly discovered EQ (Emotional Quotient) matching my superior IQ Id be writing a demo-program and sending it via e-mail to the still living transhuman aspirants. 

Inserting a disc with my program into the drive of their wearables theyd be experiencing via computer/brain interface some hitherto unknown electrochemical environments, interactions and connections of neuronal
aggregations which stretched the plasticity of the whole brain to an extent that the thinking power and imagination, needed to co-experience the overwhelming fusion of emotional intelligence favourably surveyed by empirical rationalism in my transhuman forcefield, could be easily achieved  without any additional wet or artificial brain structures. After an ecstatic period of  about seven seconds the program destroys itself in order not to damage the cognitive areas of the user`s brain too seriously.

But what about those who were in their fourties by the beginning of the 21st century ( see "RE: > fourty" on the extropian mailing list of december 1998 ) and who, by the time a proper shooting of a telomerase hybrid was available, were probably too old to derive benefit from it? No hard problem at all ( hi Mr. Dennett, hi Mr. Chalmers ) since by use of some smart genetic algorithms I might build up virtual body-mind-continua of the neurosuspended in their icy Alcor-homes and of the unhappy few irretrievably deceased who had been wise enough to let behind some hair or deep frozen blood .  So there could be a little suspension of the suspended, celebrated as a sneak preview or the limited editon of a mainstream Tiplerian  resurrection in real time and cinemascope ( . . . soon in one of your neighborhood theatres . . . )

Anyway, don`t you think an upload should consider to be able to really feel artificial, digital or whatsoever kind of emotion with an observational attitude powered by the Kantian "interesselosen Wohlgefallen" (i.e. indifferent pleasure) ?

I hope every future upload will devote a tiny fraction of his time to write reports on how it really feels  to be a true transhuman  to all those who are still reluctant to make the final decision. They shouldn`t forget those enthusiasts who have devoted so much time, willpower, wit and intelligent emotion on the subject : us extropians and transhumanists of 1999.

Next we can look for a genetically engineered virus which will kill
those individuals who have trace amounts of illegal drugs in their
systems.  Talk about ending the "War on Drugs"!!  

I can't remember his name, but the guy that was the chief of Police in
LA during (or maybe just before - a white guy) the Rodney King riots
was quoted as saying something to the effect that drug users should be
"taken behind a barn and shot."  A legislator in Mississippi has
suggested that anyone caught with illegal drugs be given the choice of
which of his limbs should be sawed off.  And in Indiana, the state
legislature is considering mandatory life sentences for certain drug
offenders - a longer sentence than most murders, all rapists and all
child molesters!!

What the hell is wrong with this country?????????

To recap our exchange, Samael posts:

Really?

There's no "right" or "wrong" way to construct a bridge, say? We can
achieve our purposes in any arbitrary fashion?

A logical deduction is neither valid nor invalid?

Eating (or the alternative, starving) is neither good nor evil?

On what criteria, then, do you base any decision at all, if there's no
right or wrong, no judgment of validity, no good or evil?

>Please define ethics in some sort of objective way.  Show me the

I believe Mike Lorrey has proposed a satisfactory approach to an objective
standard.

Liking the outcome of something is not the same as liking the something.

I asked:
>Why should anyone else care what you like? Why are you entitled to
>something just because you like it?

Samael responds:

There are any number of things we can't point to, hold up or stick a needle
into. Love, cooperation, life, the mind, to name an important handful. Are
all these just theoretical creations of our minds?

>I keep pointing out that I don't believe these things exist and then you

>I feel like I'm stuck with a bad copy of Eliza:

>Ack!

:-) Point taken, but that's not quite what I've been trying to do. I've
given what I consider grounds for believing in objective ethics.

>Sorry, if I'm causing offence, but I'm still waiting for one example for a
>purely logical basis for morals or ethics that does not depend on what

>I or anyone else thinks or feels.

No offense taken. Again I'll point out that I've proposed the evolutive
point of view as a starting point for developing an objectively verifiable
ethical code. While incomplete in itself, I think that, when combined with
game-theoretical considerations, it may make possible an approach with
considerable persuasive power for most reasonable people, at least in broad
outline.

More on this when I have time to get my thoughts together.

Short answer: it's run by idiots.
Lon(ger) answer: As Heinlein pointed out often, there's a deep under current
of religious hysteria in this country that poses an ongoing danger to anyone
not ready to run with the mob. Also there's a great deal of money and (by
now) entrenched power associated with the 'War on Drugs' that has a vested
interest in preventing any form of 'rational' solution.

I think this is ample example that cows choose not to be free or have rights... and an example of people trying to use
force to impose their will on others. You cannot free a slave that does not want to be free. Slaves must free themselves,
in their mind, first and foremost, before they can accept any assistance from others.

I don't see this as purely economic, nor is it a matter of being
denied skills or opportunity. I see it as primarily cultural, it is
not mere coincidence that these levels of violence are prevalent in
certain subcultures (neighborhoods). It doesn't take a genius to
spot a gang-banger, it takes a clear head and a certain amount of
gut's to do something about it, especially if it's your kid.

I don't see any repression, this is clearly predator/prey behavior.

I think you have a good point here. Prey species do not want any
non-prey species about.

Here in Chicago we are going through a new round of brain dead
haplophobia. Despite 17 years of handguns being totally illegal
(except if you're a Chicago politician, can you spot hypocrisy?) we
were just named murder capitol of the U.S. They can't get it
through their heads they are approaching this the wrong way.

The answer? Simple, mandatory jail time (at least a year, I'd
prefer 5 let's settle on 3) for possession of an illegal handgun.

Fight, flight or for most urbanites, just plain fright.


Fighter, not a flight-er.

I'm more disturbed by analogous arguments made about people.   Many people
who comment on population policy are of the opinion that it is a bad thing
to let poor people have impoverished kids, even though those kids would find 
their lives worth living.

So, Mr. "Macht macht recht", are you in the habit of raping, stealing,

But if you could give a cow a clear choice of death or life, I would
imagine at least 20% of them would choose life (the others being too
stupid to know the difference).

The weakneses of natural language with its ambiguity and imprecision is also
it's biggest strength beacuse that is what makes it possible to use the old
language in new domains.

Model of mass comunication:

Sender --> Message --> coding --> transmission -->
Decoding --> Receiver --> Interpretet message

Ordinary language contains both information and exformation. Informaton is
the exact words we are saying with a very direct, concrete and logical
meaning. Exformation can only be used when the sender are adressing a group
with the same experiences as he has.
It is implied meaning that has been popularised in the Generation-X meme,
where everybody is talking to each other via. movie quotes.

An example: "I'll be back" said with a thick austrian accent. This draws
it's exformation fro terminator and all of the terminator mythology.

A second example:

---
"Transhuman drinking song" by Max M ;-)

I've been glad I've been glad
For the things that I've had
I've been glad I've been glad I've been glad

I am sad I am sad
for what I wont longer have
I am sad I am sad I am sad

But I'll be glad I'll be glad
to become more than that
I'll be glad I'll be glad I'll be glad
---

Here the title is a contradiction in terms as transhumanism and drinking
parties generally doesn't mix to well. I am thinking about all the focus on
health, longivity and the functionality of the brain being seriously
affected by liquor. At least I don't imagine transhumans at the local pub
singing out loud while massively drunk. Could be wrong though. Perhaps the
receiver would even have to know me to know it is not meant to be taken too
seriously.

The rest of the song is about uploading, and most transhumans will recognise
this. Especially as the word Transhuman is in the title.

This song most likely could not be understood by any non-transhumanists, but
i'll bet that most people on this list will have gotten it right away even
though I was communicating thru exformation. And notice I didn't use any
metaphors in the song. All of the exformation and the meaning came from our
common knowledge about Transhumanism.

My point? I find that often when somebody disagrees with me on a subject on
this list, it is because I make my messages too short by using too much
exformation. When I then later explains my views in more detail and with
more precise information, generally we either agree or at least agree to
disagree.

I once asked a poet why on the earth he wrote poems. He told me that he
liked the precission he could acheive with the language. I knew exactly what
he meant (me being a lyric writing musician myself). Unfortunately the
precision is only there for the sender of the message. The more condensed
the language the harder the decoding.

One of the important things we are doing on this list is creating a language
giving us all the exformation we need to convey our meaning in short precise
sentences.

Furthermore we also need to invent more words to express the new memes
resulting from this exformation. But then... we probably will. There is
hardly a post on the list without a "" word. A so called "embryomeme".

Remember who coined that one. ;-)

well, we obviously can support our own bioresearch which either develops
an organism which kills the fungus, or to develop marijuana plants which
are resistant to the fungus. Considering the billions of dollars that
the columbian cartels have in bank accounts elsewhere, I would estimate
that biotech research will become the largest growth area of the
Columbian economy if the US gov't releases this fungus...

No bioweapon is perfect. Tree experts are now releasing specially bred
strains of American Elms which are resistant to the Dutch Elm Disease,
which is a similar organsim to the one the gov't is proposing.

A fungus resistant form of marijuana would be a useful crop, as you
could make foot creme from it to fight athlete's foot, etc.

Samael (perhaps rightly) objected to my smuggling in putatively moralistic
terms such as "valid" and "rightfully", so let me see if I can rephrase my
questions in more "wertfrei" terms:

Given the scenario where you want to live and I want to kill you (nothing
personal :)), why should I not blow you away if I can? What would you say
to persuade me to let you alone?

If it's all subjective, surely you grant that I have as good a claim to
kill you as you have not to be killed. No?

The point is that the only alternative to objectivity is arbitrariness,
which appears to culminate in den Otter's regime of might-makes-right. Is
this really your vision of human society?

Terms such as "valid" (in an ethical context) and "rightful" are simply
shorthand ways of expressing the idea that social conduct is not an
arbitrary matter, like aesthetic tastes. They don't necessarily imply a
code imposed "from above" as in traditional moral codes.

That there's no rational reason to restrict your actions simply means
that you can do anything you want. Killing is just one of many options.

Well, one would expect that a SI would pay more attention to

It all comes down to what one values more: "fun" or safety. Usually
the result is some form of compromise.

It would also make sense to make it legal for peaceful 
citizens to purchase firearms and carry them concealed.

If criminals know that a large portion of the populace is armed,
they'll be much less likely to attack members of said populace.

The problem in Chicago (IMHO) is that the government there has made it
illegal for peaceful citizens to own guns (what's the logic there),
thus making them easy targets for criminals with no interest in law or
peace.

The government of Chicago is itself to blame for it's problems with
firearms.

How strange, surely the politicians and their servants don't
*really* want to wipe out this very lucrative trade, which finances 
many of their activities and provides lots of people with jobs?
Oh wait, must be a plot to blow the prices trough the roof after
stockpiling the stuff. Not bad! Demand stays the same (or
goes up ) while scarcity increases: more violence, worse quality,
more deaths, more policing and stricter punishments, more
power to the government. Hum ho.

What if someone asks you to kill them? Or what if they would have you

"Haplophobia"? Fear of halves? I can't imagine the derivation path. How
does this word come to represent a fear of guns? (Just curious - I love
etymology.)

Interesting idea. I think rational thinking is something we have to
learn, but that we have some built in facilities for learning just
like we has a built in facility for learning languages. But you can
train your rationality more or less.
 
Sanity might be something similar. I would guess it is really composed
by several components that synergize, like rationality, emotional
maturity and good metaprograms.

Very good advice. Overall, the ability to notice what is going on in
one's mind is important in self-transformation.

It cannot be emphasized enough that an entity that never exists does not
"miss" the life it hasn't attained, and that taking its fictional
"desires" into account when making moral calculations seems to
overcomplicate an already breathtakingly complicated business.  The
rhetoric here is interesting, painting animal rights folks and vegetarians
as chauvinists stamping out a way of life they find distasteful, rather
than as people seeking to protect sentient beings from unecessary
suffering.  I've been a vegetarian almost ten years, and an "ethical" one
(as the saying goes, tho' I hope I'm not fascistic about it) almost all
that time.  I think it unlikely that domesticated animals will become
extinct once we stop consuming them as food, and focus instead on the hope
that the institutional practices by means of which they are transformed
from animals into "meat" will become extinct instead.  These practices and
institutions don't comport well with the self-image of enlightened humane
societies, as I understand them.  Certainly, they don't seem to be
"lifestyle" issues, in any of the usual understandings of that phrase.  As
far as human analogies go, the one that seems more relevant here is the
one in which antiabortionists argue that no-one who was not aborted
themselves can properly argue for the practice, since they would not be in
a position to make the argument had they been aborted themselves. 
Surely a foetus has no more of a stake in a life it has not yet lead,
than a cow a stake (or "steak"?) in a life she would have lead had the
vegetarians not managed to incubate a culture in which meat-eating is no
longer a widespread practice.  
	There, now we can play with two hot buttons at once, and get
nowhere fast.  Next up, incestuous gun-toting vegetarian socialists
against abortion rights... 
	Best, Dale

Maybe we should ask the participants at TransVision 98 who went to
Amsterdam on saturday evening :-)

(my personal view is that I'm too drunk if I can't count backwards
from 16 in binary. No, I don't drink :-)

This is likely why humor is so tricky; it relies on some shared
context. If it isn't shared and has to be made explicit, the joke is
not funny.

You joke about it, but actually "might makes right" can be

Because I'm not *that* stronger, obviously :) No mere mortal can
take on the whole of society and win, but a SI can. Who would
stop it if it tortured creatures like us in basement universes?

I don't see that introducing this specific consideration makes the difference
between complex but manageable calculations and unmanageable calculations.
So I don't see why we should reject this consideration on such grounds.

Regarding the fictionality of desires, consider the view that me-today
and me-tommorow are two different but closely related creatures.  If you
suddenly and without warning killed me, you might argue that me-tommorow
became a fictional creature whose desire to live is irrelevant.  And you 
didn't hurt me-today, except via his altruism toward me-tommorow.

I argued that if farmers anticipate your choice of meat vs. veggies, 
you don't get to choose between "suffering sentient being" vs. 
"not suffering sentient being."  What you choose between instead
is "suffering sentient being" vs. "non-sentient veggies."

 Nice, very nice.

  And it seems like a DNA spiral (scale on which we can ascend) seen
from above... Life (as the highest carrier of information known)
reaching for the stars, expanding in the expanding bubble of our
universe.

   Although the arrows, well, do seem agressive. And did you try with
stars in the background? (orion constellation for exemple, only WE are
launching arrows toward him).

    What software did you use? 3D Studio? If yes, any animated gif in

No, I think an analogy is someone with only a 3 meter home complaining that
their property rights had been violated by FAA-approved planes flying over 
at 1000m.  This seems closest to me to your claim that the use of infrared 
radiation in fireplaces centuries ago gave people the rights to all radio
frequencies on their property today, making FCC allocation of such spectrum
theft.

I can sort of understand your "but they stole it" objection to spectrum
property.  And I could understand conseqentialist arguments that other 
ways of dividing property would have better consequences.  But if your 
objection here isn't one of these types, I don't understand what it is.

I doubt that any of them are smart enough to know the difference, except that life is a lot more work, and you're more
likely to get killed if you live!   ;)

Agreed.  Do you have an improved version that overcomes 
the problem of conflicting values in cross-cultural exchanges?

I am not personally inclined to offer my respect to any culture's 
mores simply because "that's their way".  Many cultures have 
"ways" of hurting and denigrating their members (especially the 
women, but males too).  But we've already discussed this issue 
fairly recently, so I'll stop here.

You're the one making the assertion. Prove it's a fact, if you can.

In another thread, I and others are pointing toward a proof of the
existence of an objective basis for ethics. Join in if you please and
critique our arguments, don't simply dismiss them as "subjective opinions".
(Of course, in a real sense, _all_ opinions are subjective, but that's
obviously not the sense you meant, is it?)

No, I wasn't joking, but perhaps I misunderstood your point. If you mean
that, as a practical matter, we need to be ready to defend our rights
against aggressors, I heartily agree. I got the impression, though, that
you intended to reduce the _ethical_ issue to a matter of gunpower.

So you're saying that you would do those things if you were sure of
impunity? I'm calling your bluff, Mensch.

After all is said and done, I'm certain that you, being a normal person,
would still recoil from indulging yourself in such amusements even if you
were convinced that there was no possibility of retribution. I'm asking you
to examine your reasons for refraining. Can you honestly maintain that it's
- as Samael insists - merely an arbitrary personal preference?

>No mere mortal can take on the whole of society and win

I didn't postulate your fighting the whole of society. Let's assume that
the rest of society is, and will remain, ignorant of your escapades (or at
least of the identity of the perpetrator), and that you're in a position to
know this.

>Who would stop [an SI] if it tortured creatures like us in basement
universes?

That's a practical question which has nothing to do with the topic, namely,
what is ethically defensible, or, if you prefer, what general principles of
interpersonal conduct are most conducive to human wellbeing.

You joke about it, but actually "might makes right" can be
taken quite literally. Rights without might are paper tigers.

Because I'm not *that* stronger, obviously :) No mere mortal can
take on the whole of society and win, but a SI can. Who would

An argument I have found effective in communicating this point:
During the cold war, the USSR constitution included a guarantee
of free speech to all citizens, just as the US constitution does.
Why then was reality such that Americans had moderately free
speech and Soviets did not?  Because in the US, the people with
the guns (cops, federal agencies, military, and many citizens)
/believed/ in a greater level of free speech than did the Soviets
(though still not very free by some measures).

Likewise, the text of the constitution that did not allow
Congress to prohibit alcohol without an amendment in the 20s is
precisely the same text that for some reason now does allow
Congress to prohibit other drugs.  Nothing has changed except
the fact the people with guns now think prohibition is OK.

It's good to use reason and rhetoric to express opinions about
what rights should and shouldn't exist; but until you convince
the people in power, they will not exist in reality.

  IAN: I didn't say that chimps don't eat meat, 
  I said flesh can be around 10% of their diet.
  That still doesn't make them carnivores,
  i.e., members of the Carnivora order.

It is a tricky enough business to negotiate among the contending ends of
existing entities.  Even under the best circumstances I don't know if I
would describe these calculations as "manageable" exactly.  Just as
"necessary." It is not clear to me how it can be helpful to introduce our
projections about the ends of fictional potential entities to the mix.  Am
I misunderstanding your point?  In any case, even if this added and
unecessary complication of ethical deliberation is an insufficient ground
to reject such a consideration, there are additional questions about how
and why and when one should weight the ends of these actual and potential
entities over one another in ethical deliberations.

You will be unsurprised to hear that I wouldn't argue this.  If you-today
are in the process of committing suicide, because you are suffering the
extreme irremediable pain of some terminal condition, say, should I
frustrate your effort on the assumption that you-tomorrow might regret
being dead?  Should I privilege the you-tomorrow who would regret your
decision over the you-tomorrow who would not regret it and simply try
again?  On what grounds?  And anyway, it seems to me that there is a
sufficiently nontrivial ethical difference *between* the difference
between you-today and you-tomorrow on the one hand, and
you-sloshing-about-the-womb-a-week-after-conception and you-today on the
other hand, that I don't know how clarifying it is to the issue at hand to
make too much of this analogy.  The ontic difference between the
"disappointed" piglet that never has a shot at existence and the
discomfited piglet in the slaughterhouse seems to me a grander one than
the simple difference between a piglet-today and that piglet-tomorrow as
he makes his way in the world.

I don't know of anybody who's claiming a proof for the existence of an
objective basis of ethics.  How could you possibly do that without
producing the goods?  All I (at least) am trying to do is establish
that, as an interim working assumption, we should assume that there's
something that can be rationally discussed - that it makes sense to
present rational arguments for pleasure being good or nuking a K-Mart
being evil.

It's entirely possible that this isn't the case.  It's possible that
intelligence is totally dissociated from ultimate goals, so there isn't
an ultimate goal that's more "rational" or more "intelligent" than other
goals, and that the behavior of an SI is determined by whatever the
instinct-happy mortal programmers knowingly or unknowingly heap into the
goal system.  It's equally possible that any SI goes "aha!" and accesses
an obvious, unassailable proof of a pre-existing ultimate goal totally
external from evolution and our own fevered imaginings.

But answers that might be objectively and rationally correct take
practical precedence over answers that might be arbitrarily and
indistinguishably "correct".  Moreover the rules for Rational Discussion
of Questions With Real Answers External to the Participants, when
compared to the rules for Fighting Over Whose Arbitrary Answers Will Be
Imposed on Everyone Else, tend to be rather more productive of
impressive technology, not to mention creative and intelligent discussion.

MYSTERIOUS SPAYING SAID TO BE SECRET-MILITARY OPERATION

The Environmental News Service (http://www.ens.lycos.com)
has a follow-up to their report about multiple sightings 
around the U.S. of massive grid-work patterns in the sky 
being created by fleets of jets that fly back and forth 
and spray down a material that seems to make people ill. 
(see http://ens.lycos.com/ens/jan99/1999L-01-08-05.html) 

In their follow-up [1], ENS interviews Thomas Farmer, an 
ex-Raytheon Missile Systems engineer who's been tracking 
the mysterious spraying incidents for over a year. Farmer 
has confirmed that jets used to spray are Air Force jets, 
and he's made several collections of the cobweb-like, or
"angel hair," material the jets are spraying out, which 
made him, just like many others, sick after contact. It
appears to be a substance used to seed (build) clouds.

ENS reports that Farmer is "fairly certain the contrail 
phenomena is one part of a military weather modification
weapons system." The ENS report then observes that a sub-
set of the military plan to use weather as a weapon and 
create a "Weather Force," is massive cloud-seeding that 
will work in with the HAARP antenna in Alaska, which 
is the U.S. military's primary weather-weapons system,
which can exert effects on locations across the earth.

The openly-stated goal for the U.S. military is to 
"own the weather" [2] by year 2025 and to thereby be 
able to bring target populations to their knees by 
"storm enhancement," "storm modification," and being 
able to "induce drought." [1] So rather than natural 
laws of solar-heating and earth-rotation directing 
the weather, the weather will be determined by who 
is pleasing or displeasing our military masters, or
then again, perhaps power does not really corrupt.

A U.S. military webpage [3] states that weather 
modification by the military is intended to allow 
for "storm triggering/enhancement using airborne 
cloud seeding." That military webpage also says:

 "A global network of sensors provides 'weather 
  warriors' with the means to monitor and accurately 
  predict weather activities and their effects on 
  military operations. A diverse set of weather 
  modification tools allows manipulation of small-
  to-medium scale weather phenomena to enhance 
  friendly force capabilities and degrade those 
  of the adversary. Many of the sensors required 
  for this system are assumed to be...part of the 
  global information management system (GIMS)..."

Apart from allowing for an Orwellian-weather tyranny, 
military-weather control could lead to environmental 
catastrophe, since the desire to exert control will 
conflict with and overpower rational environment con-
siderations, particularly if control is directed under
the cover of  military secrecy.  Deliberate large-scale 
modification of the weather must be the most dangerous 
thing we could do to our planet, and it appears that 
military-weather-control planning is being done in 
secret, outside the realm of democratic oversight, 
just where it needs to be for the worst outcomes!

there after. Another person responded saying they've
seen unique grid-work contrail patterns in Georgia.

  IAN: An interesting theory and a lot of valid 
  insight seems to be in there. A counter that 
  comes to mind is: Why would mice become prone
  to violence in close-in high-population living?
  OK, that could be because they Hunt insects. So
  we need to see what happens to rabbits or some 
  group of animals that is hard-core vegi, and 
  if it did not display an increase in violence
  in crowded habitation, your theory could be 
  correct. But I suspect that even rabbits will
  get more aggitated and cantankerous if crowded.

  Of course such experiments directly imply a naked 
  aggression against free wills of sentient beings.

  IAN: What's the deal? That's 100% consistent 
  with what I said and know.? We've probably
  also seen the same nature shows.

  IAN: There is also a swimming instinct that
  even infants can automatically access when 
  in water. It's an interesting line of inquiry 
  you've opened up, but again, I think there's
  so many other obvious reasons why crime is 
  higher in urban and lower in rural areas;
  but the fact that other causes exist cannot
  in itself rule out the theory you've raised.

I recently released an introductory chunk of a larger work I am composing for publication.  The chunk I released, however, is a pivotal one, for it is the structural skeleton, foundation and rationale for much of the work that follows.  I received two responses, one laudatory (asking for publication data so he could purchase the finished work), and one with easily answered feeble challenges (the second on another list). Aside from these, there has been a deafening silence.  Are there any more comments?

If you really want to know?

The whole symbol architecture, a few domain modules, and a syntactic
processing mechanism on top.  "Coding a Transhuman AI" doesn't have a
particular section on language, but it has quite a bit of the grounding.

 Good greif! Make that "MYSTERIOUS SPRAYING." Ugh!
                                     ^
 Ironically one rather far-fetched theory broached 
 by a respondent about the grid-work contrail making
 team of jets is that they are happening mostly over
 rural areas, and their proposition was that it was
 an effort to sterilize the conservative anti-NWO
 strong hold that country-side communities can be,
 killing them off as agribusiness conglomerates take 
 over, so if that was true, it really would be "spaying."

On February 22 and 23, 1999, an international conference on smart homes &
telematics will take place in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. The conference is
organised by the new foundation Smart Homes,  in co-operation with the
Province of North Brabant. The European Union (TAP) and COST 219bis (Access
to telecommunications for disabled and older people) support the conference. 

Smart home technology or domotics is the integration of technology and
services inside the house with the purpose of enhancing the quality of life
of the resident through better safety & security, comfort, technical
management and communication. The integration of the various sensors and
actors into a smart home network can be realised through an extra twisted
pair network in the house, via the TV cabling network or via the existing
power network, all in combination with or without wireless media. 

Wide-scale introduction of smart home technology has up to now be impeded
by  lack of standardisation, high cost and unawareness of the possibilities
at architects, installers, project developers and residents. These barriers
are gradually taken away, f.i. by the convergence of the three major
European bus systems. Also, costs of technology and installation are
substantially decreasing. Various target groups on the market are gradually
becoming aware of the existence of smart home technology via the different
media. At present time, in the Netherlands like in Belgium, a number of
demonstration projects is realised in service flats for senior citizens.
Such demonstration projects with hundreds of smart houses give a large
experience in the various aspects of real practice implementation at the
lowest costs. 

At the conference, on the first day, a general review of the state of the
art of technology, user-interfaces and social context will be given. On the
second day, in three parallel sessions, issues like infrastructure, new
applications, market issues, user requirements, tele-services and access to
the information society will be discussed in more detail. In the
presentations a number of European TAP projects will be highlighted. 

Mr. Jacques Santer, chairman of the European Commission, will address the
conference and open the exhibition.

There are more end less efficient methods of producing something you have

Dammit. Sorry, I thought we were talking about morals.

Again, I thought we were talking about morals.

No, it's bloody well not.  A person decided to starve himself recently to
protest against something or other here in the UK (something to do with
animal welfare, I believe).  It was not an evil act he committed. In his
opinion it was a good action.  Objectively?  It was an action.

Whether I like the outcome or not (bearing in mind that here are obht long
and short term outcomes for all actions).  I've stated this repeatedly.  You
are reading my posts, aren't you????

Correct.  I like surviving.  So I do whatever is necessary to arrive there.
It is not necessary to like every point on the road there, merely to like
the place where I arrive.  Should the method of travel be too unpalatable,
then it may outweight the positive side of the place I am going, but it is
still a matter of like and dislike.

And I still don't see why evolution is so great.  It's a process for
producing animals who'se ancestors were adept at producing children.  (and
my old biology teacher would have had me shot for saying that evolution was
'for' anything).  Some of our characteristic were set by being able to
survive an ice age, some by surviving the cataclysm that wiped out the
dinosaurs, some by being fasterthan the things that were chasing us, some by
being able to kill off all of our nearby predators, some by being able to
shag our neighbours wives when they weren't looking.  Very, very little of
it was set in the last 10,000 years - far too short a period of time to have
much evolution - but still the span of all of civilisation.

Oh, and I'll repeat my objection to Michael Lorreys argument (similar to
yours in some respects) - EVERYTHING IS NATURAL.  Every human act,
everything we do, whether social, individual, liked or disliked, genocidal
or political or sexual or whatever is a natural act.  There is no dividing
line between 'natural' and 'unnatural' except in peoples heads, just because
some of us believe that we are 'above' nature or 'apart' from nature or
'over in the corner, looking at ' nature.

The same can bbe said of evolution - everythin we do is because evolution
has set us up (Bang! goes my biology teacher) to act in this way in our
surroundings.

My posting of that article was an attempt to lessen the seriousness of
the discussion.  I apologize if I was a bit too subtle.

How could anyone take seriously a story that includes 3 million
chickens let loose in Yosemite?

Hee hee

Just be warned that TheOnion.Com is one of my favorite sites and when
I find one of their stories that relates to a conversation here (which
actually happens occasionally) I will post a link to it calling it an
important story...

Hey!  It's a REAL humorous newspaper.  The stories are fake, but the
paper is real... :)

Anything that follows this thread should not be considered serious at
all.  Those who were mislead into thinking that this story is for real

You're using words like 'rightfully' and 'valid' again.
Try using words like 'without incurring consequences I do not wish to deal
with' instead.
Or asking if you want to?

I would (should I not be panicking at this point) point out that doing so
would almost certainly have negative consequences for you, living, as I do,
in a country where shootings are incredibly rare (and frequently make
national news).  That if people found out that you shot people that they
would be less likely to trust you or feel that you were someone they could
do business with.  That they may even feel that their lives would be happier
if you were locked up or otherwise removed from running around the place
shooting people.  I'd even point out that the likelyhood was that we could
do some kind of deal and form a compromise which didn't require my death.

In other words, I'd tell you that the police would get you, and you didn't
want to kill me.

If I thought you were the sort of person who bwelieved in morality as an
absolute and that that morality would be against you killing me (ie, you
were a christian), I'd tell you that you were wrong to do it (and that you
were going straight to Hell for doing it).

My main defense would be to live in a country where it is difficult to get
away with kiling people (like Scotland - where I am living now) and try not
to piss off those people to whom the police are no threat (gangland bosses,
psychopaths, secret service agents, etc)

>If it's all subjective, surely you grant that I have as good a claim to
>kill you as you have not to be killed. No?


Claim?

Might doesn't make right.  Might gets its own way unless its stopped by
other might.  Or otherwsie persuaded not go around smighting things
(economic sanctions, long term gains, etc.)  Nowadays the government tends
to be the mightiest things around - more soldiers than any provate citizen
has, nmore nukes, etc.  But the government has to pretend to be acting in
the best interests of democracy (and occasionaly might be, you never know),
so if enough citizens get upset enough, it has to change it's mind.  It's
still dead handy for providing police forces as the biggest smiter around,
to stop smaller smighters smighting the smallest of them.  <althogether too
much smighting in that paragraph, methinks>


>Terms such as "valid" (in an ethical context) and "rightful" are simply

Social conduct isn't arbitrary.  Certain actions are sociable and certain
aren't.  But some actions are anti-social and this is perfectly reasonable
(some libertarians/anarchists don't even believe in society, so they can
hardly be expected to follow social conventions, can they?).

Social rules are usually fairly simple - don't lie, don't attack each other,
etc.  But they are no use when the person you are dealing with is antisocial
and ignores the conventions you expect them to.

I don't know, but I am researching this with some mental health experts, so
I will get back to you on this. In the meantime, here are some interesting
statistics which I found in an article on the AWARE (Arming Women Against
Rape and Endangerment) Home page, linked below:

Yes, while we often see liberals hacking on how Republicans are pro-life with
respect to abortion, but not with regard to the death penalty, I wonder why
liberals can be so damn parsimonious, since they are the opposite, they are pro
abortion, but against killing animals.....

Using might to enforce rights is merely one possible manner of enforcing
respect for natural rights. Since the right to defend oneself is a natural
right, using force *as an individual* to defend one's rights is a matter of
natural law. Using force to deprive others of rights is against natural law.
This shows that while force is not objectively moral or immoral, it can be
used to either objectively moral or immoral ends. So you see, force is merely
a means to an end, not the end in and of itself. "It is the right that
defends all other rights."

Subjectivists try to deny that force follows from the natural right to
defense, because they want to deny the existence of natural rights. Nothing
scares me more than subjectivists in government positions, because they are
the ones who have the greatest potential to become tyrants.

Yes, this is the correct spelling. I goofed. Here is an extract from an article

Well, look at cows. As for mice, they are rodents. Most rodents, including mice,
are not only scavengers, but opportunistic predators, and sometimes full time
carnivores. Most rodents have no problem whatsoever with cannibalism.
We can look at human societies which have had little access to game and sparse
access to meat of any kind, with rigid social structures for long periods. We can
look at countries like Japan and China which have systematically culled their
population of misfits for thousands of years. This sort of evolved social
engineering certainly has had an effect, I think, upon the weight of the old
instincts in the minds of people in those societies. However, I think that nobody
today would be willing to go down such a path now.

Chimps and baboons are also members of the 'great apes' (the baboons may just be
considered a monkey, I can't remember) and are not strict vegetarians. These are
also only ape species that exist TODAY. Look at the fossil record....

While many social engineers like to blame it all on the bad public policies of
their political enemies, I would say that behavioral evolution is at the very
least 50% responsible for the phenomena.

Are there *ANY* non-subjectivists in government positions?  An
objectivist would probably die rather than take a job in our current

 IAN: I didn't say that chimps don't eat meat,
  I said flesh can be around 10% of their diet.
  That still doesn't make them carnivores,
  i.e., members of the Carnivora order.

Dick: I didn't say they were, I just pointed out that chimps are an
exception among the great apes.

A note on jargon: there's no such thing as an "omnivorous carnivore"; the
terms are mutually exclusive. Dogs and cats are carnivores. Some primates,
including people, are omnivores.

Most people I know eat meat (my Girlfriend doesn't, but apart from that I
think everyone  know does), and all of them are liberal (well, certianly by
your definition - all fo them are in favour of government, anyway).

Oh, and very few people are in favour of abortion, all though many people
are in favour of people being allowed a choice.  Enforcing abortion isn't
likely to be very popular.

We were, but you did write: "There is no 'right', 'wrong', 'valid',
'invalid', 'good', 'evil' EXCEPT within moral systems_" (emphasis mine).

Was that a slip of the pinkie, then?

Ha, thats funny. Say I'm a criminal holding you up. Since I have a silencer on
my gun, I just decided to blow your kneecap off to show you I meant business,
and nobody heard a thing, so I'm obviously not phased by your yap about 'the
police are gonna get me'. What are you gonna do now?

If I were trying to kill you, I obviously don't regard killing as a morally
unacceptable act, so what are you gonna do now?

Ha ha ha ha ha. You are SO funny. The only reason things are so peaceful around
Scotland is that all of the troublemakers got shipped off the the US and Nova
Scotia 100-200 years ago. The culling is long over with. It is very easy to get
away with killing someone who you have no significant prior contact with, have
no aversion to completely destroying all evidence, and prepare ahead of time,
and I sincerely doubt that the Scottish authorities are any more technologically
advanced in forensics than the FBI is.

Of course. Its extremely rude of me to carry a concealed firearm which you never
know about until the moment you decide to rip me off. Of course, since you are
only redistributing wealth which I obviously did not earn (because in your
opinion it is too much money), then your behavior is socially acceptable while
mine is not.

Subjectivism is the antithesis of civilized behavior and a free society.

I absolutely, 100% agree. What makes you think I believe in that bogus
dichotomy? My postulating evolution as a basis for understanding ethics
should've been enough to tell you where I stand on that.

Seems to me you're the one trying to get above or beyond nature in this
discussion, by arguing against the evolutionary basis for decent behavior.
Check your premises.

Actually last time I saw any figures, Scotland's murder rate was listed as
3.x per 100,000, where x was somewhere between 1 and 5; that's more than most 
of mainland Europe and rural America. Otherwise I generally agree with the
points about the troublemakers.

Also, I just saw an article pointing out that the per-capita assault rate 
in the small town near to where I'm currently working in England is three 
times higher than New York, burglary four or fives times higher, and car 
theft six times higher (the latter no surprise since there are far more 
cars per person here than NYC). I expect much of that is a statistical 
oddity because one is a town of thousands and the other a city of millions, 
but England isn't a particularly safe place either; almost makes me wish I 
had moved to NYC after all.

An objective evaluation obviously has to consider context. In this case,
_given the protester's goal_, it may be true that starving to death was the
right thing to do, i.e. it was good.

But for most of us most of the time, our objective (and a necessary means
to achieving just about any other objective) is to stay alive, and since
starving is obviously inconsistent with that goal, the proper objective
judgment is that eating is good.

I want to emphasize something which I've been remiss in not stating
explicitly: I'm not arguing that anything is _intrinsically_ good or right
(good or right in itself), as if goodness or rightness were an attribute of
an object or action; that's not where the objectivity lies. Things are good
or right only relative to someone's purpose. In this view, "rightness" and
"goodness" express relations, not qualities.

Thus, ethical principles, like all heuristics, are conditional: IF you want
to live, AND eating is necessary for life, THEN you need to eat (or, in
ethical terms, eating is good). The conclusion can be generated by a
syllogism. There's nothing arbitrary about it.

What I'm saying is that objectivity resides in recognizing effective means
to an end, not necessarily in choosing the end itself (except insofar as an
end is itself a means to a more important end).

Does this help us see a bit more eye-to-eye?

Yes, another example is the anti-hunting, pro-meat eating hypocracy. I have much
more respect for vegetarians than for such hyporites....

I'm also pro-choice, not because I don't think that the fetus is a living
creature, I think it is, but by all international norms, a human being must be a
citizen of either a country or a visitor from a UN Human Rights Treaty signatory
country, or from a country has diplomatic relations with the country we are
talking about to be considered to have rights. Under no national or
international law is citizenship conferred on an individual according to the
nation in which the individual was conceived in. They all make birth the
condition of citizenship. Thus the unborn have no rights under any accepted
national or international convention. Here in the US, under the 9th and 10th
amendments, any rights not specifically enumerated in the Bill of Rights were to
remain in the hands of the people, or in the states as delegated by the people.
So here, the various states can pass laws or state constitutional amendments
which regulate abortion and remain entirely constitutional on all levels. It is
their right to do so, and the right of people in the states to put such
amendments up to state referendums.

If a state wishes to pass an amendment putting the rights of the unborn ahead of
the rights of the mother, then so be it.

Hmm...my guess would be that it's "hopliphobia", though I can't find it in

A hoplite was a Greek infantryman.

Your second thought is correct: baboons are monkeys, not apes. (Good rule

Huh? I don't know of anyone, anarchist or not, who doesn't believe in
society. What we don't believe is that any grouping of people (community,
society, etc.) has ontological or ethical precedence over actual people
themselves.

Yes, this is the correct spelling. I goofed. Here is an extract from an
article
by Jeff Cooper on the origins of the word (I found it on the Canadian
Firearms
Site http://teapot.usask.ca/cdn-firearms/homepage.html )  here goes:

In order to do what?  We are talking about whether something is right or
wrong and how to define morality.  Not advance self defence techniques.  You
were paying attention weren't you?

So, as far as your concerned, if someone gets their own way, they are by
definition right?

Usually social construction become apparent through interaction with a
group.  Some groups codify these instructions, some don't.  These rules
generally evolve over time as individual points come up which don't fit the
rules.  You have interacted with a group before, haven't you?

Oh, and "who decides" was my point.  It doesn't matter who decides, you
don't have to pay attention to them anyway.  You can have your opinion, they
can have their opinion and neither of them is absolute.  I thought you were
arguing for objectivism?

Socially acceptable to which social group?

>Subjectivism is the antithesis of civilized behavior and a free society.


Weren't you just questioning who decided the rules?  Either we have rules or
we don't.  If we don't, then there are no rules (including property rights,
self-determination rights, etc.).  If we do, then they have to be defined by
a person/group/whatever.  Which one is it?

sorry, i'll rephrase:

When we are talking about morals, 'right', 'wrong' ,etc. only make sense
relative to a particular moral system.  In the same way that a speed is
always relative to an observer or other frame of reference, an action is
only right relative to a particular moral framework:  ie some actions are
perfectly reasonable under a utilitarian framework, but completely
unreasonable under a christian framework.  You have to look at the action
and see what the framework says about it rather than the action being right
or wrong seperate to that framework.

Sorry, is that clearer?

IMO, there is a long list of unusual mental abilities that a hypothetical,
perfectly sane being would possess.  I've never met a human who had all of
them, but some people certainly have more than others.  A partial list:

1)  The basic ability of rational thinking.  Its amazing how few people
bother to develop this, or even see it as a worthwhile goal.

2)  A willingness to apply rational thought to _all_ topics, not just a
select few.

3)  The ability to tell when you are lying to yourself, and to stop doing
it.  No one ever seems to be perfect at this, but some people are much
better than others.

4)  A good mental immune system, again based on rational thought.  If you
have 2 and 3, you probably have this - although thinking of ideas as memes
seems to make it much easier.

5)  Global change propagation.  When new information overturns a
long-established belief, the effects should propagate through the rest of
your mind in a reasonable amount of time.  This one sounds easy, but it is
actually very difficult to make sure you don't retain distantly-related
beliefs whose foundation has been undermined.

What else should be on the list?

Who's anti-hunting?  I'm not.  Hunting has been shown to be one of the more
efficient, pain-free methods of population control for some animals.  I'm
against torture, not hunting.

I would say that since it is evolution we are talking about, then it is the
longest possible span of reproducing the genomes of the individual in as many
reproductions as possible. Over the past several centuries, or past couple
thousand years, we have plenty of practical evidence and data that certain
heuristics which are commonly referred to as morals or ethics tend to benefit
their adherents in long term survival of their genome. This recognizes that
there are plenty of FAILED morals or ethics which did not stand the test of time
(state communism, nazism, cannibalism), and possibly some which provide no
benefit or harm, and are merely memetic baggage. This is because there is
survival of the fittest in memes as well as in genes.

What is the goal of evolution? Reproduction. All other goals are to optimize
this. Gaining wealth, long life, the most fun, are all subsets of the primary
evolutionary drive to reproduce. It is not subjective, merely a measure of
abstraction.

Now you are starting to understand, a little. Every being IS natural, but only
some things have being. A society or government is not a living thing. A human
or a cow is a living thing. A society or government is merely an abstract
construction, a tool, that we individual beings use to get along with each other
as our each individual set of rights overlaps. Society in and of itself has no
rights, and government only has such rights as we individual beings delegate to
it.

Rephrasing:

Okay, they don't believe that society takes precedence over them, so they
can't be expected to follow social conventions unless they feel like it, can
they?

Right.  So any action I perform is evolutionary.  Taking your money is an
natural act and therefore right.  Programming a computer is a natural act.
All acts are natural
, all are part of evolution, all is allowed by your ethics system.

Evolution allows _everything_, therefore your ethical system allows
_everything_

  IAN: If mice are in low-crowed environments but
  get violent in high crowding, but each condition
  is under laboratory conditions where the mice are
  not hunting for food in either scenario, they are
  deprived of hunting situations equally in both
  low and high crowing scenarios. This would tend
  to suggest that hunting depravation is Not the
  cause of increasing violence upon crowding,
  since the crowding is not associated with 
  any increase in non-hunting activities,
  but is assocaited with increased aggression.
  
  So hunting change is zero and yet aggression
  change is nonzero, which speaks against the 
  theory you raise that country folk are less 
  criminal because they kill more animals.

There are a few rational people in high office; Judge Posner
comes to mind.  And of course the most powerful man in the
country--Fed Chair Alan Greenspan--was one of the original
members of Rand's "collective".  You think the President has
power?  Last year, one casual remark by Mr. Greenspan about
the market's "irrational exuberance" was overheard, and that
day 200 billion dollars vanished from the planet.

Rand herself did not object to the idea of using public
office to accomplish things; if a robber hands you a gun,
would you not defend yourself with it?

P.S. For the nitpickers out there, yes, I know the Fed is
not technically a government office, much like the USPS is
officially a private enterprise.  Greenspan's job, however,
is subject to political pressure.

Well, Ayn Rand outright says that there's no such thing as society. 
She says the entire concept is nonsense.  I agree with Dick, but

I understand but disagree with the arguments that yield the "conservative"
stance.  It seems less a simple inconsistency than a skewed prioritizing
of the lives of potential beings over existing ones.  As for the corollary
"liberal" inconsistency, notice that the whiff of paradox vanishes if the
"liberal" permits abortions for both human and nonhuman animals, while
also pooh-poohing the consumption of either human or nonhuman animals as
food.  Again, existing beings have priority over nonexisting ones.  No
inconsistency at all.  Best, Dale

6)  Self-awareness.  The ability to say *why* you thought a given
thought, and be accurate about it, even if it's uncomfortable.  The
ability to think without using the word "I".  (I can't do this unless I
concentrate - that is, causal analysis attributes all cognition to a
monolithic self-symbol unless the subgoal of fine-grained analysis is active.)

7)  Emotional control.  A sane being should be able to control vis
emotions like flexing a finger, not by expending willpower.  (It's an
unfortunate fact that human emotions are central to the cognitive
architecture.  A perfectly sane human couldn't get rid of all emotions,
therefore, but would have to control them deliberately to select the
best cognitive ability for a situation.)

8)  Self-disbelief.  You're a lot less vulnerable to a "very old form of
mind control" (to quote Lois Bujold) if you think of orgasms as "small
explosions of endogenous opiates" (to quote ?) rather than anything
meaningful.  Same thing holds true, for, say, youthful rebellion; the
hold is a lot weaker if you think of yourself as acting out a scene from
challenging the chief of a hunter-gatherer tribe.  The other side of
evolutionary psychology is not taking yourself seriously.

9)  Ethical dreaming.  One of the ways to check your work, where
self-alteration is concerned, is to see whether the ethical principles
you instill in yourself when awake carry over into dreams.  If you can
retain your principles when your rational mind is asleep, logic is
mutable, nobody is watching, and you can be tempted with anything, then
you've probably done a good job.  (Lucid dreams don't count.)  I'm
ethical even in dreams now, and I'm damn proud of it.

What if the mice are programmed to switch from scavenging to actively 
hunting at high population levels, regardless of food availability? I 
have no evidence for it, so I'm probably hopelessly incorrect, but I 
could see that *in their natural circumstances* at a low population level 
they'd do well as scavengers but at high population levels they'd have 
to search more actively. Evolution could have built in some suitable
programming based on the population density (e.g. level of mouse scent)
rather than food availability.

Either way further experimentation would be required to decide the issue;
I don't think it's as clear-cut as you believe.

Hate to contradict someone who's on my side, but this is simply untrue, or
I'll eat my hat. Can you quote an reference for this? I've read everything
Rand wrote (I think), I subscribed to the Objectivist (in its several
incarnations) and the Ayn Rand Letter and still have every issue of these
publications. Nowhere do I recall her stating that the concept of society
is nonsense.

Unfortanately, she did write that anarchy is nonsense. Well, nobody gets it
right every time...

Does anybody know of any implementations of the game of Life
that introduce mutations, diseases, noise, colored cells, etc.?

It seems that with a few additional rules one can
develop evolving / fault-tolerant cellular automata,
and do lots of other interesting things, such as researching
attractors in automata state space and preparing for
nanotechnology that would produce physical automata
subjected to noise.

But maybe, these things have already been done?

If not, is anybody interested in collaboration?

     Now, as for humans, considering that we have evidence of  tool use in the
     harvesting of ungulates (proto-horses, proto-bison, mammoths, proto-deer, etc.) as
     well as other species like the great sloth, cave bear, etc., for several hundred
     thousand years, and we have fossilized spears etc. which are also several hundred
     thousand years old, we know that hunting has been a constant practice of human
     beings throughout their history. We also know that the late homo erectus preyed
     upon the early homo sapiens, as well as many other species, so the evolved
     practices go much farther back than just human history.

I think some of the most striking evidence that humans are suppose to be meat eaters, comes from a comparison of the human digestive system with other species.

    http://www.panix.com/~paleodiet/comparison.html

One thing we know for sure, is that human beings are not designed to eat grains!

Mike Lorrey writes of the spectrum allocation issue:

>Well, the original point of debate regresses back to the original land
grants.
. . .  Since electromagnetic spectra were not seen as a form of property
>(or even to exist) until after many of these grants were made, 
>it follows that all grants but those which were blanket grants of
>sovereignty . . . retained such rights to the sovereign power, i.e. the
>federal or state government. 

I think that the argument errs on two counts.  First, it presumes that
statists have rights to the property they claim, usually by merit of having
stuck a flag in some corner of a continent or watershed.  Contrary to that, I
would argue that property rights in land follow from possession and
improvement--usually the province of native peoples or of incoming settlers.

Second, though relatedly, the argument overlooks the doctrine of adverse
possession.  Even assuming that statists could obtain good title by mere
claim, they would under general principles of common law lose that title to
anyone who possesses a piece of property for seven years without objection or
interference.  In brief, mere claims to property do not suffice to retain
ownership.  If you fail to police your property, you can lose it to someone
who will put it to good use.

Now, as I've argued, I think it unwise to treat the spectrum like real
property.  But even if you do, and even if you think federal authorities can
establish good title to the spectrum by mere fiat (another dubious
proposition), the feds will in many cases lose that title due to the peaceable
use of the spectrum by private citizens.

Correction: unless they agree with the wisdom and propriety of the

I said merely that our long and peaceable use of the spectrum puts the burden
on the FCC to explain why it now has a valid claim to particular parts of it.
Separately, I argued that the FCC has no valid claim to one's peaceable use of
spectrum that does not interfere with anyone else's prior use nor to uses
prior to the FCC's claims.  Your counter-interpretation of the hypothetical
speaks only to the first point, not the second.

Regarding the second, I propose two hypotheticals based on height that would
fit.  First,  I build a 10m tower on my property (read "use spectrum") that
does not interfere with anyone else's use and enjoyment of their
property--including planes, etc.  No "Federal Height Commission" could
rightfully tear down my tower on mere grounds that it claims title to all
airspace above 9m--at least not without admitting that it was taking my
property for public use.  This hypo covers the FCC's bar on private, non-
interfering, low power uses of the spectrum.

Second, I build in the year 1900 a 100m tower on my property, one that does
not interfere with any prior-existing easement in the airwaves (there being no
air travel to speak of in that era).  The Federal Height Commission comes
along in 1927 and demands that I tear down the tower to accomodate the advent
of airplanes.  Such a demand, regardless of its utility to the public, would
violate my property rights in the tower and require (at least) compensation
under the 5th Amendment.  This hypo covers the FCC's claim on all the
spectrum--even parts that were in private use at the time of the Radio Act of
1927.

Robin and I also discussed the merits of particular sorts of arguments one
might use to resolve these sorts of questions, most notably those that rely on
counter-factual negotiations between property owners.  I wrote:

>>I have yet to hear a description of such a process that would, absent

Robin:

>objection here isn't one of these types, I don't understand what it is.

If I understand the form of argument under consideration, it aims at
justifying a particular mode of spectrum allocation on the basis of
hypothetical consent.  I object that it relies counterfactual assumptions
about all property owners agreeing to a particular allocation of spectrum
rights.  Property owners do not and almost certainly will not reach any such
agreement.  It will not suffice to justify the FCC's treatment of spectrum, or
for that matter a property-rights (as opposed to trademark-rights) based
approach to spectrum allocation, to argue that "property owners *might* have
agreed to it."

To my agreement that everything is natural, Samael quips:

Wrongo. I never stated that any act is allowed, just because it's natural.
Only rational action is enjoined by my ethics, i.e. what is objectively
conducive to my purposes. The purposes, and incidently reason itself, are
basically a result of my evolutionary (both biological and cultural)
heritage.

The question is not "what is natural?" but "what is reasonable?" (and I
don't just mean "polite").

I'm not sure I see the significance.  The leading supercomputer
manufacturers passed 1 TeraFLOPS a few months back, if I remember correctly.
I suppose its an indication that China is learning how to build its own
computers, but that's not a big surprise - and note that they use Motorola
CPUs.

So far as I am aware, no one has actually built a general-purpose quantum
computer.  The work I've seen uses purpose-built hardware to solve a given
problem - you have to rebuild the computer to change the program.  So, you
can't really run a meaningful benchmark on one yet.

  IAN: I also think it's not so clear-cut. 
  It's an interesting theory that even if it

I'll be glad to attempt to find the quote... Remind me tommorow if you
don't see it.  Grab your copy of "Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal" I
think it's either in the first essay or in one of the appendices.

I think she also mentions that the idea of society is nonsense in
Atlas Shrugged.

I will endeavor to find the exact quote and post it.

  Observe this U.S. Air Force weather-warfare webpage: 

http://www.au.af.mil/au/database/research/ay1996/acsc/96-025ag.htm 

  it says:

     "In the US, weather modification will likely 
     become a part of national security policy with 
     both domestic and international applications."

  That indicates that weather modifications classified 
  as "national security" (probably secret) operations 
  are planned to occur within the United States. If 
  witnesses across the US are seeing cloud-seeding
  operations conducted by Air Force jets, it seems
  that such secret Ops may be happening right now.

  This page gives a governmental definition of "security": 
  http://glossary.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-032/_4740.htm 

    "[2] With respect to classified matter, the con-
    dition that prevents unauthorized persons from 
    having access to official information that is 
    safeguarded in the interests of national security."

  So when the first military webpage says domestic
  weather-control Ops will be a subset of "national 
  security policy" it suggests they could be secret.

  If this nationwide military-cloud-seeding operation 
  has been happening for over a year, or even as far
  back as the late 1970's (as one witnesses told ENS),
  and the only way news of this surfaces to the people
  is either by direct witness, rumor, or out-of-the-way 
  and alternative-news sources, this suggests a uniform 
  news blackout is being conducted by the major media,
  and that media heads must be "authorized persons."
 
  This situation reminds me of the "Truth by Decree"
  essay: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/decree.htm

The related thing that most strikes me is the unfortunate 
lack of paper-length contributions on the topics which 
frequently appear on this list. 

There is a natural spectrum of "length" of contributions on 
a topic, ranging from off-the-top one sentence comments 
to detailed book-length or longer analyses.  In between are
email posts and paper-length discussions.  

Each of these lengths has its place, but contributions 
lengths should increase as topics become more important
and as conversations about them mature with time.

Shorter contributions are more flexible and responsive, 
allow discussants to more quickly adapt to changing 
feedback about what others find interesting and 
understandable.  Longer contributions, however, can 
support deeper and more elaborate examination of 
topics, and can make conversations more accessible to 
wider audiences.  

On many novel topics on this list I think discussants 
too quickly begin with email, and would do better 
initially with the flexibility of a phone conversation.  
On many older long-discussed topics, however, I think
conceptual progress is hindered by the failure of 
most of you to move on to paper-length contributions.  

Now a few people have, over the years, written books
on the topics we discuss.  But these mostly come off
as idiosyncratic personal visions, instead of part 
of a conversation within a larger community.  They
mostly give the impression that the author thought up 
all this stuff by him/herself, and rarely cite others 
who they are responding to or building on.  

Why?  It seems to me it is because of jumping too
quickly to book-length contributions, where paper 
length contributions would be more appropriate. 

When you get a new idea, call up a friend and talk.  When 
that gets stale, write it up as a short post, and try it 
out on an email list or newsgroup.  But after the topic 
gets hashed out a lot in email, and discussions there 
don't seem so productive anymore, if you think the topic
still worth pursuing, please, MOVE ON TO WRITING PAPERS!

Now maybe the first paper-length contribution on a topic
will seem an idiosyncratic personal vision, but after
that good papers should cite each other and respond to 
each other, just as good email posts do.  And only after
the conversation of papers seems to be getting stale
and limited by the depth of analysis possible in a paper,
only then should you really think about writing a book. 

I think you can infer some things about a topic from 
the length of contributions made on it.  If you only
ever see short contributions on a topic, you might 
reasonably infer that people don't really take it that 
seriously.  Either they don't care enough about it to 
take the next step, or the topic doesn't withstand 
careful scrutiny; those people who tried to write 
longer analyses realized it's all bunk and gave up.

So what do you guys want other folks to infer about 
the topics that come up over and over on this list?  
The "it's science fiction, not science" critique 
can be in part translated as "sure they'll throw out 
a few half-baked ideas in a novel, but anyone who
thinks about it carefully will realize it doesn't 
make sense."  

Well, do these ideas make sense or not?

Unfortunately, my copy of _Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal_  is in storage at
the moment (along with most of my political and economic library), but I'll
search my much-worn edition of _Atlas_ tonight.

I'll be glad to attempt to find the quote... Remind me tommorow if you
don't see it.  Grab your copy of "Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal" I
think it's either in the first essay or in one of the appendices.

I think she also mentions that the idea of society is nonsense in
Atlas Shrugged.

I will endeavor to find the exact quote and post it.

Well said, Robin.

My own experience is perhaps too unrepresentative to be useful, being stuck
here at the arse-end of the world with only three or four >H types visible
in the whole continent. But I have found that long phone discussions with a
friend, Russell Blackford, help both of us to clarify relevant ideas.  In
the last couple of years, partly as a result of such discussions, both he
and I have placed informal papers in such places as the Australian
cultural/current affairs journal *Quadrant* (Russell had a piece on the
likely impact of drastic technological innovation, which drew to some
extent on my book THE SPIKE; I've just placed a 5000 word piece on the ill
effects of holism as a research method, and hope to see a lump of my
forthcoming life-extension book in the national newspaper's monthly
upmarket Review of Books).  The response has been non-existent, as far as I
can tell (apart from the inevitable crusty letters muttered Bah Humbug).
And neither of us has yet produced a paper on any of these topics suitable
for submission to a peer-reviewed scholarly journal.  I do think that will
be the way to go, however.

Nothing new, but interesting to see the story there without the
Frankenscience smear:

< Warwick's eagerness is palpable, engaging, contagious. "This is where you
     can speculate," he says. "This is where we take a technical thing and
say,
'Right-o, got the signal, got the implant; all I've got to do is run a wire
                 the implant to my nervous system.' . . . I'm so excited

CNN just published a report "Higher speed limits mean more deaths"
 ( http://www.cnn.com/US/9901/14/speeding.deaths.ap/  )
from the studies conducted by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
and insurance companies.

The studies conclude that in the states that raised speed limits, highway
death rates increased by 12 to 15%.

General statistics: "people drove a little more than 2.5 trillion miles
in 1997, and the death rate was 1.6 per 100 million miles traveled - an
all-time low."

I am always suspicious reading statistics from agencies that are financially
interested in the results - in this case, collecting speeding fines and
carrying the price of insurance.

In this case, they seem to forget to take into account that some of the
victims of deadly crashes would, at a slightly lower speed, get "only"
severely maimed, or that there may be something special about the states
that increased the speed limit - like, increasingly congested traffic, or
that some people may now choose to drive through a state that has higher
speed limits, etc.

But I would like to suggest a different statistic.
Let's assume that the death rate rises linearly with speed limit
(looks like the case now).  So 10% increase in speed limit would
raise death rates by 0.16 per 100 million miles traveled.
So on average, a person would lose half of their life's worth of
waking time per each incident = 35 years * 365 days * 16 hours * 0.16
= roughly, 33,000 hours  per 100 million miles traveled.

But then, the same speed increase would save people time for productive
and pleasant activities, with the savings:
100 million miles / (average) 50 miles per hour * 10% = 200,000 waking
life hours.  Which is six times as much.

Note that these hours are current, unlike the hours that will not
be lived in the future, and any reasonable person would consider
younger-age time now more valuable than old-age time later.

As driving is a stressful activity, time saved from it will likely 
reduce mortality from other reasons.

Add to this the unaccounted factors mentioned in the beginning of this
message, and also considerations that reliance upon police instead of
common sense is not good for personal development, that it takes more
human life time to pay police expenses for enforcing speed limits,
that people who save time are usually more careful and more productive
than people who speed unreasonably (and don't have to suffer for their
stupidity) - and you will see that *higher speed limits save lives*.

The only problem, they don't save money to insurance companies.

*------------cut here/end--------------------------------------------*



CATALOGUE VERSION CHOICES:

1.  This version can be read by everyone, no matter what type of
     computer you use, or what type of software you use.  It is a simple
     format, with just our entire catalogue pasted into the body of a
     single email message, 316K in size.  If you use pine or elm on a unix
     system or an advanced software version such as Eudora Pro 3.0 or
     later, you will most likely receive it as a single email message.
     However, if your software limits incoming email messages to a
     certain size, say 32K or so, then your software will split it into
     multiple email message parts.   Whether you receive it as a single
     email message or multiple part email messages, you can easily
     paste it into one whole text document with your word processor, in
     about 10 minutes or so.
2.  For more advanced computer users:  attached plain ascii text file
     ~316K - you must know how to download an attached text file and
     then be able to locate it on your hard drive or system home
     directory;  it can then be opened with any pc or mac word processing
     software.  If in doubt, don't ask for this version.  This isn't for
     internet *newbies.* Better to order option 1 and spend a few minutes
     pasting them into one whole text document with your word processor,
     than to waste hours trying to figure how to deal with this option.
     This version is great for doing keyword searches and jumping around
     within the catalogue with your word processing software, if your
     normal email reading software doesn't allow this.


VERY IMPORTANT DIRECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT YOU GET A REPLY:

1.   you must call from an "unblocked number," ie. one that is not blocked
from caller id.  We are very sorry for this requirement, but our fax
software requires this before it allows an incoming fax call to connect.
If you have a blocked number, you must first unblock it.  In most cases
this means dialing *82 from a touch-tone phone (or 1182 from a rotary
phone) before you dial 1-718-227-9125.     NOTE:  If you are not sure if
your number is blocked, just try dialing our fax # normally.  If you don't
get a recording telling you your number is blocked, your number has been
transmitted and you may press the start button on your fax when you hear
the fax tone from our fax.
2.   no reply forms can be accepted by email....only via fax or smail.
3.   your form must be typewritten or printed out on your computer printer
before you fax it;  sorry, but *no* handwritten forms will be acknowledged.
If you can't find someone with a typewriter or a computer printer, we
apologize for not being able to reply to you.
4.   faxes with cover pages will be rejected.  You must send *only* the
reply form.
5.   forms not *completely* filled in will not be acknowledged.
6.   you will receive a reply within 1 business day directly from the
company making the offer via email.  Therefore you must have an email
address.  If you read this message, then you must have an email address, or
access to one, at least.   :-)
7.   your fax must not exceed 1 page in length.   Faxes of 2 or more pages
will be sensed, then auto-terminated and deleted.  Your fax goes directly
onto our 5.0 gigabyte hard drive and we must limit all incoming faxes to 1
page.
8.   all faxes must begin with:
*------------cut here/begin-------------------------------------------*
and must end with:
*------------cut here/end--------------------------------------------*
9. Any fax not conforming to this format will be sensed by our software,
then auto-terminated and deleted from the hard drive, before any human ever
gets to see it.
10. The type on your fax must be dark and legible.   If in doubt, please
print it out darker before faxing it in.  If we can't read it, we can't
reply to you or send you our FREE catalogue.     :-(
11.  If this all seems too complicated for faxing, just do it the old
fashioned way via smail!!!


WHO WE ARE:

Tempting Tear-Outs is an advertising company that brings potential new
customers to the companies they advertise for.

MORE ABOUT THE COMPANY MAKING THE FREE OFFER:

The company making the offer is a magazine subscription agency based in the
USA.  They have over 1,100 popular USA titles available to be shipped to
*any* country, including of course, to anywhere in the USA!    They offer a
FREE 1 yr. subscription to your choice of over 200 of the titles in their
catalogue to any new customer using them for the first time.       The
dollar value of the freebies, based on the subscription prices directly
from the publishers, ranges from $6.97 all the way up to $50.00!

For new customers in the USA, there is no charge for FPH (foreign postage &
handling), so the freebie is 100% free!   For new customers living
overseas, the only charge on the freebie would be for the FPH (foreign
postage & handling).

Their president has been in the magazine subscription business since 1973
and they are very customer-service oriented.   They will even help you with
address changes on your magazines, even if you move from one country to
another country.   They have thousands of happy customers in over 59
countries.

Their price guarantee is very simple:       they guarantee that their
subscription prices are the lowest available and they will BEAT any
legitimate, verifiable offer before you pay them or match it afterwards, by
refunding you the difference in price PLUS the cost of the postage stamp
you would use sending in the special offer to them, even 6 months after you
pay them, as long as it was current at the time of your offer.    Does that
sound fair?       Wouldn't it be great if everything you bought came with
that price guarantee?

Sometimes they are less than half of the next best deal out there,
sometimes just a little cheaper, but always you get the lowest rates
without having to shop around.     With 1,100+ titles on their list, they
would like to think that they have also the best selection around!

Within the USA, for their USA customers, they are cheaper than all their
competitors and even the publishers themselves.  This is their price
guarantee.         The 1 yr. freebie that you get with your first order is
completely free!

Overseas, (even after you factor in the cost of the FPH (foreign postage &
handling) and the conversion from USA Dollars to your currency), on the
average, they are generally around one-fourth to one-half of what the
newsstands overseas charge locally for USA magazines.  On some titles they
are as little as one-tenth of what the newsstands charge.  They are also
the cheapest subscription source for delivery overseas, including directly
from the publishers themselves!   Some publishers don't even offer
subscriptions overseas.........but overseas subscriptions are this
company's specialty!  They feel that magazines should not be a luxury
overseas.   In the USA, people buy magazines and then toss them after
reading them for just a few minutes or hours.  They are so cheap in the
USA!   Well, this company would like to make it the same way for their
overseas customers.  They are also cheaper than all their competitors in
the USA and overseas, including the publishers themselves!   It is also
*highly unlikely* you will find any of their USA competitors calling you
overseas, in order to offer that personal touch, just to sell you a couple
of magazines!  But that is what this company specializes in and loves
doing!     Around one-half their business comes from overseas, so they are
very patient with new customers who only speak limited English as a 2nd
language.    Subscription prices quoted for overseas consist of the
subscription price, plus the FPH.   You add the two together and that is
your total cost.   The exception is the 1 yr. freebie you get with your
first order.   On that title, you pay *only* the FPH for the 1 yr. term.

Their prices are so cheap because when you deal with them, you cut-out all
the middlemen.


HERE IS HOW YOU CAN GET MORE INFO AND GET STARTED WITH THEM:

Simply fax or smail back to us the reply form listed at the top of this
message.   We will then forward your form on to the subscription agency.
They will then email their "big and juicy" catalogue to you, in whichever
of the two formats you chose.   The catalogue is FREE and makes for hours
of fascinating reading, on its own. It includes the complete list of
freebies, a complete list of all the titles they sell, as well as detailed
descriptions on most of the titles, along with lists of titles by category
of interest and their terms of sale.

They will then give you a friendly, no-pressure, no obligation, 5-minute
call to go over how they work and to answer any questions that you might
have, as well as give you up-to-the minute price quotes on any titles you
might be considering.     They will call you in whatever country you live
in, taking the time difference into account.        As they like to
emphasize the personal touch they give to each new customer, all first-time
orders can only be done via phone, so they can answer all your questions
completely and personally.   Once you have placed your first order via
phone, you will be able to place future orders and make inquiries on your
account, get price quotes, etc., all via email, if that is most convenient
for you.

Within the USA, they accept payment via check over the phone, Mastercard,
Visa, American Express, Diner's Club and Carte Blanche.    Overseas, they
accept Mastercard, Visa, American Express, Diner's Club and Carte Blanche,
even if your credit card is a local one in local currency (that most
merchants in the USA would not normally be willing to accept).

That's our introduction of our client that we represent.   We hope that we
have piqued your interest and that you will take the next step to get their
free catalogue!   Thank you for your time and interest.

Thank you for doing the math on this one, Sasha!

It's been one of my favorite observations for years
 - were you here when the 55 mph limit was imposed? 

That's when I noted that the law was killing more than
it was saving, if you counted the life times wasted 
behind the wheel...  but you said it well, on the net 
for all to see.  Thanks again.

This is not to fail to appreciate your many more profound
observations that you are kind enough to share with us...

Keep Shinin'!

The basic argument is

1) Killing people is wrong.
2) Foetuses are people.

Most people would go with statement 1, less people with statement 2.

The problem being that it's hard to define when a foetus becomes a person.
For instance, my father is a neonatologist specialising in premature babies.
I know his NICU has dealt with babies down to 22 weeks gestation and they
have survived.  This would seem to indicate higher personhood than the ball
of 8 cells that they are a teensy bit earlier in their gestation.  Only
counting people as people when they are born seems a tad arbitrary.

Not using 'I' can be a useful trick for thinking in certain ways.  Another
useful one can be trying to form concepts without the word 'is' in them (or
isomorphic words).  Instead replacing it with phrases that acknowledge you
as an observer - ie instead of "Bob is an idiot" - "I Saw Bob do something
that I thought was idiotic." and instead of "electrons are particles." - "In
experiment X electrons acted in particle-like ways".

It can be a bit long winded, but rephrasing like this can be a good way to
spot logical flaws.

My philosophy in dealing with all other people is that I should never
initiate force or fraud against anyone (the standard libertarian line)
and everyone should be treated with courtesy. (Read "Miss Manners" for
specifics on this subject.) Also, when in Rome...unless it is immoral or
unhealthy. Obviously, if the Romans practice wife beating you do not
join in. :-)

One problem with your argument.  when you are speeding, you don't
necessaitly hit another speeding person.

If I'm doing 50 and you're doing 90 and you hit me, it wasn't my fault and
I'm dead too.

Thanks to the people who posted their opinions of this film. This movie
was one of the best of 1998. The visuals were stunning, the plot
ingenious, and a number of very interesting philosophical questions were
raised such as: What is identity? and How do we know what objective
reality is? Like most  good sci-fi, there are things to quibble about
and many unanswered questions, but so what? That only makes talking
about it more interesting. Also, at 98 minutes the film is a reminder of
how overlong many films have become and of the advantages of brevity.

Catch this one on DVD if you can. It's quite stunning and the separate
audio commentaries by film critic Roger Ebert and the director are
interesting too. You may want to watch this one three or four times.

I have a friend who is trying to convince me that torturing cats should
be legal because once we start granting animals rights, the next thing
you know we will have forced vegetarianism and roach motels will be
outlawed. I fail to see this slippery slope, but he is convinced of it.

This fellow is a devotee of Miss Ayn Rand, and he tells me it took him
months to understand her theory of rights. Well, it takes months to read
"Atlas Shrugged," so it isn't surprising that it takes that long to
figure out some of her philosophy.  I'm not sure why he thinks I am
going to understand it after a short e-mail. I suspect it took him so
long to understand because like all natural rights theories it is
"nonsense on stilts," to quote Bentham, and nonsense takes a lot more
explaining than things that make sense. Rand believed in objective
reality but her "rights" floating around in space waiting to be
discovered, or where ever the hell they come from, are as  silly as the
God she did not believe in. Maybe you can find them next to Plato's
"forms"  in the land of OZ, who knows. And can somebody give me a good
explanation for that weird rape scene in "The Fountainhead." Please.

At any rate, I pointed out to him that I don't give a damn about what
Miss Rand thinks about the "rights" of sadistic cat torturers, but if he
had a good extralegal solution to the problem of cruelty to animals , I
would entertain the idea. He doesn't think people should torture cats,
only that it should be legally allowed.

I have two cats, so I am a bit biased in favor of the critters.

I'd recommend you watch the first two-three minutes with the sound off,
because the voice over at the beginning gives away the whole damn plot.

The advanced regions of China are pretty modern now, and will probably be on
the same level as western Europe within a decade.  I'd expect their military
at that point to be using the same tech base as France, Japan, and other
modern countries.  Their neighbors will worry, but it doesn't threaten us
unless we go out of our way to be really, really stupid (i.e. even worse
than usual) about our own military affairs.

Of course, the nukes could still be a problem if we don't get an ABM system
built soon.

May I suggest a non-cursive font for the web page?  Otherwise some of us
have to switch to 'View Source' just to see what it says, which kind of
defeats the purpose.  :-)

More comments to follow after I get a chance to read everything.

Part of the problem is the nature of the topics we discuss.  Honestly, how
many of us are qualified to write a rigorous analysis of a topic that spans
half a dozen disciplines?  A detailed justification of any particular
Singularity scenario, for example, requires an understanding of every field
of technology you want to take into account, plus a bit of political
science, history and economics.  It is very easy to be overwhelmed by the
impossibility of covering the entire topic, and end up writing nothing at
all.

The traditional solution, of course, is to pick a sub-topic you can do
justice to.  Unfortunately that doesn't work well when dealing with future
scenarios, because the different components are often mutually
interdependent.  What we really is a better mechanism for doing on-line
collaboration - perhaps a web site set up for use as a moderated
discussion/collaboration forum.

Yes, you are correct EXCEPT in denying the existence of zero, a natural moral
fixed point within the moral space continuum from which all others can relate
and which binds the moral continuum to real behavior in the real universe. Even
in relativity space there are absolutes, like the speed of light, the Planck
length, etc...

Yes I am. However, the abortion is a debate on the legal status of the fetus in
the current system. There is no current system in existence which allows for
citizenship for the unborn, based on location during conception. You must be
born somewhere to be given citizenship there. A person without a country in the
present day has no big thug to protect him from other big thug governments, and
has no rights except and unless the big thug picking on the nationless
individual is a signer of the UN Human Rights treaty. We are talking about
legalities here, not absolutes. As I said, I do beleive that abortion is killing
a being., but under the current legal systems everywhere it is not murder any
more than putting a dog to sleep can be murder.

NO!! The state has no more right to pass laws on non-citizens than
does the federal government. This does not stop them however.

I disagree completely.

Ok, so I'm really bored this morning - SUE ME!

*******************************************
The Extropian Redneck:

The Redneck Application of the 7 Principles of Extropianism:

1. Perpetual Progress - "I want to kill more deer.  To do so, I will
become a smarter hunter - ever increasing my deer hunting skills.  If
I live indefinitely, the number of deer I kill will increase.  I will
seek to remove all obstacles standing in the way of killing more deer
- be they political, cultural, biological or psychological."

2. Self-Transformation - "I also want to drink more beer. I affirm
that I will direct my entire being to transform myself into a more
efficient beer-drinking person.  Through critical and creative
thinking I will become a better beer drinker.  I will explore
biological and neurological augmentations that will allow me to
consume ever-greater quantities of beer."

3. Practical Optimism - "Life is great.  I know I will continue to
have more and more opportunities to drink beer and kill deer."

4. Intelligent Technology - "There must be some way to applice science
and technology to enable me to consume more beer and kill ever greater
numbers of deer.  Perhaps a new laser equipped, satellite enhanced
site for my rifle, neuro-implants to sharpen my vision, and a
mouth-widening operation to allow me to drink two bottles of beer at
the same time.  I refuse to see technology as an ends to itself, but
more as an enabler to allow me to further my redneck goals."

5. Open Society - "I support social orders that promote freedom of
rifle ownership and deer hunting.  I oppose authoritarian social
controls which ban the drinking of beer, even on Sunday.  I prefer
bargaining over battling, exchange over compulsion, and serious
hunting over spotlighting."

6. Self-Direction - "The woods over over yonder, my rifle is right
here and the cooler's in the truck!  All set!"

7. Rational Thinking - "I know that without hunting, the population of
deer will skyrocket, and while large numbers of deer make for a target
rich environment, too many deer will cause starvation which may lead
to extinction of deer population in certain areas, perhaps including
the Skunky Bark Huntin' Camp.  The more accurate my rifle site is, the
better shot I will become, thus increasing my hit to miss ratio.  Beer
frees the mind from worrying about the wife, twelve kids, six dogs,
leaking roof, the Trans Am on blocks in front of the trailer, and my
current lack of employment.  Budweiser is indeed, the king of beers."

However, you are talking about mice and I am talking about men. They are distinct
species with different behaviors. However, using lab mice is kinda like looking
for the behavior in a herd of cows. They are very domesticated. Try a natural
environment with wild mice, with and without prey. I'll try to find out if Jackson
Labs produces a strain of lab mice which is naturally sociopathic/psychotic. A lab
experiment could be run with such a strain, providing non mouse prey and no non
mouse prey  on such a strain would work.

Yes, very. However notice how much they've evolved into a niche that cannot
tolerate violence, and is probably what will cause them to become extinct, even if
not by the hands of man. Same with the orangutan.

Even during the colonial times, the settlers, as serfs/vassals of a sovereign in a
feudal system, required land grants from their sovereign to posess good title to
the land they settled. While frequently, they had occupied the land first, built a
cabin and cleared a field, etc. then put in for a grant as recognition of their
posession, mainly due to the slow speed of communication in those days. However,
minor grants for homesteads were granted by the colonial governors of the various
colonies. The grants for the colonies as whole entities were themselves granted by
the monarch

Natives which did not have recognisable legal systems to adjudicate property
rights tended to get walked over, while those that did fared better. The Iroquois
Confederacy is a notable example, as were the Cherokee. The Iroquois had a
preexisting system in place when the white man came, while the Cherokee developed
one/mimicked one to try to adapt, with predictably different outcomes.

Yes, this is definitely true, however, this is presupposing that the new owner has
some sovereign enforced venue to ajudicate his or her claims.

Yes, one could argue that since Westinghouse was the first 'occupier' of the radio
spectrum, that it should be the sovereign power in that 'land', except that
Westinghouse only existed as a corporation granted a charter by the US and a US
state, much like Hudson Bay Company and the East India Company were granted
charters by the English monarch.

I think we need to research the history of areas settled by colonization that
established independent self governance without any granting by outside
sovereignties.

Thank you very much. This is an excellent reference. We can also look to actual people who live exclusively on meat diets: eskimos and inuit peoples. Note to those
not knowing the difference: the Eskimos originate from arctic siberian coasts, and migrated relatively recently to northern Alaska; the Inuit are long term
residents of the Alaskan and northern Canadian coastal regions.

Eliezer's web pages contain a number of paper-length elaborations of
his ideas.  While they are a somewhat personal view particular to him,
one possible approach would be for others to write thoughtful critiques
of Eliezer's writings, at a similar level of depth.

Well, are your cats fixed? That seems to me to be (presupposing the animal

Here's a question: Does the study examine differences in the range of speeds
used on the same roads at the same time? I would imagine that if everyone were
going 80 mph they would be driving much more safely than if people on a
highway were driving a range of speeds from 50-80. I'm sure that if everyone
were driving 80 they'd have a higher risk during the time they were driving
than if everyone were driving 50, but they would also be on the road at least
40% less time than those driving 50, so their overall cumulative risk may be
lower even though their minute by minute risk may be higher, as you
calculated.

I've included an article below.  If you want the whole enchilada, see
the http://www.people-press.org/tech98sum.htm which is packed with
statistics.

Among the more interesting ones:

-43% of adults own a computer
-41% of adults use the internet (74 million Americans)
-35% of adults use email
-16% of adults (45% of email users) checked their email "just yesterday"
-12% of adults are regular, daily users of the Internet

-20% of adults (49% of Internet users) log in ONLY from home (not work/school)
-13% of adults (32% of Internet users) have bought something online

-The Internet male/female ratio is 52%-48%, close to the US ratio (48%-52%).

>The 74 million Americans who go online remain substantially younger,

There's a lot of other neat stuff, like how much traffic various
Internet news sites get.

I found this line the funniest:

>Overall, parents worry more about what their children might see on
>television than they do about what they might see on the Internet (35%
>vs. 23%)

But how reliable is this survey?  These stats make me wonder:

>Internet users are also substantially better informed than non-users,
>particularly about high-technology news topics -- again, even when the
>higher education and income levels of Internet users are taken into
>account. For example, twice as many Internet users as non-users could

>(75% vs. 35%).
>
>Similarly, more Internet users than non-users knew the Republicans are
>the majority party in Congress (68% vs. 50%)

	If you don't know the Republicans are the majority party,
where have you been the last 4 years?

>Americans who go online also say they voted in the 1998 elections in
>greater numbers (61% among Internet users, compared to 51% among
>non-users).

	Well, they're lying.  Voter turnout was around 36% in 1998
(see www.fec.gov).  Roughly 20% of adults lied in this survey.  Hmm...

                  Poll: Audience for Online News Up 

                  By ANNE GEARAN
                  Associated Press Writer 

                  WASHINGTON (AP) Weather that most universal of
                  topics is now the most popular subject for Americans
                  seeking news on the Internet, a poll released today found. 

                  That's happening as the audience for online news is
                  expanding rapidly, and as that audience's tastes broaden
                  from niche interests like election news to more general
                  subjects like weather. 

                  The online audience is changing from an elite,
                  computer-savvy group (typically well-educated, affluent
                  and male) to a group that looks more like mainstream
                  America, the survey by the Pew Research Center for the
                  People and the Press indicates. 

                  The nationwide telephone survey of 3,184 adults, taken in
                  November, found the percentage of Americans who use the
                  Internet as a source of local news, entertainment news and
                  weather data has increased significantly since 1996. 

                  "The popularity of general interest subjects online from
                  weather patterns to entertainment news is growing much
                  faster than that of political or international news," the
                  survey authors wrote. 

                  The survey found 41 percent of adults use the Internet to
                  some degree, and weather is the most popular online news.
                  In 1996, 23 percent of Americans used the Internet, and
                  news items related to technology were the top draw. 

                  Among Internet news users, 64 percent said they looked for
                  weather information online. In 1996, 47 percent sought out
                  such information. Use of the Internet for local news rose to
                  42 percent of news users, from 27 percent. 

                  The survey found women have overtaken men among
                  newcomers to the Internet. Of people who said they began
                  using the Internet within the previous year, 52 percent were
                  women and 48 percent men. That's close to the breakdown
                  of the population at large. 

                  Middle-aged and middle-income people of both sexes are
                  also coming to the Internet in increased numbers, as are
                  people with less than a college education. Among Internet
                  newcomers, 40 percent never attended college, and 23
                  percent have household incomes below $30,000 a year. 

                  Still, the 74 million Internet users in the United States are
                  generally younger, better-educated and more affluent than
                  the population at large. The survey indicated 80 percent of
                  Internet users are under age 50, compared with 63 percent
                  of all Americans, and 39 percent of Internet users are
                  college graduates, compared with 22 percent of the nation
                  at large. 

                  Internet users are no more likely to distrust the government
                  than the population at large, the survey suggested. 

                  Overall, online news consumption is up dramatically. In
                  1995, 4 percent of Americans went online for news at least
                  once a week. The figure is now anywhere from 15 percent
                  to 26 percent, based on recent Pew surveys. 

                  Among Internet users, 37 percent go online for news at
                  least once a week, another third do so less frequently and
                  about 30 percent said they never look for news online. 

                  Those who seek news online cited three main reasons: to get
                  information unavailable elsewhere, for convenience and
                  because they can search for particular subjects. 

                  More people getting more news online may mean fewer
                  people getting their news from television, the survey found.
                  Heavy Internet users seem to read newspapers and listen to
                  the radio as often as those who don't use the Internet. 

                  In addition, new online users increasingly come from
                  middle- and lower-income groups that watch more TV
                  than other Americans. Also, new users are drawn
                  disproportionately from younger generations that have
                  relied primarily on television for their news, the survey
                  authors noted. 

                  The Internet news audience generally said the Web sites of
                  various news organizations are as accurate as those groups'
                  traditional outlets. But 44 percent think the Internet
                  provides a more accurate view of the world than daily
                  newspapers or newscasts. 

                  The number of people who sought election news online
                  grew to 11 million in 1998, up by 4 million users from 1996.
                  But among regular Internet news users, the percentage who
                  logged on for election information fell to 15 percent from
                  22 percent in 1996. That is partly due, in part, to the fact
                  that 1996 was a presidential election year, the authors said. 

                  Among other findings: 

                  Sending and receiving electronic mail is the most popular
                  activity online. The survey found 35 percent of all adults
                  use e-mail, up from 19 percent in 1996. 

                  E-mail is increasingly used for personal communication. In
                  1995, 31 percent said it was exclusively a work tool. In 1998,
                  12 percent said that. Among e-mail users, 88 percent use it
                  for both personal and work communications or exclusively
                  for personal communication. 

                  Online shopping is up. Even before the Christmas 1998
                  shopping season was in full swing, 32 percent of Internet
                  users had made a purchase via computer at some point. In
                  1995, just 8 percent had.

Yes, even if we founded a School of Transhuman Studies on a campus somewhere,
there would still be a large number of people who are merely fans/advocates who
would not at that point be students, faculty, or researchers actively involved.
Better yet, why has there not been an establishment of formal classes in
transhuman studies over the internet? I would love to participate in such
courses, but I think it would be up to established faculty like Robin Hanson,
Max More, Alex Chislenko, and others to create such a curriculum. If you guys
want to start the School of Transhuman Studies, I will provide whatever start
up space that is needed on the servers of my company (we are launching an
e-commerce ISP, to go online in a few months), unless you want to put it under
the ExI site.

The sad thing is, I cannot disagree that this is the impression that
this list projects.  This list seems to attract more political
commentators than researchers, more gun enthusiasts than computer
enthusiasts, and more conspiracy nuts than scientists.  There is more
discussion about economic theories than on scientific theories.
Arguments about vegetarians, animal rights, gun control, homosexuals,
social classes, government actions, liberals, religion, class struggles
should be on alt.politics instead of the extropians list.

Believe it.  At a cellular phone repair center, where I work, more than 
half of those who work with me must have four-year degrees, to get
their jobs.  However, in casual conversation, I have learned that fewer
than half of those people know things like who the majority party in
Congress is.

Where is this zero, how do we find it.  What does it derive from.  How do we
observe it.  With the speed of light, there are observations and
meausurements we can make, not so with morals.

If you're a very good driver, in a well-maintained
vehicle, it may be safer overall to drive faster
(within reason) than the speed limit (and the speed
of must other vehicles), because you reduce the time
you spend on the road (during which you're at risk).

You can disagree with the 9th and 10th amendments all you want, but they
are there, and that is what they imply, and the feds and states can do
what they want to people who are not citizens of any country, while the
feds have authority over immigration of citizens of other countries, as
well as the travel and actions of non-citizens from other countries, but
only as a consequence of us recognizing those countries. Individuals are
protected under our constitution as honorary citizens merely as a matter
of diplomacy to ensure that our citizens in other countries will be
similarly protected under their domestic systems. Now what would be
interesting would be for the feds to treat abortion as an immigration
issue.... he he. In the abstract sense, since birth is a form of
immigration from legal nothingness to citizenship, the feds should have
control in this sense. They can, if they want, change the qualification
for citizenship to whatever point during pregnancy they want (which is
going to make it obviously more difficult to enforce versus a clear cut
point in time like birth). I would think that this would require a
constitutional amendment to change though....

So do I (there's some other stuff too). See:

It's a bit dated, but perhaps there are still some useful links in there.

You automatically assume that I find utility in killing MORE deer per unit of time. This is an unjustified and untrue
assumption. I may seek to increase my deer hunting skills by making it more difficult for me to kill a deer, say
eventually I may only do so with bare hands, or that I must kill from beyond 1000 yards, or be within 10 yards, etc.,
which would obviously reduce my overall deer kill rate.

You again assume that the unit of improvement is quantity. I actually prefer microbrewed beer, for the taste. I tend to
drink less these days than in my Coors and Miller funnel chugging frat boy days in college....

Try to imagine that you are talking about a Californian instead of a redneck:
2. Self-Transformation - "I also want to drink more wine. I affirm
that I will direct my entire being to transform myself into a more
efficient wine-drinking person.  Through critical and creative
thinking I will become a better wine drinker.  I will explore
biological and neurological augmentations that will allow me to
consume ever-greater quantities of wine."
This is obviously inaccurate, as the goal will be to be a more discriminating and capable wine connesseur, the goal of
which would be to drink BETTER wine, and have better taste in wine.

This is all very funny. I love it. I think I'll post it up at my hunting cabin (called the Steel Gate Camp).

I disagree.  It is easy to be a scientist and a socialist, but it is
not possible to be an extropian and socialist.  Some may disagree but
read the principles that Max has written.  Advocating the use of force
against peaceful citizens has no place in extropianism.

Extropianism is not about technology or science.  It is about a way of
life that happens to promote technology and science as a means to the
end of eliminating entropy.

How can we grow as individuals (a definite aim of Extropy) if we limit
our discussion to science and technology?  Poor, inconsistent memes
must be weeded on a continual basis.

Am I right?

I'm sure that if you wish to have an exclusively scientific discussion
you will find other lists to suit you.  I'm sure that scientific
discussion will continue here as well as discussions about politics,
conspiracies, animal rights and rednecks.  As long as we don't resort
to name calling, I think all is fair game - even occaisional humor.

My redneck post was simply a light hearted and probably poor attempt
at humor caused by excessive boredom on a Friday morning.  I'm sorry
you found it disgusting or disturbing.

Can you point to any animal rights literature that claims this?  I think
you are setting up a straw-man argument for animal-rights advocates that
I have never heard them profess.

Please!  I studied comparitive biology, and this chart is a joke.  Any
biologist will tell you that humans are omnivores.  Our digestive system
is somewhere in-between an herbivore's and a carnivore's.  You can draw
parallels to either.  And as for grains, humans and all herbivores have
the enzyme ptyalin in their saliva which is required to digest grains.
Carnivores do not have this enzyme.  Humans are obviously adapted to
digesting grains.

This chart claims that humans always chew vertically and never rotary?
Mastication is not important in human eating habits?  Humans get no
digestive benefit from intestinal bacteria?  Human digestion works at
100% efficiency?  And it is impossible for a human to live without
animal protein in its diet?

Why does it compare digestive track length as a ratio to the whole body,
but compares actual size of stomachs?  Why the emphasis on colon size,
rectum size, and feces size?  Couldn't we just choose a rabbit for our
herbivore and get a small colon, small rectum and small feces?

What about the comparisons that the chart doesn't show:

Carnivores                      Herbivores      Humans
==========                      ==========      ======
Perspires through tongue        through skin    through skin
Sharp claws                     no claws        no claws (or vestigial)
Sharp pointed fangs             no fangs        no fangs (or vestigial)
Acidic saliva                   alkali saliva   alkali saliva
no enzyme ptyalin               enzyme ptyalin  enzyme ptyalin 
strong HCl acid in stomach      1/20th strong   1/20th strong
no molar teeth                  molar teeth     molar teeth

The fact is, humans are omnivores.  They evolved away from meat eating
into something inbetween an omnivore and an herbivore.  Transhumans can
eat whatever they want, as long as they get enough of each nutrient in
whatever diet they choose.

But does socialism inherently involve advocating the use of force?  Can't
it be organized on a voluntary basis?

Consider: a group of socialists gets together and builds themselves a
space station.  They agree that the property will be the common ownership
of the group, with specified procedures for group decisions.  This is
analogous to how a corporation works.  The whole thing is organized
voluntarily, and all the means of production are controlled by their
society.  Where is the force?

No not at all. It allows anything which does not impede on anyone elses rights.
That is a distinct subset of _everything_.

Well, being an *actual* redneck myself (hell, I grew up in Vicksburg,
MS - the Gibralter of the damned Confederacy!) I did this just for the

Actually, I'm assuming that a true redneck wouldn't be able to tell

Again, to a redneck, quantity of beer is the important thing.  Most
rednecks wouldn't mind have an infinitely filled keg grafted onto
their back with a hose running directly into their mouth.  Nevermind
the taste, or sensation - it's fun to puke in the back of your truck!

Well, to a redneck, wine is kind of like holy water to a vampire
(unless we're talking Mad Dog 20/20)...  Just the thought of wine
pisses off a redneck...

How do you know unless you have tried? Using my earlier definition of objective
morality, it would be relatively easy. First off, you need to theorize that it
might, in fact, exist.

Can you do that?

-----also forwarded to mutantRMs

Greetings merry extropians.  Thank you for the scoop on the CNN and Time
stories, as well as the many other great tips that I have gleaned from
this list.  You are a all a big part of my life.  

I hope you don't mind my lurking too much.  I'm a poor grad student, and
time is limited.  Plus, I'm not sure that I fit in entirely, so I lurk
and benefit from your clearly brilliant intelligence.  Here are a few
key points, which you may address, if you like.

1.  I'm not hot on the idea of cryonics.  ;-}
	a.  Based on my own subjective experiences, I am entirely convinced
that consciousness is non-temporal.
	b.  Cryonics is, at best, a last resort.
2.  I'm not a strict atheist, in fact, I'm a devout mormon.
	a.  The mormon "god" is like a successful extropian.
3.  I'm not a strict libertarian.  You could say that I am an extremely
liberal, left-wing, libertarian.
	a.  Bring on the national ID cards.
	b.  Send welfare mothers back to school.
	c.  National enterprise is glorious.
	d.  Environmentalism is good.
4.  Entropy is part of the life process.
	a.  We would not exist w/o certain entropy driven processes.


Get the idea?  Despitely these points, which most of you I think would
disagree with, we are probably in complete agreement on most everything
else.  For example;

5.  I'm a scientist (biochemist/crystallographer).
	a. the method of science leads to truth and technological advances,
which as a net benefit, uplifts humanity.
6.  I am excited about the possibility of enhancing human experience and
intelligence through drugs and implants
	a. ... and through uploading/downloading.
	b. I would like to have the whole web in my head.
7.  I am engaged in an intensive life extension program.  
	a. I am going for immediate quality of life improvements
	b. ... and increased longevity.

I feel that points 1-4 are coherent with regard to points 5-7.  

----------- Please, am I an extropian? -------------

Regards, 
proclus

First Union Mortgage Company (part of one of the country's biggest
banks) restrict's their employee's access to the Extropy Institute's
web site because they find it to be objectionable!  I can't believe
it.  I just sent my wife (who is a contractor working there) the link
to the Extropian Principles and she was blocked from going there...

Isn't that interesting...?

She also just told me they block the Matt Drudge site too...

Suppose they don't want any of their sheep getting ideas... or lazing
around work either. hmmmmmm

It may adapt, but what is it most efficiently evolved for? The page she
referenced purports to show that the human digestive tract is, in fact,
optimized for a meat diet. On a basis of natural law, this means that it
is in fact not naturally immoral for humans to kill animals and eat their
meat. One might say that it is more moral than displacing herbivorous
animals in the food chain of an ecosystem with humans practicing the less
efficient herbivorous lifestyle.

Good point, but I was referring to governments.  In the case of the
spaceship we may not be talking about a government.  What if someone
on the ship worked really hard to create something *really* valuable
and then decided not to share it with her crewmates.  Since she's
confined to a spaceship, her association with her crewmates is no

share her creation or would the socialist commune partially dissolve?

My point is that socialist governments must by their very nature use
force against peaceful citizens to make them participate.  Those who
advocate socialist governments are therefore advocating the use of
violence.  Unless the association with the group is voluntary, force
is required.

On the one hand, I have to agree with Harvey Newstrom that debates about
these topics tend to be remarkably sterile - anyone who cares about these
issues already has an opinion, and is unlikely to change it.  OTOH, one of
the major things we stand to accomplish here is helping each other figure
out how to cope with (and take advantage of) the future - and that means
more than just technology.

IMHO, the problem arises when we forget where we are, and start arguing
about a mundane topic (like gun control) from the perspective of the society
we live in.  That reduces us to dissecting the mistakes of the past, and
assuming we are doomed to repeat them.  Then we get a thread that could just
as easily have originated in alt.politics, alt.religion, etc.

Surely we can do better than that.  Aren't we supposed to be the ones who
can see that the future will be different than the past?  We should be
focusing on how to solve problems in the future, not on how our ancestors
should have done it 10, 100 or 1000 years ago.

When we can create our own engineered "meat" will this conversation
even mean anything?  Would vegitarians be more willing to eat beef
because no cows were harmed?

Distinctions between governments and mutual agreements go by the wayside
if we assume that everyone involved voluntarily agreed to live by the
rules of their society.  Newborn children are a sticky issue with this
approach, since they are born into society without agreeing to anything.
Generally you can consider that while minors they are bound to obey
their parents, and then when older they have a choice between accepting
the rules of society or leaving.

This would work best in a system where emigration was possible, such as
the space station (not space ship) I was proposing, where the assumption
is that other space stations with different rules would exist, or of
course on a planet where different countries existed with varying rules.
We have even discussed the possibility of people choosing their rules
on an individual basis, rather than on where they live, although that
gets pretty complicated.

The lady who made something and then wanted to keep it is violating
the rules that she herself agreed to (assuming that private ownership
was not allowed in their society).  This is unfortunate for her, but
that is the price we pay for saying that people own their own lives.
They have to be able to bind themselves to rules.

In theory, sure.  Lots of communes have been organized on this basis, for
example.  Larger socialist groups could also be formed on a voluntary basis,
if you could find enough volunteers.  The problem arises when you start
talking about how to run an existing society.

Then you have a circumstance where the group is not composed of volunteers.
Instead you round up everyone who happens to live in a geographic area, and
tell them they all have to live by your rules.  No matter what those rules
are, a significant fraction of the population won't like them - so you have
to force them to go along.

Thus, any nation-state is ultimately based on force.  The question is how
best to minimize the amount of force that must be used in order to get a
functioning society.  If this is a central issue for you, then socialism is
a bad deal - it requires lots and lots of rules, most of which are against
the best interests of those who follow them, so they all have to be backed
up with force.

For socialists, this isn't a problem.  The naive ones convince themselves
they won't ever need to actually shoot anyone, and the more insightful ones
simply believe that other goals are more important than minimizing violence.
If, however, you believe that minimizing the initiation of the use of force
should be one of our top goals, it is very difficult to justify any of the
more expansive types of government.

Speaking an IE 5.0 beta-tester, I don't think it matters much.  Your screen
quality will make a bigger difference, but the real determinant is how thick
your glasses are - red on black is low contrast to start with, and adding
the cursive effect reduces me to squinting along at <10 WPM.  Ack!  :-)

Good point.  Are we debating the evils of consuming meat, or the best way to
avoid hurting animals?  Or are both points important to the veggies?

I don't much have a problem with people advocating a kind of
noncoercive socialism, though I honestly don't believe such a society
would last very long - especially not if it was very large.  We can
talk all we like about space stations and voluntary governments, but
those don't exist.  99% of people who advocate socialism advocate
statist socialism which is an advocation of force against peaceful
citizens.

A professor of mine once asserted that he would be willing to grant full rights of personhood to fetuses the moment they petitioned for same - his point being that it is an act of bad faith to assign personhood rights to organisms that do not and never have possessed the subjectivity essential to the exercise of freedom and choice, and cannot assume any responsibility correlative to such rights.  To claim that the embryo or fetus possesses a unique DNA sequence is no argument for its being granted equal status with a functioning member of society, unless one is prepared to defend an entirely chemical definition of conscious human life.  A fetus is not a potential human being, it is possibly an potential human being (1/3 of all pregnancies end in miscarriage, a fact which makes christians squeamish, for it means that their god is far and away the universe's most prolific abortionist).  When the rights and freedoms of an actual human being, with a unique subjectivity, an individ!
ual personal history, and an existent and continuing participation in a web of social interrelations, are weighed against the alleged rights of a possibly potential human being, who (and "who" does not even actually apply here) lacks all of these, the rights of the actual person must take precedence.

I think this is setting too high a standard.  If you are qualified 
to write informative posts on a topic, you are qualified to write
an informative paper on the topic.   You need just consider the same 
issues you would in a post, but more carefully and thoughtfully.
The goal is relative, not absolute: to improve our understanding of the topic.

I am eating some pig now as I write.  It was a real, not fictional, pig.
If you say that I shouldn't have eaten it, you are saying you prefer
the counterfactual world where that pig never existed.  Your argument
is that, in that counterfactual world, the real pig in front of me would
then be fictional, and so you wouldn't have to worry about its "desires."
But I am now taking into account the *real* "desires" of a real pig I 
am eating.  I judge it preferred to live than to not exist, even if that
meant being eaten in the end.

Mutations and noise, that seems to be indistinguishable. Can't parse
diseases. Colored cells seem to mean states richer than boolean.

Such things have indeed been investigated, albeit not under the label
'Life'. You might want peruse the cellular automata bibliography on 
Santa Fe's ALife server. The literature is quite huge, though somewhat
difficult to obtain.

Searches though state and rule space are not exactly unprecendented,
albeit the scope has been very limited. This is a question of
hardware, and time effort. The code is simply enough to write.

Using cellular automata implemented in hardware for computation 
purposes have been suggested for more than a decade, by many 
people ('gene included). The concept keeps popping up frequent 
enough, but still not enough for the mainstream to perceive it.

This is a convenient fiction for people who like big government, but it
doesn't have much to do with reality.  No government ever asks its citizens
to agree to its rules - you are stuck with them whether you like it or not.
Leaving is also an illusory option - there is literally no place on Earth
where you can go to escape the rule of bog government.  Besides, you can
only leave if the government lets you - and the bigger it gets, the less
likely it is to let you go.

I would be the first to agree that a group of people setting up a new
society in ungoverned space should be able to create any social contract
they like.  However, here on Earth we are stuck with a system no one agreed
to, that no one is allowed to leave.  IMO, that puts important constraints
on the policies that we can endorse with a clear conscience.

I think good arguments can be made both for and against a meat diet, but
bringing "natural" into it isn't a wise idea. By the above rationale, it
would be immoral to live past one's "natural" life-span. After all, the
same evolutionary history that caused our digestive tracts to be the way
they are also saddled us with finite life spans. In fact, a common argument
against immortality is that "death is natural".

I don't know what your own views of the morality of life extension are, but
assume that like most people on this list, you are probably in favour of
it. If so, how do you reconcile your stance with its violation of natural law?

Their abstract reads: 

  We discuss the Carter's formula about the mankind evolution 
   probability following the derivation proposed by Barrow
  and Tipler. We stress the relation between the existence of 
  billions of galaxies and the evolution of at least one 
  intelligent life, whose living time is not trivial, all over 
  the Universe. We show that the existence probability and the 
  lifetime of a civilization depend not only on the evolutionary 
  critical steps, but also on the number of places where the 
  life can arise. In the light of these results, we propose a 
  stronger version of Anthropic Principle. 


I finally looked this paper over carefully, and I think they 
misinterpret their main result.  Their main result is equation 
15 on page 7, which they interpret as showing "that the 
expected living time of a civilization increases with the 
number of earth-like planets in the Universe."  They contrast 
this with the suprisingly short living time obtained in 
Carter's original calculation.  What Feoli & Rampone actually
calculate, however, is the expected *maximum* living time 
among all the planets.

Carter got his result by conditioning on a planet having
reached the civilization level sometime during the planet's 
fixed time window of t0.  Feoli & Rampone, in contrast, 
condition on at least one of N planets achieving civilization 
during its t0 window.  

Equation 9 gives the probability P'(t) (for t in [0,t0]) that 
at least one of the N planets will have reached civilization 
level by the time that planet is t old.  This can be thought
of as a CDF over the PDF describing the actual time when the
earliest planet reaches civilization level.   

Equation 10 differentiates this CDF, obtaining the PDF, and
takes the expectation of this PDF.  Equation 10 is then 
reworked to obtain equation 15, which is the main result.
Thus the main result is just the expected time duration after
civilization arrives on the *earliest* planet on which 
civilization arrives.  

This time obviously should increase as N increases.  However,
unless we have some reason for believing that we are the earliest
planet (relative to when our planet formed), this should give
us no comfort about the expected time our planet will remain
viable.  If there is a conflict between Carter's result and 
observations about our planet, Feoli & Rampone do not help us 
resolve it.

In the United States check out the tax laws that apply if you decide to
leave and change citizenship. In theory you can... in practice you are
subject to a set of tax laws where the governments gets to keep a lot of
your hard earned money.

Good points, Robin. And, if you don't mind, I'll take that as a cue for
this...

I recently completed a draft of a paper that I'm going to send to philosophy
journals. I want to get it off ASAP, but I'd appreciate feedback before doing
so. The topic is definitely of extropian interest (see abstract below). I
would
prefer offer to read from those list members who are familiar with the
style of
philosophy journal articles (or academic articles in any subject area).

Please let me know if you would like to see a copy of my draft.

Here's the abstract:

----------------------------------------------------
TESTING THE SPECIES CONCEPT:
Technology's Impact on the Evolutionary Classification of Humanity's
Descendents

Max More, Ph.D.
max@maxmore.com


Abstract
The species concept is central to modern evolutionary biology. Most biologists
and philosophers of biology have decisively settled on the particular concept
of a species as a protected gene pool. While borderline cases do arise in
applying the concept, mostly it has worked well for the biological world up
until now. This paper examines how well the biological species concept can
handle some possible future developments among Homo sapiens. These changes,
being driven by the interface of biology and technology, raise boundary
problems unprecedented in evolutionary history. I argue that the current
species concept can handle some of these possibilities, but runs into serious
difficulties in classifying the results of imaginable technological
modifications of the human species. The paper suggests a range of responses to
extend or supplement the protected gene pool species concept.

There is no scientific evidence that a meat diet is better for humans
than a vegetarian diet.  All medical evidence shows that we should eat
less meat rather than more meat.  If you want to look at historical
evolution, don't assume that cavemen caught and ate meat every day like
most humans do now.  A meat-eater's diet is not replicating a cave-man
diet.

Why are you trying to argue what is "natural" or "moral" anyway?  This
is the Extropians List.  Talk about increasing extropy.  I have no
interest in increasing natural law or morality.

Different vegetarians have different goals.  I am a vegetarian for
health reasons.  Statistical studies show that veggies live longer than
meat eaters.  This is the same reason that I don't smoke.  I have not
become concerned with animal rights at all.  I have heard all the
animal-rights arguments, but I choose vegetarianism for totally selfish
reasons.

In my case, I would avoid cloned meat even though it does not harm
animals.  If it still contained cholesterol and saturated fats that
contribute to heart disease, it would be the same as real meat for my
purpose.  I am looking for healthy food.

Before you get too upset, check out what criteria their software uses to
block web sites.  Most content blockers censor Sussex county because it
contains "sex".  It may be some random phrases on the page which is
triggering the software, and not an intentional decision at all.

If the discussion archives are visible from the Extropy web page, it
would get blocked because of all the talk about homosexuals, animal
torture, abortion discussions, smart "drugs" references, and all the
gun/crime discussions that keep referencing murder and rape.  It may not
be any statement from ExI at all that is triggering the censorship.

Yes I am. However, the abortion is a debate on the legal status of the fetus in
the current system. There is no current system in existence which allows for
citizenship for the unborn, based on location during conception. You must be
born somewhere to be given citizenship there. A person without a country in the
present day has no big thug to protect him from other big thug governments, and
has no rights except and unless the big thug picking on the nationless
individual is a signer of the UN Human Rights treaty. We are talking about
legalities here, not absolutes. As I said, I do beleive that abortion is killing
a being., but under the current legal systems everywhere it is not murder any
more than putting a dog to sleep can be murder.

This is horribly out of context, but here goes:

"Since there is no such entity as 'society,' since society is only a
number of individual men, this meant, in practice, that the rulers of
society were exempt from moral law;..."
          - Appendix: Man's Rights 
          Capitalism: The Unknown Undeal


Now that I've reread it I see that she's just giving her own
definition of society, but I knew I had seen something about no such
thing as society.

Oh well...

Morality is connected with actions (or their forbearance).  Not to act at all cannot be considered a zero point, however, in, say, the case of an excellent swimmer who just sits on the shore like a sodden log whilst clearly perceiving the gurgling plaints of a drowning child.  The reason that there is no zero point is that there are multifarious circumstances (not to mention many ethical systems) which can not agree on such a common reference.

this is interesting... any comments on the thought experiment below

If a space ship arrived at earth and the occupants were humanoid. Lets say
they were biologically humans, perhaps better. They all looked like Playboy
centerfold models and Chippendale dancers. Well, why not if they had
extropinan technology? Wouldn't you try a little self improvement if the
technology was easily available? Would these visitors have any human rights?
Or could they be placed into slavery under the current human rights law?

The reason is that for most people, writing an email is fun, but 
writing a paper is work. Since people here are not payed for their 
contributions, they mostly contribute in ways that are fun. If there 
were a lot of professors of transhumanism out there, I bet we would 
see plenty of papers.

But do write more papers, guys, please!

Aha!  That's it:  impose lower speed limits - it plays to the same interests
of fine collections and insurance, _and_ saves lives.  (I mean, of course, after
studies, etc.)   
The problem with that though is that it's _creative_, it's something _new_,
and the big organizations will not want to flip their arguments 180% degrees.
Besides needed thinking, this would demonstrate that their true motives are to
create a controlled environment which they can benefit from, rather than save
anybody's time.

As for the innocent people getting killed - I agree, that's an issue.
And we don't know the extent of it.  Why?  Because the statistical agencies
don't care about this, apparently.
I didn't mean to post a comprehensive analysis of the issues.
I don't have the data, the expertise, or the time.
All I meant to demonstrate that the few numbers published in the study 
support the opposite conclusion form what they are trying to make.

It's a general problem with economic calculations - they do not take into
account at all the ultimate benefits people want to receive from the economic
system, such as free time, knowledge of the world, freedom, and happiness.

So all economic indicators count the progress of the machine world.
Looks like the machines already rule the planet, and humans just serve them.

This is a common misunderstanding of economics, which does exactly,
precisely, what you claim it doesn't.  Many people, even otherwise
educated people, think that economics is only about industrial
production and employment and finance and such.  To disabuse you
of this error, I strongly recommend you read everything on David
Friedman's site: <http://www.best.com/%7Eddfr/>.

Economics is nothing more than the study of the consequences of
rational agents acting to achieve goals, whether those goals are
money, happiness, free time, or anything else.  (Economics can be
considered a subset of Game Theory in that regard).

I'm sure many plants will be happy to know that you'll now be producing your
own food from sunlight and soil, and not eating any more of them.

Oh, it's only bad to steal from producers who are intelligent.  Of course.

I'm sure many plants will be happy to know that you've taken up producing your
own food from scratch, and won't be eating any of them anymore.

Oh, it's only bad to steal from intelligent producers.  Of course.  How

I am in favour of making it illegal to kill animals, unless you have
their explicit consent. I am starting a petition to this effect. I am in
favour of closing down all fisheries, butcheries, etc., and setting up
animal hospitals, particularly under conditions of nanotechnology. I am
in favour of providing boosting to animals as far as can be achieved and
with as much consent as can be achieved under the conditions of the
period. Ultimately, I am also in favour of not killing plants without
their consent. The food chain is shattered with the Ecoburst, amongst
other events of the Escalation.

I once developed a cooperative game named CoLife that had color cells
for two players.  The evolution rule is the same as in Life; the rule
for color is: the cell born gets the dominant color of the parents 
(since there are always 3 parents, and 2 colors, there is always a
maximum).   In between the evolutionary steps, each of the two players
could add a piece of their own color to the field.  The [common] goal
of the game was to keep the populations balanced on the highest possible
level.  The game appeared a bit hard for humans, but post-humans will
probably enjoy things like that.
Also, in the same game, there was a third, disease color, that the cells
would turn after a certain number of generations of being stagnant.
The "stagnation disease" didn't have it's own moves, or strategy, but it
would infect all new cells born near even one diseased cell.

What I meant by mutations and noise:  Mutations would affect non-zero
cells, by killing them, or moving them a little, or temporarily changing,
for one point, reproduction rules. (Or maybe more, like turning some group
of cells a multiple of 90 degrees).  Noise would also affect empty space,
by randomly creating points on it.   There isn't much difference here,
I agree, but there is a slight difference in programming, and also noise
can bring life into existence from scratch.  Maybe, not all life forms?
One probably needs a high degree of initial noise to jump-start an open-
ended evolutionary process...


Santa Fe Alife server, for those interested, is at  http://alife.santafe.edu/

If anybody finds references to noisy cellular automata, please let me know.

Socialism, no.  That doesn't mean total market freedom is the only
alternative.

Until a few weeks ago I called myself a classical liberal, meaning my
positions were close to libertarian but my reasoning wasn't; the difference
between Hayek and Ayn Rand.  Now I call myself confused.  The difference was
reading Galbraith's _The Affluent Society_, which is modern liberalism (or
one variety) presented by an actual economist.  I will attempt to summarize.

Growth is good.  But as with most things, the more we've had of it, the less
urgent the next bit is.  Diminishing marginal returns.  Decent housing, good
food and clean water are more urgent than mansions and SUVs.

On practical grounds, almost no one likes unfettered competition applied to
themselves.  Humans are loss avoiders.  People can deal with great inequality
when they themselves aren't worried about the means of existence.  When the
market drops people out of the middle class they get agitated.  They become
less concerned about the rights to property they no longer have and more
concerned with the right to existence.  It's no good telling them they're
being inconsistent.

On practical grounds, shirking is less of a problem when dealing with people
who enjoy their work.  The incentives from welfare or unemployment insurance
and from progressive income taxes have less relevance for the teacher or
scientist who has already passed up a high paying job as a doctor or lawyer
than for a blue collar worker whose work is toil.  He calls "the New Class"
the increasing group of educated people who like their jobs, value job
satisfaction more than increasing their incomes past a certain point, and
expect both satisfaction and freedom from stress about their basic material
needs.  In general, they won't laze on welfare; they'd get bored.  In general,
they're not out to steal your yacht; the benefit isn't worth it.  And some of
them enjoy automating toil, freeing up workers who can be educated and brought
into the New Class.

So.  On practical grounds, private ownership and production are a success, and
vital to any society, and urgent for any poor one.  On practical grounds, a
wealthy society does not need to be growing at the fastest possible rate,
which is why its members will be buying insurance and engaged in other
members, not all market friendly, to protect their elemental affluence.  A
wealthy society can afford to sacrifice 1% of GDP growth and buy basic social
insurance for all of its members, and to ensure that all have access to basic
food and medicine, and above all to a good education.  This will make 
people happier; most feel more secure from want, and the rich don't have to
imprison themselves as they're doing right now in Brazil.  

He also points out that a moderately managed society might be more productive
than a laissez faire one, in that it would avoid the very severe productivity
loss caused by the deep recessions such as America had frequently in the 19th
century.  Lots of people unemployed equals lots of people not producing.

Eh.  This'll have to do for now.  It's a good book.

The old golden rule was fine, the only issue is a semantic one.  This "new"
rule loses its bang because it ignores the relationship between you and your
fellow man.  Arguably, this "projective" capacity is the foundation of the
rule to begin with.  The idea, as expressed by modern cog sci scholars, goes
something like this:  We developed the ability to hold a model of the world
around us in our heads to make decisions, and as a byproduct of this
"projective" ability, we learned to project, or model, our own experience of
humanity to other humans...i.e. creating a model of what its like to be us
and projecting it on them.

Forget multiculturalism, thats just a small example of the differences that
arise between our subjective, lonely, isolated minds.  Even people who share
a similar cultural heritage have differing wants and needs, so different in
fact, that we cannot begin to second guess their desires.  Descarte
understood this when he articulated the golden rule as he did...

Do unto others _just as_ you would have them do unto you.  The statement is
intended more to express the ideal relationship between individuals than to
dictate specific behaviors.  It can be processed on many levels.  i.e.  "I
will give you, Mr. Pacifist, a punch in the face because I would have you
punch me, Mr. Masochist, in the face."  but by that same token, "I will not
do to you, Mr. Pacifist, what you do not want me, Mr. Masochist, to do to
you, because I would not do to you, what I would not want you to do to me."

The golden rule should be seen to operate on this second, "higher level"...
Maybe somebody out there could better express what I'm trying to get at with
this.

My very rough estimate of the number of post-Escalation worlds (as
opposed to preborn worlds, i.e. ones where evolution has not yet become
fully self-directed) is one third of all worlds with life, i.e. quite a
lot, though finite in this universe.

PS Evolutionary charts regarding human population:
a: why do human population charts stop with arbitrary cultural
definitions of species beginnings? Though interbreeding may not be
possible, real population charts would include 3-d branches and total
numbers. Otherwise, rational comparisons are not possible. Also, note
existing population charts and growth match the Escalation aka
Singularity, Spike, and numbers for domestic animals and computers trail
after us.

b: have any Gaian theorists done any estimations for the total number of
living organisms that have existed on Earth including unicellular life
and viruses?

PPS
My personal name has changed again and though it should really be
written within a pentagram here it is:
Avatar Polymorph  Star-A-Star  Aleph Null  Z-Aeon  Neon Orthogenesis
Sub-Quantum Flux
Also known as:
Vessel and instrument of the clan of changeable form, every person can
be a star, to be the first is nothing, the inauguration of an age of
magic, the bright new glow of reorganized understanding, the mechanism
of change which is the messenger of the nodal goddesses and gods. (The
numbers of these divine beings are somewhat larger than that hinted at
by going through the figures regarding star systems in this universe, as
you might imagine.)

Sprintlink:  your customer, estop.net aka thephoenix.net aka
hoster.eroticaworld.net appear to be another group of Florida career
spammers.  They are spamvertizing webpages and have intentionally hidden
their identity to the best of their (limited) ability.  Please enforce your
AUP and terminate 208.17.14.0/24 / NETBLK-SPRINT-D0110E-1 / ESTOP2-DOM for
theft of electronic services and trespassing upon a chattel (see AOL v.
Cyberpromo or Compuserve v. Cyberpromo for court definition of spam
offences) BTW pls. note that the reply-to address would never get back to
the criminals.

In many of the non-profit projects that I get involved in, there
arise typical problems - coming, I guess, from some common features:

- difficulty to explain the project to many people, as it is
  usually highly technical, relatively obscure (can't show it
  to a large audience)

- lack of funds

- difficulty in managing a diverse group of people who may
  sympathize with the goals of the project, but are too busy
  to push it forward.

- probably a bunch of other common factors [?]

There are two basic approaches to this problem as I see it.

1.  Whine and complain that normal people are too stupid to
   understand great ideas, and smart people are too depressed
   and/or selfish and/or unreliable to implement them.

   This helps, to vent the frustration, for the first 30 seconds or so.

2. Realize that the world is imperfect (that's good, isn't it, what
   would we do in a perfect world?  Or in the world whose imperfections
   would be beyond our understanding?)  and do something about it.

I would like to suggest some ideas on this last one.

The crucial thing I think is visibility, from the very beginning.
You want to find people who would help you do the work, criticize
your approach, donate money, test the results, etc.

One way to do this is gaining high visibility on the Web.
A service that I have been happily using recently, is Clicktrade -
originally an idea of our fellow extropian, Scott Banister.
It allows you to _buy_ visitors for your website for as little as
1 penny.   An investment of $100 dollars, and a modest link (e.g.
"visionary socially responsible projects" will bring you 10,000
visitors that hopefully (and actually, in my experience with my
own site) will make this investment worthwhile.

We can also create a Frontier Projects web page.
This page would list a number of good projects, describing for each
the goal, the approach, contact info, and call for participation.

This could go beyond extropian projects.
Awhile ago, I stopped giving money to any "good causes", thinking
that it would be humiliating to decide that the best way I could
use my resources for social good is to pass these resources to
someone else.  So instead I can spend my resources on the projects
that I work on myself.  I am sure there are other people who feel
like this, and there are more people who would like to contribute
to a visionary project that can actually take the world forward than
toss their money down the seemingly bottomless pit of the traditional
attempts to alleviate problems of backward social structures.

So my first two suggestions are:

- Create the [Great/Extropian/Frontier] Projects website
- collect some seed money for advertising this Projects site, and
  also other visionary sites - Extropian and TH pages, Global Bank
  of Ideas, etc.

  Maybe, after applying visionary PR methods, we'll turn the most
visionary projects on the planet into the most popular ones?

I have more meta-project ideas, but first I think we should address
the above issues.

Or maybe you see other issues, and other solutions?

Meanwhile, is there anybody with some HTML skills and/or a few extra
dollars and a will to use them to promote worthy causes?

Controversy Alert.  You've been warned.  This warning will not be repeated.  :-)


People knowledgeable of the Singularity seem to be aligned within a quadrant of four extremes.  

1) In one corner, we have those who believe the singularity is inevitable and want it to come as soon as possible.

2) Those who believe the singularity is inevitable but want it to come as late as possible .

3) Those who believe the singularity is not inevitable but want it to come as soon as possible )

And,

4) Those who believe the singularity is not inevitable, and do not want it to come at all.

I am definitely not in 1 or 3. I'm probably somewhere between 2 and 4.  The Singularity may be inevitable, and I want it to come when *I* want it to come and not a moment sooner.

As extropians, we  live are lives within two penetrating and sometimes contradictory precepts.  On one hand we have a strong desire to create and shape the future our way by any means necessary, yet we see those strong desires tempered by a critical understanding of the laws of nature.  Obviously we'll continue to search for ways to break those laws, but in the meantime we're stuck with them.

When it comes to the Singularity, the jury is still  out as to whether it's a good, desired, or inevitable thing.

As an extropian, I want to shape my future around my desires.  Any force which attempts to curb my desires we'll be met with the strongest resistance possible.

To begin, I see the Singularity as a direct assault on my freedom and desires as I define them.  Does this mean I am a Luddite?  Hardly!   I embrace high technology in my life at every opportunity, but blind faith in High technology as savior is as irrational as any religious zeal.  Why should I embrace a technology that offers no obvious appeal or fills no needs or wants?  What does the Singularity offer me?  According to several Singulatarians, quite literally nothing - it considers 'me' irrelevant.  So why should I accept it or want it? If the Singulatarians are right, then the Singularity will sweep away everything we know in its rapid path to increasing complexity.  What if I happen to like what I have?  What if I don't want to be swept away?  What if I would rather spend a lot more time as an individual roaming around the cosmos as an *enhanced* being rather than an *assimilated* being of this higher collective called the Singularity?  Many may say I am resisting change, or perhaps the inevitable. Bullshit!  I am not resisting anything; I simple want to do something else for a while longer.  Besides, anything that forces me to do something against my will is not extropian anyway - its tyranny pure and simple.  You may say one can't fight evolutionary forces.  Again, I say bullshit!  As an extropian who values exceeding limits of every kind, why should I now accept the blind limits of evolution? I want to exceed those too!  I would much rather spend a few centuries in a place like Iain Banks' Culture, than become part of some blind singularity as soon as possible. 

Now, what if I were to start a movement to stop the singularity from occurring? I think I'll call this new political movement - the Anti-Singularity Party.  Some might say I I'm going down the path to curbing people's freedom - like freedom to build seed AI's. Yet, how is this any different from *them* creating a singularity and forcing me to be either be assimilated or weeded out through cybernetic natural selection?  I see no difference, and I challenge you to show me otherwise.  I say, fight tyranny with tyranny!  If I can do tyrannical things today to prevent the singularity from occurring tommorow, I can prevent future tyrannies from being committed. Tyrannies which Singulatarians admit will completely render all of our desires irrelevant.

So what if most living transhumanists do not want to be absorbed into the 'sublime plenum' that is this singularity?  I've heard Singulatarians say "too bad, you will be assimilated by the singularity anyway'.

So whose agenda is the greater tryanny again?!

P.S. Eliezer, we now find ourselves on the opposite sides of a new political spectrum - those of you for the Singularity, and those of usagainst it. The future is shapiong up to be very interesting. :-)

Mr Sandberg do you know if this has any implications in modern physics?
  Photons are supposed to decay after a very long time right? Also, is
  this phenomenon predicted by relativity?

*------------cut here/end--------------------------------------------*



CATALOGUE VERSION CHOICES:

1.  This version can be read by everyone, no matter what type of
     computer you use, or what type of software you use.  It is a simple
     format, with just our entire catalogue pasted into the body of a
     single email message, 316K in size.  If you use pine or elm on a unix
     system or an advanced software version such as Eudora Pro 3.0 or
     later, you will most likely receive it as a single email message.
     However, if your software limits incoming email messages to a
     certain size, say 32K or so, then your software will split it into
     multiple email message parts.   Whether you receive it as a single
     email message or multiple part email messages, you can easily
     paste it into one whole text document with your word processor, in
     about 10 minutes or so.
2.  For more advanced computer users:  attached plain ascii text file
     ~316K - you must know how to download an attached text file and
     then be able to locate it on your hard drive or system home
     directory;  it can then be opened with any pc or mac word processing
     software.  If in doubt, don't ask for this version.  This isn't for
     internet *newbies.* Better to order option 1 and spend a few minutes
     pasting them into one whole text document with your word processor,
     than to waste hours trying to figure how to deal with this option.
     This version is great for doing keyword searches and jumping around
     within the catalogue with your word processing software, if your
     normal email reading software doesn't allow this.


VERY IMPORTANT DIRECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT YOU GET A REPLY:

1.   you must call from an "unblocked number," ie. one that is not blocked
from caller id.  We are very sorry for this requirement, but our fax
software requires this before it allows an incoming fax call to connect.
If you have a blocked number, you must first unblock it.  In most cases
this means dialing *82 from a touch-tone phone (or 1182 from a rotary
phone) before you dial 1-718-227-9125.     NOTE:  If you are not sure if
your number is blocked, just try dialing our fax # normally.  If you don't
get a recording telling you your number is blocked, your number has been
transmitted and you may press the start button on your fax when you hear
the fax tone from our fax.

2.   no reply forms can be accepted by email....only via fax or smail.

3.   your form must be typewritten or printed out on your computer printer
before you fax it;  sorry, but *no* handwritten forms will be acknowledged.
If you can't find someone with a typewriter or a computer printer, we
apologize for not being able to reply to you.

4.   faxes with cover pages will be rejected.  You must send *only* the
reply form.

5.   forms not *completely* filled in will not be acknowledged.

6.   you will receive a reply within 1 business day directly from the
company making the offer via email.  Therefore you must have an email
address.  If you read this message, then you must have an email address, or
access to one, at least.   :-)

7.   your fax must not exceed 1 page in length.   Faxes of 2 or more pages
will be sensed, then auto-terminated and deleted.  Your fax goes directly
onto our 5.0 gigabyte hard drive and we must limit all incoming faxes to 1
page.

8.   all faxes must begin with:
*------------cut here/begin-------------------------------------------*
and must end with:
*------------cut here/end--------------------------------------------*

9. Any fax not conforming to this format will be sensed by our software,
then auto-terminated and deleted from the hard drive, before any human ever
gets to see it.

10. The type on your fax must be dark and legible.   If in doubt, please
print it out darker before faxing it in.  If we can't read it, we can't
reply to you or send you our FREE catalogue.     :-(

11.  If this all seems too complicated for faxing, just do it the old
fashioned way via smail!!!


WHO WE ARE:

Tempting Tear-Outs is an advertising company that brings potential new
customers to the companies they advertise for.

MORE ABOUT THE COMPANY MAKING THE FREE OFFER:

The company making the offer is a magazine subscription agency based in the
USA.  They have over 1,100 popular USA titles available to be shipped to
*any* country, including of course, to anywhere in the USA!    They offer a
FREE 1 yr. subscription to your choice of over 200 of the titles in their
catalogue to any new customer using them for the first time.       The
dollar value of the freebies, based on the subscription prices directly
from the publishers, ranges from $6.97 all the way up to $50.00!

For new customers in the USA, there is no charge for FPH (foreign postage &
handling), so the freebie is 100% free!   For new customers living
overseas, the only charge on the freebie would be for the FPH (foreign
postage & handling).

Their president has been in the magazine subscription business since 1973
and they are very customer-service oriented.   They will even help you with
address changes on your magazines, even if you move from one country to
another country.   They have thousands of happy customers in over 59
countries.

Their price guarantee is very simple:       they guarantee that their
subscription prices are the lowest available and they will BEAT any
legitimate, verifiable offer before you pay them or match it afterwards, by
refunding you the difference in price PLUS the cost of the postage stamp
you would use sending in the special offer to them, even 6 months after you
pay them, as long as it was current at the time of your offer.    Does that
sound fair?       Wouldn't it be great if everything you bought came with
that price guarantee?

Sometimes they are less than half of the next best deal out there,
sometimes just a little cheaper, but always you get the lowest rates
without having to shop around.     With 1,100+ titles on their list, they
would like to think that they have also the best selection around!

Within the USA, for their USA customers, they are cheaper than all their
competitors and even the publishers themselves.  This is their price
guarantee.         The 1 yr. freebie that you get with your first order is
completely free!

Overseas, (even after you factor in the cost of the FPH (foreign postage &
handling) and the conversion from USA Dollars to your currency), on the
average, they are generally around one-fourth to one-half of what the
newsstands overseas charge locally for USA magazines.  On some titles they
are as little as one-tenth of what the newsstands charge.  They are also
the cheapest subscription source for delivery overseas, including directly
from the publishers themselves!   Some publishers don't even offer
subscriptions overseas.........but overseas subscriptions are this
company's specialty!  They feel that magazines should not be a luxury
overseas.   In the USA, people buy magazines and then toss them after
reading them for just a few minutes or hours.  They are so cheap in the
USA!   Well, this company would like to make it the same way for their
overseas customers.  They are also cheaper than all their competitors in
the USA and overseas, including the publishers themselves!   It is also
*highly unlikely* you will find any of their USA competitors calling you
overseas, in order to offer that personal touch, just to sell you a couple
of magazines!  But that is what this company specializes in and loves
doing!     Around one-half their business comes from overseas, so they are
very patient with new customers who only speak limited English as a 2nd
language.    Subscription prices quoted for overseas consist of the
subscription price, plus the FPH.   You add the two together and that is
your total cost.   The exception is the 1 yr. freebie you get with your
first order.   On that title, you pay *only* the FPH for the 1 yr. term.

Their prices are so cheap because when you deal with them, you cut-out all
the middlemen.


HERE IS HOW YOU CAN GET MORE INFO AND GET STARTED WITH THEM:

Simply fax or smail back to us the reply form listed at the top of this
message.   We will then forward your form on to the subscription agency.
They will then email their "big and juicy" catalogue to you, in whichever
of the two formats you chose.   The catalogue is FREE and makes for hours
of fascinating reading, on its own. It includes the complete list of
freebies, a complete list of all the titles they sell, as well as detailed
descriptions on most of the titles, along with lists of titles by category
of interest and their terms of sale.

They will then give you a friendly, no-pressure, no obligation, 5-minute
call to go over how they work and to answer any questions that you might
have, as well as give you up-to-the minute price quotes on any titles you
might be considering.     They will call you in whatever country you live
in, taking the time difference into account.        As they like to

ANNOUNCING A NEW BOOK SERIES
Central Problems of Philosophy
Series Editor: Dr John Shand

To be published by ACUMEN
Dear Philosophy Colleagues,

I am looking to commission authors for a new major series of books 
CENTRAL PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY, of which I am the Series Editor, to be 
published by the new London based press ACUMEN PUBLISHING. I am an 
Associate Lecturer in Philosophy at the Open University in Manchester, 
England. This is the third set of books of which I am Series Editor.
The series is aimed primarily at upper-level 
undergraduate/postgraduate students and, therefore, expects a 
reasonable degree of familiarity with philosophical argument from its 
readership. The books will be around 160pp or 55,000 words, and will 
aim to convey to the student a clear and rigorous understanding of 
persistent philosophical problems. Although introductions, the books 
are opportunities for authors to make a striking and fresh 
contribution to the subject, in the way it is tackled and the 
conclusions reached.
I am therefore making an open request to professional philosophers who 
think they may be able and willing to make a contribution to the 
CENTRAL PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY series to contact me. Please send this 
email on to any other appropriate philosophy lists.
We are looking to commission authors for the following titles (those 
marked * have already been filled)
Analysis *
Modality
Paradox
Realism and Anti-Realism
Time and Space
Freewill
Causation and Explanation
Relativism
Action
Truth
Meaning
Self *
Mind and Body
Scepticism
Rights
Value
Ontology
Perception
Knowledge
Universals
Artificial Intelligence

I'm not sure why you would submit suggestions for new species
classifications to philosophy journals.  I realize that your expertise
is in philosophy, but if this is a serious suggestion for the extension
to the biological nomenclature, you need to send it for peer-review to
those who develop and confirm said nomenclature.  Unless the philosophy
journals you are considering are specifically intended to address the
philosophy of biological nomenclature, I would suggest that your
submission might be misdirected.

If it has not been reviewed by a biologist, and if you do not have
specific training in biological nomenclature, you could easily be
including very basic mistakes in your paper that would mar its serious
consideration.  Just as an example, are you aware that biologists curse
the term "homosexual" as being unscientific?  It uses the Latin root
instead of the Greek prefix as do the terms "asexual," "bisexual,"
"heterosexual," "polysexual," and the like.  Whoever invented this term
did not know the proper biological conventions.  If you are not trained
in biological nomenclature, you could be making similar mistakes.

As with any international standards, there are committees and
international agreements within the scientific community as to which
standards are acceptable and which are being developed.  If you publish
your suggestions outside the system, this could also mar its serious
reception.  Imagine if someone published a suggested change to
astronomical nomenclature on their own, or to mathematical notation on
their own.  It would not only be ignored, but would probably be directly
denounced by the standards bodies as being apocryphal and unapproved.
They may even pass a standard against its use.  The committee that
developed HTML was so angered by Netscape and Microsoft publishing "HTML
3 compliant" browsers before the standard approval and with unofficial
and conflicting extensions, that they skipped version 3 and proclaimed
that any product claiming "HTML 3" was fraudulent.

I don't mean to sound negative here, but I just wanted to warn you about
some of the pitfalls you might encounter in proposing scientific
nomenclature if you are not aware of the proper procedures to do this.

Approach #1 is a typical straw-man argument.  All joking aside, nobody
is really suggesting that this is the solution to anything.  This
straw-man approach implies that you are choosing among various options,
but in reality you are not.  You are presenting one and only one
solution.

Approach #2 has the opposite problem.  It is so perfectly vague that it
is the correct answer to any problem.  How could anybody disagree with
"do something about it"?  It is content-free.

This whole preamble to your suggestion does nothing to support your
case.  It is what I call "hype" and "content-free".  You should skip all
this verbiage and directly state what you are trying to say.

I don't really know, high energy physics is just an area I like to
watch but I can't say I'm knowledgeable in it. I think the Standard
Model says that protons decay with an extremely long half-life
(photons on the other hand are stable, I assume a typo). Relativity
doesn't really predict it. 

If this effect is true I doubt it will play a large role in current
astrodynamics, since extreme accelerations like those needed to
force-decay the protons likely only exist very near black holes. I'm
not sure if they could occur in neutron stars; it might actually be
interesting to calculate the consequences (my guess is that they are
still too weak to induce quicker decay).

Likely it is only of theoretical interest, but who knows?

> The old golden rule was fine, the only issue is a semantic one.

No, the old golden rule was a perfect excuse for projecting one's
morality onto others.

"I would want someone to intervene if I turned away from God and the
true faith, and I will treat my fellow man the same way."

"I would want to be punished if I committed a sin against God until I
repented and submitted to God's will, and I will treat my fellow man the
same way."

Such believers would never say "Give me the right to choose my own
religion, even if it's wrong," and so they would never grant that right
to others.

They would never say "Let me make up my own mind without following what
the priests tell me to do, or what the Bible tells me to do," and so
they would never grant that right to others.

Almost all religious intolerance historically performed by the Christian
Church has been done under the sanction of the old Golden Rule.

So what about us who don't believe in the inevitability of the

OK, I see your point and I partially agree with it. The problem isn't
the Singularity itself, it is the *concept* of it that is often
proposed here on the list. The Singularity idea that many people seem
to throw around is surprisingly defaitistic and collectivistic. 

Remember Vinge's original idea? That intelligence amplification
technology accelerates the rate of progress in the whole of society to
unimaginable levels. Note that this is just a historical development,
just like we can see that energy use have changed as technology and
economy developed. It is not a personal force, it is an abstract
process like the "industrial revolution". Vinge was aware of the
possibility that one or a few individuals could get ahead in this
process (cf. "True Names") but overall his view appears to be closer
to the "Swell" model of Singularity rather than the "Spike" model
(sorry Damien, but the term has this meaning in this context) where a
few take over. This is also a more likely outcome given the laws of
economics, what we understand of the development of technology and so
on. 

But where the Singularity idea gets unhealthy is when millennialist
memes (something BIG is going to happen in our lifetime!) combines
with technological determinism (this *will* occur) and transhumanism
(it is going to be called a Singularity and involve
nano/AI/uploads). The problem is that this promotes an uncritical
approach that tends to shrug off any counterarguments with that the
Singularity or the entities involved will be so smart that nothing we
can figure out now will be applicable and a tendency to turn a complex
*process* into an undivisible *thing*. Add to this the lack of
expertise in the "soft sciences" that often becomes apparent in our
discussions, and the whole mess becomes messier.

As you point out, this leads to that many important transhumanist and
extropian ideas gets thrown overboard in the rapture of the future. We
want to control our lives, we want to become more. For this we need a
clear view of possible futures, but we shouldn't just say that because
one possibility appears larger than others that it is inevitable; we
might actually change the future just by doing such analysises and
working against the trends leading towards them.

This is of course where you strays from what I would consider
extropian thought, or at least the fairly libertarian views expressed
in the principles. Initiating force to prevent others from initiating
force is a notoriously tricky subject. But there are better ways of
preventing the big bad singularity from borganizing you, like turning
into a personal mini-singularity a la a extrosattva able to resist big
singularities. Since you would certainly not be alone in trying to
achieve this, it might be possible to make big borganizations
uneconomical (again, this depends *a lot* on the scaling properties of
intelligence, something nobody of us yet has any clues about. This is
worth a good analysis). 

The realy tyrrany to defeat is the tyrrany of a meme gone bad, the big
'S' Singularity that seem to have become defined as some kind of
omnipotent borganism lurking beyond 2020. We need better analysises of
the future, not blinkered by "here be monsters" or wishful thinking.

Actually, there are several specialized philosophy journals, such as The
Philosophy of Biology, that have had quite a number of "species papers" for
the past 25 years. The big issue has been if species can be considered a
"class" or an "individual" concept.

Science has a metaphysics too! Philosophers and Scientists need to keep each
other in check sometimes.

Passport photo stores sometimes have such an ID, unfortunately these havebeed abused by
youngsters to get into bars with and may not be accepted
everywhere. Also check out Internatioal Driver's Licence.

This gave me a product idea- a shield or carrier for your driver's licence, made
of thin metal or plastic, that has cutouts for picture, DOB (or just year of birth),
official seal. Putting it on a chain (or adding other functions) may be an
option for some.

I'm not entirely sure of this, but begininning in 2001 or so all  US states will be
required (by extortion) to place your Social Security Number on your licence
or ID card, producing a defacto national ID card. I don't know where to
start in listing the abuses this will produce.

I just wanted to say that there seems to be a solution.
Judging by the still relatively slow (IMO) pace of proliferation of
extropian ideas and projects, this statement doesn't seem to be obvious.

I also am sitting in front of my PC with a strong fever, so I guess my 
semantics may look as blurred as my screen.  Sorry for that.

What I don't understand is why you chose to address only the part of my
message that you called "content-free".   I guess criticism of content-free
text is not content-free (or is it content-free of the next degree?), but
in any case it can't construct anything new and positive (and not being a
result of a mistake, probably raises the level of guilt more than the extra
semantic step raises the level of meaning).

Whatever.

Let's break out of this meta-meta-nonsense and return to the issue:

==========================================================================
I suggest creating a projects list, to use low-cost advertising to promote
these projects and other extropian pages, and also solicit other ideas on
how to gain visibility and support for things we would like to see grow.
==========================================================================

Would anybody like to do something meaningful and active about this, like
do HTML work, donate some money, or anything else?

If you have a small practical response, like
"Yeah, I think I could spare 10 bucks to buy 1000 visitors for [Site name]"
or
"HTML is so hard, but I'll try to help"

- please mail them to me personally; I'll post the summary on the list.

If you have another proposal or meaningful criticism, please post it to
the list.

Thanks,

Actually writing papers can be great fun! One can start with one's
best emails, and extend them. Don't be shy!

And lots of bad term papers, I expect :-)

Agreed! I'll promise to become a bit more productive.

An argument I've advocated (and put into practice) for the last half-million+accident-free
miles. I don't go quite as fast as I would like to though, as a
portion of my attention has to be diverted to scanning for cops. In selecting
a speed for the given conditions, I also trade off the expense of speeding
tickets against time saved. I've developed a 'courteous speeder' style of
driving, e.g. never passing at more than ~ 5mph.
You can also argue reducio ad absurdum- lowering the limit to zero will
'save' all the lives. I have never seen anyone do an analysis of this
phenomenon like the one above; why do you suppose that is? Might it
conflict with the kindergarten culture belief sysem?

Maybe. Sometimes I tell people I'm trying toget there quickly before I have an accident.

I think this is absolutly correct, but calls for a more formal study. I've alsodiscovered
that traffic court judges are completely oblivious to this
argument.

Well, maybe. Check out:(Hotwired)
People all over the world are turning to the Net for the latest info
about what's going down in Iraq - everyone, that is, but the people of
Iraq, who have no Internet systems or services whatsoever.

I've put out a few scattered bits and pieces on this topic over the past
few years. One defense is simply bulk: all the nukes in the world today
would barely make a dent in Mt. Everest (a relatively tiny structure), nor
are they of much effect against deep underground installations.
Because a nuke has minimum size limitations, it's ammenable to early
detection via 'Star Wars' (or 'Land Wars') sensing and response.
As for an all-out strike, consider this- radionucleotides are scarce relative
to Si, C, H, Pb, etc. Explosive construction can overwhelm.
Of course the best defense of all is vacuum- lots of it.

I don't agree at all. The efficacy of offensive and defensive measures
change place over time, historically. The current situation is temporary.
Even a simple strategy like change of address (e.g. Mars) will tip the
balance back.

But do they have the codes to exploit it? Dire TFlop'ses are cheap: Alpha
Beowulves, or DSP clusters are easy enough to build, but writing the

It would probably take a case in court, where somebody would refuse to reveal

The "Sugar Cube" That Remembers...



   Last issue we talked about how nanotechnology may, eventually,
   enable us to store "...a hundred billion billion bytes in a volume
   the size of a sugar cube"
   (http://www.digital.com/rcfoc/981221.htm#A_Hundred_Billion_Billion).
   But of course that's off in the far future. So how about a mere "100
   trillion bits of data in a cubic centimeter of space?"

   Brought to our attention by RCFoC reader Alan Maltzman from the Dec.
   15 Nikkei English News, it seems that Japan Science and Technology
   Corp. and Kyoto University's Hirao Active Glass Project is pursuing
   an optical storage device that will use femtosecond lasers (pulsing
   a thousand-trillion times each second) to store a hundred terabits
   of data in that tiny volume.

   They begin with today's optical storage technique of using a laser
   to burn pits in a surface. But they combine this with the laser's
   ability to alter the state of a rare earth element called
   "samarium," mixed into this glass storage medium, in a special way.
   Rather than burning a simple "on or off" pit, the samarium can be
   altered to only "burn out" certain "colors" from each spot, thereby
   allowing each spot to take on one of many different values (rather
   than only a 1 or 0).

   This is only "basic research" at this time. But it is a good
   reminder that it may not take the seemingly far-out technology
   breakthroughs of nanotechnology to make potentially vast differences
   in how we compute -- shorter-term innovation might allow us to store
   a year of Digital TV content in a glass sugar cube. Just don't drop
   it in your cup of coffee...

I think people would tell you that they "have to drive" to "survive".

I have offered some reductio ad absurdum suggestions before that are
clear of this "have to" issue, for example:

- building overpasses instead of all crossings and concrete walls around
  all streets should eliminate all accidents evolving pedestrians 
  (except that the pedestrians crazy from spending all their time on
   building the overpasses and climbing up and down, may start jumping
   off them, or smashing their heads at the walls)

- A great reduction in crime may be achieved by putting all non-productive
  members of the society in solitary confinement with maximal security.

- making everybody carry 100lb concrete umbrellas when outdoors, to protect
  them against possible meteorites, sudden huge hailings, and other falling
  objects.

(of course, one can prohibit everything that is not absolutely necessary,
 such as driving to movies or sports games, or any fun activities.  But then,
 people may find that the life itself is no longer really "important")
 

  The apparent truth here is that people want not to optimize their safety
at any cost, but to find a reasonable compromise between risk factors,
efforts, quality of life, lifespan, etc. This is not a specifically extropian
opinion, it's plain common sense.

Now, why there is so little publicity for these suggestions, and support for
balanced approach, while the risk aversion suggestions receive millions of
dollars for "research", and billions - for implementation?  How can we respond 
to that publication now, so that everybody could see it?  (Actually, it may
be possible to write an article for NYT or something - anybody interested to
work on it?)

The issue I think is that the distribution of ideas is propelled by power
interests more than by their truth value; this problem is apparently worst
with the centralized power, though a mechanism for distribution of critical
evaluations of non-coercive projects is also quite needed.

So they offer lop-sided arguments that sound convincing enough for the majority
of the population, who do not care to think of balanced social approaches or
philosophical foundations of the legal system.  And that's enough to justify
further funding for "protective" projects, further expansion of the state, etc.

Who would pay millions of dollars for the study showing what kinds of risks
people are willing to bear in their pursuit of quality of life, freedom, and
happiness?    Not the State, I think.

I would expect that some visionary journalistic efforts aimed at the Slow Zone
could make some difference here.   But they, apparently, don't, with all those
civil libertarians and journalists out there.  Or maybe, they couldn't find the 
right meme? 

An article on Concrete Umbrellas, anyone?

I actually strongly doubt that a well-chosen phrase can generally make much
difference, but since the illogical swamp of social ideas tends to swing 
between polar states, and social policies keep being followed until they
become not just theoretically ungrounded, but hugely ridiculous and wasteful,
exposing problems at these critical points early may help swing both opinions
and policies.  - Another task for the Institute of Memetic Engineering?

Yes, my cats are fixed. You cannot get a cat from the Humane Society
that has not been fixed. (This is done using an anesthetic, so the cat
does not suffer.) Yes, I suppose an animal "rights" person could argue
that you are denying cats the experience of sexual pleasure. However,
the consequences of not sterilizing some cats and letting them all "do
their thing" would be millions more strays running around leading
miserable lives, getting diseases, starving to death and being squashed
by cars. Just taking a purely utilitarian approach towards animal
welfare (forget "rights") argues strongly in favor of sterilization.
Also, I doubt very much whether sterilized cats really are in terrible
psychic agony over their condition, unlike humans.

I really have not come across a good argument for twisting cats necks
and throwing them against a wall. The question is whether this ought to
be legally prohibited or not.

I agree with the above, but it turns a positive and proactive statement into
a negative one...the following is what I actually use as a social template.


            "Do unto others they way they want, if not harmful to them or
others."

(self is in the set of "others")

This statement requires that I work hard to know myself to a significant
degree and in real time, and make myself care enough to have an active
knowledge of the other person and their wishes.

This has helped me immensely in being clear on how to treat my wife of 25
years. When I  treated her the way **I'd** want to be treated, it rarely
seemed to work. She wanted to be treated the way SHE wanted to be treated.
Too obvious...now, I focus on
her...not how I feel or what I'd want. And, the bonus is - I'm getting what
I want much more often. and I feel better about it at the same time. Works
for me...

Actually none of these three are established faculty.  For that, consider 
Moravec or Tipler.  I think the thing most limiting me from creating a class

Writing an essay is another way to elaborate on a topic, and a mode which
works well for those who do not want to write lengthy pieces, but do have
ideas which can be expressed in a crisp cogent manner.  (i.e., Susan Sontag
is an excellent essayist, and if anyone hasn't read her, please do, as you
will enjoy her uncanny intellect and depth.)

For those of us who are either in or have been teachers, educators or
professors, the essay is a wonderful way to present topics for giving a
talk at educational institutions.

Article in Chemical and Engineering News (distributed by The American 
Chemical Society) 
Issue January 11, 1999
"Much Ado About Nanotubes"
Collective peices of the article as posted by Gina "Nanogirl" Miller

The concept of a "space elevator"-a cable that would tether a 
geostationary satellite to earth and allow payloads to be raised to 
space without the use of rockets, was polarized two decades ago in two 
science-fiction novels written independently by Arthur C. Clarke and 
Charles Sheffield. In "The Fountains of Paradise," for example, Clarke 
envisioned the cable as a diamond-like fiber strong enough to support 
its more than 22,000-mile length.

In the past decade, a potential canidate material for this cable has 
emerged: carbon nanotubes. Indeed, at the Materials Research Society
(MRS) meeting in Boston early last month, chemist Daniel T. Colbert of 
Rice University, Houston, stated that nanotubes look like they may be 
stong enough to serve as an elevator in space. Colbert, who does 
research in the department of chemistry and the Center for Nanoscale 
Science & Technology, prefaced this remark by noting that a rope, or 
parallel bundle, of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT's) should be 
the strongest fiber ever made-perhaps the strongest that can ever be 
made.

+++++++++

At a special evening plenary sessions that attracted a overflow 
audience, Smalley marveled at the physical properties of single-walled 
"buckytubes", which are being intensively studied around the world. In 
addition to being the strongest known fibers, he noted, SWNT's also 
promise to rival copper in electrical conductivity and diamond in 
thermal conductivity. 

Smalley, who shared the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Robert F. 
Curl. Jr. and Harold W. Kroto for the discovery and characterization of 
buckministerfullerene (C 60), focused his talk, appropriately enough, on 
the big picture, discussing how buckytubes may help meet the challenges 
of the next century. At the outset, he urged his listeners, in seemingly 
contradictory fashion, to "think nano, think big." He was referring to 
the dream of constructing microscope objects with nanoscopic precision. 
Revolutionary new nanotechnology involving carbon based materials and 
devices will be crucial to meet the challenge of a burgeoning 
population, he said. This new technology will be necessary to make the 
lives of more than 6 billion people on Earth healthy and fulfilling.

+++++(There's a lot more interesting information in the article between 
here and the end, - to much for me to type- but it ends as:)
+++++

One strategy that Smalley and his co-workers are pursuing in their goal 
of economically producing bulk quantities of nanotubes is to his small, 
cut tubes as "seeds" from which to catalytically grow longer tubes. By 
selecting seeds with a specific diameter and helicity, for example, one 
presumably could grow nanotubes with the same structural features, and 
therefore the same properties. Another advantage of this approach, he 
said, is that the seeds could be oriented to produce aligned nanotube 
arrays. This might allow the tubes to be grown continuously to produce a 
1-cm-wide "buckycable."

Smalley and coworkers so far have made limited progress in developing 
this seed approach. But if they can solve the problems he believes it 
could become the basis of industrial process for making molecularly 
perfect SWNTs in multiton quanities. Nanotubes would then be cost 
efficient enough for use in large-scale applications, he predicted. 
Perhaps, one day, even for an elevator into space.

Anders-

Rather than re-post your thoughtful comments, I'll just respond by saying that you are refreshing as cool lemon aid on a hot dry day.  Thanks.  :-)

Your right about the tryanny of today to stop the tyranny of tommorow.  I was using it in jest; perhaps to stir up things a bit more than a rational excursion into libertarian principles - which I otherwise adhere too. I'm a rather mellow fellow myself, but my exposure to the 'S'ingularity so far leaves much to be desired. I'm over-prone to stay in lurk mode on lists I find appealing (like this one!) - but I had to speak my mind.  One last thing before I retire for the eveneing:

The Future is up for grabs people!  Nothing is written in Stone.  It would be very refreshing, to echo Anders sentiments, to see some rational, pro-active descriptives and strategies for evolving into somehting other than a borganism.

Happy Dreams.

Be careful about saying things like that, my ego may grow so much that
fusion processes start in the core :-)

It is a bit ironic that borganisms are so often suggested, since they
appear to be harder to implement than individuals. In very complex
individual the concept of self will likely be rather complex (in some
sense we are borganisms already, collective minds made up of
semi-independent brain systems), but connecting minds evolved to be
individual in an useful way is likely rather complex; it is likely
easier to extend them instead.

I agree that we need some different scenarios to look at. There were a
few scenarios mentioned in the technology thread a few weeks back
based on the relative arrival of AI, nanotech and hardware; while they
just ended up in the big Singularity discussion, I think the approach
is good. We could list the potential technologies and methods
available, figure out an approximative dependency tree (i.e. "If we
have reliable nanotech, massively parallel CA-style computers become
easy and cheap") and discuss the consequences. Most likely this can
get extremely complex, so we should either try to run it as a scenario
planning project or find some useful hypertext/critlink model to keep
track of all the links.

How does this do more than protect your investment in the shares?  That's
already at risk in the current system, since your equity can be wiped out if
the corporation does something really stupid.  Without limited liability,
ownership of corporate shares would expose my entire net worth.  Or am I
missing something?

I can't speak for most people, but I know it FEELS different to me to invest
in a general partnership, where I know I have unlimited personal liability . .

This is true, and I noted it in my initial post in this thread, but it's VERY
rare in terms of real public companies.  It is much more common in private,
closely-held corporations: In my practice, I check into the assets of the
principle stockholders of such companies as a standard procedure in the course
of litigation, since there's a real risk of such companies being plundered in
anticipation of an adverse judgment.

This is a good way to look at the mind: separate systems, some evolved
earlier (the "reptilian  mind"), some added later (the mammallian cortex).

Imagine reptilian minds looking forward with horror to a future where
they were taken over, suppressed, and dominated by a higher level
mammallian mind.  They might see this as an oppressive future in which
they would lose their reptilian individuality.  But actually, from
our perspective as integrated minds, we see that the added layers give
us more capability, more understanding, and a fuller experience.

Calls to "fight the future" have something of the same flavor.  Are we
so sure that our present minds have reached the peak of perfection that
we should see any extensions to them as threats?  What is the point of
going forward if we have to keep our minds static?

I see Extropian philosophy as adopting the "embrace and extend"
perspective towards mind enhancements.  Yes, it may leave us with
a new kind of mentality in which our current minds are just part of
a much larger and richer whole.  Some people view such a change as
being so major that the person they are today has effectivelly died.
But I think we have to accept that the future will bring major changes,
and that we should adapt to them and welcome the new opportunities.

I'm sorry you're not feeling well.  You have my wishes for a speedy
return to good health.  I merely was pointing out that your preamble was
unnecessary.  I did not have any quarrel with your actual proposal,
which is why I did not comment upon it.

Yes, the journals I'm considering specialize in philosophy of biology and
philosophy of science. Some of these journals include papers by people like
Ernst Mayr, one of the leading evolutionary biologists, along with
philosophers whose expertise lies in analyzing these concepts as used by
scientists. Mayr's own papers on the meaning of "species" are just as much
philosophy as they are biology

>If it has not been reviewed by a biologist, and if you do not have
>specific training in biological nomenclature

Philosophers who are writing papers in philosophy of science know that they
need to thoroughly understand the scientists vocabulary. I'm surprised that
you would think I would consider submitting a paper on species without
carefully researching the area.

I found the rest of your comments puzzling. Perhaps you are unfamiliar with
philosophy of science. I'm not proposing new nomenclature that scientists
should adopt through a standards committee. I'm doing what philosophers
frequently do and which is their job--to analyze the concepts used in other
disciplines. The whole purpose of journals in philosophy of science is to
bring together philosophers and scientists to analyze and critique existing
concepts and methods, and to examine underlying assumptions.

Yes,  Thats exactly it.  *I* love to change my mind all the time.  Continually seeing things from new and enhanced perspectives is the most rewarding thing one can do I think.  In that vein, I fully welcome any and all enhancements and extensions that will assist me in that endeavor.

However, that is a far cry from the rhetoric on this list in regards to the Singularity as it is often proposed and proselytized.  The more rabid Singulatarians seem to take pride in their Singularities delightful ability to render everything that we are irrelevant.  Rather than the a future where we are enhanced into more comprehensive minds, using your reptillian/mammalian metaphor, we are just as likely to be fully *erased* or *deleted* in the Singularities path to greateness.

Which brings me to my final point.  If the Singulatarians are right, that the Singularity could very easily wipe out any trace of you and I, then as extropians it is in our best interest to ensure such a future scenario does *not* take place.  Extropianism is about extending ourselves into a future that is more expansive and enjoyable.  This is in complete conflict with a Singularity that considers you a complete waste of CPU cycles.

  IAN: In the case of man, there's a good supply 
  of alternatives to the theory that rural people 
  are less criminal since they kill more animals. 

  On reason that people may become more violent 
  when crowded is simply because they want to push 
  others out of their way, and one way to do that 
  is push them out of life. Perhaps that response 
  is more of a "population control" instinct than
  the arising of a "repressed-hunting instinct."

  Of course, interesting to observe, carnivorism
  arises in some varieties of frog tadpole, where
  some of the tadpoles eat their noncarnivorous
  siblings! That might work with your theory.?

> [mice and men] are distinct species with different behaviors. 


  IAN: That mice and men appear to respond in 
  the same way (more violent when crowded) is 
  a good indicator of a useful analogy, which
  is why they cited the study showing that on 
  some program I've seen on "over population."

  In that mouse study, it seems plausible to  
  say that depravation of hunting was not a 
  causal factor in the observed increase in 
  aggression upon crowding, since noncrowded
  mice in the laboratory were not (I assume)
  hunting for food, but eating the very same 
  lab-rat chow that the crowded mice ate.

  IAN: Yes, and I agree. It could be possible 
  to maintain the theory that survival goes to 
  those beings that can most effectively and 
  casually kill other beings, such that 
  "socio-pathic" brutality and murder are 
  the keys to success in life, and I think 
  that grim view is only bolstered by humans. 

  I believe it's inherently true that those 
  with the most guns "win"; they rule the 
  nations and write the laws and history, 
  and thus "might makes right" = reality.

Great.  It sounds like you have positioned your paper most efficiently. 
I wasn't sure because you mentioned "Philosophy Journals" without
stating that they were specific to the philosophy of biology.  To me a
"Philosophy Journal" is not necessarily biology-specific.

I did not question your understanding of the vocabulary, nor did I imply
that you had not carefully researched your topic area.  I was pointing
out
the consequences of submitting your paper to different types of
journals,
since you had not specifically stated which types of "Philosophy
Journals" you were considering.

I did misunderstand this point.  I did indeed think that your paper was
proposing a new nomenclature for the classification of new transhuman
species.

Yes, my cats are fixed. You cannot get a cat from the Humane Society
that has not been fixed. (This is done using an anesthetic, so the cat
does not suffer.) Yes, I suppose an animal "rights" person could argue
that you are denying cats the experience of sexual pleasure. However,
the consequences of not sterilizing some cats and letting them all "do
their thing" would be millions more strays running around leading
miserable lives, getting diseases, starving to death and being squashed
by cars. Just taking a purely utilitarian approach towards animal
welfare (forget "rights") argues strongly in favor of sterilization.
Also, I doubt very much whether sterilized cats really are in terrible
psychic agony over their condition, unlike humans.

I really have not come across a good argument for twisting cats necks
and throwing them against a wall. The question is whether this ought to
be legally prohibited or not.

Mark D. Fulwiler

...

Since nanoyear is around 2020 and the genome mapping projects are
nearing completion, along with 10 year timeframes for at least one
memory enhancement therapy, the logical thing to do would depend on the
age of your cat. Cats in my experience have lived anything from 12 years
to 22 years, although around 14 is probably the common limit currently.
Therefore, yearly contraceptive implants in your cat would be the trick
ethically. In only a few years, and certainly under a decade, you can
start to boost your cat, and eventually seek its opinion more fully. The
main thing to concentrate on would be extra lifespan. After nanoyear you
can have your own private animal hospital service in your backyard
gunkpool and manufacture appropriate intra-cellular nanotechnology. If
your cat is older, however, you will probably have to spend a
substantial sum of money (while money is around) to give it a chance,
and if it is now two or three years from apparent death then
sterilization may be the humane option, although I would always allow
one litter for a female cat, since they seem to like having them in my
assessment.

As for killing any animal, this should be legally prohibited in my
opinion. Such a prohibition would be a prelude to the institution of
non-force (i.e. against non-consensual force), which applies across the
post-Escalation worlds. This is effected by protective screening from
more complex universal consciousness (i.e. the largest group mind
matrixes).

For the amusement of those who find the US tax system labyrinthine and
Wicked, here's something from Australia:

======================

Excerpt from The Sun-Herald - January 17, 1999

"The tax raising legislation, already through the House of Representatives
and now before the Senate, is engagingly called A New Tax System (Goods and
Services Tax) Bill 1998.

Section 165-55 sets out the bizarre powers of Tax Commissioner Michael
Carmody in deciding whether certain tax schemes are taxable income or not.

The bill states: 'For the purposes of making a declaration under this
sub-division, the commissioner may:

'(a) Treat a particular event that actually happened as not having
happened;
and

'(b) Treat a particular event that did not actually happen as having
happened; and

'(c) Treat a particular event that actually happened as:

(i) Having happened at a time different from the time it actually happened;
or

(ii) Having involved particular action by a particular entity (whether or
not the event actually involved any action by that entity.)' "

I'm in "favor" of the singularity as I understand it., because.
       a.  It's inevitable.

That's me.

As a mortal, I'd like to see humanity survive in any form at all. 
Getting the future to conform perfectly to my desires is ludicrous and
would probably result in eternal living hell, no matter how careful I was.

As a Singularitarian, I want a Singularity to happen, but I don't really
care when it happens as long as it's within the next ten thousand years
or so (a mere moment on a galactic time scale).  Of course, I could be
totally wrong about the lack of urgency; it could be that every single
second of delay is more terrible than all the pains of human history. 
But the moral scales (and my feeble understanding of How Causality
Actually Works) seem to me to tilt far more towards "maximize
probability" than "minimize time".

The question doesn't arise.
My two allegiances don't come into conflict.
It's Singularity or bust.

Okay, maybe nuclear war would just delay things by a century.  So then
we have the same option again - Abort, Retry, Singularity.  And again. 
And again.  Until either intelligent life wipes itself out or creates
its successor.

Okay, so maybe the Singularity will wipe out humanity for spare atoms. 
Maybe it won't.  I accept both possibilities.  If I knew "for certain
sure" it was option one, I'd still be a Singularitarian; but as has been
stated, I'm not sure, so the question of divided allegiance doesn't arise.

I race towards the Singularity because every delay in the Singularity
increases the chance that there will be no human Singularity, ever.  And
while I might weep over that for my own peculiar logical reasons, your
reason for weeping is that it means that you and everyone you know and
the entire human race will be extinct.

Screw dynamic optimism.  The future isn't a playground, it's a
minefield.  Okay, so it's a unique minefield in that blind panic will
get you killed even faster than blind enthusiasm, but blind is blind. 
The fact is that shiny new technologies always get used for military
purposes, and that technological advance decreases the amount of cash
needed to wipe out human life.  Forgive me, but I don't see any reason
for raving optimism.

> According to several Singulatarians, quite literally nothing - it considers 'me' irrelevant.

I don't know that, and if anyone else says they do, they're mistaken.  I
simply offer no guarantees and point out that no guarantees are necessary.

> So why should I accept it or want it? If the Singulatarians are right, then the Singularity will sweep away everything we know in its rapid path to increasing complexity.

Again, this is only a possibility.

> I would much rather spend a few centuries in a place like Iain Banks' Culture, than become part of some blind singularity as soon as possible.

Yes, I'd love to spend a few centuries in the Culture, especially the
new revised-history "You can Sublime off any time you get bored"
version.  But I don't see any GCUs in Earth's atmosphere, do you? 
Evidently this simply isn't an option.

Besides which, the Archive (my own invention; see _Singularity
Analysis_) beats the Culture any day of the week.

> Now, what if I were to start a movement to stop the singularity from occurring? I think I'll call this new political movement - the Anti-Singularity Party.  Some might say I I'm going down the path to curbing people's freedom - like freedom to build seed AI's.

I happen to think that nanotechnology could get us all killed.  Do you
see me proposing any laws to restrict Zyvex?  That trick never works. 
Not for me, not for you.  Restricting technology is always more
destructive than the technology itself.

> Yet, how is this any different from *them* creating a singularity and forcing me to be either be assimilated or weeded out through cybernetic natural selection?

Very simple.  We are not forcing you to do a damn thing.  We don't have
the right.  We are not superintelligent.  You are not superintelligent
either and have no more right than I to impose your views on your fellows.

A Culture Mind might be able to search through enough futures to safely
suppress a technology.  I can't.  The same applies to coercion.  I do
not refrain from coercion and suppression for any fundamental moral
reason, but because they ALWAYS end in disaster.

If you're really right about coercion being morally wrong, I'm sure that
our Future Friends will be able to figure it out as easily as you did.

> So what if most living transhumanists do not want to be absorbed into the 'sublime plenum' that is this singularity?  I've heard Singulatarians say "too bad, you will be assimilated by the singularity anyway'.

If that's how the cards are set up, yes.  If not, not.  It's not
something I think we can influence via initial conditions.

Look, the human brain is finite.  It's got a limited number of states. 
So you have to die, go into an eternal loop, or Transcend.  In the long
run... the really long run... mortality isn't an option.

So why not just go ahead and do it, leave the womb, for good or for
evil, while my grandparents are still alive and before the Earth gets
eaten by grey goo?

Wouldn't it be ironic if you delayed the seed AI, got smothered in goo,
and all along it turned out that the Singularity would have obligingly
provided an environment hedonistic beyond the most fevered imaginings of
the AhForgetIt Tendency?

Combine this with COSMO World's VRML Authoring (Free Download)

Now you've got your own high powered workstation!

I'm looking forward to seeing visualizations of microrobots, 
nanosystems and neural interfacing implants.  If you can code in 
Java, you can even write your own 3D animated mandalas, 
kaleidoscopes, and other hallucinatory visual mind trips.

http://www.cosmosoftware.com/products/player/developer/eai/

This link is too long to fit on one line, so it will need to be 
pasted back together.  It shows sample Java code for writing directly 
to the VRML External Authoring Interface (EAI) for real time scene 
updates and generation.  This is probably the easiest method for 
creating realtime 3D, although it still requires some concentration.

P.S. Any suggestions to http://define.com/brandX/ ?

Probably no Linux drivers for the video and surround audio, but NT

With some trepidation in his voice, Chris asks the great prophetic EvMick, "Who might those enemies be?".  Awaiting EvMick's answer, Chris anticipates the prophet EvMick's response.  Chris thinks to himself, "Is Evmick's enemies people, and if so, is he some kind of mad prophet, or is EvMick of the more high brow holy men, with his enemies being the more abstract concepts of entropy, death and stupidity?".

Unfortunately the same applies to month old babies.  Unless you count the

feotuses show that.

Are you arguing that it would be alright to kill one month old babies?

As they say on AOL.

LOL...which means Laughing out Loud.

I'm not a prophet.  (and I'm definitely NOT great)...but I've read a book or
two.

My enemies are government.  From reading I conclude that government will be
badly hurt .  


I get mad ocassionally.  Usually at something government does..or caused.

:-) As Duncan Frissell put it, "What we seek is not the overthrow of
the government but a situation in which it gets lost in the
shuffle". Although invoking singularities to get rid of bad government
is a bit like using x-ray lasers to sharpen pencils.

I don't have a problem with socialists who are willing to allow
socialism to happen voluntarily.  I think that's fine and dandy
(though it won't work), but I what I have a problem with, and what I
think is exclusive of extropianism is advocating the use of force
against a peaceful population.  That's what socialist governments do. 
If you advocate a socialist government then you advocate the use of
violence against peaceful people.

This sounds eerily like the course of events in "Atlas Shrugged."  If
this is indicative of Australian thought and politics, it won't be
long before they're reduced to the stone age.  Of course, I'm sure our
tax laws aren't any better...

I know.  I always got a kick out of the idea of building one that could
handle a full-scale exchange with '80's technology.  Still, it seems we
should be able to get something moderately effective in the next decade or
so, if we can ever get a president willing to let it happen.

I'd be willing to do HTML coding for it.  I can also do programming in VB
(using any combination of ASP, DAO, ADO, MTS, Access & SQL server that
happens to be convenient) and WebSpeed (using Progress 4GL & database), if
the need arises.

IMO, the picture isn't that simple.  Early nanotech won't be able to burrow
that well - remember, there is nothing preventing us from using 100 MT
warheads instead of the puny <200 KT devices currently in fashion.  Later
nanotech could do it, but by then you're facing multi-gigaton weapons.
Mature nanotech could protect you from anything reasonable, but by then I
would expect all threats to be pretty unreasonable.  For a good level of
security, you really need a good anti-missile system and enough room to use
it.

BTW - H should be on the 'nuke-building material' side of the ledger, not
the 'stuff to build walls with' side.

Since I coined the phrase, New Golden Rule, in an earlier post allow me
to comment.

"Do unto others as they would have you do unto them" does not, IMO, ignore
the relationship between you and your fellow human.  In fact, it explicitly
takes
your fellow human into consideration whereas the old rule seems more one-
sided.  I'm in general agreement with Harvey Newstrom who stated,
"No, the old golden rule was a perfect excuse for projecting one's morality
onto others."

Dave Kekich offered,

"Stay out of my life, and I'll stay out of your's."

There are too many exceptions to this one.  (e.g. If I'm on fire, I
definitely want
you to come into my life, hopefully with an extinguisher, and an invitation
is
NOT required.

David Gobel suggests:

"Do unto others the way they want, if not harmful to them or others."

There are obvious "holes" in this one too.  Harmful in whose opinion?
I don't want Jehovah's witness' bothering me, but they believe it is
harmful to me for them not to try to convert me.

I agree with you that this higher order meaning is satisfactory.  I don't
know
if this is a better expression or not, but I could restate it as . . .

    "I will give careful consideration to your desires and dispositions
before I
     interact with you, because I would want you to act in the same
respectful
     manner toward me."

The problem is that the common interpretation of the Old Golden Rule is not
on this meta level, but rather is frequently used to further one's own
agenda,
as Mr. Newstrom explained with several good examples. The average person
would have a more difficult time justifying selfish actions if the higer
order
interpretation were somehow made more explicit than it currently is.  The
statement above is also stated in a positive, proactive manner (as suggested
by Mr. Gobel).

The version offered in quotes above solves this problem.  It does not
obligate
you to do "anything" another may request of you, it obligates you to give
respectful consideration to their request.  Further, it obligates you to
consider
unspoken requests (e.g. please don't make jokes about to my weight).

Unfortunately, the quote offered above is hardly a snappy one and is not
likely
to catch on.  Then again, it's the snappy quotes that tend to be inflexible
and too
black_and_white.

I think a moderated web site would work well enough to be worthwhile.  I'd

IMO, an 'instant singularity' precipitated by the sudden appearance of an SI
is not very likely.  However, the factors that determine whether it will
happen are not under human control.  It depends on the answers to a number
of questions about natural law (like: How hard is it to increase human
intelligence?).  If the answers turn out to be the wrong ones, the first AI
to pass a certain minimal intelligence threshold rapidly becomes an SI.  If
they don't, we have nothing to fear.  The only thing we can do that makes
much difference is to make sure our seed AIs are sane, in case one of them
actually works.

I'm currently writing a more detailed analysis of the whole issue, in hopes
of outlining what all of the critical questions are.

Since nature is only concerned with the reproduction of the species, once a being
has lived past its reproductive age, it is no longer needed by nature, however,
nature does not need for humans to die immediately after reproducing (as is the
case with some species like some spiders and preying mantis'). Arguably the fact
that humans can live so long past their reproductive age indicates that humans
living after reproductive age impart positive evolutionary benefits upon others
reproducing, so living longer than nature is capable of (humans are, in fact, one
of the longest lived animals, thus indicating that we already push the limits of
what nature is capable of) may increase this benefit, provided that people are
able to be productive self sufficient individuals. Moreover, life extension also
includes the desire to be able to reproduce far longer than currently possible,
thus increasing our capacity to meet the goal of nature, to reproduce. Life
extension also gives us the ability to survive long space voyages to planets in
other star systems, thus fulfilling nature's other goal, expansion of the species
into other ecosystems and niches....

So you see, natural law can fit just fine into life extension.

Mike

> Morality is connected with actions (or their forbearance).  Not to act at all cannot be considered a zero point, however, in, say, the case of an excellent swimmer who just sits on the shore like a sodden log whilst clearly perceiving the gurgling plaints of a drowning child.  The reason that there is no zero point is that there are multifarious circumstances (not to mention many ethical systems) which can not agree on such a common reference.

This is what I dispute. While most, or all ethical systems do not agree on everything, there are plenty of commonalities among most of them, especially the most successful of them, to imply that there is an inherent objective truth to the shared heuristics, at least as far as the human species is concerned. There may also be a subset of this set which may be objective truth for all thinking beings. In your example above, I can imagine no possible
moral justification for an olympic swimmer saving a drowning child, if no other factors ar involved. That is not to say that there may not be one, but it not very likely to be one that is part of a successful ethical system of any sort. The closest to this that I can imagine is that the swimmer might want to get paid first (much like how Crassus made his fortune in ancient Rome as the owner of a fire company, he brought his pump and crew to the
scene of a fire, and wouldn't even set his pump up until the owner of the building had paid him the negotiated price. Eventually he wound up owning most of Rome. This is where the term 'Crass commercialism' came from.).

One should note that this is only true over short time scales.  A generation
that grows up with affluence level X will consider it the minimum they can
live on, and try to achieve something substantially better.  Also, a large
fraction of society is not satisfied with anything less than the mansion -
there is a wide diversity of opinion over when enough is enough.

This description may fit teachers and scientists.  It does not fit knowledge
workers at all.  Most of us don't stop worrying about money until we can
afford lots of our favorite techno-toys, which means upper-middle class at
least.

Also, it is a mistake to think that the workers can all become part of this
class.  Most people don't especially enjoy anything you could reasonably
expect to be paid for - they want to go fishing, hunt deer, watch the game,
party, read a book, attend a play, etc.  If they can support these
activities without having to work, most of them will.

Isn't Brazil a good argument for rapid growth?  Their problem isn't large
income disparities, its that there are too many people who can't afford
food.

In more general terms, this analysis ignores the fact that the benefits of
growth do not end when you have a warm bed and a full belly.  Wealth can be
spent to buy health, and the more wealthy you are the more health you can
get.  No nation on Earth is wealthy enough to provide top-notch medical care
to everyone, and the best way to solve this problem is to grow as fast as
possible.  Growth won't remove the inequality, but it will make everyone
better off than they were.

Also, the 1% idea is completely divorced from reality.  Most people don't
want to work, for the very simple reason that they have other things they
would rather do.  If you make it possible for them to do the things they
really want to do without having to work, many of them won't.  You end up
having to support a significant fraction of the population, which costs much
more than 1% (try 20% for starters, and it will grow with time).  All of
this is just for the basic living standard - throw in medical care and the
potential cost instantly becomes larger than your GDP.

To make these ideas work, you need a world in which all basic human needs
can be met without significant human labor - and if we could do that, we
wouldn't need welfare programs in the first place.  We may see such a world
after nanotech and advanced AI arrive, but we aren't there yet.

Why should we expect future economists to be any better at it than those of
the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries?  There has never been a time when
government simply left the market alone.  The governments of the 19th and
20th centuries have tried every scheme they could think of to prevent
recessions and boost economic growth.  At this point it is clear that such
approaches don't work.  We don't know nearly enough about economies to be
able to fine-tune their operation by government fiat.

America tried 'moderately managed' society in the 19th century, and 'heavily
regulated' society in the 20th.  Other countries have experimented with
'totally regulated' society in various guises.  I can think of no instance
in which anyone has actually tried laissez faire - usually they just make
speeches about it while enacting more regulations.

Over the holidays this year I discovered that the Exi List has gone through
a messaging explosion. Instead of the usual 40 - 60 messages per day, it's
now running more like 100 per day. Each time I log on and read my email,
there are more messages in the In Box, and I haven't been able to clear my
In Box for over a month now.

A year or so ago this happened to another list I was on. A nice,
informative list about the plant Salvia Divinorum suddenly inflated from 20
messages per day to 120 messages per day. Too much! No content! Too
difficult to find interesting messages! Doom!

And, sad to say, despite the heroic efforts to create sub lists, exi -
select lists, etc, the basic Exi list is too much for my pore ole DEL
finger to handle anymore. 

Sure, I know about filters, etc etc. My range of interests makes it
difficult to make filters. Why? First of all, I can't do it by name because
someone may be great at Quantum Mechanics and hopeless at Economics. I like
QM, hate Econ, so by name is useless. Second, doing it by thread is also
not too great for threads wander, usually into oblivion but now and then
into wonders. So filtering doesn't serve me well.

As for lists like Exi-Select (which I am not leaving), I just haven't seen
much traffic.

I think I could handle this idea: (I write this in trepidation that someone
has already done this, and I've been just too lazy/busy to go read it off
the Extropy site...)

Create 4 or 5 MODERATED lists limited to specific topics. Here are some
topics to consider:

	Science
	Uploading
	Machine Intelligence
	Economics
	Governmental Design (ie Libertarian rants, etc)
	Titbits (misc of genuine interest)

The moderators scan the general Exi list for things of interest and
sometimes post to these lists. It is understood that anyone posting to the
general list may find their messages crossposted to these lists now and then. 

===============================================

Okay. I'm not going to wait around and wade through 500 more messages for
responses to this post. All of you are invited to send your remarks to me
privately. If any of you are so moved, feel free to send stuff from the Exi
List which you think I may find interesting. I will reply to all such
messages. If I do something of interest to the Exi community I will ask
someone to post my announcements to this list.

PS. As moderator for the Truth Machine list, please send any and all
messages on this topic to me privately. Thanks.

A long time ago (I has my winter vacation and am now drowning in nearly 
2000 mails), Mike Lorrey wrote:

A government has no "interest" in redistributing your money. A government 
is not some evil villain trying to rob you. It is an institution based on 
the common will of those assembled under it's power, intended to promote 
such social and political goals as "justice", "peace" and to balance the 
forces of the socalled "free market". A government is someone elected by 
you to provide you with certain services you select to vote for. This is 
why you have to pay taxes, cause the government won't be able to provide 
this for nothing.

In an ideal world such as defined by Adam Smith in "The Wealth of Nations", 
a free market would be a place where all people have approxiamtely the same 
power, and there do exist neither monopolies (discriminating or ordinary) 
nor competitors, which have an overwhelming market share in one special 
commodity. In this world the "invisible hand" would promote the best for 
all by everyone pursuing his own private goal, the market equilibrum will 
always be achieved. But because we do not live in an ideal world, believing 
in this means believing in fairy tales. Modern economics have proven that 
this is mere illusion, a theoretical state which cannot be achieved. It is 
a "perfect" state which cannot be acieved as you cannot achieve "perfect" 
conditions in a physics experiment because you cannot turn off friction or 
gravity. In the same way you cannot turn off predominant market positions 
like perhaps that of Microsoft. You can only achive the market equilibrum 
by having some superior force counter such destabilizing effects.

If you think that in an ideal state we'll somehow all become "ideal" humans 
means commiting the same faults as Marx when he thought of man as a social 
being before invention of "Capitalism", living in an Eden where everyone 
did as he pleased and "property" did not exist. Altough I hope that 
sometimes we'll be able to transcend our physical and psychical limits and 
become Transhumans, I doubt that even then we'll eliminate this problem.
Maybe it will be the other way round: A market exists only if commodities 
are scarce. If they are available in any amount, they'd have no value, thus 
eliminating the need for a market or an economy. We can only eliminate 
greed if we get to the point where everyone has so much of everything he 
wants that these commodites do no longer function as symbols of power and 
wealth. Perhaps then, people will recognize that the only factor which 
truly shows the difference between men is intellect, not wealth.
On the other hand ... history shows us that evolution was promoted mostly 
by external effects. Maybe we'll all become decadent and lethargic if we'll 
achieve the post-economical society?

> I agree that a police force, or its equivalent on a free market, is
> necessary.

Police force is necessarry, as you will never be able to distinguish 
between a bad guy and a goog guy carrying a gun. If you carry a gun and 
someone points one at you, he'll probably be a bad guy, but then again he 
won't wait till you've drawn your gun and shoot him. He'll probably blast 
your head of with a grin. So all that you said does not advocate any 
advantage of carrying guns, open or concealed. If instead, carrying of 
wepons is prohibited, anyone carrying one is a bad guy, and the police 
could arrst him without having to wait till he actually uses it.

There can be no equivalent for this on the market. Security should not be 
considered a commodity. It should be available to everyone regardless of 
his or her income, socail standing or other differences. Thus it is no 
commodity. Instead of spending billions of dollars for corporate and 
private security services, it would perhaps be more effective to use this 
money for the improvement of police service. If the police force is not 
effective because of lack of personnel, infrastructure or equipment, then 
this deficit can be compensated by using additional credit for improving 
the police force. This leads to better overall security, benefitting not 
only those capable of "buying" it but everyone.

Security is one of the basic ideas behind the idea of a democratic state. 
Libertarian might include a lot, but if you don't want the state to take 
money from you to finance it's organization, you don't want public police, 
well, then you'll probably won't want a state, preferring Anarchy instead?

Still, I cannot understand why U.S. citizens still need to carry guns. Is 
it this cowboy feeling?

A concealed firearm is not an implied threat because no one knows you have 
it. If criminals know you carry a weapon, they'll see to it that you won't 
use it. You don't draw a gun if someone points one at your nose. This gives 
you a near-nil protection from anyone. If someone wants to pickpocket you, 
you won't draw a gun and kill him right away.On the other hand, if you live 
in Texas, maybe you will, but I consider this excessive force. In Germany, 
you'd be in jail for this very quickly. So, the least problems arise when 
no one carries a gun, as you stated in the last few sentences. It is always 
a matter of trust. I am not impressed by anyone pointing a gun at my head 
if I do not trust him to be willing to pull the trigger. If he's a wimp, he 
won't. If the victim is a wimp, the victim would not use a gun if he had 
one, even in self-defense. This happens quite often, as some nerds do 
actually think they would only have to show the gun to have all people act 
frightened. Some of them would not shoot, hoping that the weapon alone 
intimidates their opponents. So, if you go ahead and carry a gun, be 
prepared for others carrying a gun. And the bad boys will use their guns. 
So you'd better let your gun at home if you do not intend to kill if 
threatened.
By the way, do guns protect from being shot in the back?

It is even more simple. I will not travel into an area which is not secure. 
If some area is not secure, I will ask my government to resolve this 
problem, normally, by calling for police force. Going into insecure areas 
means danger, possible loss of property, health or life.

This is okay for the past case of two rational enemies. But what if some 
lunatic like Hussein or Gaddafi gets his hands on Nukes and the capability 
to throw them anywhere on this planet (read: ICBM)?
It will never be over as long as it is just an unspecific implied threat. 
The greater problem with nukes is that no rational man will ever use it, 
cause it's effects backlash very soon. In the hands of terrorists or 
fanatics, they become real dangers, as well as any other holocaustic 
weapon. What if I were a terrorist seeking to blackmail the US government? 
I would purchase 10g of pure Plutonium. Less than enough to build a bomb. 
But why should I? Pouring 1g of it into the water of any large US city 
would cause mass death of thousands of people. What effect would the US 
nuclear, chemical and biological strike force have ... nil. So why should 
anyone need any of these weapons.
The real cause the Cold War never became hot was the insight of both 
parties that a war would not have any winners. A modern war cannot be won 
because no city can be conquered. You'd have to destroy it completely to 
really conquer it, and then, well, you won't have any use for it.
The second cause is: The NATO would never have attacked. Why should they? 
Their people would never have approved such a war. The Warsaw Pact needed 
the threat from the NATO to uphold it's dictatorships. Without an enemy, 
they'd have no one left to blame for their own faults.

With such matters you'll always walk thin ice. I read of aconcept not so 
far away: If a ship is sinking, and you're on the only boat that survives, 
and you'll have one hunderd hands stretching out to be rescued with only 
the ability to save ten, would you allow them to drown your boat by tearing 
them onboard or would you rather chop of their hands with an axe? This 
draws off into a discussion about ethics, which, in return, is nothing 
rational. Like Sun Tzu said: The best way to win a conflict is to avoid it. 
If the enemy is rational, he will back down faced with overwhelming odds. 
If he's not rational, he would not even back down if attacked. He'd see to 
it that your losses are as big as possible, even if he kills his own 
population. Luckily we will soon have means to avert such wars by 
"non-lethal weapons", which destroy the (military) infrastructure without 
harming the population. EMP to destroy enemy communications, bombing to 
destroy factories, bridges, streets, railways, ports and airfields. You 
can't conduct war without this. The Second World War was won because of 
this. Terror bombing of civilans only increased the hatred and thus 
prolonged the war.

> Its all a matter of semantics. Try this:
Indeed, it is ... so, try THIS:

"I oppose the initiation of force for the promotion of social, _personal_ 
or political
goals."

Well, the use of force should be avoided whenever possible. To my oppinion 
the carrying of weapons always implies a threat to others. I cannot see the 
advantage of carrying a gun "only in self defense", because a weapon always 
works the both ways. If you have the possibility to use force, you'll be 
willing to use it whenever you might feel threatened. This might be 
objective, but it is very probable that you'll judge on a very subjective 
basis, your own perception. If humans where truly rational beings, I would 
judge this different, but in most cases weapons are used senseless and 
irrational. Not to mention all those killed by accidents in wepaons usage. 
Some kids would not have shot othersart school if they had no weapons. The 
problem with any technological advance is that some creative weirdo will 
always see to it that it is used in the worst way possible. this is not an 
argument against technology. It is simply the truth. Man is his own 
greatest enemy. In this, evolution has separated us from the animals.

First they would need to convice people that:
a) they were intelligent
b) they posed no threat to Earth
c) they either sought asylum as refugees, or
d) they sought to establish diplomatic relations between Earth and somewhere else.
Just as one nation recognises people that are citizens of other nations as
'temporary honorary citizens' for legal purposes (with the minor aberration of
those with diplomatic immunity, which has another legal purpose), we would
obviously want to recognise them as 'honorary human beings' merely for the
convenience of being accorded a reciprocating 'honorary alien
chippendale/centerfold' when and if we visit their home planet.

This brings in a convention that Orson Scott Card uses in his Ender's Game trilogy
(Ender's Game, Xenocide, Speaker for the Dead). My memory is sketchy here, so
others are invited to correct me on the exact terms and definitions:

human: another being of the same species

varelse: a being of another species which is understandable, that can be
communicated with, and can be conferred honorary 'human' status.

ramen: a being of a species that is alien to humans, which is not understandable or
able to carry on rational sustained communication with humanity, and may be seen as
a threat to humanity.

Now, up until this century, humans tended to look at others as human only when they
belonged to the same race AND ethnic group, while members of other ethnic groups
but of the same race were varelse, and those of other races were either varelse or
ramen as the situation demanded (which is why it was so easy for such people to
keep slaves, as they were obviously not 'human', as far as could be seen then.)

Today, more people beleive they can see some animal species as varelse, and even a
few as 'human', and many vegans and animal rightists insist that all animals are
varelse. My own opinion on this effect is that it is a phenomenon similar to
isolated individuals talking to their teddy bears. We, as far as we know, are the
only intelligent species in existence. We can theorize on the existence of other
species on other worlds, but we have no evidence as of yet. Despite this, we have
reached a point in our development where we are subconciously crying out for
interaction with other intelligent species, and because we cannot find any, we are
left talking to our teddy's.

Depends. If none of the planes can take off, then there will be no risk to those

In fact, recent studies have shown that the Russian nuclear capability, numbers of
warheads, has dropped below the limits of the proposed Start II treaty, which are
half the levels of the (still unratified by the Russian State Duma) START I treaty.
While we aren't anywhere near in as sad a shape, we still haven't complied with
START I because the Russians refuse to ratify it, even though we have ratified it on
our part. Iraq and North Korea are the only ones whe seem stupid enough to actually
want to use nuclear weapons, while the India/Pakistan exchange of tests was merely
bringing into the open capabilities which have, in fact, existed since the 1970's
(when India did, in fact, test one device) to no adverse actions. I think that if
nations like Pakistan are smart enough not to use nukes in real life, and other
countries like South Africa are smart enough to actually disband their programs and
give up nuclear capability, it says something significant in opposition to the
position above.

The only study I am aware of is one involving 7th day
adventists(sp?). I could be a bit of a wag (sorry, I was watching
Noel Coward on Great Performances yesterday) and say this only
proves being a 7th day adventist is good for your health. Are you
aware of any other study?

Dr Bruce Ames has pointed out that a large portion of any fruit or
vegetable are chemical weapons it uses against other plants and
animals. There is a good co-evolutionary argument that we are
better able to deal with these, but it is a point worth
considering. As an Extropian, I do not suscribe to the Judeo-
christian notion that what is here was provided for us.

I am not the typical omnivore studied in this study either. I eat
a smaller quantity, and much higher quality of meat than does the
average american. I also take a state of the art regimen of
vitamins/anti-oxidents and exercise.

I think cloned or vat grown meat could be produced without the
dangerous compounds, and in fact, be produced with helpfull
compounds grown in. There would certainly be no need to kill
animals once this was possible.

This puts us in the realm of "Medical Diets/food" as suggested in
Bruce Sterlings transhumanist novel "Holy Fire."

  IAN: What surprises me is how the entire media
  Establishment and thus the majority of people,
  believe exactly that which is necessary for 
  "the true nature of government" to run wild!

  I believe that the majority are "order-taking 
  believers," that is, they believe what they 
  were told and entrained to believe from youth. 
  Public education has entrained belief subordination
  to that to which we pledge allegiance.. the State.
  Thus the emissaries of the State direct belief.

  If dozens of witnesses saw a rocket kill FL800,
  but unknown persons at the CIA produce a video
  that claims noseless planes can maintain stable
  flight and even fly upwards at twice the normal 
  speed (void the laws of physics), that must be 
  true, since the witnesses are not leaders.

  Every person is drilled from first grade to university
  to believe what their teachers/elders/leaders tell them.
  The people in the TV represent the leaders, and what 
  they tell people to believe, most will believe.

  As I researched libertarianism, my counter arguments
  against the libertarian literature that I was reading 
  came directly from what I was told to believe in my 
  Social Studies class in public high school. I've 
  isolated the core source of my once-socialist
  mind set: the public (socialist) school system.

  In social studies class I was told that unionism, 
  federal regulation and control were the saviours of 
  humanity from the ravages of capitalist exploitation. 
  It was virtually Marxism 101, but more like Marx-lite, 
  instead of going for policies that would induce famine 
  almost over night, it's the slow/static poverty track.

  As to per the question about whether the revelations
  of secret military-weather control Ops are a surprise.
  What is, (at least has been to me over several years) is 
  that the media seems to operate as a subsidiary function 
  of the federal govt. Observe the one and only blurb the 
  multiple events of "cobweb" (cloud seed) dropping air-
  craft got in the media (USA Today, 8/11/98, page 9A):

	"UFO CLEANING: Maybe the little green men were 
	just doing a spot of cleaning but residents of 
	a small Australian community swear they saw 
	cobwebs fall from the sky after UFOs passed 
	overhead. Dozens of residents of Quirindi 
	called Australia's Antional UFO hot line 
	after the incident."

  Gee, so since they could not identify the aircraft 
  dumping cobweb-like (cloud seeding) debris on them,
  they were UFOs and we can laugh off the whole case.
  I'd say that reason stipulates that between aliens
  and the mass-hallucination it seems to be written
  off as, there is the most probable scenario: that 
  they were military aircraft dropping the very same
  cloud seed that is being reported around the world,
  which is supported by this statement from the USAF:

     "In the US, weather modification will likely 
     become a part of national security policy with 
     both domestic and international applications."

  Which indicates that secret-cloud-seeding will be world-wide.

Possibly there are many similarities with behavior in lion prides, wolf packs,
dolphin pods, etc. The chimps are also great homicidal maniacs.

However, men are nowhere near as cannibalistic as mice and rats are. This in and

I'm not denying that there is a density effect. However, US cities have far lower
population densities than many other cities, in both Japan, China, Germany,
France, and England, yet have higher crime rates. If it were merely crowding, I'd
expect violent crime to be far higher in the denser cities. Granted we have more
guns available (even though they are banned in the cities with the highest crime
rates!), but the incidence of mental illness as well is not noticably higher in
denser cities, which has nothing to do with guns. I think that no human cities are
anywhere near the crowding levels necessary for the rat/mouse effect in the study
to be as pronounced.

I've never said that might doesn't make right, just that it is a derivation and
member of the overall set of natural law. Because of this, might makes right,
rightly, only in support of the rights in the rest of natural law. Subjectivists
deny the existence of natural law because they want to write and control ALL
rights themselves.

Is this historical, or are you just pulling our legs? I'm an aficionado of
Roman history, but I haven't encountered this story about Crassus before.
He doesn't seem to have been a businessman of any sort.

I'll have to read it. With regards to 19th century America, most of the economic
vacillations were not due to natural economic phenomena, but because of a) the
vacillations in the amount of fiat and private money being printed/stamped which
did not reflect accurate changes in the actual dynamic needs of the money supply
(thus rapid inflation/deflation and changes in interest causing boom/bust feedback
cycles), and b) changes in the policy of the feds toward a money standard. Gold,
silver and wheat all were used or proposed at various points,  the standard
evaluation rate changed frequently, and the massive influx of gold into our
previously mostly agrarian economy in the mid 19th century fron the California
gold rush caused a hellacious amount of inflation much like what occured with the
Spanish Empire during the conquistador era. This great boom caused a significant
resonance effect that was amplified and maintained by the money policies described
in (a) above. Other factors include trade/tariff policy changes in our own and
other governments, and immigration rates.

The cyclic effects we have seen this century are also resonance effects aided by
the tax laws. Because corporate managers are focused on the quarterly or annual
profits, not usually in the long term growth of the company, such short
sightedness feeds the excesses of the 'business cycle', while the fed tries to
dampen them out. If corporate managers' own performance were judged on the
company's long term growth, I think that this feedback loop would die out much
more easily, and the fed would begin to lose its reason for living. Management of
an economy is only needed when the factors by which the system function are being
biased by government policies based on insufficient or inaccurate information.

The State of Vermont drivers license has no photo in it. You can get one that does, if you
need to go out of state, but the standard drivers license, sans photo, is acceptable in all
bars in Vermont. Likewise, many college ID's which have a photo and include a clearly
discernable date of birth can in some jurisdictions be an acceptable ID, and any military
ID, which has no address information at all, just your name, SSN, blood type, branch of
service, rank, and DOB, with your photo, is mandated to be accepted in all US jurisdictions
as proper ID.

It depends partly on how we implement it, but I can't see it being very big.
If we avoid graphics, <50 MB would hold many months worth of arguments.  Do
you already have a web server running?  If so, what software do you use?

You apparently live under a completely different government than
here in the U.S. Our taxes were never voted in, and must be paid at
the threat of armed people showing up on our doorsteps.
Questionable services are constantly inflicted on us without any
vote what-so-ever, most are some sort of wealth redistribution
scheme.

We are periodicaly drafted to serve in the military. and sent off
to forsaken places for bad political reasons. While there we are
subject to dumbass decisions made by the same dumbass politicians,
who conviently have never served themselves.

Actually I enlisted U.S.M.C. when I was 17 so exclude me, but I
still think the draft is the most evil thing our republic has.

I'll leave the economics 101 lesson to Michael.

Anyone who points a gun at me is the bad guy, if he/she is in
uniform, they usually get away with it.

The advantage of concealed carry has been established here many
times, I won't repeat it.

Here in Chicago, handguns have been banned for 17 years, yet
Chicago was just named murder capitol of the U.S. The Mayors
solution? More gun laws.....

The problem is that the police cannot be held liable for failing to
protect you, and when someones breaking into your house you
probably don't have time to get on the phone and explain things...

The fact is crime drops dramatically anywhere concealed carry laws
are passed. No one should even own a gun without being properly
trained in it's use and when it can/cannot be used.

Wishfull thinking, I can block EMP, so can any other engineer. No

If you do not wish to carry a weapon, you don't have to, but you
gain protection in a society with concealed carry, because the
criminals never know.

Actually current thinking is that there is no need to build larger
than 100MT. At 100MT a 10 mile diameter chunk of atmosphere blows
off into space. Larger bombs only blow the same 10 mile chunk at a
faster rate. Unless we're talking planet busting.

Linux + Apache web server.

Obviously, VB isn't gonna work.  Do you know perl, python, or

Eliezer, before you say "screw dynamic optimism" and equate it with "raving
optimism", please make sure you know what it means. If you read the
relevant principle (and it's now called "Practical Optimism"), you'll see
that it doesn't imply that the future is a playground with no dangers,
problems, or challenges.

Just trying to keep the record straight.

Ah, but now you are second-guessing what nature wants. Such hubris! Given
the massive variation in mammalian life-spans, it seems likely that death
through old age is something nature approves of. More exactly, the genes
that have been responsible for the evolution of a given species have
selected a life-span for that species that best allows their replication.
Who are we to change that?

Even if we did, and were right, why stop there? Why not adjust our
digestive systems? After all, an all-meat or all-vegan diet might yield
more descendents, on average.

Now that I think of it, the logical thing to do would be construct a better
replicator than those that currently exist, let it take over the Earth and
give it the means to expand into space. Existing replicator vehicles, such
as ourselves, will no doubt be consumed, but so what? We will have
fulfilled nature's will.
 
>So you see, natural law can fit just fine into life extension.

...or into the extinction of all existing species by a better replicator
that we design. Ready to start working on it?

[Mission Statement?  ExI has a *Mission Statement*?  There goes your
chance to recruit Scott Adams.  A pity; "evolve into pure energy and

help him with.]

"Living vigorously, effectively, and joyfully, requires dismissing

Okay, this is what I disagree with.

1)  I think that negative mental states invoke a higher order of
intelligence than positive mental states; consider the evolutionary context.
2)  Problems *should* dominate our thinking.  First, worry about
survival/Singularity.  Then, worry about creating the Culture.

In other words, I specifically object to, or "screw", the idea that
enthusiasm enhances intelligence; and blathering about the rewards but
refusing to acknowledge the dangers, and particularly the dangers of
deliberate misuse.

Someone has to keep track of the threats.

True enough - which is why birth (and more recently fetal viability), when the progeny's rights can be separated from those of the woman's, has traditionally been the legal, logical and for most people the emotional demarcation line.  Roe vs. Wade was, in this light, an extremely farseeing document, fitting the gradually increasing restrictions on abortion to fetal development, measured in trimesters.  Are you arguing that a woman should be imprisoned or executed because she chooses to undergo a first trimester abortion?

It not only tries to rob me, it succeeds. More accurately, some people
calling themselves "government" conspire to take a lot of my money without
my consent in order to spend it on programs I don't want and of which I
don't approve. How is this any different in germ from a common mugger?

>It is an institution based on the common will of those assembled under
it's power,
This is meaningless blather. There's no such thing as a "common will".
There are only individuals each of whom has her own will.

>A government is someone elected by

Sorry, I did not elect any government. Nor have I voted for any "services".

>This is

>this for nothing.

The reason I have to pay taxes is that if I don't, very bad things will
eventually happen to me. This is known in other contexts as a protection
racket.

Nations",

No, the fantasy is yours. Smith never postulated an ideal world; he
observed the real world and drew conclusions therefrom. As do all modern
economists. It's anti-market pseudoeconomics that denies reality and
constructs fairy-tale worlds.

>You can only achive the market equilibrum
>by having some superior force counter such destabilizing effects.

More nonsense. Equilibrium, by definition, is a product of
self-organization. "Superior" (i.e. political) force merely moves the
equilibrium point to some less-efficient point.

[more "ideal state" red herrings]

Since market freedom has nothing to do with any "ideal" or "perfect"
conditions, I won't spend any time arguing your further economic points. If
you think you can prove that freedom requires some sort of perfection,
proceed to do so.

>If instead, carrying of

This is a silly argument. Obviously, the bad guy isn't going to parade his
weapon before the police so they can arrest him for carrying it. Or do you
advocate strip-searching everyone at random to make sure no one is hiding a
gun?

>There can be no equivalent for this on the market.Security should not be

There are lots of things that "should" be available to anyone regardless of
means. Shall we socialize the farms so nobody will starve? Oh, wait, that's
been tried, hasn't it?

>Instead of spending billions of dollars for corporate and
>private security services, it would perhaps be more effective to use this
>money for the improvement of police service.

Oh, yes, by all means, let's improve the police forces' ability to harass
people for so-called victimless crimes. What sort of "offenders" do you
think are occupying the vast majority of prison space? The fact that the
police go after easy pickings, namely innocent people, instead of
effectively protecting us from real crime, is exactly why market-based
security services, as well as Block Watch-style neighborhood programs, are
rapidly proliferating. We've found that "private" security works, whereas
political "security" is mainly an illusion.

The more money "government" funnels into police services, the worse the
problems get. Just as with every other "government" program.

>Libertarian might include a lot, but if you don't want the state to take

Why, yes, in fact some of us want just that.

Yes, it's so much easier, safer, and more "cost-effective" to silence the
victim than to go after the criminal, isn't it?

>[T]he carrying of weapons always implies a threat to others.

You know the old movie line "my hands are registered as lethal weapons"?
Must I cut off my hands to avoid posing a threat to you?

>If you have the possibility to use force, you'll be

Speak for yourself. You don't know what I'm willing to do.

>If humans where truly rational beings, I would

Since most weapons are employed by "governments" to wage war or oppress
their subjects, I would have to agree with this last.

Bullshit. We remain animals, only with far greater scope and power of
self-determination than our ancestors.

Not to act at all cannot be considered a zero point, however, in, say, the case of an excellent swimmer who just sits on the shore like a sodden log whilst clearly perceiving the gurgling plaints of a drowning child.  The reason that there is no zero point is that there are multifarious circumstances (not to mention many ethical systems) which can not agree on such a common reference.

While most, or all ethical systems do not agree on everything, there are plenty of commonalities among most of them, especially the most successful of them, to imply that there is an inherent objective truth to the shared heuristics, at least as far as the human species is concerned. There may also be a subset of this set which may be objective truth for all thinking beings. In your example above, I can imagine no possible
>moral justification for an olympic swimmer saving a drowning child, if no other factors ar involved. That is not to say that there may not be one, but it not very likely to be one that is part of a successful ethical system of any sort. The closest to this that I can imagine is that the swimmer might want to get paid first (much like how Crassus made his fortune in ancient Rome as the owner of a fire company, he brought his pump and crew to the

If by "zero-point" you mean cases or classes where all ethical systems would agree, the most likely candidates are the ancient prohibitions against murder, theft, rape, cheating and lying; yet even in these, exceptions can be found, which may be exceptions in some systems but not in others.  Can you furnish an example of such a "zero-point"?

If we are willing to believe that nanotech permits at least some way to
build large structures using multi-generation assembler production techniques,
then it should be possible to send arobotic probe to the Oort cloud and find
a very large comet or a bunch of smaller comets, aggregate them into a
large mass, add reaction engines, and direct the resulting mass into a
cometary orbit that intersects the earth. Just how do you intend to defend
against this? There are a great many alternative attacks: this is just
the first one I happened to think of.

I'm new to this group but have read through most threads posted over the
past week and a number of the regular participant's personal websites to get
an idea of the kind of content required. Brief introduction: I'm 33-year old
partially burned-out South African software entrepreneur taking a semi-break
from the front lines of "Internet start-up" battlefield.  My last project
can be found at http://www.ferretsoft.com.

As I'm still somewhat overawed by the high quality of writing in this list
and on the websites of the various "regular" contributors that I've checked
out, I feel it best to pose a few questions before diving in at the deep end
with my own view points.

Question to Extropian and Transhumanist thinkers and philosophers: A
manic-depressive with a decade long history of recurrent hypomania/mania and
mostly mild depressive episodes chooses after initial diagnosis and
voluntary hospitalisation to forego the "benefits" of modern medication, so
as to better learn to "use" the cycles to enhance thinking and ability.
Prior to diagnosis, coping mechanisms were learned by trial and error but
are felt to be sufficiently effective.  This, of course, could just be
warped, grandiose thinking and poor judgement as per the symptoms.

Could this person considered to be a self-experimenting transhumanist OR
irresponsible and delusional, a danger to society and to herself/himself?

The reason I ask is that the subject of affective mental "illnesses" hardly
seems to appear in transhumanist discussions, "science fiction" scenarios
and essays. This despite the psychiatric notion that great minds like Newton
and Einstein "suffered" from forms of schizoid affective disorder, whilst
the list of possible manic-depressives amongst philosophers, entrepreneurs,
leaders etc. is too long to even start mentioning specific individuals.
Kind of like no one wants to talk about it, despite huge leaps in
neuroscience in recent years.

It would seem to me (and admittedly my research on enhanced intelligence and
so forth is still far too limited to say anything really sensible at this
point) that studying what it is that made minds like Einstein's tick is a
critical part of understanding true super-intelligence, and recreating it
artificially.  Rather most biotech/medical research appears to be directed
at finding "cures" and treatments and better ways to ensure medication
compliance.

Insights, comments and questions always appreciated.

Sorry to everyone else here for wasting space but...
I was considering being a libertarian, but at the only 2 libertarian party
meetings I've ever attended they were discussing who really owned the
"secret gummit black army helicopters" So that kinda made me think that's
where all the anti-government conspiracy theorists went. But that was a
couple years ago, and since then I've run into my socialist
phase.(Anarchist to Socialist in 3 years)
 Just thought I would offer a short explanation(I'm not very good at
debating so I won't try to).     BYE

Well ... as a true transhumanist I must add that I too find the number of
messages a bit overwhelming. I therefore would like to suggest a
technological solution.

What about a news server? It is easy to set up and can be combined with a
maillist and a webserver with a little bit of server side scripting. This
way it would be possible to acces the same messages in a multitude of ways,
and it would a LOT easier to browse the threads and older messages.
Isn't it about time that the old maillist gets uploaded to something more
intelligent?

I would like to assist if it has any interrest. I normally do this kind of
stuff for a living and it is not that big a project.

Could be both; I see no reason said categories must be exclusive.  IMO
the important questions would be the severity of the swings and the safeguards
the person provides against damage during the extreme parts of the cycle.

I have, and I don't see that at all.  Besides that, the ExI statements doesn't
exclude negative states, just defeatist ones.  Fear, panic, concern, worry,
etc., aren't on the list.  Those mental states certainly have their place.

Potential solutions should dominate our thinking, as well as potential
opportunities.

My enthusiasm certainly enhances my intelligence.  I'm amazingly more

Well, similar issues provided the context for a previous discussion on the
term "dynamic optimism".  Several people, including me, thought that the
term implied the kind of brain-dead optimism you see in some pep talks and
sales seminars.  But none of us thought that's what ExI was suggesting;
there's nothing in the ExI statement about "refusing to acknowledge dangers"
or other various difficulties.  Max has addressed those objections (nicely,
IMO)
with the shift to "practical optimism".  Ignoring realities, including
dangers,
is anything but "practical" but the emphasis is on how to improve things.

Geez, if this is your experience, I can understand your disenchantment with
the LP. The local party seems a bit out of touch. I can assure you that the
real LP has better topics to discuss. Have you read a good book about
libertarianism? I'd hate to see your perception of the movement skewed by a
bunch of oddballs. (Not that they're necessarily wrong about the black

Depends on how deep the target is.  I don't have my penetration figures
handy, but I recall that penetrating very deep targets rapidly turns into an
exercise in building gigantic bombs.  Of course, there are lots of other
ways to approach the problem, on both sides - I just wanted to point out
that moving mountains doesn't require any exotic technology.

By using the same technology, of course.  While your robots are journeying
to the Oort cloud and diverting comets, mine are mining the moon to build
defensive systems in high orbit.  A multi-gigaton warhead will convert a
comet into a cloud of gas quite nicely.  If you build missile defenses on
the comet, we can use directed energy weapons instead (burn one side of the
comet to push it off course - or just shoot off your missile defenses and
nuke it).  I have far more mass to play with than you do, which lets me
build bigger and better hardware.

The fundamental point is that the contest between offense and defense is far
from over.  Nuclear weapons and ICBMs gave offense a temporary edge because
the size of the Earth and the speed of human reflexes used to be important
limitations.  The same automation that lets us actually do something with
assemblers will completely change that equation, and it is not easy to
predict how.

Of course, we may be able to get by with straight HTML for this purpose.

Anyone else have a possible home for such a site?  Failing that, is there a

  IAN: Good point, however, a possibility could be
  (just speculation backed with no known research)
  that our cities are more violence since they are
  not homogenous cultures, that is, the U.S. is a
  classic "melting pot," and urban communities in
  the U.S. are quite often divided by voluntary
  selection into ethnic areas. In areas with 
  multiple cultures, or "gangs," we tend to 
  see more aggression. Look at the problems
  in India between Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs,
  look at Yugoslavia, look at East L.A.'s gangs.
  But look a Japan, a monoculture with low crime.

Actually, the evolutionary context suggests *different* kinds of
intelligence for positive and negative mental states, the problems to
be solved are different. And it is worth noting that among primates
and especially humans the problems of communication and social
interaction appears to have been especially important, given the
evolution of these parts of the brain - and these aspects of
intelligence are enhanced by positive mental states.

If we turn into humorless nanosurvivalists while preparing for the
Singularity, we might never reach the Culture even if we survive.

We should apply our intelligence to both solve problems and find new
possibilities. Transhumanism began as the realization that there was
possible ways out of the human condition, not as some effort to
"solve" it. Being aware of risks does not preclude being aware of
possibilities, and a sane person can balance both.

Both. It depends a lot on the approach and how well it works; a person
with mild swings could likely use them rationally, but if the swings
are so severe that rationality is impaired it is likely that it is
delusional. Of course, checking that rationality is impaired is hard
to do "from the inside", for that you need to check past experience or
ask friends.

But is this approach worth it? Does the total
productivity/creativity/happiness produced increase with the swings,
or would a more balanced state produce an overall better performance?
It might be worth looking into.

I would guess it is more because it is regarded as counterproductive;
few on this list would argue for the uses of the common cold, and
could it or bipolar disorder be treated most would likely simply avoid
them.

I agree that understanding the brain (including through its disorders)
will help us approach AI, SI et al but it is not clear to me that
affective disorders are useful in themselves. It would be much better
to be in a high energy active state for most of the time, with periods
of deep, restful relaxation in between.

 You assume that the time spent driving has zero productivity and
pleasure. The government seems to assume normal productivity and/or
pleasure. If the speed limit affected time spent in congested traffic,
I'd find your assumptions clearly better than the government's, but
I think it mainly affects time spent on uncongested highways, where
I can sometimes derive pleasure from things like listening to a CD,
talking to a friend, thinking about work, etc.
 So I think the truth is somewhere in between your assumptions and the
government's.

Probably the former - unless the mood swings are so large that they prove
impossible to manage, which is something that can only be discovered through
experimentation.  Of course, such projects are a lot easier and _much_ safer
if undertaken with the aid of an understanding friend or significant other.

Well, its critical to understanding natural intelligence variations (check
out Eliezer Yudkowsky's web site for some interesting thoughts in this
direction).  Certainly IQ can vary in kind as well as quantity - there is a
normal human distribution of cognitive abilities, and there are people who
stray from it to greater or lesser degrees.  There is a strong tendency for
the medical community to label anyone who doesn't fall close to the average
distribution as 'sick', and try to 'cure' them - never mind that I might
think I've got a good deal.

OTOH, I doubt that such studies will have much relevance to intelligence
enhancement.  It doesn't look like biotech is moving fast enough for that.
Genetic engineering approaches might require detailed studies of natural
variations, but they would take generations to get anywhere interesting.
Meanwhile, neural interfaces will appear in the same time frame but lead to
explosive innovation.  Once you can wire a computer into your brain you can
start figuring out how to use it do things for you - first math, then

 I find phone conversations generally less flexible because of the
need to synchronize communications. I don't like interrupting people or
being interrupted to initiate a new conversation, and I usually want to
reflect for minutes or hours before responding to novel ideas.

 Your advice makes perfect sense in an abstract world where we ignore
the details of the communications infrastructure and the adaptations
of the human mind to particular modes of communication.
 In practice, I think that the mode of communication supported by mailing
lists gets treated as a variation on the kind of conversations we would
have if we were talking face to face, and that when a single contribution
reaches some size threshold (maybe taking long enough to write that the
subject is no longer fresh in people's minds, and/or passes some threshold
for the time/effort required to read it), it no longer fits within our
idea of a conversation. You want a continuum between the concept of a
conversation and deeper communication modes, but I suspect there is a
partially innate category of conversation that hinders the development
of such a continuum. And when we switch to non-conversation modes, we use
very different filtering mechanisms to decide when to read and write ideas,
which don't fit well with the mailing list approach and probably produce
fewer (or at least less immediate) psychological rewards.

 The fact that on some absolute scale few people have the understanding to
write a good essay isn't a good reason for those whose understanding is
relatively good to avoid the topic or let people who oversimplify dominate.

I don't recall any instance where socialism hasn't involved force, ultimately.

Hi!

I'd like to know your opinion about a couple of ideas I had. If you have
already mentioned them before, I'm sorry.

I've been thinking that in a not so far away future humanity will be ruled
by a small number of men, computers or hybrids of both. The argument is
that economical power is becoming more concentrated as time goes by, when
the technology to control humans -- either by brain implants, highly
developed subliminal messages or military force -- arrives, someone is
bound to use it. We had Hitler, Napoleon, Caesar, Alexander and many more;
why shouldn't Bill Gates use this to control humankind. Most politicians
are power fanatics that will individually control humankind if they're
given the technology.

The other idea is far simpler. Don't you enjoy classifying technological
capacity of a civilization by the precision and ability of atomic
manipulation? We began by having a chemical industry, we are working with
cells' organelles to increase our molecular manipulation skills, we will
have nanotechnology and as nanotechnology develops, the more powerful
computers we'll have and the more molecular modeling we'll be able to do
thus leading to an evolution in nanotechnology the cycle will begin once
again.

Anyway, just a couple of thoughts.

What do you think, is this interesting to consider? Myself, I
think things would progress even more quickly if we took a
big chunk of this military budget and spent it on funding
science projects more directly. Not to mention we could have
finished that particle accelerator in Texas...

DIGITAL NATION

A Moral Project for 21st Century: Stop Creating Better Weapons

By Gary Chapman

Copyright 1999, The Los Angeles Times, All Rights Reserved

As we approach a new millennium, there will undoubtedly be a wave of 
general public introspection about the state of the human race -- 
where we've been and where we're headed.

If we look back on the last few centuries, it's clear that each one 
has been defined by singular and historic moral projects that 
affected the world's entire population.

The 18th century introduced the modern concepts of democracy and the 
social contract. The 19th century saw the end of slavery in most of 
the world and its condemnation as an immoral human relationship. In 
the 20th century, the universal moral project has been expanding 
civil and human rights and ending racism.

What will be the moral project of the 21st century?

This is difficult to predict, obviously, and it will depend on what 
seizes the imaginations of millions of people, and on leaders who can 
move people to action. But here's a worthy candidate for 
consideration: severing the relationship between 
scientific-technological progress and the means of war.

The "technological imperative" of improving weaponry has lodged 
itself in our minds as an inescapable part of the human condition 
ever since our primitive ancestors first improved the club. But if we 
take away any lesson from this century, it should be that continual 
improvement in weapons threatens the long-term survival and welfare 
of the human race.

If the 20th century is remembered for anything, it will certainly be 
for the introduction of vast advances in the ways we kill one another 
-- for nuclear weapons, mass-produced biological and chemical 
weapons, "smart" weapons, bombers, tanks, machine guns, ad infinitum. 
This is the historical blight that must be corrected, and this will 
require jettisoning the stubbornly held idea that people and nations 
will always seek better and more deadly weapons.

It may seem naive or utopian to suggest that science and technology 
be decoupled from weaponry in the next century. But we should 
remember that people once believed that kings, slavery and the notion 
of racial superiority would be with us forever too.

What steps can we take toward such a goal? Fortunately, we have a 
number of opportunities before us right now, but we need leadership 
to take advantage of them.

First, the end of the Cold War is a unique historic opportunity, one 
that we have yet to recognize fully. No other nation in the world is 
now a military threat to the United States the way the Soviet Union 
once was. Because of this, we should regard the military spending of 
the Cold War as an anomaly in U.S. history that can be corrected in a 
time of peace.

This correction could lead to a significantly lower defense budget 
than we have even now, nearly a decade after the demise of the Soviet 
Union. We could take steps to dismantle the remnants of the "national 
security state," end our war-posture nuclear weapons alert status and 
shut down the laboratories that continue to work on nuclear weapons.

Unfortunately, President Clinton recently announced a large increase 
in defense spending, the largest since the huge military buildup of 
the Reagan years. He wants $100 billion more for defense over six 
years, and Republican leaders in the Congress want even more than 
that -- as much as $150 billion.

Chris Hellman, senior analyst at the Center for Defense Information, 
a Washington-based organization founded and led by retired senior 
military officers, calls this proposed increase "an unnecessary waste 
of American tax dollars." Hellman thinks we can cut $20 billion to 
$30 billion from a $270-billion annual defense budget without hurting 
national security. He notes that the U.S. still spends $25 billion 
per year in preparation for a nuclear war and is still "continuing to 
improve and enhance the performance of nuclear weapons."

The year 2000 software bug may, interestingly, pose another 
opportunity for rethinking defense policy. Defense experts are 
concerned about the sensitivity of the highly interdependent 
"hair-trigger" nuclear command and control systems in both the U.S. 
and Russia -- especially in Russia, because the Russians haven't 
begun to address the Y2K problem and have no hope of fixing it in 
time. Last November, the Pentagon's Defense Special Weapons Agency 
was caught lying about its own Y2K preparations involving U.S. 
nuclear command and control systems: The agency reported the systems 
had been fixed when they hadn't even been tested.

Because of this, public interest groups such as the British American 
Security Information Council have called for a year-end shutdown of 
all nuclear weapons systems around the world to prevent problems 
caused by the software bug. This seems prudent, given the risk. But 
if we shut these systems down, why would we need or want them to be 
turned on again? Coming to grips with this question may be one of the 
few benefits of the Y2K problem.

Another opportunity is provided by the Internet, launched and funded 
for many years by the Defense Department. Now that the Net is a 
nearly ubiquitous global communications medium, the world is tied 
together as never before. That makes the prospect of war that might 
disrupt this interdependency increasingly unlikely. As the Internet 
grows and becomes more and more embedded in world commerce, the need 
for globe-spanning military resources should diminish, not increase.

High-tech-industry leaders should grasp the present contradiction 
between the impact of the Internet and rising defense budgets.

Congressman George Brown (D-San Bernardino), the ranking Democrat on 
the House Science Committee, told me, "We're too interconnected now 
to have sane national leaders contemplate war as a viable national 
option for solving problems."

Brown believes that in 20 years, U.S. military 
research-and-development spending could be half its current level of 
about $32 billion per year, and decline further after that. "We 
cannot continue to sustain the illusion that we're going to fight a 
war with nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction," he 
said.

To cut the ties between technological progress and war, to shut down 
the indefensible and obscene international arms trade and reorient 
hundreds of thousands of scientists and engineers around the world to 
peaceful and sustainable work, we'll need courageous and determined 
moral leaders. And those people will almost certainly come from the 
common citizenry -- no social change of this magnitude has ever been 
sparked or led by political officials.

Those leaders may be living among us already.

...it doesn't actually work. _None_ of the cards shown the first time appear
the second time. You're encouraged to memorize one card, and all the cards
are similar, so you don't notice that all the cards changed.
9 of Hearts changes to 9 of Diamonds, &c. &c.

I am instigating a privately funded study for industrializing andcolonizing
Mars using near-term technology and financing. The proposal
relies heavily on forward-deployed robotics, early native resource
development, private launch vehicles and one-way tickets.
We need some marketing, law, finance and technical assistance. If this
gets going within a couple months, I may include a very short segment on
it in episode 2 of our television series.

I shook my head at this trick a couple of days ago too.
After that, I keep shaking my head at Andy's page, as
it sells me a thousand of visitors a day now (at slightly
over a penny apiece).  Reason knows how many he gets.

If extropian pages were getting that many visitors...

Well, I will try to channel the ones I get from Andy, though
the flow of curiosity aimed at [even "intelligent"] humor is
not the prime sort we seek.

The productivity or pleasure of driving can also be negative.
An easy way to find out would be to ask people how much money
or time they would pay (or take) for having their driving time
extended by each minute or mile.

As people who speed, do so willingly, they always have a
subjective gain there.

Any reasonable speed limit compromise between risks
and time should apparently depend on the quality of the cars
and the roads and the value of time.  As both of these increase,
the speed limit should have considerably grown since the 70s...

I chose to build my weapon in the Oort cloud specifically to keep you from
knowing what I was doing, and to give myself stealthy access to more mass
than you have readily available. I also get the advantage of throwing
my planet-sized mass down a steep gravity gradient giving you an essentially
impossible task. The only way you can stop me is to organize your entire
set of resources into a single defensive and surviellance effort, to keep
track of all of my efforts to destroy you. That is inconsistent with the
concept of complete freedom of action for millions of individuals. Any weapon
you can build and use to defend against an earth-massed weapon can be used
against the earth, also.

For the record, I don't actually indend to destroy the earth, or even threaten
it. I intend to continue to try to advance the singularity.

Assuming the concept is viable..why quibble with the paltry military budget?

How about a BIG budget...perhaps that of Health and Human Services.?

Personally I think government funding of science is a bad idea.  I think
corporations...or better yet...individuals...should have less of their income
confiscated.(ideally...NONE).  THEN we'd see some advances.

Sorry..I strongly disagree..

I disagree that economical power is becoming more concentrated...rather the
opposite is true.  Evidence the stockmarket(s)....and the wide dispersal of
stock ownership.

With the emergence of the global economy the military becomes less important
since trade is more advantageous to governments than conquest.  Also the same
global economy tends to break down governments.  

"Power to the People" is becoming a reality.  For example.  I have more
transportation power than did columbus and more computing power than did the
British Empire or pre world war one (perhaps world war two?) and easily more
"mayhem" power than a roman legion  (various undisclosed firearms)..better
communications capabilities than the pony express and better medical access
than Florence Nightingale.and with the "pornographer to the president"..why
French Post cards are blase..

You get the idea...

The individual is getting more powerful...not less.

I could imagine a country where the citizenry
is willingly submitting to the centralized power.
This is not a country where I would like to live though.
But... it's still not socialism.  The Law doesn't just
allow you to submit.  It promises you punishment if you
ever disagree.

It's like being in jail and being free at the same time.
The fact that you are currently confined to one place
(or agree with somebody's opinion) is quite natural.
It's when you are not allowed to leave (dissent), it
becomes a jail (socialism), and you start feeling rage.

Everything in extropian values is about frontiers, personal
experimentation, unbounded growth in new directions and
dimensions, and risk-taking.  What does any centralized
power have to do here?   Control sewage disposal?
Why would a society that finds effective and non-coercive
organizational approaches for modifying human nature in
thousands of ways, and running super-complex fluid
connections between them, post-human nano-goo, and who
knows what else, need coercion for sewage handling?

Or do we need a centralized system to bring us to the
beginning of this time in the fastest and most efficient
way?  Can you imagine IRS and welfare program as leaders
in economic and social innovation?  - And they'd get
immeasurably worse without competition and ability to get
innovations from non-socialist sector.

Well, lets hope your right.  But that brings up my central point - we need to take responsibility now, all of us, not just extropians and tranhumanists, but everyone who wants to create a better future, to ensure through rational planning, scenario creation, increased technological accesability, dynamic optimism, to create the future.  Since the future is up for grabs, it is we (all of us) who will ultimately determine if we end up as grey goo or waxing poetic in The Culture.  Therfore, we *must* take full responsibility about *how* these seed AI's are created, their growth algorithms, etc.  As far as grey goo, I'd suggest that as many people as possible get access as soon as possible to as much nanotech as possible.  That way it ensures that if any one specific group, no matter how malign, will have several if not hundreds of more benign competitors just as likely to develop nanotech before they can.

Since The Culture has implict immortality, I'd spend time doing all of the above.

Can ethics even exist without multiple agents?
If not then we've found a natural zero point in "ethics-space":
The empty set describing the possible ethical interactions of
non-interacting agents.

Non-interaction is certainly A zero point. Of one axis at least.

Actually, aging is due now to natural wear and tear.  Also, our bodies replace all of their composite atoms in less than a year.  It is the strutural intelligence of our bodies that remains throughout this natural atomic replacement.  Therefore, with a sufficiently detailed description of a youthful body, nanotechnology could very easily extend and maintain your human form indefinitely - certainly well past a mere 3338 years (which sounds suspiciosuly arbitrary to me).

Hope I can prove you wrong, by having this consveration with you at the Far Edge Party in a mere 200,000 years.  By then, I'll probably have gotten bored with the human form, and gone on to something more capable of flight. :-)

Some deontologists would argue that it is unethical to have bad will
towards someone, even if you never come in contact with them in your entire
life and affect them in no way at all.  Obviously, in this case you could
have two people who would never interact, but who would nonetheless each
have ethical obligations regarding the other.

Could you be more precise?

If the singularity is defined as the horizon beyond which we can conceptualize, how do you intend to advance it?  The closer you get, the further this singularity=horizon will receed from you.

If the singularity is more like the noun 'SINGULARITY' as defined by Eli, what makes you certian that your intention not to destroy or threaten the earth is not in conflict with this Singularity you want to advance? In otherwords, since you imply that the singularity will not threaten the Earth, perhaps you could describe specifically how it will not.

We have already considered and rejected nonaction, or forbearance, or wu-wei (doing by nondoing) as a zero-point in this thread with the counterexample of the excellent swimmer who does nothing when hearing the entreaties of a drowning child. Such an absence of (inter)action would generally be considered morally deficient rather than neutral.

I'm thinking non-interaction in a more physical sense. A swimmer sitting
on the shore, watching a drowing child, has knowledge of that drowning
child. I'm making the implicit assumption here that knowledge can only
come from interaction, and that if there is knowledge then there
necessarily has been some causal chain linking the two agents.

By non-interaction, I mean agents between which there is no
communication, and no causal chain whatsoever.

I didn't say it was a very USEFUL zero point, just one natural one. :)

Title
  Panax ginseng prevents apoptosis in hair follicles and
  accelerates recovery of hair medullary cells in irradiated
  mice.
Source
  In Vivo.  12(2):219-22, 1998 Mar-Apr.
Abstract
  We studied the effect of the water fraction of Panax ginseng, one of
  traditional oriental medicine herbs on apoptosis and the formation of
  medullary cell in the hair follicles of irradiated mice. The
  hair follicle or its differentiated product, the
  hair, which represents a linear historical record of
  follicular proliferative activity, could provide a biological indicator of
  the effect of radioprotective drugs. Adult N:GP(s) mice with
  hair follicles synchronously in the middle of the
  hair growth cycle received whole-body doses
  of gamma-radiation. The hair follicles were analysed either
  12 hours after irradiation with 2 Gy in the experiment on the apoptosis, or 3
  days after irradiation with 3 Gy in the experiment on the forming medulla.
  The number of medullary cells per unit length (100 microns) were measured by
  H and E staining. Apoptosis was detected by a nonisotopic in situ DNA
  end-labeling (ISEL) technique and H and E stain applied to the serial
  histologic sections. Ginseng administration before irradiation resulted in a
  suppression of apoptosis, as shown by a reduced number of cells stained with
  ISEL for fragmented DNA, both i.p. (0.3 mg/head, p < 0.05) and p.o. (2 mg/ml
  of drinking water, p < 0.05) treatment. In addition, ginseng treatment was
  associated with an increase in the number of medullary cell per unit length
  as compared with the vehicle treated mice (p < 0.001, i.p.; p < 0.05, p.o.).
  These results indicate that the water fraction of ginseng can exert a potent
  effect on the recovery of the hair follicles by its combined
  effects on proliferation and apoptosis of the cells in the
  hair follicle.

Title
  780 nm low power
  diode laser irradiation stimulates proliferation of
  keratinocyte cultures: involvement of reactive oxygen species.
Source
  Lasers in Surgery & Medicine.  22(4):212-8, 1998.
Abstract
  BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine
  irradiation parameters of a 780 nm low
  power CW diode laser (6.5 mW) leading to
  enhanced proliferation of cultured normal human keratinocytes (NHK). The
  possible role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this response was
  evaluated. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: NHK were exposed to a single
  dose of 0 to 3.6 J/cm2 (0-180 sec) of irradiation. Proliferation parameters
  studied were: incorporation of 3H-thymidine during 6-24 hr
  following irradiation; percentage of dividing cells and
  number of cells, 24 hr and 48 hr following irradiation,
  respectively. RESULTS: Proliferation of NHK exposed to 0.45-0.95 J/cm2 was
  significantly enhanced by 1.3-1.9-folds relative to sham-irradiated controls,
  as inferred from parameters studied. Exposure to other energy densities was
  considerably less effective in enhancing proliferation parameters. Added
  enzymatic antioxidants, superoxide dismutase or catalase, scavenging
  superoxide anions and H2O2, suppressed this enhanced proliferation. Added
  scavengers (alpha-tocopherol acetate, scavenging lipid peroxidation, or
  sodium azide, histidine, mannitol, scavenging singlet oxygen, superoxide
  anions, and hydroxyl radicals, respectively), or N-acetyl cysteine, the
  thiol-reducing agent, suppressed the response, but to different extents.
  CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that 780 nm
  low power diode laser
  irradiation enhanced keratinocytes proliferation in vitro, with an apparent
  involvement of ROS in this response, and comparably, might be used to promote
  their proliferation in vivo to enhance wound healing.

  The penetration enhancer
  SEPA augments stimulation of scalp hair growth by topical minoxidil in
  the balding stumptail macaque.
Source
  Skin Pharmacology.  8(5):221-8, 1995.
Abstract
  The purpose of this study was to determine if
  the penetration enhancer
  SEPA (2-n-nonyl-1,3-dioxolane) would augment the scalp hair
  growth effects of topical minoxidil in the balding stumptail
  macaque. A 1-in2 area on the balding scalp of 40 adult
  female monkeys (four drug-treated and four vehicle-treated groups of 5
  monkeys each) was topically treated 5 days/week, q.d. or b.i.d., with
  approximately 250 microliters of minoxidil-SEPA (2.5% minoxidil,
  weight/volume in 10% SEPA, 25% propylene glycol and 65% isopropyl alcohol),
  Rogaine topical solution (TS, 2% minoxidil, weight/volume in 20% propylene
  glycol, 60% ethanol and 20% water) or respective vehicles (without drug) for
  16 weeks via paintbrush application. Scalp hair was collected by shaving and
  vacuuming the dosed area at baseline and at 4-week
  intervals. The shaved hair was filtered, weighed and
  recorded as the change from baseline. The
  q.d. and b.i.d. minoxidil-SEPA groups displayed a significant increase in
  hair weight compared to their respective vehicles at week 4
  whereas q.d. and b.i.d. Rogaine TS groups were not active until week 8 and
  12, respectively. Both minoxidil-SEPA treatments produced significantly
  greater cumulative hair weight over the entire 16-week study
  compared to either of the Rogaine TS
  treatments. Comparable increases in cumulative hair weight were evident
  between q.d. and b.i.d. minoxidil-SEPA groups and between q.d. and b.i.d.
  Rogaine TS groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Title
  Phosphate supplementation prevents a decrease of triiodothyronine and
  increases resting metabolic rate during low energy diet.
Source
  Journal of Physiology & Pharmacology.  47(2):373-83, 1996 Jun.
Abstract
  Thirty overweight women participated in 8 week slimming program consisting of
  a self-controlled low-energy diet (4.2 MJ/day) supplemented with highly
  viscous fibres and mineral tablets containing calcium, potassium and sodium
  phosphates (Redusan Combi, Biokraft Pharma AB, Sweden). Half
  of the patients received in double blind manner mineral tablets during first
  4 weeks and placebo (without phosphates) during next 4 weeks
  (group 1) while the remaining patients were treated (cross-over) with placebo
  first and mineral tablets in the final period (group 2). The rate of weight
  loss was similar in groups 1 and 2 (4.7 vs 5.2 kg during the first 4 weeks
  and 2.7 vs 3.0 kg in the further 4 weeks). During periods of phosphate
  supplementation, the resting metabolic rate (RMR) increased by approx. 12% (p
  < 0.05) in group 1 and 19% (p < 0.05) in group 2. Phosphate supplementation
  ameliorated also a decrease in plasma triiodothyronine level and a decrease
  in thyroxine to triiodothyronine ratio. There were no differences between
  groups in the plasma insulin, catecholamine, growth hormone, cortisol and
  testosterone levels. Phosphate supplementation did not affect plasma lipids
  or blood glucose concentration. It is concluded that phosphate
  supplementation in obese patients on a low-energy diet enhances RMR
  irrespectively of the rate of weight loss. This effect seems to be, at least
  partly, due to an influence of phosphates on peripheral
  metabolism of thyroid hormones.

Title
  Increased postprandial energy expenditure in obese women after peroral K- and
  Mg-phosphate.
Source
  Mineral & Electrolyte Metabolism.  20(3):147-52, 1994.
Abstract
  Energy expenditure (EE) was studied in 15 obese (BMI > 27.5, median 29.2) and
  15 lean (BMI < 22.9, median 21.7) healthy, postmenopausal women before and
  after peroral orange juice with or without K- and Mg-phosphate
  supplementation. The women, 56-58 years old, were studied in a double-blind,
  crossover experiment on two separate days. They received 100 ml of orange
  juice (10 g of carbohydrates) with or without a supplement of K+ (35 mmol),
  Mg2+ (17 mmol) and HPO4(2-) (39 mmol). Measurements were made before and 30
  and 60 min after the stimuli. Intake of juice only had no effect on EE in
  either the lean or the obese subjects. When the minerals were added, EE
  (+6.3%; p < 0.001) increased significantly in the obese group with in a
  maximum 30 min after stimulus, while no such increase was seen in the lean
  group. The difference between the groups was significant (p < 0.05) and so
  was the difference in the obese group with or without minerals (p < 0.01). We
  conclude that an addition of potassium/magnesium-phosphate to glucose
  increases the postprandial thermogenesis in obese postmenopausal women, but
  not in lean ones.

Title
  On the relationships between mineral metabolism, obesity and
  fat distribution.
Source
  European Journal of Clinical Investigation.  23(5):307-10, 1993 May.
Abstract
  Alterations in calcium metabolism have been associated with cardiovascular
  risk factors. An altered binding of calcium to plasma proteins and raised
  levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) have been described in morbid
  obesity. In the present study, indices of mineral metabolism
  were related to obesity (body mass index, BMI) and fat
  distribution (waist to hip ratio, w/h) in 194 subjects with a wide range of
  BMI and w/h. The ratio of total serum calcium to plasma ionized calcium
  (Ca2+) was found to be significantly correlated to both BMI (r = 0.20, P <
  0.02) and w/h (r = 0.22, P < 0.005). Serum phosphate was also correlated to
  both of the indices of obesity in an inverse way (r = -0.24,
  P < 0.0008 for BMI and r = -0.33, P < 0.0001 for w/h). These relationships
  were still significant when the influences of age, sex and serum creatinine

Title
  Increased metabolic rate in obese women after ingestion of potassium,
  magnesium- and phosphate-enriched orange juice or injection of ephedrine.

Abstract
  Thirty-six obese, pre-menopausal women were studied after an overnight fast
  and randomized to four different regimens of metabolic stimuli: group I (n =
  12), 100 ml orange juice with dissolved K- and Mg-phosphates
  (K, 40 mmol; Mg, 17.5 mmol; HPO4, 35 mmol); group II (n = 8), 100 ml of water
  with electrolytes as in group I; group III (n = 8), 100 ml of orange juice;
  group IV (n = 8), injection of ephedrine intravenously, 0.25 mg/kg body
  weight. The women in groups I, II and III were further stimulated with
  ephedrine as in group IV and new measurements made. Thirty minutes after the
  first stimulus VO2, VCO2 and energy expenditure (EE) rose significantly
  (13.1-16.5 per cent) in groups I and IV only. In groups I and III the blood
  concentrations of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide rose significantly. After
  the second stimulus (ephedrine i.v.) no further increase in VO2, VCO2 and EE
  occurred in group I, but the increases from basal values became significant
  in group III. In all women at baseline, whole-body potassium was
  significantly correlated to VO2. Serum-magnesium was negatively correlated to
  A/I weight (actual/ideal weight). We conclude that the addition of K- and
  Mg-phosphates to glucose increases the postprandial
  thermogenesis in obese patients.

What is the support for this? As far as I can remember from Hayflick's
_How and Why We Age_ and other readings, wear and tear doesn't appear
to be the main factor in current aging, and people more look at
genetic and systemic factors.

I have seen estimates for multicentury or millennial lifespans based
on accidents as the sole cause of death; is this the source of the
above figure? (It seems unlikely that anybody could do a believable
calculation of wear and tear lifespans with this "accurracy").

I think this is highly doubtful. The trend of power seems to be moving
in the opposite direction if you look at it historically, and most new
technologies we are discussing here appear to have strong
decentralizing effects - internetworking and strong cryptography makes
it hard to control information flows, easy surveillance can (as David
Brin has argued) break the government monopoly on spying,
nanotechnology removes the need for centralized production, space
colonisation by its nature creates dispersed and independent habitats,
and so on. I think Vernor Vinge put it like "the power of governments
is growing, but the power of individuals is growing at a faster
rate".

There are a few on this list who argue that certain technologies may
emerge that are so powerful they give a total advantage to their
owners, but this appears doubtful (see the archives for that tiresome
discussion).

Maybe the trend of power is moving in an orthogonal direction, from
powerful individual to powerful institutions, designed or
spontaneous. Once it was just the kings, now it is the Internet,
government structures and international markets. Note that this
doesn't mean individuals loose power or independence, they just become
parts of greater clusters.

Unfortunately, Ayn Rand was wrong.  Collectives are real!  Memes
create social organisms just as genes create regular biological
organisms.  One could just a well say that the human body doesn't
exist!  Really, the human body is a group of individual cells, albeit
co-operating in complex ways.  Nonsense!  Collectives and
human bodies do exist......fortunately, with self-awareness, one
does not have to be part of a collective.

Yes, by '87 all of the major systems proposed at that point had been built as
prototypes and tested either on the ground or in space. All that was lacking
was a sufficiently powerful computer system to manage the whole shebang.
Here's what had been tested:

x-ray laser (underground nuke test)
CO2 laser (air test @ 20-80 mile ranges through atmosphere)
electron laser (ground tested, technology now used for treating cancer)
F-15 launched kinetic kill vehicles (mostly for ASAT work)(air launched,
tested against satellites)
Missile launched kinetic kill vehicles (ground launched, tested against other
missile dummy warheads in space)
railgun launched kinetic kill vehicles (ground tested)
adapted phalanx gun system for terminal perimeter defense (tested)
High Exoatmospheric kill vehicles (ground launched)

The computer software expected to run an entire sytem was thought to require
at least several hundred million lines of code, which was serveral times
larger than any programming done in the 80's, but all of it of course needed
to be bug free....;)

As I recall, even Dr. Ashton Martin of the Union of Concerned Scientists
admitted, despite the groups' propaganda in the media to the contrary,
that,"the dispute is no longer scientific".

Then you picked the wrong way to do it.  By current U.S. legal definitions,
I currently own more mass than you could dig out of any hundred comets (a
few thousand acres of useless swamp, projected down to the center of the
Earth - yes, I own the mineral rights).  That ignores the fact that Luna and
the Earth-crossing asteroids are much closer than the Oort cloud, and can be
mined much faster.

What impossible task?  You're thinking in 20th century terms.  With the
technology we are talking about there is no problem hitting an object that
moves at a paltry few tens of KPS, and one mega-nuke per comet is a cheap
trade - I can easily take out as many comets as you care to throw.

Again, tracking every large natural object inside the orbit of Saturn is not
that big a deal.  Comets are especially hard to hide - an asteroid would
have been a better choice.

Did I say I was an Anarchist?  Governments will only be replaced if we come
up with another institution capable of fighting wars - either way, there is
going to be an Earth-Luna defense system backed by the collective resources
of four billion human beings.  Good luck - you'll need it.

> Any weapon

Comets aren't 'earth-massed weapons' - a typical comet might weigh 10^12
tons, while the Earth is more like 10^21 tons.  That's why comets are
relatively easy to stop.  If you want to use a really big object (like
Ganymede) as a missile a short-range interception becomes impractical - but
there is no way to move something that massive without releasing enough
energy to tell the whole solar system what you're up to in plenty of time to
stop it.

Look, I happen to be in favor of expanding into space as soon as possible,
for the obvious reason that the world is getting to be too small a place to
fight on.  I am also in favor of putting a lot of work into design-ahead of
defensive systems, so we can all be as sure as possible of avoiding a
disaster scenario.  However, nanotech does not magically negate all
defenses.  Nanotech warfare is simply warfare on a larger scale, and if we
move into space it begins to look a lot like conventional warfare at that.
If both sides have the same tech base, there is no obvious way to tell
whether attackers or defenders will have the advantage.

If you are aware of another person, there is interaction. Maybe not personal
one on one interaction, but it is still interaction. Much like a certain CEO of
a monopoly coporation most of us are shareholders in. Most of us have never met
him, but his unethical 'personal' actions in the office have impacted us
all....

I would say that with the sole exception of communes and kibbutzes, which still
relied on significant amounts of peer pressure, no socialist organization with any
political power has worked for very long without force. My opinion for this is
that since communalism is so much of an anathema to human nature that force must
be used to maintain a population in permanent residency. Note that communes and
kibbutzes do have significant turnover levels, mostly of young adults coming and
going once they got the socialist bug worked out of their systems. I admit that
when I was a teenager that I considered myself a socialist for about two weeks...
then I regained my sanity and actually thought things through. I once heard
someone say that they would be worried about a person who had not been a socialist
for at least 15 minutes in their lives....

If everything works exactly the way you expect, maybe - but how often does
that happen?  The problem with making Algernons is that it takes several
years to figure out if your first experiment worked, and longer to find out
what went wrong.  If you go through a few mistake cycles before getting it
right, then wait 10 - 15 years for the first kids to get old enough to be
helpful, you're looking at the 2030 - 2040 time frame.  Plus, the funding
and legal problems are likely to delay the whole project substantially.

Meanwhile, research on neuron/microchip interfaces already has solid funding
and legal acceptance.  Primitive examples exist in the lab, and the cycle
time for building improved models is only a couple of years.  It appears
that prosthetic limbs and sensory organs using such techniques will be in
production in a few years.  If we get a typical progression curve, I'd
expect cybernetic enhancements to exist in the 2020 - 2030 time frame.

But even if the cybernetic approach takes longer, it is still likely to be
more important.  Algernic enhancement would produce sharply limited
enhancement of a few few-defined types.  Artificial enhancement is an
open-ended process.  It probably isn't as fast as pure AI enhancement, but
it would advance much faster than a purely biological approach.

Follicley challenged Extropians may wish to save their cash. I've
taken Panex ginseng for 2 years as part of my regular vitamin/anti-

I remain the spitting image of a Socratic Greek.........   ;)

It does have other usefull properties though....

I said in my earlier post that it REQUIRES knowledge of the person.

Perhaps the reason the Golden Rule was promulgated in its original
form was to take account of the fact that we can only know a very few
people intimately well-thus, appealing to an interior world-view as a
propective
surrogate for the unknown party's humanity would provide the only
conveniently
available template of likely beneficial behavior...never thought about this
before...thanks!

By the way, in an incredibly bizzarre coincidence, I happen to be a
Jehovah's
Witness. Weird huh? So, in the spirit of my rule, I promise to not bother
you henceforth.

Who was it that said, "Communism is just another step on the long road
from Capitalism back to capitalism."

I think it was Dennis Miller talking about the collapse of the Soviet
Union.  I've always liked that quote.  I think socialism would work as
well.

Yes, good point, and one that I've made in the past. If we accept this premise,
we also must acknowledge that the crime, as a function of demographics, is
related to the lack of available 'acceptable' economic opportunities in general
as well as a lack of proper preparation of the individual to take advantage of
economic opportunities, thus forcing those falling through the 'cracks' of the
system resort to predation, as well as translating their economic and personal
stresses into violent acts.

This sort of resorting to predation in a rural environment as a natural behavior
is accepted, because the individual has the ability in most rural environments
to exercise his or her predatory instincts upon wilderness species, rather than
on other people. There is a large percentage of the rural population who live a
large percentage of their productive hours in a hunter/gatherer lifestyle. They
become excellent hunters, and maintain hunting licenses in several states, so
they can harvest a half dozen deer during the fall, possibly a couple moose, as
well as partridge, grouse, woodcock, and ducks, etc., not to mention trout and
salmon fishing. They maintain a good sized garden in their yards producing a
significant amount of vegetables to can for the winter and springtime (then
there are those who are involved in more lucrative crops.. pot is the #1 cash
crop in Vermont..).

These sort of opportunities to survive despite lack of employment opportunities
and with high urban taxes, forcing people to become welfare slaves to the
system, is a significant departure from the rest of human history, which our
natural behaviors are optimized for. Add to this the criminalization of cash
crops like pot, and you add a significant percentage of the population to the
criminal class, which further limits their "acceptable" employment opportunities
beyond their ethnic or racial problems.

Yes, I much prefer meetings which have topics very similar to much of the
discussion on this list. Libertarians tend to be very technologically oriented,
in my experience. The Black Helo phonomenon is documented, and the few times
people were able to find ID numbers on them, the numbers wound up belonging to
helicopter owners on the other side of the country who still had the numbers on
their own birds there, so there is some sort of fraud going on there. The
reason why everyone thinks they are government is because the personnel
associated with them sport paramilitary SWAT type uniforms and treat people
like they are conducting official military business. Because there is no way to
identify the units involved, accountability for this is very low.

There is some evidence that they are actually employees of a company called
EG&G, which is also known to be the security contractor to the DOE and the Air
Force for Area 51, which is why everyone in the paranoid community is convinced
that its all the 'big UFO coverup'. Frankly, at this point, anything the
mainstream media AND the government scoffs at, I would prefer to take a closer
look at before I dismissed it.

My personal opinion is that they are members of  or work with Seal Team Six, a
unit whose primary covert mission is to limit the proliferation of nuclear
technology by direct covert action.

I think this would be an interesting exercise. It might be a good idea
to have someone knowledgeable in technological history look into the
design to make it reasonable.

As I see it, we want nodes and links between them, both able to be
commented (first a general description like "Simple nanotechnology:
the ability to mechanosynthetize some molecular structures using
special tools in a controlled environment", or "Simple nanotech leads
to advanced nanotech given enough interest and investments", then
comments and discussions about the details). Ideally it should be
clear what nodes and links are regarded as likely (lots of supporting
analysis: lots of small green markers), what is regarded as unlikely
(red markers) and controversial (many markers of different colors). 

I wish I could devote more time to something like this, but I have a
scarce supply of that precious commodity. However, I really wish to
see this implemented and hope to participate in the debate.

Texas politicians pulled a political fast one to get the SSC, first
chance they got, the enemies they made cut them and the project to
ribbons.

As for this moral project, I disagree completely. There are to many
military problems in the world to consider this currently. Our best
bet is to stay ahead technology.

Once we possess the technology, biological wear and tear will
become irrelevant. However the possibility of accidents will
continue to plague the biologically based immortals. Hopefully
advancing tech will assist in many areas, and things like "utility
fog" may help protect. Some of couurse will move to shiny new homes
of metal and compositites.

there are lotsa studies showing 7th day adventists live longer,
but im pretty well convinced the delta can be explained with
4 simple rules for living:

1. dont smoke
2. drink in moderation if at all
3. eat meat in moderation
4. sleep in your own bed

So you are talking about planet busters i.e. burrowing H-Bombs.

Your subsequent post about space makes it clearer why we might need
these devices i.e. planetary level defense.

She never said collectives aren't real. She said they're not entities: they
have no independent physical existence. They exist as relations and as
conceptual categories, not as objects. Take away the individuals and
society disappears. The converse doesn't hold.

An intriguing idea, but wholly unsubstantiated. Can you point to such an
organism? Have you communicated with one (other than in the sense of
communicating with one or more individuals representing it)?

It's somewhat more than that: it's a tightly integrated and mutually
dependent group of cells with a more or less central control mechanism. A
cell can't exist apart from the rest of the body except under highly
artificial conditions. None of this is true of individuals vis-a-vis
society, for instance.

Exactly. But if the collective were truly an organism, this would not be
true.

Yes, this is a problem. However, one might bootstrap by looking at
historical transhumanism, like the thread from Bacon, the
Enlightenment, Haldane, Bernal, Stapledon, FM 2020 and so on. But we
really need more papers... (writing, writing, writing)

Implementing the ideal interface would probably take more work than any of
us have time for.  However, IMO we can get most of the benefit with much
less work.  A series of static web pages could display the summary info for
different scenarios, and a simple database app could store and display
arguments on the different points.  Someone would have to spend time keeping
everything up to date, of course.

Any other ideas on how to organize such a site?

Can anyone suggest a catchy term for the illusion
that "collectives are real" or "collectives exist?"

This issue is discussed in 'Word Controlled Humans'
by John Harland, out of print but apparently available
from A-Albionic --

<http://a-albionic.com/a-albionic/gopher/conspiracy/a-albionic/bonus>
<http://www.msen.com/~lloyd/BIG.html>
<http://www.msen.com/~lloyd/LITTLE.html>

I also found 'The Life And Crucifixion Of Julian And The Threat Of
Group-Entities' by Harland, John at
<http://www.books.com/scripts/view.exe?sid~dxd6YNGjrY7RZYV/isbn~0914752332>,
which suggests the term "Group-Entity" Illusion. But maybe someone
can suggest a term with greater "meme-power."

The basic illusion is that the "flock" is real or exists as an
entity, often spoken about as if it is a volitional entity.
Similarly, the "school" of fish, "society" of humans, "country"
of citizens, "government" of politicians and bureaucrats, etc.

For some related analysis, see Max's DEEP ANARCHY -- AN ELIMINATIVIST
VIEW OF "THE STATE" <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.htm>.

Yes, I'm sure the technology was developed by them specifically as a
means of either combating or aiding the black oil alien menace, which
may be why the house resolution mentioned in the episode was going to
export the technology around the world, so it can be rapidly deployed
when 'the day' when the aliens expect to take over arrives. Thats the
tough thing with the 'organization' in the X-files, they are colluding,
but they act like they are trying to do what they think is best. That
Krycek was able to control the nanites via what seemed like radio
emissions indicates a level of control over the nanites that would be
useful to immobilize a population rapidly to either inject them all with
the black oil, or to immunize them all against it.

It will be interesting to see how it plays out.

I'm curious.  What keeps me from throwing a mega-nuke at the planet?
              Why can't I use that to defend the comet?

Also, how would you defend against a laser the size of a small moon, or
even a system of mirrors focusing 50x normal solar intensity onto
Earth's surface?  As near as I can tell, the only defense is to prevent
it from being built.

As far as I can tell, the largest mass wins - BUT:
1)  The defender has to keep a living, fragile populace safe.
2)  The attacker has a whole solar system to hide in.
3)  You'd better control the entire mass of the solar system, especially
Earth's core, if you don't want someone to take it away from you.

So there is a very real advantage to the attacker.  It only needs to
control huge amounts of mass temporarily, and doesn't need to make a
clean sweep; military-grade nano can be a lot less fragile than carbon;
and it can launch surprise attacks.

   One should note that this is only true over short time scales. A
   generation that grows up with affluence level X will consider it the
   minimum they can live on, and try to achieve something substantially
   better. Also, a large fraction of society is not satisfied with
   anything less than the mansion - there is a wide diversity of opinion
   over when enough is enough.

People may have higher expectations than their parents, but they're still
affluent.  We are biological beings; there is a level of physical privation
which has been the common fate of agricultural humans, is still common in much
of the world, but which has been left far behind by most of the First World.
There is a difference between not having a mansion and not having enough to
eat.  The urgency of growth to get basic food, shelter, and education 
is less than the urgency of getting the next round of goods.

And I note that if a large fraction of society wants a mansion, then they
won't suffer the disincentives to work you fear from a guaranteed minimal
income.

   This description may fit teachers and scientists. It does not fit
   knowledge workers at all. Most of us don't stop worrying about money 
   until we can afford lots of our favorite techno-toys, which means
   upper-middle class at least.

Teachers and scientists aren't knowledge workers?... At any rate, Galbraith's
broader point was that educated people generally expect to enjoy their job.
Teachers were my extreme case of people who could have done better taking a
low-paying job.  Programmers and executives and others get (and expect) more
money, but they also expect some intellectual engagement with what they're
doing.  If they don't get it, they switch jobs.  They do not toil, not the way
factory workers do.  Thus progressive income taxes fail to tax all the utility
gained from a New Class job.  

   > people happier; most feel more secure from want, and the rich

   > Brazil.

   Isn't Brazil a good argument for rapid growth? Their problem isn't
   large income disparities, its that there are too many people who can't
   afford food.

I was using Brazil simply as an example of what happens when rich people are
surrounded by a lot of people who can't afford food and are inclined to do
something about it.  Whether the people can't afford food because the rich are
monopolizing income or because there isn't enough food to go around (thus
requiring rapid growth), I can't say.

   In more general terms, this analysis ignores the fact that the
   benefits of growth do not end when you have a warm bed and a full
   belly. Wealth can be spent to buy health, and the more wealthy you are
   the more health you can get. No nation on Earth is wealthy enough to
   provide top-notch medical care to everyone, and the best way to solve
   this problem is to grow as fast as possible. Growth won't remove the
   inequality, but it will make everyone better off than they were.

Growth (sustainable) always has benefits.  The analysis did not ignore that.
The analysis did not claim we should stop growing.  The analysis asserts that
the new material benefits are less urgent than the old benefits, and that a
different benefit we can buy is economic security, such as basic, never mind
top-notch, medical care.

   experimented with 'totally regulated' society in various guises. I can
   think of no instance in which anyone has actually tried laissez faire
   - usually they just make speeches about it while enacting more
   regulations.

There's a reason that no one has tried laissez faire, which is that almost no
one wants it.  I quote from Hayek:

  "Above all, it [the market] is a game which serves to elicit from each
  player the highest worthwhile contribution to the common pool from which
  each will win an uncertain share."

But many people now would take a lower growth of the pool in return for a more
certain share.  And they band together or pressure the government for relief
from the vigors of pure competition.  Farmers, manufacturers, workers, the
elderly, the unemployed in time of depression, and more all seek ways partly
to maximize their income, but in large part to make more secure the income
they already have, by means of government action.  

19th century America wasn't laissez faire, but it was closer, and they did
make speeches about it, and it was part of the conventional wisdom, and a lot
of activity went into constructing the classical liberal state, with a lot of
the gov't imposed inefficiencies swept away, and balanced budgest, and stable
currencies.  We grew, and had depressions, and worse depressions, and grew
some more, and had the Great Depression, and finally tried something else,
because 25% of the population was persistently unemployed.

I predict that if any nation in the next 50 years tries something close to
real laissez faire, it will be China in some enlightened despotism mode,
because they have the willingness to shoot protesters.  Democracies find ways
to save people from losing Hayek's game.

Laissez faire might work with a Heinleinian or Randian population, in much the
same way that communism could work with a truly Christian population.  Real
populations will probably be as likely to subvert or frustrate either.

   Also, the 1% idea is completely divorced from reality. Most people
   don't want to work, for the very simple reason that they have other
   things they would rather do. If you make it possible for them to do

Wait, I thought they wanted mansions.  You can't have most people having
higher and higher ideas of what constitutes affluence but also have them go
fishing once the gov't provides them with $8000 income.

The idea isn't to imitate the Culture where all desires are met.  The idea is
to provide, well, a safety net.  Perhaps a negative income tax.  Perhaps just
generous unemployment insurance, between the US and European levels currently.
Certainly not blank medical checks.  Most people will still work for fun, or
for 'luxuries' (more fashionable clothes, better tasting food, bigger houses,
electronic toys, more drugs), or both.  Some won't; we can afford it.

(He also links not trying to run at full employment all the time to avoid
inflation, but I can't recreate that argument now.  Full employment _is_ our
safety net of sorts, these days.)

   Why should we expect future economists to be any better at it than
   those of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries? There has never been a
   time when government simply left the market alone. The governments of
   the 19th and 20th centuries have tried every scheme they could think
   of to prevent recessions and boost economic growth. At this point it
   is clear that such approaches don't work.

We might expect future economists to have learned from the mistakes of their
predecessors, the way the classical liberals learned from the mercantilists
and modern economists feel they learned from the classical liberals.

And what do you mean, approaches don't work?  Since WWII we've traded low
inflation and high frequency, intense depressions for (at best) steady
inflation and milder recessions.  Monetary policy can control inflation;
deficit spending in a depressed economy can restore production.

And again, gov'ts don't leave markets alone largely because people and
businesses don't want to be left alone in it.

  IAN: A black-and-white newspaper photograph is a 
  collection of individual dots, but the collective 
  entity is more the sum of the individuals, since 
  the same dots in any other ordering would not 
  be the collective entity that is "the photo."

  I believe that that situation -- where the whole 
  is greater (has something more) than the sum of 
  the parts -- defines "the collective entity."

  So the question is: Is the photo an illusion?
  If yes, the collective entity is an illusion.
  If no, then the collective entity is real.

I'm guessing it was an accident rate calculation.  Assuming no disease or old
age, but given a certain level of fatal accidents, how long can you expect to
go without accidentally getting squished?

If you have a 1/10,000 rate per year, then you have a 37% chance of living to
10,000, and a 72% change of living to 3338.  With a 2/10000 death rate you
have a 50% chance of living to 3338.  (Those are ages, not years since AD.)

Advanced medicine saves more lives but doesn't help squished brains.  People
might take more risks given the medicine, maintaining the current rate.
Backups would change things a lot.

Would you suggest a list of topics that need to be covered?

It doesn't seem necessary that each of the papers is written or
delivered by an established faculty or celebrity.  Some of the
material touched by them will transfer the legitimacy and PR to others.

Should we try to figure out what a[n online?] >H course may look like,

While most, or all ethical systems do not agree on everything, there are plenty of commonalities among most of them, especially the most successful of them, to imply that there is an inherent objective truth to the shared heuristics, at least as far as the human species is concerned. There may also be a subset of this set which may be objective truth for all thinking beings.

Can you furnish an example of such a "zero-point"?

First of all I don't require that ALL ethical systems share identical heuristics, for the plain fact that some ethical/moral systems are demonstrated to be more successful than others, because they are more 'fit' due to their closer dovetailing with optimal objective morality.

I would also say that there are two types of morals or ethics in any system, proscriptive and prescriptive, which often condition or impose exceptions on the other.  While theft is discouraged, compassion for and sharing resources with those in need is encouraged, for example (or while murder, rape, assault, and battery is discouraged, defending yourself and others from such assaults is encouraged).

This is why ethics or morals are a system of inter-related heuristics, rather than just a few simple rules that are black and white and not related to each other (even though some moral systems try to be that simple). Simplicity does aid in propagation and popular compliance, to a point, but there is a limit to how simple or complex a system can go and remain functional, adaptable, and stable over a long term.

Just because a moral or ethical system is very inter-relational does not make it subjective, it is just complex and abstracted. The Golden Rule, which semantically is very simple and easy to remember and propagate, can only be seen as a generalization over a complex amount of subjective considerations and thus has considerable amount of paradox built into it (i.e. if I'm a masochist, should I hurt others because that is how I want to be treated?) as
has been described on this list in other recent posts, but it is extremely adaptable due to its vagueness as well, thus having long term viability. However, it does accurately define two seemingly objective morals/ethics: being true to the self and being true to others, placing both on an equal/commutative moral or ethical footing. One could argue that putting the second on equal footing with the first tends to serve only to optimize the first, and is
not a sucessful goal in and of itself, which is why systems which emphasize others over the self in any and all situations tend to not be as successful as ones oriented toward the self, but putting the interests of others on a similar footing being only because it is directly beneficial to the self (as Anders has talked about his models which compare cooperators versus individuals practicing "might is right").

Crassus was not born into a high aristocratic family. He began life as
contractor in the construction business, and developed his early fire fighting
technology to fight fires that erupted from time to time on the work site. From
this he founded a fire fighting company (I just saw this in a  documentary on
firefighting on either the History Channel or the Discovery Channel). By the
time he arrives on the scene politically in the big histories (written by
aristocrats and mainly focused on the lives of other aristocrats) he was
already the major land lord in Rome. Eventually he became part of the
Triumverate with Pompey and Ceasar (but was killed at a battle in Persia (as I
recall)) which broke up when Ceasar decided to cross the Rubicon River to march
on Rome to declare himself Emperor (which originated in the term 'imperator',
which was not a political position, but merely a recognition by the troops that
a military leader is smart, blessed by the gods, lucky and has big balls).

> >This is where the term 'Crass commercialism' came from.).

No, its supposedly the real source of the saying. I don't know if it originated
in his era or was merely one of a later era which appreciated classical
histories (much like how the Rubicon is synonymous with difficult fateful
decisions.). Crassus was an up and comer, and was thus seen by his aristocratic
contemporaries as an oaf, a usurper, with plebian tastes and habits. Being
crass denotes the sort of ostentatious displays and rudeness that newly wealthy
people display, as Robin Hansen described when he talked about the study on
signaling/counter signaling. Likewize, his aristocratic contemporary, Pompey,
is the source of the term pompous, presumably because of his stuffy manner.

Unfortunately, with nukes you can only sterilize comparatively tiny
volumina, while globally distributing potential contaminants, the 
updraft pumping dust right into the stratosphere. Andromeda strain 
movie was bull, but at least they have gotten that much straight.

I really don't see any other way of sterilizing Earth by dumping
enough rocks upon it to melt the upper crust (giving plenty of
opportunity for particles to reach escape velocity, a la tectites), 
or introduce a singularity within its volume which grows faster 
than it evaporates.

Ah.  Now comes the interesting stuff.

Nothing keeps you from using a mega-nuke on the planet, of course.  Good
missile defenses can make it a challenge, but a determined attacker is bound
to land one eventually (and this ignores the terrorism problem).  That's why
you either need to move into space, or live very deep underground.

You can put anti-missile systems on the comet, but its hard to protect - one
hit will take it out, and a near miss will take out your defenses.  Add
energy weapons to the equation, and the comet becomes pointless - you're
better off just building a fleet.

The mirror system is no threat - we just tell everyone to stay inside their
diamondoid homes while we blow it up.  Besides, you can hardly build it in
secret.  :-)

Moon-sized weapons are a different ball game - they imply much more advanced
technology.  IMO, you can't build such things unless you have SIs doing the
engineering, in which case who knows what they'll come up with.

If humans are still in charge, then all the mass in the solar system is
likely to be claimed well before such things can be built - which means you
convert the planets into overgrown space fortresses.  We don't have any
energy sources handy that could blow up something that big, so aggressors
would probably be reduced to staging physical invasions - bombard the
surface with mega-nukes, then send in a few billion war bots to try and dig
the defenders out.

Having more mass in a nano-war gives the same kind of advantage as having a
bigger economy does in a conventional war.  That is usually decisive, but
not always.  The Eastern Front in WWII is a good example of this - the
Germans were routinely outnumbered 10:1 or more, with even more lopsided
disparities in heavy equipment, yet they came within spiting distance of
winning.

> 1)  The defender has to keep a living, fragile populace safe.

In the early phase, yes.  By the time you start tossing moons around, expect
virtually everyone to be uploaded, cyborged, distributed, or otherwise
non-fragile.  Of course, you still need to have a secure rear area - but it
could easily be deep underground.

> 2)  The attacker has a whole solar system to hide in.

You can't hide an economy.  Individual units could easily hide in the outer
system, but large-scale nanofacturing will produce huge amounts of waste
heat that would be very visible even at large distances.  Besides, combining
future sensors with even primitive AI would let us build a system capable of
tracking every drive flame and macro-scale spacecraft in the system, which
pretty much rules out hiding large-scale movement.

Absolutely.  You'd also better do constant training and spend heavily on
R&D, because yesterday's defenses are useless tomorrow.

Well, I'll be! Guess I've been reading the wrong history books. Thanks for
the fascinating info on Crassus, Mike. I have to say, though, the
derivations of "crass" and "pompous" you cite do look suspiciously like
folk etymology. "Crassus" is a standard Latin word meaning "thick", "fat",
etc.; it's possible that the word derives ultimately from a family name,
but the reverse seems more likely. "Pomp" and its derivatives, however,
come to us via Latin from a Greek term for a solemn procession.

Are we not to believe that if the gene that predisposes the timeline of 
our life, that there are no other factors? That the elelments 
surrounding us have no effect on encouraging the aging process. To alter 
ourselves internally, still leaves the environment? We will still have

air, stone and clay). We breathe and move in these molecular structures 
daily. We would in a sense be a foreign matter living in a typical and

  IAN: A black-and-white newspaper photograph is a
  collection of individual dots, but the collective
  entity is more the sum of the individuals, since
  the same dots in any other ordering would not
  be the collective entity that is "the photo."

  I believe that that situation -- where the whole
  is greater (has something more) than the sum of
  the parts -- defines "the collective entity."

  So the question is: Is the photo an illusion?
  If yes, the collective entity is an illusion.
  If no, then the collective entity is real.

Dick: The picture is actually in our perception, not on the paper.

Yes, I understand.  My contention is that if you compare the number of lives
saved by even a well-designed welfare system to the number of lives saved by
maximizing growth, you will find that growth wins by a huge margin.  The
reason is that welfare benefits a small (and shrinking) group by  modest
amount, while growth benefits virtually everyone.

In a really poor country there is not enough money to prevent the poor from
occasionally starving, so welfare is impossible.  In a modern country (like
the U.S.) the number of people who can't afford food is so small that you
don't need government to save them.  In a really rich country (with basic AI
/ robotics / nanotech), the idea of people starving would be inconceivable.

Medical services, which are an even bigger life-or-death issue, follow a
similar pattern.  The only difference is that they are more expensive, so no
one has really reached the 'wealthy' stage yet.

Yes, they do.  One of civilization's ongoing challenges is the struggle to
get people to accept enough risk to make progress possible.  In a poor
society most people sensibly refuse to take any risk, since failure often
leads to starvation.  The richer your society becomes, the more feasible
risk-taking (and therefore capitalism) becomes.

America, however, is currently suffering from a pathological fear of any
sort of risk.  This is partly the result of modern medicine and the modern
regulatory state, which together have engendered the hope that life can
somehow be made 100% safe.  The trend has been strengthened, however, by
decades of exposure to the socialist idea that markets are a fraud and rapid
growth is impossible. The end result is a situation where many people will
sacrifice huge future returns to gain tiny immediate benefits, because they
don't believe those returns will ever materialize.  This is certainly a
challenge to current proponents of capitalism, but it is a temporary social
phenomenon rather than a timeless fact of human nature.

It is easy to get this picture of history if you look only at the broad
sweep of events, especially if your textbook was written by believers in big
government.  Pick any specific instance of crisis, whether recession,
depression, or simple monopoly, and you will find a different story in its
details.  Whatever the problem, whatever the age, the government will be in
the middle of it trying to fix things.  There has never been a time when
government just left the economy alone.

Read the economists of the generation after that crisis, and you will find
another interesting fact.  Occasionally they find that the government
intervention helped, but far more often they discover that it only made
things worse.  Frightened officials, under public pressure to 'do
something', simply grasp at whatever strays come easily to hand.  The result
is almost never an improvement.

The simple fact is that no one can predict what an economy will do next
year, and no one can understand an economy anywhere near well enough to
manage its operation.  The best we can do is lay a stable foundation, remove
a few obvious impediments, and hope for the best.

*Sigh* Let me try again:

Over _long_ time spans, each _generation_ wants more than their _parents_.
This doesn't mean that a particular person has infinite wants, or that
everyone is the same.  It does, however, mean that modern welfare
beneficiaries think color TV is a basic necessity of life.

The safety net is not a new idea.  We've been trying it out for several
generations now, and we've got pretty good experimental data to base our
decisions on.  I recommend Charles Murray's "Loosing Ground" if you are
interested in the details.  Based on past experience, however, we can safely
say that:

1) If you have a program that provides anyone who signs up with food,
clothing and a place to live, at least 10% of the population will end up
living on it.

2) If such a program exists, there will be a constant pressure to increase
the benefits and remove any restrictions on who can benefit.

3) There is no such thing as cheap, basic medical care.  If you want
government medical care, even for a minority of the population, you face a
very unpleasant choice.  You can either tell people they are going to die
because you won't pay for a treatment that would save them, or you design a
program that will bankrupt the public treasury.

Putting all of this together, we see that you can't fund a meaningful safety
net at our current level of affluence without taking enough in taxes to
significantly hurt the middle class.  Trying to build a government safety
net reduces growth, increases poverty, and creates large power groups with a
vested interest in maintaining a large social underclass.  Over time the
benefits tend to grow, requiring higher taxes which force more people below
the poverty line.  All you've really done is institutionalize poverty.

The other approach is to lower taxes and maximize growth.  Then most of that
10% will get jobs, and almost everyone will be able to save enough to tide
them over in a crisis.  The remaining needy population would be 1% or less
of the population, which is a small enough group for private charity to
help.  Better yet, growth causes the poor class to shrink while the
philanthropic classes grow, so the problem becomes smaller with time.

Thus, my personal answer to poverty - get rich enough that it doesn't cost
anything significant to deal with it, then let private organizations deal
with it on their own.

Yes definitely. I've got the server space on the ISP I'm starting up. If
you guys want to figure out a good name that corresponds with an available
daomain name, let me know. What does it take to get an *.edu domain name?
For a curriculum, I'd say building an anthology of authors like that
suggested above, with papers on them that have been published as well as
commentary from past mail list archives. We could pull from bibliographies
in books by Damien Broderick, Jim Halperin, Tipler, and others to build up
a 'library'. I think that most of the resources are on the web or
elsewhere, but we need to definitely come up with a course curriculum and
synopsis.

Wow, that IS weird!  But not so fast!

If *Extropian* Jehovah's Witness' knocked on my door, I'd have to

how they reconciled their Extropic and Religious beliefs. What a

Assuming the concept is viable..why quibble with the paltry military
budget?

Paltry? I thought it was 7% of US GDP. Foreign aid is 0.3% or so I
thought. But in the rest of the world, we're used to seeing America
spend money on weapons and suppressing democracy to ensure raw materials
flow to them. The Australian government imitates yours. They let
millions starve while they debate Seinfeld and patent life and
information.

Non-American extropians and Tekno-anarko-socialists like myself look
forward to a world without money. Resource allocation is a different
matter. Money, like nation states, will be for romantics.

As far as it goes, currently, I want to vote for my UN representative,
one vote one person, and I would recommend to him that America be
requested to strip itself of its outrageous offensive capabilities.
After all, they break their own rules, they're not democrats, and they
have forgotten San Fransisco and 1969.

Luckilly nanotechnology will distribute itself. Judging from the track
record, America cannot be trusted to behave ethically. After all, they
sanction judicial murder, are quite happy to have one sixth of their
population living in absolute poverty and do nothing for blacks except
produce more guns. The top 20% of America's population have 80% of their
wealth, in fact it is a far smaller percentage at the very top who
retain most weatlh, most of which is untaxed. Worldwide the top several
hundred billionaires have as much wealth as the bottom half of the
world's population. What do they use it for? Not medical research. If
extropians are waiting for Bill Gates to invest half his money in
lifespan extension, they shouldn't hold their breath. Rupert Murdoch
will try to patent it first.

So how much do American extropians think Geron Corp. will charge for
telomere therapy? How much is an extra twenty to thirty years worth?
Perhaps the American government could manufacture it and distribute it
to other countries by population. That's what I would do.

              agree, the most likely candidates are the ancient prohibitions against murder,
              theft, rape, cheating and lying; yet even in these, exceptions can be found,
              which may be exceptions in some systems but not in others.  Can you furnish an
              example of such a "zero-point"?

              First of all I don't require that ALL ethical systems share identical heuristics
               for the plain fact that some ethical/moral systems are demonstrated to be more
              successful than others, because they are more 'fit' due to their closer
              dovetailing with optimal objective morality.

Hold it right there!  This whole quest for a "zero-point" began for the purpose of attempting to generalize and extrapolate an objective ethical system from such a point of universal agreement.  You are assuming the existence of your goal in order to use it to build the means to attempt to prove such an existence.  This vicious circle has neither an entry nor an exit point, and is instead an exercise in Moebius logic, where what are apparently two different things (two sides of the strip, a "zero-point" and "objective logic") are actually one thing that it is impossible to reach from outside.

              I would also say that there are two types of morals or ethics in any system,
              proscriptive and prescriptive, which often condition or impose exceptions on the
              other.  While theft is discouraged, compassion for and sharing resources with
              those in need is encouraged, for example (or while murder, rape, assault, and
              battery is discouraged, defending yourself and others from such assaults is
              encouraged).

              This is why ethics or morals are a system of inter-related heuristics, rather
              than just a few simple rules that are black and white and not related to each
              other (even though some moral systems try to be that simple). Simplicity does
              aid in propagation and popular compliance, to a point, but there is a limit to
              how simple or complex a system can go and remain functional, adaptable, and
              stable over a long term.

Agreed; but systems by nature are dynamic, responding to the developing particulars of exacerbating and/or extenuating circumstances, and possessing hierarchies of moral imperatives, but with recursive loops of exceptions between them.  One cannot either freeze such a system into objectivity, nor pin it at any "zero-point" to an absolutist wall (two ways of trying to do the same (impossible) thing) without deforming it into something that is not itself any more

              Just because a moral or ethical system is very inter-relational does not make it
              subjective, it is just complex and abstracted. 

There is a difference between complication and complexity, true; but I would maintain that not only are individuals complex, but so are the aggregate of the webs of interrelations between them; thus any efficient/effective ethical system to be applied to these complexities within a greater complexity must of necessity itself be complex.


The Golden Rule, which
              semantically is very simple and easy to remember and propagate, can only be seen
              as a generalization over a complex amount of subjective considerations and thus
              has considerable amount of paradox built into it (i.e. if I'm a masochist,
              should I hurt others because that is how I want to be treated?) as
              has been described on this list in other recent posts, but it is extremely
              adaptable due to its vagueness as well, thus having long term viability. However
               it does accurately define two seemingly objective morals/ethics: being true to
              the self and being true to others, placing both on an equal/commutative moral or
              ethical footing. One could argue that putting the second on equal footing with
              the first tends to serve only to optimize the first, and is
              not a sucessful goal in and of itself, which is why systems which emphasize
              others over the self in any and all situations tend to not be as successful as
              ones oriented toward the self, but putting the interests of others on a similar
              footing being only because it is directly beneficial to the self (as Anders has
              talked about his models which compare cooperators versus individuals practicing
              "might is right").

This is why it only works to the degree that its "fuzziness" obscures the complex paradoxes contained when one attempts a finer-grained perspective upon it.
It's accuracy, therefore, must be a relative one, and cannot lay claim to more precision than the "fuzziness" inherent in it (and which allows it to "work" at all) permits.

This is true for an exponential model, but not for a hyperbolic model
or a discontinuous model. I feel that the discontinuous model is the
most valid.

I didn't say that I intend to protect the earth, I merely saind that I
will not intentionally  harm it. I feel that the singularity is inevitable,
and I feel that we cannot predict its outcome. the outcome is either good or
bad. If bad, a delay is of little worth. If good, a delay is of substantial
harm (specifically, to those who die during the delay.) Since any reasomable
projection that does not include a singularity ends in catastrophe, A "good"
singularity is our best bet.

My preferred SI is a sort of collective consciousness that includes
substantially independent sub-entities, some of which are or derive from humans.
I have no reason to believe that the SI will organize itself this way,
but it's the best chance for individuality.

Yes - but...  I wonder about the outliers.  I don't know anyone who's
hyper-rich, but it looks from the outside like a kind of opiate addiction
that sometimes actually *overwhelms* some of the obvious self-maintenance
routines (think of Howard Hughes).  

And there's another boggle - I don't quite know how to factor it in - due
to each of us currently having only one body to experience stuff through.
Murdoch pere and fils have both been seen lately on TV doing fairly
dangerous things on boats in rough water, playing dangerously with the
other rich kids.  No doubt this is partly advertising and partly Alpha
behaviour, but I imagine it's just a hell of a lot of fun and even when you
could be making another trillion dollars at yr desk sometimes you'd `rather
be sailing'.

Induce a solar nova.
(A series of mirrors around the Sun to reflect energy back in might do
the trick - I think you only need to shunt one-quarter of the output
back in for one second, but I can't remember where I heard the figure.)

Dump enough solar energy on the surface to melt the upper crust.

Stop Earth's rotation (which would release enough energy to melt the
surface directly), or cancel its orbital momentum (and let it fall into
the Sun).  Not sure how to manage that.

Dump some antimatter in.  A Mt. Everest's worth would cancel all the
gravitational energy - the dust would never recoalesce.

Use nano to construct lots of laser-detonated fusion bombs on the ocean
floor, maybe using up most of Earth's deuterium.  The result might leave
a planet but would pulverize the crust.

Let any gray goo loose and if enough of the crust gets caught up in
chemical reactions it will be hot enough to melt lead.

There are all kinds of interesting things you can do if you can
manipulate gravity, but you can't.

Wimpy alternatives:

Block enough solar energy that the planet freezes to Pluto temperatures.
 (Unfreeze at leisure.)  Okay, so the core will stay hot for a while,
big deal.

Dust the planet with something highly radioactive.  Okay, so some
bacteria might survive, big deal.

Old fashioned nuclear war.

I didn't make myself clear. I don't intend to us a few hundred comets:

I'm using nanotech. My impactor will not have the attributes of a comet,
because I'll extract the metals to create a shell, which I will then
paint flat black, lowering the albedo to below that of a carbonaceous chondrite.

That's why I'm starting from the Oort cloud. I'll do all my accelerating out
there, probably on the individual comets, before final assembly.

As a reminder of what all this ia about, I feel that an SI is needed to control
nanotech, and that nanotech without an SI will lead to the destruction of
humanity.

Furthermore, there's a fundamental difference between
the dots on paper we perceive as a photo/picture and
the supposed "collection of humans" some call "society."
That difference lies in the largely fixed relationship
between the dots on one piece of paper, and the very
different kinds of "fluid" relationships (or lack of)
between the individual humans some claim constitute a
"society."

I said:

Hope I can prove you wrong, by having this consveration with you at the Far Edge Party in a mere 200,000 years.  By then, I'll probably have gotten bored with the human form, and gone on to something more capable of flight. :-)

Gina said:

Is this a predesignated party, or hypathetical? His is this new form you dream of concieved in form? Just curiouse, besides, one could always revert back to the primitive and human shape we originated in ,couldn't 
we!

My response:

Its a celebratory party first conceived by Kith Henson, the founder of the L5 Space Society.  His idea, is that  as we expand out into space, it would be much more economical and efficient if we xeroxed oursleves into multiplle copies to explore the galaxy in parallel.  After a couple of hundred thousand years all of our copies and everyone elses copies could hook up at the other end of the Galaxy to celebrate our multiple interpenetrating lives thus far.

Of all things I can think of doing, flying has got to the most blissful and joyful.  So I will probably maximize my oppurtunities for doing that in the future.

And yes!  I imagine I'll definitly try on my human form from time to time - nostalgia sometimes gets the best of me!  :-)

Chris,
Do you have your own web page?
I personaly enjoy nanotech fantasies that involve things like: my own 
planet.  Others could also participate, everyone who has the likeness to 
entertain a specific planet holding a specific scheme, or theme.
On lue of the fact that creating a planet that is adjusted to one 
particular mood, it would be "realistic" to include others with a mutal 
perspective. All those interested could retreat to the planet, and leave 
on a whim to another. There might be something like a criminal planet, a 
spiritual planet, or a life in the fast lane planet. Get it? These are 
the kind of, far reaching but I believe potentially attainable nanotech 
dreams I realize.
Gina
P.S. Is there a web page regarding the party?

Fred,

For arguments sake, how is a collection of people forming a society any different fundamentally than a collection of cells composing your own body?  They do interact in wyas that are highly fluid and dynamic.  And those cells are themselves composed of a large and complex mix of molecules who also interact with each other in highly complex and fluid ways - ways which are still only now beginning to understand.

I therefore see no philosophical reason to speak of 'society' as any less fictious as a single 'human' or single 'cell', both of which could just as easily be seen as fictions in the same way that 'society' is a fiction.

Either everything beyond a collection of atoms is fiction, or Ayn Rand is Wrong - pure and simple.

ok mike, however: the high exo kv that i think you are referring to is the
eris system, and yes, that was tested.  that system had a deployable
umbrella that increased its cross section.  the theoretical models at the
time predicted less than a 50-50 chance of a hit on the target reentry
body.  they fired anyway, direct hit, pop the corks, quickly pack
everything up and go away.  {8^D  to this day i suspect luck was a
big player in that event.

our current system under development, thaad, is 0 for 5.  {8-[
the next test is coming up very soon.  so, altho the dispute is
highly political, there is a lotta difficult science yet to be solved in
making a nonexplosive kill vehicle collide with a hypersonic target
out in the thin air... spike

  IAN: Yet we can draw the same analogy with 
  the "fluid" and non-fixed set of relations 
  that is you by observing that you yourself
  are greater than the sum of your parts, as
  the sum total of the individual elements 
  you're made of I've heard runs around $1.

  The ordering of individuals in a system 
  creates a de facto collective entity, be 
  that entity real or an illusion. The main 
  actor in Adam Smith's "Wealth of Nations" 
  was in fact a collective entity that's
  widely know as "the invisible hand."

brian, since you brough this up:  for years now the seventh day
adventists
have been trying to convert their retired church worker pension program
from a pay-as-you-go to fully funded.  this is an admirable goal for an
organization that predicts the soon end of the world.  {8^D

turns out, the standard actuarial tables have proved quite useless:
the church workers live and live and live, all the while cheerfully
soaking up pension checks.  (my college roommate's grandfather
is a retired sda minister, still going strong at 92.)

there is much debate, but the retired church workers have the following
in common:

1.  the smoking rate is extremely low (probably <1%)
2.  majority vegetarians, probably lower fat diet than average
3.  very large percentage anglo saxon (longer life expectancy)
4.  low alcohol consumption
5.  they live long and prosper  {8^D

as i have stated here before, seventh day adventist is the only
christian sect i know of that has no conflict with the notion of
cryonics (since they do not separate body and soul) and are
very open minded regarding radical life extension techniques
as demonstrated at loma linda university.   the llu medical
ethics board is notoriously open minded.

there was a comment by a jehovahs witness i saw yesterday.
that group also has the notion of soul sleep, but are less open
to medical technology methinks.  witness, are you still out there?
comments?  spike

I find it difficult to count how much of value that could be going to 
interesting project, is taken away, or supported, by the military.
Serving hamburgers and walking dogs can also add up to 7%, but it's
a different 7%.   We could as well count the effort the dogs (or people)
exert chewing.  This effort can't possibly be converted into DNA analysis.

I thought value exchange without value representation (whoever issues it)
is for romantics.   I'll bet a PC against your cow it will never work
in any sufficiently complex society.

Title
  Electrolyzed-reduced water scavenges active
  oxygen species and protects DNA from oxidative damage.
Source
  Biochemical & Biophysical Research Communications.  234(1):269-74, 1997 May
  8.
Abstract
  Active oxygen species or free radicals are considered to cause extensive
  oxidative damage to biological macromolecules, which brings about a variety
  of diseases as well as aging. The ideal scavenger for active oxygen should be
  'active hydrogen'. 'Active hydrogen' can be produced in reduced
  water near the cathode during electrolysis of
  water. Reduced water exhibits high pH, low
  dissolved oxygen (DO), extremely high dissolved molecular hydrogen (DH), and
  extremely negative redox potential (RP) values. Strongly
  electrolyzed-reduced water, as well as
  ascorbic acid, (+)-catechin and tannic acid, completely scavenged O.-2
  produced by the hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase (HX-XOD) system in sodium
  phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity of
  reduced water is stable at 4 degrees C for over a month and
  was not lost even after neutralization, repeated freezing and melting,
  deflation with sonication, vigorous mixing, boiling, repeated filtration, or
  closed autoclaving, but was lost by opened autoclaving or by closed
  autoclaving in the presence of tungsten trioxide which efficiently adsorbs
  active atomic hydrogen. Water bubbled with hydrogen gas
  exhibited low DO, extremely high DH and extremely low RP values, as does
  reduced water, but it has no SOD-like activity. These
  results suggest that the SOD-like activity of reduced water
  is not due to the dissolved molecular hydrogen but due to the dissolved
  atomic hydrogen (active hydrogen). Although SOD accumulated H2O2 when added
  to the HX-XOD system, reduced water decreased the amount of
  H2O2 produced by XOD. Reduced water, as well as catalase and
  ascorbic acid, could directly scavenge H2O2. Reduce water
  suppresses single-strand breakage of DNA b active oxygen species produced by
  the Cu(II)-catalyzed oxidation of ascorbic acid in a dose-dependent manner,
  suggesting that reduced water can scavenge not only O2.- and
  H2O2, but also 1O2 and .OH.

Maybe, some of this curriculum can be offered as paid
workshops before Extropian conferences?

Don't know if any other website is needed.
Why not ExI's? 

Would you envision the School/workshop giving college
credits that could be used towards social/future studies program?
What about the online course?

I know many people coming to the extropian mailing lists and
gatherings, are frustrated because nobody debates the basics
there.  I learned to quickly explain why this is so, but the
need is still there (maybe, extropian list would have more
focused discussions now if its new members were coming through
this School).

Existing Web guides, good as they are, also do not completely
address the problem of introducing basics to a new visitor.
But then, this probably could be worked into >H websites...

Sure. You can certainly help aging on the way by for example
smoking. But wear and tear doesn't seem to be the main *cause* of
aging. Individuals prevented from activity does not live longer than
active individuals. Then again, in the body the borders between the
theories start to fade. One promising possibility is that aging has
something to do with metabolism and the stress response (as suggested
by the methuselah strain of fruit fly and the CR-related research),
which of course means that if you are stressed you will live shorter.

But what about External stresses? We'd have to have that utility foglet 
going before messing with our molecular structure: and blindly assuming 
that beyond us, there will be no effect. Do you feel that molecular 
structures outside of our body, are without interaction with ourselves?

There are interesting effects of external stresses, not always
deleterious (I seem to recall that when London first began to suffer
serious smog, heart problems in certain groups increased while it
decreased in others; the extra nitrous oxide apparently helped
them). Overall, stress is bad for the organism and may activate
opportunistic illnesses beside the other negative effects (e.g. loss
of hippocampal neurons due to corticosteroids). 

However, we don't need utility fog to tinker with our molecular
structure, medicine and genetics can do that reasonably well
already. What we need is a better idea of where to tinker, in what
systems and what genes.

The trouble is, photons diffuse rather than radiate through most of
the sun, and the diffusion time is so large (hundreds of thousands of
years) that you won't get an explosion. Just a heating of the outer
layers that will blow away, until you reach an equilibrium with a
small non-fusioning ball of gas a few million years later or
so. However, all the mirrors would occlude the sun and freeze the
earth.

> Dump enough solar energy on the surface to melt the upper crust.

You would likely need the above mirrors for that, the energy involved
is Dysonesque.

Not sure if that would sterilize the planet.

Hi!

Thank you for your input. I don't have time to begin a major debate on this
and therefore I'll just say that I agree with some of your ideas and
disagree with others. Still, it was an educational experience.

See ya.

Today's Wall Street Journal (January 19, 1998) carries a solid analysis by
George Melloan of the IMF's role in "fixing," actually precipitating, the
events leading Brazilian currency devaluation. He writes, in part:

"Congress succumbed in October and a grateful IMF handed Brazil a $41
billion IMF package. But Brazil went the way of the Asian tigers anyhow....
Brazil still had some $45 billion in October when the IMF proffered its new
credit line and dispatched a $9 billion first tranche. This was supposed to
show the markets that Brazil could easily defend its admirable Real Plan,
which pegged the real to the U.S. dollar but allowed a very gradual
devaluation.

"The markets were not impressed. What's a lousy $54 billion in a global
foreign exchange market that turns over at least $1.5 trillion every day?
The only people who were impressed were Brazilian politicians, for whom $41
billion looked like a lot of money, quite enough for them to go on merrily
spending as if there would be no tomorrow, funding welfare programs and
pork-barrel projects. The markets, instead of looking at the IMF bailout,
were looking at the behavior of the politicians, the swollen Brazilian
budget, its vast and heavily featherbedded public sector and its $300
billion in debt that was compounding rapidly because of the high interest
rates the central bank was using in a vain effort to defend the Real Plan.

"The silence at the Treasury and the IMF last week was surely because those
institutions knew that they had sold Congress a bill of goods. This was not
a time to bluster, but rather a time for damage control. Francisco Lopes,
Brazil's new central banker hired to do the dirty work, had ill-advisedly
declared that the devaluation was consistent with the IMF deal last October.
That must have embarrassed Camdessus and company, who have taken a lot of
flak for promoting those disastrous devaluations in Asia. Mr. Lopes and
Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro Malan were summoned to Washington, perhaps
to try to help Mr. Camdessus, Mr. Rubin and Mr. Summers work out a
better-sounding story.

"But finding a better-sounding story isn't easy. The string of disasters
midwifed by the global money managers since 1997 is reflective not only of
misjudgments but of a fatal flaw in the existing "architecture." ...[A]
president who spends most of his working hours figuring out how to buy votes
with public money is not likely to be very critical of a multilateral agency
that does pretty much the same thing. It subsidizes two very influential
constituencies, international bankers and the profligate politicians who
preside over such places as Russia, Indonesia and Brazil.

"These bankers and politicians got the IMF's number a long time ago. They
knew that institutions, like natural organisms, fight for self-preservation.
The IMF keeps itself in business by winkling money out of rich nations such
as the U.S. and handing it out to the poorer brethren, who usually are poor
because of gross economic mismanagement. In this age in which income
transfers are deeply imbedded in politics, the IMF doesn't lack for clients.

"What is absent is any convincing evidence that this has made the world a
better place. Africa appears to be regressing, despite the billions poured
into it by the IMF, U.S. aid agencies and the World Bank. Asia, acting
partly on IMF and Treasury advice, took a big step backward, in terms of
living standards, with the 1997 devaluations, as did Mexico in 1994. The
Brazilian and Russian governments, living well beyond their means, were
shielded from reality for far too long. The people in such places now must
pay a price and their politicians will blame everyone but themselves,
including Bill Clinton and Michel Camdessus.

"The IMF has proved that it is impossible to get good conduct from
politicians by subsidizing their bad conduct. President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso made himself very popular when he killed hyperinflation and gave his
country a solid currency with the Real Plan. But he didn't follow through by
reforming government itself. Had there been no international safety net
supplied by an act of Congress, he might have seen fit to work harder. There
should have been plenty of evidence around that a monetary policy alone
cannot compensate for governmental indiscipline.

"So it's back to the drawing board for the U.S. Treasury and the IMF. Will
they really come up with some new "architecture" this time, something like
going out of the global management business? Don't count on it."

You need to go back and run the numbers.  The only energy source in the
solar system that puts out enough power to move that much mass is the sun -
and you'd need to capture a significant fraction of its output to do it.
That means mega-scale engineering, which is probably impossible without SI
anyway.

Now, no known technology will allow us to stop such a weapon without landing
on it, building our own motive system, and spending years accelerating it to
change its vector.  However, no known technology will let you assemble it in
secret either.  Moving that much mass will produce fireworks easily visible
for light-years, and it will take years to get anything done.  Everyone you
could threaten will know what you are up to long before the weapon is ready
for use.

Also, by the time you could do something like that many, many other things
will have changed.  Is it really the ultimate, megascale uses of nanotech
that worry you, or do you see more immediate worries?

How to de-goo a planet in 4 easy steps:

Important caveat: I assume you are trying to remove microorganisms and/or
gray goo, and that the target organisms are powered by chemical and/or solar
energy.  That means the bulk of the infection will be a shell a few hundred
meters deep covering the surface of the planet, with smaller inclusions at
greater depths and a drifting population of airborne contaminants.

Step 1 - Preparation
Muster your forces in space.  You need to produce several tons of
antimatter, a few million tons of something highly radioactive with a short
half-life, several thousand heavy orbital weapon platforms armed with nukes
and directed energy weapons, assorted heavy transport systems, and a landing
force of several million nanotech infantry units.

A 'nanotech infantry unit' is build around a tank-sized robotic
nanofabrication facility powered by a nuclear reactor.  It acts as a base,
control system and production facility for a fleet of insect-sized
transports that carry loads of red goo (i.e. smart disassemblers with IFF
capability).  It is also capable of deploying smaller robots to collect raw
materials, and it can replicate by producing its own parts and a crew of
construction robots to assemble them.

Step 2 - Bombardment
First, release the antimatter (in solid form, as dust) into space around the
planet.  With a little planning you can get all of it to land over the
course of a few hours, producing an intense flux of gamma rays that disables
the vast majority of the defenders.  You follow up by dropping the
radioactive dust, which makes the planetary surface very hostile to
nanomachines.  Then move the weapon platforms into place, and start using
burrowing nukes to dig out whatever deep concentrations of defenders are
left - oilfields, volcanic vents, and similar buried energy sources will all
need to be dug out via sustained bombardment.

Step 3 - Invasion
At this point there are bound to be some functional defenders left, but they
are few and scattered.  Drop your landing force in a small area, and it can
mop up there and set up organized replication.  The landing force grows and
spreads across the planet, leaving behind a thin screen of defenders to hold
the ground they've cleared.  The high radiation level gives them a big edge
in replication speed, and the orbital fire support prevents any large
concentrations of goo from re-appearing in the areas they haven't reached
yet.  You should be able to clear the planet in a few weeks.

Step 4 - Maintenance
Since we can never be sure that we got everything, we need to establish a
permanent 'police presence'.  We spend the next few months setting up a
global monitoring system, with its own nanofabricators and large mothballed
reserve forces, so that any small quantity of goo that turns up in the
future can be easily cleaned up.

We also need to terraform the planet to undo all the damage we've caused,
but what the heck.  It shouldn't take more than a few months to make it
habitable again.   :-)

I believe I already explained why this line of reasoning is false. Read the

resembling the integration of cells in a human body.

"Collective entity" seems to involve a contradiction, since a collection of
objects can't itself be a physical object, it exists solely as a concept.
But I suspect we're once again embroiled in more a semantic than a
substantive disagreement here. It all hinges on your definition of
"entity". To me an entity is a "thing", a physical existent that can be
perceived via the senses (or extensions of the senses). Apparently you wish
to include concepts such as sets, relations and systems under the
definition of "entity". But this usage generates confusion, since there are
obvious basic differences between physical things on the one hand and
arrangements of things on the other, and grave errors ensue from failing to
distinguish different categories.

Smith's famous invisible hand - virtually synonymous with the extropian
principle of spontaneous organisation - is the internal organizing
principle of a complex relational nexus. It is not by any stretch of the
imagination a "thing". As evidence that Smith himself had no illusions
about it being an entity in the strict sense, observe that he used the
phrase in a simile ("...as if by an invisible hand") and not as a metaphor
as in common usage nowadays.

____________________________________________________________

Mr. Bishop,

I would very much like to help in the privately funded  project to
industrialize and colonize MARS.  I believe successful industrialization
and colonization of MARS hinges on growth and development of key
technology.  The cable television DISCOVERY CHANNEL featured a
scientific research project currently in progress at NASA.  The NASA
project is TERRY FORMING.  TERRY FORMING is the process of transforming
environmental and atmospheric conditions existing on other planets in
such a way as to make the 
environmental and atmospheric conditions existing on other planets more
earth like.  

I believe the success of TERRY FORMING depends on the growth and
development of NANOTECHNOLOGY as espoused by Dr. K. Eric Drexler, in his
book ENGINES OF CREATION  (Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, Inc. 
Copyright 1986).   Imagine  trillions of replicating atomic scale
assemblers and disassemblers released into the atmosphere of a planet
with a hostile environment. The assemblers and disassemblers are under
control of an atomic scale nano computer.  The assemblers and
disassembers immediately go to work changing poison gases into
appropriate levels of oxygen and nitrogen. 

Mr. Bishop, you state that this privately funded project will deploy
near term technology.  I have a question for anyone on this list that
can answer it.  Why do scientist make such long range forecast in terms
of new scientific discoveries allowing expansion of mankinds
capabilities?

 I read about predictions that it will take 100 or 200 years to
accomplish such and such.  It seems to me that such predictions discount
the incrediable power associated and inherent in each new scientific
discovery. I tend to believe that such long range predictions is a meme
planted inside the scientific community for the purpose of stalling
scientific progress.  

In the book ENGINES OF CREATION by Dr. K. Eric Drexler,  Dr. Drexler
makes long range forecast, but, provides a discussion concerning how
artificial intelligence can greatly accelerate design and engineering. 
I think long range forecast are contradictory to the to the inherent
power of current and expanding technology.

Mr. Bishop, I belief projects such as Industrialization and Colonization
of Mars proposed by The Institute of Atomic-Scale Engineering  will give
the human race something to shoot for, other than shooting at each
other.  I believe public excitement and enthusiasm for The
Industrialization and Colonization of Mars project will promote
scientific progress. 

I believe that Industrialization and Colonization of our Universe will
have to be accomplished by private non-governmental interest.  I believe
scientific progress is so mind boggling that Lawmakers are not able to
govern in new emerging areas in society and culture.  The new emerging
areas in  society and culture are a consequence of scientific
advancments.  

Lawmakers are very confused.  I believe the current DOG FIGHT in the
United States capital  reflects confusion and is counter productive to
scientific progress. The URL below provides more information on this
point:

___________________________________________________________

I tend to agree with the viewpoint of Mr. Den Otter, as posted above. 
On earth, arbitrarily defined geographical boundries will always be the
focal point of border disputes and war.  The earth is too small.  The
mind boggling nature of an infinite universe will promote peace because
it will be more difficult for technical beauracrats to lay down a
precise border as a boundry.  Ocean colonization will provide good
practice to colonize the final frontier of space.

Sincerely,

Mark Gaffney

Sound wisdom, this would make a good political platform.

Actually there is an inexpensive medical plan

1) eat healthier
2) exercise regularly
3) take vitamins/antioxidents
4) get more sleep
5) learn to relax
6) drink large amounts on unclorinated water

I've always thought if T.V.'s were powered only by stationary
bikes/treadmills we would cut medical expenses by 2/3's.

There is no such thing as judicial murder, if you are referring to

Nobody's happy about anyone living in poverty. 


What should we be doing for African Americans? Half my data center

they have the projects) are there, but you wouldn't like the
answer. 

In New York, guns are legal, but they started putting criminals in
jail, and the crime/murder rate plunged. In Chicago, and Washington
D.C, guns are banned, and they are soft on criminals, number 1 and
2 murder rates respectively.

You are assuming the existence of your goal in order to use it to build the means to attempt to prove such an existence.  This vicious circle has neither an entry nor an exit point, and is instead an exercise in Moebius logic, where what are apparently two different things (two sides of the strip, a "zero-point" and "objective logic") are actually one thing that it is impossible to reach from outside.

Please describe the 'vicious cycle' you are referring to. I see none. I recognize the scientific, objective validity of evolution as a phenomenon of the objective universe's physical laws. I postulate that memes or heuristics which optimize evolution are to be considered objective morals or ethics, and I can test this given that game theory modeling consistently shows a net evolutionary benefit to heuristics and the practitioners of said heuristics which are common to many popular ethical systems, which explains why they are so popular, as they are successful competitors in the evolution game.

> Agreed; but systems by nature are dynamic, responding to the developing particulars of exacerbating and/or extenuating circumstances, and possessing hierarchies of moral imperatives, but with recursive loops of exceptions between them.  One cannot either freeze such a system into objectivity, nor pin it at any "zero-point" to an absolutist wall (two ways of trying to do the same (impossible) thing) without deforming it into something that is not itself any more

Not at all. An ethical or moral system may have greater or lesser commonality with an objective morality or ethical system, but the heuristics it does share are the foundations upon which the rest of the relational system is based. Even a system which maintains that the only meaning in the universe is that which we give to it still presupposes one objective set within the understanding of the human species which gives that universe meaning. The meaning we give it is based upon our observation of it and our interpretations of our observations. Just as with hard science, the interpretations of
observation which are the most accurate, consistent, etc eventually are considered physical laws rather than just theories. Theoretical morals or ethics either pan out and are successful memes or are not and die out. The most successful such heuristics thus are the ones which most closely dovetail with an optimum objective morality that optimizes evolution.

Which does not make it subjective. One may say it is subjective merely because the system is too complex for that individual to completely understand the entire system, or to understand how it is pinned to the physical laws of the universe via evolution. My opinion is that the 'subjectivity' gambit is so popular mainly out of pure mental laziness or incapacity (no insult intended).

It is not necessary to be precise to be objective. You are stuck in the 'black and white' meme again. Nor do I deny that there is some subjectivity within the system, but stipulating this does not mean that it is all entirely subjective, with no objective underpinnings. Objectivity and subjectivity can coexist in an ethical or moral system. Subjectivity describes the relationships of complexity and abstraction to the objective core ethics or morals of the system. Its a matter of primary (objective) and secondary or dependent (subjective) relationships to primaries.

Hi...I'm the one -

>comments?  spike

Jehovah's Witnesses do not believe the Bible teaches the existence of an
immaterial/immortal soul. We believe that we are entirely composed of
material found on Earth (adham=Earthling-clay-human in hebrew), and when
(sadly) we die, we are recycled to dirt. Jehovah's Witnesses' position on
life is that we want to prolong it because it is a really cool gift. Kinda
necessary in fact. We want to live forever. We believe that was the original
intention. We will accept any medical procedure or method which has proven
to be beneficial in double blind studies with ONE well publicized exception.
We don't smoke. We don't take non-prescription addictive or hallucinogenic
drugs. We are sexually monagamous. We may drink alcholic beverages in
moderation. We drink coffee. I eat meat in small quantities - personal
choice. I avoid saturated fat -personal choice. I practice CRAN to the
degree my will power allows. I take low dose melatonin, anti-oxidants, and
vitamins/minerals etc. Currently I avoid HG and DHEA because I feel that
more research on dosing/periodicity needs to be done. I exercise both my
body and mind, pursue that which in the long term helps me be happy, and
drop that which makes me unhappy. Jehovah's Witnesses interestingly are a
historical descendant of the Adventist movement. We have not done
statistical studies on mortality within our community. Yet I personally know
very many who have made it well past 90...my wife's grandmother just died at
the age of 94 - many of her relatives of that generation are still alive AND
active. Generally, we take responsibility for those who are aged among us,
and therefore if the aged do go to nursing homes it is because the family is
medically unable to care for their needs properly.

The only currently practiced medical procedure we avoid is blood
transfusion. I do not desire to get into a flame war on this subject. Please
however, do not presume my reasons are apriori irrational. I'm not sensitive
on the subject, I just don't want to be seen to be the cause of controvery
outside the boundary of the discussion space of this list.

  IAN: A stone is an object, and as I understand, 
  it's composed of "a collection of objects" known
  as molecules, atoms, and subatomic entities; which
  directly falsifies your claim that "a collection 
  of objects can't itself be a physical object."

  IAN: Your error of saying physical objects 
  (which are collections of entities) cannot 
  exist seems the gravest and only error here.

  IAN: And the "complex relational nexus"
  is the "collective entity." I think that 
  the case to the contrary is just semantics.

Or computers. However, what would be the productivity losses? I'm sure
with the tv example, the amount per day watched would go down
significantly. How about this: Have a biometric unit attached to the
system. Hook yourself up and let the computer decide how much exercise
you need. Once you have completed that amount on the treadmill or bike,
the tv will operate for 24 hours. Of course, if there are multiple
occupants in the household, you would need to keep the tv in a separate,
retina scanned entry room so that only those who have exercised can
watch....

 As the value of the shares drops below zero, the value of the puts starts
rising at the same rate that the value of the shares drop.
 This probably depends on my implicit assumption that it will be possible
to trade shares whose value is negative. I'm confident that that would be
the most efficient way to handle the unlimited liability. I suspect you are
assuming that trading stops when the share value drops below zero.

 And investing in GM feels different from buying an internet startup before
the IPO. Buying on margin feels different from buying on a purely cash basis.
Selling short feels different from buying. I see a wide range of risks. I
doubt you would give much thought to the possibility that buying the S&P 500
would expose you to a risk greater than your investment.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 (UPI) - Scientists have combined the morning-after
abortion pill and a bio-engineered cold virus to deliver a genetic switch
into the body that can be flipped on to produce therapeutic substances only
when needed. Dr. Bert O'Malley, of Houston's Baylor College of Medicine,
told United Press International the method opens the door to fighting
conditions ranging from cancer to anemia. His experiment produced high
levels of human growth hormone in mice without causing an immune response
that might destroy the virus. His findings are reported in Tuesday's issue
of the Proceedings of the National Academy of sciences.

O'Malley and his team loaded a gutted adenovirus, which usually causes
colds, with a segment of DNA that would activate the growth hormone gene and
a receptor sensitive to the drug mifepristone, commonly known as RU486, the
morning-after pill. After being injected into the body, an extremely low
dose of RU486 - thousands of times smaller than is used to disrupt the
reproductive system - turned on the gene in the infected liver cells,
producing high levels of growth hormone. O'Malley says he chose the growth
hormone gene for the experiment because the protein it makes it is easy to
track in the body. But he says you can pop the gene out and put in any other
DNA segment, such as one that fights cancer or aging.

He plans to try some other proteins this year and hopes to test his
virus-and-switch system on humans by 2000. The human experiments will be
aimed at cancer, targeting agents that limit tumor proliferation or block
blood supply to the cancer. Gene therapy expert Gary Nabel, of Howard Hughes
Medical Institute at the University of Michigan, called O'Malley's
experiment a major advance. In a commentary accompanying the study, he says
he is encouraged by the work, because it can presumably be extended to other
vectors to fight other diseases.

I had written:

of

Ian replies:
  IAN: A stone is an object, and as I understand,
  it's composed of "a collection of objects" known
  as molecules, atoms, and subatomic entities; which
  directly falsifies your claim that "a collection
  of objects can't itself be a physical object."

Perhaps I should've written "mere collection of objects". A stone is
emphatically *not* just a "collection" (a mental grouping or association)
but a coherent whole that responds to changes as a unit. You can kick it,
you can stub your toe on it. You can't kick a mere collection of things,
such as "all the rocks in the universe".

I had written:
>Apparently you wish

>definition of "entity". But this usage generates confusion, since there
are
>obvious basic differences between physical things on the one hand and

to
>distinguish different categories.

Ian responds:
  IAN: Your error of saying physical objects
  (which are collections of entities) cannot
  exist seems the gravest and only error here.

But of course I said nothing of the sort. See above.

Again me:
>Smith's famous invisible hand - virtually synonymous with the extropian
>principle of spontaneous organisation - is the internal organizing
>principle of a complex relational nexus.

And he:
  IAN: And the "complex relational nexus"
  is the "collective entity." I think that
  the case to the contrary is just semantics.

I'll agree to disagree. "Just semantics" discounts the importance of
careful language usage IMO, but have it your way.

My mother was a Jehova Witness. That is, until she died last March,
because she refused a transfusion. The doctors unamamously agreed 4
units of blood would have saved her. Her "brothers" and "sisters" hung
around the hospital like a pack of vultures, making sure she wouldn't
get blood. It was her wish, and we wouldn't violate it, but her
mysticism finally killed her after suffering for 3 weeks in ICU.

Whether "socialism" can be a viable voluntary form of organization all
depends on how you define the parameters.  Certainly, if you define it as a
form of "government" then ipso facto it involves coercion, as most people
define a "government" as an institution that has monopolized the
"legitimate" use of force.

However, even inside an unrestricted "free market," people form voluntary
organizations _all of the time_ wherein "each contributes according to his
ability and each takes according to his needs."  The most common example is
kinship and marriage based communities, i.e., "families,"  but business
organizations, i.e., companies are also clear examples of economic
organizations that are not internally governed by market principles.
Families tend to lean more towards communism (as defined by the Marxist
quote above), while business tend more toward socialism, in that they
allow/tolerate a more uneven distribution of the fruits of the collective
enterprise.  Most people appear to make the calculation that it is
economically efficient to participate in these kinds of organizations, and
they generally do so free of the type of coercion we associate with
government.

Explained from a more theoretical perspective, this is simply an
application of Coase's Theory of the Firm.  Quite simply, Coase's Theory of
the Firm posits that, given the existence of transaction costs and
differing utility curves, there are economic activities that are more
efficiently performed inside the structure of a command economy (rather
than being contracted out on the free market).  Thus, in a "free market"
(where people are free to organize their activities as they will) people
will voluntarily form "command economies" around these bottlenecks to
maximize economic efficiency.  Depending on transaction costs, it can be a
tremendous drag on efficiency to outsource your required inputs.  This is
why companies exist: rather than all economic interaction being a
negotiated transaction between two individuals, sometimes it is more
efficient to have a command economy.  Thus, a small-business owner makes
the calculation that it is more efficient to hire permanent help that she
can order to do any task she needs help with, rather than attempting to
hire temporary help for different individual projects; or a corporation
that manufactures end-use products might also own factories to manufacture
its primary inputs, perhaps because it cannot tolerate the uncertainty
associated with acquiring those inputs on the open market.

To summarize, belief in the efficiency of the "laissez faire" free market
does not require one to eliminate the socialist meme as an appropriate
method of economic organization.  Inefficiencies and differing utility
curves will result in the creation of voluntary organizations in which each
participant agrees to work towards maximizing the good of the whole rather
than their individual good, often in exchange for some reduction of the
risk of sub-par individual economic performance.  Perhaps you are a
risk-tolerant entrepreneur, but there are others who would prefer to join a
corporation or partnership where they share the risks and rewards with
others in exchange for a more predictable income.  This too is "socialism,"
and it appears to work.

It is obviously different from the "Socialism" coercively imposed by a
government, but that's what happens when you bandy about words loaded with
ideological baggage, without stopping to think about what they really mean.
If "voluntary socialism" is defined as "an organization run with an
internal command economy to which the members voluntarily submit," then of
course it has been an economically successful method of organizing
vis-a-vis its competitors.  Just look at Microsoft....

Now, if your ideological meme-set makes you want to define businesses and
families as something other than "socialism" then we've got a whole 'nother
semantic ball of wax around which to engage in a typical Extropian-list
ideological flame-fest....  But many such disagreements, it is rooted in
the fact that people attach different meanings to a meme-symbol like
"socialism."

The issue with regard to collective entities made up of humans is not whether
they exist in some sense.  The question is whether they have sufficient
coherence to entertain cognitive states.  Perhaps it makes sense to say of
some small and purely voluntaristic organizations, such as partnerships or
clubs, that they think, believe, and act (though I think even that usage goes
too far).  But whole societies fail utterly to behave like individuals.

Notwithstanding the incoherence of large social collectives, certain
individuals, for reasons of public choice, find it advantageous to attribute
cognitive states to them.  I like to make light of this with a little joke:
"As a society," the politician said, "I have decided . . . ."

Comparative references to how cells make up bodies or how dots make up a
photograph thus do not resolve the question at hand.  Neither cells nor dots
nor, for that matter, photos, entertain cognitive states.  We individual
humans do,

Smith's "invisible hand" is a metaphor. The utilization
of a metaphor to "explain" some phenomenon, does not
imply the existence of an entity.

Similarly, Thomas Szasz argues (convincingly, in my
opinion) that so-called "mental illness" is a myth.
Szasz explains that the myth arose from using physical
illness as a metaphor in attempting to describe improper
functioning of the mind. See #TL05T: Thomas Szasz and
Slavespeak <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl05t.htm>.

Darn! I just printed out the article and was planning to be first with
it with my "this weeks finds" posting :-) 

(ah, the sinful pleasures of having access to lots of online
journals. Now I got IEEE too! I will never get any work done!)

As the commentary points out, the technique is not completely novel,
it is a combination of several already developed methods. It is
definitely a step in the right direction.

   IAN: When I hit a baseball, all of the (atomic) 
   objects it's a collection of stick together due 
   to the electromagnetic force that holds them 
   together. In the same way, objects like the 
   rocks that compose the earth are held together 
   by the gravitational force. While the electro-
   magnetic force is stronger, the difference is
   only a matter of degree. So the proposition 
   that there is no "entity" connection between
   objects in the universe is manifestly untrue.

   IAN: I've made a crystal clear definition:
   "a 'collective entity' is the ordering of 
   individuals in a system." Clearly, the 
   ordering of objects, from atoms, to  
   amino acids in the DNA chain, to 
   dots in a photograph, define 
   distinct entity-identities
   that are "collective entities."

   Collective entity A = {RDIB}
   Collective entity B = {BIRD}

   The ordering of the same letters yields
   what are two distinct entities. Any who 
   disagree should consider that even the 
   slightest change in the DNA sequence 
   will result in a distinct entity. 

   These entities may or may not be definable 
   as "illusions," but we can measure their 
   existence just as well as we can measure
   the difference between "rdib" and "bird."
   In my book, if it exists then it's real.

The difference between socialism and corporate structure is that: a) the
egalatarian memes of socialism contradict the class strucure, promotion
competition, and compensation inequality of corporate employee structures, b)
socialism is majority tyranny only of members, while a the controlling majority of
voters in a corporation is only the stockholders (and sometimes those that hold a
specific class of stock), while employees have little to no say, unless they are
shareholders. The fact that corporations are usually controlled by investors not
employed by the corporations they are vested in says that a corporation is far
less likely to go down a 'bread and circuses' route so long as the majority of
employees are kept reasonably fat and happy, than in a collective where a majority
of employees can overrule management decisions (witness Microsoft compared to
1970's US auto manufacturers).

I don't dispute Coase, except to say that command economic niches erode away with
faster technological and economic growth, especially when technology helps with
big advances in productivity, at which point his arguments become moot.

Ian summarizes:

<sigh> I haven't said otherwise. We're talking at cross purposes, I'm
afraid. I never claimed that collections, sets, relations, concepts, etc.
are not real, merely that they're not "entities". I've conceded that your
definition of "entity" embraces such mental objects, while stating that my
definition is different. Can we stop flogging a dead horse?

 SCAM ALERT! WARNING! PLEASE READ IMMEDIATELY!

             THIS IS SERIOUS!!!

If you get an envelope from a company called the
"Internal Revenue Service," DO NOT OPEN IT!

This group operates a scam around this time every year.
Their letter claims that you owe them money, which they
will take and use to pay for the operation of essential
functions of the United States government. This is untrue!
The money the IRS collects is used to fund various
inefficient and pointless social engineering projects.

This organization has ties to another shady outfit called
the Social Security Administration, who claim to take money
from your regular paychecks and save it for your retirement.
In truth, the SSA uses the money to pay for the same
misguided make-work projects the IRS helps mastermind.
These scam artists have bilked honest, hard working Americans
out of billions of dollars. Don't be among them!

Please copy this envelope in triplicate according to the
guidelines of the "Paperwork Augmentation Act" of 1999
and then tear up all three of these envelopes a
hundred pieces and send the pieces to the following address:

The original post was about some news release I assume is/will be
online somewhere. The original article, in fulltext, exists at
www.pnas.org but you need a subscription to the journal to get access.


(Apropos my earlier statement about the temptation of online papers
and the fact that I have spent the whole evening printing out texts

You are assuming the existence of your goal in order to use it to build the means to attempt to prove such an existence.  This vicious circle has neither an entry nor an exit point, and is instead an exercise in Moebius logic, where what are apparently two different things (two sides of the strip, a "zero-point" and "objective logic") are actually one thing that it is impossible to reach from outside.

I postulate that memes or heuristics which optimize evolution are to be considered objective morals or ethics, and I can test this given that game theory modeling consistently shows a net evolutionary benefit to heuristics and the practitioners of said heuristics which are common to many popular ethical systems, which explains why they are so popular, as they are successful competitors in the evolution game.

Any moral system which claims to be based upon evolutionary law is not telling the whole story about itself; it is in reality based upon someone's extrapolations from what they believe, based upon their own perspective, are the "lessons" evolutionary theory "teach" us (it had different eugenic lessons to teach the Reich).  The rationale behind such concealment is that otherwise the confusion between biology and axiology would become apparent.  Game theory modeling occurs in an abstract microworld, and as such, its conclusions have limited applicability in our complex environmental/social system, for one of the hallmarks of a complex system is its incompressibility, or the impossibility of faithfully representing it by anything simpler or smaller than itself, unlike, say, the merely complicated jumbo-jet, which may be represented by a schematic.

>> Agreed; but systems by nature are dynamic, responding to the developing particulars of exacerbating and/or extenuating circumstances, and possessing hierarchies of moral imperatives, but with recursive loops of exceptions between them.  One cannot either freeze such a system into objectivity, nor pin it at any "zero-point" to an absolutist wall (two ways of trying to do the same (impossible) thing) without deforming it into something that is not itself any more
>
>Not at all. An ethical or moral system may have greater or lesser commonality with an objective morality or ethical system, but the heuristics it does share are the foundations upon which the rest of the relational system is based. 

This would work fine if there were only two (archetypical duality as an easily knocked over "straw man", but which does not truly represent the existent multiplicity); but with a plethora of moral systems, with so single shared value that can be identified (you are welcome to try), these purported "foundations" simply do not exist.

Even a system which maintains that the only meaning in the universe is that which we give to it still presupposes one objective set within the understanding of the human species which gives that universe meaning. The meaning we give it is based upon our observation of it and our interpretations of our observations.

This would be a reasonable point of agreement if this were the only source of personal meaning, but it is not; personal meaning is based at least as much upon self-observation, and this is subjective and personally unique (as Heidegger said, Dasein is "in each case  mine").

 Just as with hard science, the interpretations of
>observation which are the most accurate, consistent, etc eventually are considered physical laws rather than just theories. Theoretical morals or ethics either pan out and are successful memes or are not and die out. The most successful such heuristics thus are the ones which most closely dovetail with an optimum objective morality that optimizes evolution.

Stubbornness vs. flexibility in a person could not be decided in the absence of also knowing how much insight the person possesses; It is better to perdure in the proper course, and to leave an erroneous one.  This is a single example of the messy complexities inherent in human beings, which do not permit of such abstract and sterile optimizations.

One may say it is subjective merely because the system is too complex for that individual to completely understand the entire system, or to understand how it is pinned to the physical laws of the universe via evolution. My opinion is that the 'subjectivity' gambit is so popular mainly out of pure mental laziness or incapacity (no insult intended).

Nor do I deny that there is some subjectivity within the system, but stipulating this does not mean that it is all entirely subjective, with no objective underpinnings. Objectivity and subjectivity can coexist in an ethical or moral system. Subjectivity describes the relationships of complexity and abstraction to the objective core ethics or morals of the system. Its a matter of primary (objective) and secondary or dependent (subjective) relationships to primaries.

I survived being struck by an automobile as a pedestrian, and refused a
blood transfusion. I lost about 4/5ths of the blood in my body and
recovered.

If I had nanotech I'd do two things relatively soon.

1. Upload.  (thereby making time irrelevant)
2.  Leave.   (so what if it takes a long time to cross interstellar
space...just slow down my "clock-cycle")


Were there others with similiar ideas as mine (it COULD happen) then humanity
would disperse.  A dispersed target is extremely difficult to destroy.

You are correct in that I didn't run the numbers. I'm simply assuming that
I can find 2 million comets with an aggregate mass of two eath masses, and
that if I am willing to use fusion-powered ion engines, I can expend half
the mass of each comet to direct the other half into the same converging
hyperbolic orbit with very low relative velocities. Since each of the million
mass drivers is "small", far away, and directing its energy away from earth,
I assumed that detection from earth was difficult. As it happens, there
are a few minor trivial loose ends on this hare-brained scheme. In particular
I'm not quite sure how to manage the heat generated as the pieces aggregate
into a single mass.

Please note that I don't feel that this is the easiest way to use nanotech
to destroy a human-based civilization. I feel that direct application of
military nanotech gives an overwhelming advantage to the attacker. My
earth-mass impactor simply makes the attacker's advantage more obvious.

Just for fun, let's try an earth-based approach. I think your nano-based
defense model pits the defending naites against the attackers directly?
That is, you need to know that an attack is occurring.
What if I use my attackers to build hundreds or thousands of mega-nukes
at an appropriate depth in the earth's crust? I don't have to burrow the
nukes, I just program the seed nanites to first burrow and then build nukes.
You cannot defend against this unless you are continuously monitoring the
entire target volume: IMO this defense will require an SI.

Ahem.  Referring to this new-fangled data device on my desk (the Concise
Oxford Dictionary), I'm told that 

crass a. Thick, gross

is from

L. crassus solid, thick

(and my Latin dictionary lists both `crassus', as above, and Crassus the
entrepreneur, separately)

while

pomp n. Splendid display

is from

Gk pompe' procession, pomp (pempo' send)

Sorry to spoil a good story.  :)

I just don't trust the Medical Professions use of blood. They get this
stuff for free (in most cases) then charge a lot of money for the
procedure. I think that there are as many unnecessary complications caused
by transfusions as there are lives 'saved'

The military supports a lot of research, much not immediately related to
weapons development.  Particularly math, computing, and physics research.

Galbraith bemoaned the fact that all private production is considered good and
all public production a burden, even when comparing rent-a-cops and schools.
Except that military expenditures are often exempt from the stigma of other
gov't expenses, so a lot of research (which he would like more of, and
non-military) survives under the military umbrella, where it might not
otherwise.

  IAN: That "the invisible hand" is a metaphor 
  also does not mean society does not function
  as a collective entity, so no point is made. 
  In fact, the utility of the metaphor in this
  case exactly expresses the fact that society 
  really does operate as if it were "one hand."

  It's the failure of central planners to perceive
  the social entity, how it communicates with it-
  self (supply/demand pricing) and such, that is 
  why they assume someone needs to plan for it.

Unfortunately, nanotech by itself doesn't enable uploading. Uploading
requires solution to s lot  of other problems. It's a whole lot easier
to implement a humanity-destroying scheme.

Fortunately (at least from my perspective,) an SI will almost certainly
precede nanotech anyway. If not then if I personally can acquire nanotech,
my first project will be an attempt to build an SI by running the best AI
programs on huge nubers of nanotech computers, in a desperate attempt
to protect against nanotech catastrophe.

True...well then.  Reverse the priorities.

Leave first...(work on uploading....maybe not leave too far thereby staying in
communication and benifitting from others work on that.).....then
upload...(after the details are perfected).....then shag ass to points unkown.

Part of the problem is that, in my experience, people spend far more of
their time securing their income than securing a certain share (analogous
to "job security" vs "employment security").  Thoughtful investment of
income (in the broadest sense e.g. educational, monetary, etc.) lowers the
volatility of "share" significantly and should generate larger net growth
over the long run.  However, many people do not have the will to invest
income thoughtfully despite the fact that most people are aware of the
consequences of their actions, although better education in this regard
could certainly help.  The cliche "expenses rise to meet income" expresses
a common symptom of this behavior.  Most cultures implicitly encourage
aspects of share retention behavior, but I think few people fully
comprehend the impact appropriate investment can have on their long term
share retention. 

Maximizing income via government action does not decrease volatility; it
only attempts to increase the mean around which an individual's share
fluctuates.  I think it can easily be argued that such attempts generally
decrease the mean share for an individual.  In any case, I do not see how
this could improve the situation.

I would tend to agree with this.  To apply this to the real world the
initial populations would have to be self-selecting.

With respect to the "minimum income" society concept:

Minimum income societies have been shown to work.  However, there is a very
large problem in implementing this in a real world society, a problem large
enough that the number of such societies is very small.

Implementing an MIS requires a very large income surplus from the moment of
instantiation onward.  This turns out to be an immensely large problem for
two reasons.  First, the initial surplus must be exceed the net income of
the total population by many times to be viable in the long term.  This
requires either aggressive taxation over many decades or the receipt of a
large windfall from a source external to the society.  Every real world MIS
received its instantiation surplus from the latter.  Governments and
politicians almost never demonstrate the discipline required to amass huge
surpluses of cash, particularly over a span of decades.  Such government
amassments are almost always plundered long before maturity.

The second problem is that the floating surplus must be well managed in
perpetuity for the MIS to remain viable.  Again, governments and
politicians have an appallingly poor record in this regard.  The most
successful forms of MIS occur when the floating surplus is managed by
individuals external to the MIS that have a profit motive in seeing the MIS
succeed (e.g. corporate socialism).  This motivates the managers to both
increase the floating surplus and prevent the surplus from being
squandered.  Some minimum income societies have actually demonstrated a net
increase in the minimum income through shrewd management.

It should be noted that minimum income societies have generally been on a
small scale.  Many have failed due to mismanagement.  However, the well
managed minimum income societies have prospered.  In my opinion, this is
the *only* form of socialism that is demonstrably beneficial over the long
term.  However, the price of entry is extremely steep and the "free lunch"
aspect is only maintainable if the floating surplus is continually
increased through intelligent investment.  I do not think the entire world
could do this without crumbling into the classic socialism that we love to
hate; the secret to this model is that individuals external to the society
effectively foot the bill for your free lunch.

  IAN: No. As I see it, central planners don't work
  since the planning that directs the prices and the 
  allocation of all resources requires a mind too
  large for any planner or even group of planners
  to comprehend. It requires too much brain power 
  for anyone to compute. It requires the mass-mind
  of the collective entity that is "the market."
  The invisible hand is the invisible planner.

  I like "invisible" since it runs the fine line 
  between what we're both saying, it is yet isn't!

  IAN: A similar line of reasoning that says 
  a group entity is an illusion is found the 
  Buddhist view that the mind (a group entity) 
  is an illusion, and thus seeing a self in the
  mind is like seeing phantoms in the clouds,
  which I believe to be a truthful analysis.

  IAN: The initial point was that a collective 
  is not an entity as in a "thing," if it's a
  matter of it being a conscious being, that 
  ventures into the deep. Life per se tends
  to display consciousness if we correlate
  consciousness with learning. The process
  of evolution is a learning process, but
  exactly who is learning seems to me to  
  be the same question "exactly who am I?"

  In short, assuming that the mind houses 
  a spirit is the same as assuming a group
  houses a spirit, and yet assuming that a
  mind houses a spirit proves very practical.

The Einstein brain may have functioned a tiny bit differently than other
brains, and close inspection of it has revealed some interesting (although
slight) structural/anatomical differences. Physical neurological
differences in the Einstein brain may have resulted from differences in the
way the brain got used rather than the other way around, in similar fashion
as calloused hands may reflect the way those hands got used rather than that
biology intended them for rough use (the old genotype/phenotype comparison).

Whether we enhance, augment, amplify, intensify, magnify, or otherwise
embellish intelligence, we (intentionally or unintentionally) increase the
capability of the brain which generates that intelligence. The refreshing
death/rebirth experienced by psychedelic experimenters reminds us that
subjective form and objective function converge to activate self-determined
entities -- to make them tick. Understanding true super-intelligence
requires true ultra-intelligence. So, while we may not have the aptitude for
that, we can nevertheless see that intelligence constantly recreates itself
artificially, unless you prefer to think of it as a natural process (in
which case artifice = nature).

Your limited research on enhanced intelligence puts you in good company,
since no one else, including eager educators, has come up with reliable
techniques for recreating Einstein's brain artificially (or any other way).
But these few comments here merely serve to preface what I really want to
ask you: Why do you constrain your question to the type of genius
exemplified by Einstein? Why not include Mohammed, Kabir, Shakespeare,
Beethoven, Socrates, Buddha, Lao Tzu, Krishna, and enlightened masters? Do
they not qualify as critical parts of understanding intelligence?

With a sincere intention to contribute to the integrity of this list, and
not wanting to antagonize anyone, I submit that the Einstein brain and the
Buddha brain have close to identical capabilities. But Buddha died in
blissful Nirvana, while Einstein died disappointed, saying that if he had
his life to live over again, he would have become a plumber instead of a
theoretical physicist. It seems a toss-up to me which engenders more
extropian energy: the cosmically conscious Siddhartha, or the mathematically
gifted Albert. At any rate, ought we not to attempt to understand the
significance of such a powerful technique as meditation (dhyana) in our
search for enhanced intelligence? (Note that I do not here refer to the body
of ritualized superstition known as religion, but rather to scientific
methods of expanding the brain's accurate awareness.)

You've nailed it once again, Anders. Better than understanding what can go
wrong to subvert or prevent SI, an understanding of what it takes for
intelligence to thrive, burgeon, flourish, and grow seems very
appropriate -- even if it means understanding that intelligence drives all
life before it. Likewise, the diligent extropian seeks to understand and
know what past masters have understood and known, the better to exceed it,
if possible. Unless we see the exquisite immensity that Gurdjieff, Krishna,
et al. saw, we cannot know (or imagine) what other mysterious poesy and
profound adventure awaits us. While I feel confident that all the
enlightened masters approve of extropian use of high-technology, it makes me
sad to think that extropians may miss the vision of beauty and verity
directly experienced by buddhas.

Namaste,

Dan Clemmensen wrote of assorted ways to depopulate Earth using nanotech.
I'll reply to his suggestions in another post - I've got a related point to
make here:

I believe I have detected an interesting implicit assumption in your
scenarios, which is common to nanotech doomsday theories but is not at all
realistic.  You seem to assume that your nanotech is controlled by a
computer system that can obey commands like "Go grab 2x10^6 comets from the
Oort cloud, merge them to make a giant projectile, and then smash it into
the Earth."  The computer obligingly does so, with no muss or fuss.

Now, the AI that runs that computer can already do everything an SI could.
It can do millions of man-years worth of engineering, programming, and R&D
in a few weeks (or less).  It can supervise giant construction projects,
deal with unexpected physical obstacles, and generally do anything a human
would do in its place.  The only thing it lacks is self-will.

Do I really need to point out how unlikely that is?  To get this genie
machine you have to figure out how to make a fully sentient AI, then come up
with a way to lobotomize it (presumably by tinkering with its goal system).
Even if that happened, it won't be a week before someone decides to free
one.

Even if the AI can't be made sentient for some reason, this is still an
instant-SI scenario.  "Upload me" isn't any harder a command than the comet
project, after all.  There are several other easy paths to SI as well - you
could build a neural interface and integrate your own mind with the genie
machine's design ability, for example.

If you want to talk about nanotech sans SI, that necessarily means there
aren't any genie machines.  That in turn means that many types of
construction still involve large numbers of people and a lot of money - your
nanofab simply builds whatever designs you can buy for it.  The resulting
world is very different than our own, and it is more unstable, but it isn't
nearly as bad as the one you fear.

To do this you nead to move each comet a long way - about 0.1 LY, if I
remember right.  Ion drives at .01 G will take around 20 years, which is
long enough to make the whole scheme irrelevant.  To do it fast enough to
matter you need to apply a velocity change of several thousand KPS in a
space of a year or less.  The exhaust is going to have to be extremely hot
(otherwise you expend all your mass as fuel), and the drive system will also
have a huge IR signature.  It won't be visible to the naked eye from Earth,
but it will certainly be obvious to even a modest-size early warning system.

It always looks like the attacker has an overwhelming advantage if you gloss
over the details.  Using giant space-based weapons strengthens this effect
because it moves you into an unfamiliar realm where the problems aren't
obvious.  That doesn't many anything has actually changed - its just that
the 'gosh-wow' factor of schemes like this tends to cover up the
vulnerabilities.

A seed nanite can't build a nuke.  You have to import plutonium, tritium,
and other exotic elements, and export a lot of useless matter (probably
several hundred cubic yards for a mega-nuke).  You also need an energy
source, which means running a power line to the surface and putting a
visible power station there.  You also need to figure out how to build such
a device in the first place, and find a source for the raw materials.  The
appropriate depth to place them is less than a mile down, so you also have
to avoid notice from all the other construction projects - if you can do
this, others will be digging underground freeways, factories, bomb shelters,
and who knows what else.

Now you're talking about something similar to the modern problem of
terrorist nukes.  It is possible (in theory) to pull of the project, but in
practice it takes more knowledge, planning and organization that can be
mustered by anyone who would want to do it.  In the long run it might happen
anyway - but I've already said I think we should migrate into space at the
first opportunity.

Now _this_ is something I dealt with last time.  If you take a lot of
lasers, maybe (for nanotech) a solid sphere-surface of hyperefficient
quantum-well lasers, all pointing inward, you can zap a pellet of
deuterium ond it will fuse.  The last time I suggested it on the group,
someone else wrote back that I'd disclosed something he was going to patent.

As for power, there are all kinds of burnables in the Earth; or if not
that, you can use geothermal, the energy differential between one mile
down and ten miles down.  As for getting geotherm set up, I'm sure that
you can build some pretty efficient electrochemical batteries and charge
'em up beforehand.  If you've got a large enough resource base you could
give 'em a small supply of antiprotons.  (Remember the antimatter leak
at Fermilab?  10^12 antiprotons - almost bright enough to see, I think.)

And remember, the best place to find deuterium is in the unoccupied and
already-pretty-noisy oceans.

  IAN: The key word is "intelligence." I believe
  that we can say that the collective "life entity" 
  DOES display intelligence (a symptom of "mind"), 
  since evolution is a process of learning, and 
  artificial-learning systems, such as neutral 
  networks, are considered to be (more or less)
  viable examples of artificial intelligence. So 
  I believe we can say: learning <=> intelligence.

  If so, then we can say that the collective 
  life-entity has a measurable intelligence.
  If we can measure it, then I'd say it exists.

  Moreover, the question arises: "What in the 
  process of the evolution-of-species evolves?" 
  In short, where does this intelligence of the 
  life-entity exist, in individuals or the group?
  If it exists only in the group, then the group
  entity constitutes a viable entity and "mind."

  Do individual members of one species suddenly
  evolve into a member of a new species? NO! So
  the evolution of any one individual member of 
  species-type B into another non-B species = 0.
  Ergo: ONLY THE COLLECTIVE EVOLVES! We've thus
  isolated the learning-intelligence of evolu-
  tion to the collective life-entity, and in
  so doing have measured something major that 
  is ONLY an attribute of the group-entity.


  If we are to contend that the collective is, 
  has, or does nothing more than each individual 
  (thus it can just be erased), then we say that
  there is no process of evolution, just a lot 
  of different individuals. Doing that we've 
  cut ourselves off from real understanding,
  and thus the no-collective-entity theory
  is false and antithetical to knowledge.

An interesting aspect of solar-system engineering is that there is this
tradeoff between power and time.  You can do a lot with little power if
you are willing to take a long time at it.

Moving asteroids and comets around, taking them apart, providing resources
to planetary bodies, can largely be done using solar power and in situ
fusion reactions.  Low-thrust ion rockets or mass drivers take time to
build up delta V but are very efficient.

It should also be possible to exploit the chaotic dynamics of some parts
of the solar system, where very tiny changes can produce big outcomes.
Comets which pass close to the sun or Jupiter are good candidates
for this.

I think Billie Bob "Bubba" Klinton did a good job of exposing the "end
of big government" lie in his State of the People's State address this
week.  Anyone able to watch the entire thing without experiencing a
retching sensation is a more tolerant man than me.

A couple of points:

1)  You have equated the Coasian "firm" with corporations rather than the
broader class of institutions covered by the definition.  In fact, you seem
to be focusing on the narrow set of large "publicly" owned corporations,
rather than the far more common closely-held corporation.

This is just to point out that your arguments are not directed at Coasian
firms in general, but at a very specific subset of such firms.  I still
maintain that many families and businesses constitute working forms of
voluntary socialism.  And I don't even conceed that publicly-held
corporations are not "socialist".

2)  My understanding of the memes of "socialism" appear to be different
than yours.  Your understanding appears to be much more in line with what I
understand to be the memes of "communism."

"Socialism," as I understand it, is much more tolerant of differences in
positions and outcomes -- it is more focused on providing a "safety net" or
minimum floor of economic outcome below which it's members will not fall,
and sometimes providing a minimum starting position from which its members
will compete.  "Communism," as I understand it, is more concerned with
equality of positions and outcomes, rather than minimum floors.  Note that
a "command economy" need not function under either of these memes, some
examples being fascism and state corporatism (although both, admittedly,
are forms of coercive government).

While I was talking about the viability of voluntary "socialism" as a
method of economic organization, note that many successful families, and
some business firms (e.g., even-split partnerships), appear to be heavily
influenced by the communist meme in their distributive outcomes.

Also note how, as I predicted, this discussion is in many ways coming down
to semantics and the ideological baggage associated with the word
"socialism."

This is confusing.  Are you saying that only one-man-one-vote democracies
can be "socialist" and that oligarchies where many do not have the
franchise cannot be "socialist"?  The definition I gave above for
"voluntary socialism" ("an organization run with an internal command
economy to which the members voluntarily submit") makes no distinction
about how command decisions are made.  Even if you narrow this definition
to only include those organizations focused on providing (a) a "safety net"
(my definition of the socialist meme) or (b) equality of outcome (my
impression of your definition of the socialist meme), no mention is made of
how decisions are reached.  Whether these decisions are made by an
enlightened dictator or by universal one-man-one-vote sufferage, they are
still "socialist" economies.

Perhaps you are saying that oligarchic command economies tend to be run
better, as they are better able to control rent-seeking behavior (or at
least limit it to members of the ruling oligarchy)?  That may well be true,
but it doesn't make these institutions any less of a command economy, nor
does it make membership in them any less voluntary.

Ah, but you are ignoring a key point of Coase's analysis.

"Firms" arise not only because of transactions cost inefficiencies (And I
agree with you that technology and economic growth help to reduce these
costs, and thus reduce the size of many firms -- witness the growth of
just-in-time outsourcing of production inputs, as technology has made this
more feasible.  However, until proven, I am skeptical of the claim that
technological progress will at some time render these transaction costs
moot.  To me, that claim appears to be a technophilic meme, rather than
based on any empirical observation).

According to Coase, "firms" also arise, as I explained in my first post,
due to differing utility curves, the specific example I gave being
risk-tolerance.  Many people are risk-adverse and will quite willingly join
a command economy in order to reduce the risk of catastrophic failure.
Joining a Coasian "firm" can be seen in many ways as the same decision as
buying insurance.  As has been pointed out in a parallel thread,
catastrophic economic failure is often defined by people in relative terms
(i.e., in comparision to one's peers) rather than in absolute terms (i.e.,
whether survival requirements can be met).  The subset of the population
with this level of risk-aversion is therefore likely to join a command
economy that provides them with this insurance, regardless of the level of
technological progress.

Of course, anyone is free to junk the Coasian analysis as a meme-set that
they don't agree with, and to adopt another meme-set.

It might work for the trigger, if you can make it small enough.  That would
remove the need for plutonium, but you still need a very large amount of
deuterium and/or tritium to get a large explosion.

You can't burn anything 1,000 meters down - no oxygen, right?  Antimatter
reactors are possible, but would have to be rather large (you need to absorb
the gamma radiation to capture the energy, and that takes a lot of matter).
Conventional batteries don't hold enough power to dig themselves down to a
deep construction site.  IMO, your best bet is actually to drop a power line
from the surface - you'll need a small pipeline to move material in and out
of the worksite anyway.  Failing that, build a burrowing robot with a
nuclear reactor.  Either way, however, you need something much bigger than a
pack of nanobots.

> And remember, the best place to find deuterium is in the

True enough - but to make gigaton-range weapons you need *tons* of the
stuff, and probably tritium as well.  Even then, you need several dozen
bombs to do a good job of wrecking the world (or hundreds, if diamondoid
buildings are common).  Its hard to collect that much without making it
obvious what you're up to - either your robots end up hot enough to show up
on orbital surveillance, or you end up with a lot of gigantic,
heavily-shielded vehicles that the neighbors are going to wonder about.

Now, all of this is not to say that it can't be done.  It just can't be done
by diffuse, nearly-undetectable swarms of nanobots.  You need macro-scale
machines for a lot of essential roles, and macro-scale machinery is hard to
hide.

You own implicit assumption which I find weak is that there needs to be an AI to
run this system. The thing with nanotech is that you can give the little buggers
simple instructions to fulfill, and when done, die. You also assume that if
there were an AI, that it would, could, or couldn't be restricted from,
developing enough independence to prevent the mad plot to blast the planet.
Computers are, despite their power, amazingly stupid devices when they don't
have good software. Even the smartest ones can easily be programmed to take no
initiative (or, rather, just don't program it to take initiative).

A missing factor in these blast calculations is seismic. Get enough impacts
going at once and the shock waves will turn the entire lithosphere (the crust)
of the planet to lava. Diamonds burn just fine at such temperatures.... We know
that this is an effective strategy because the Alvarez asteroid which killed the
dinos created a shock wave that went around the planet and focused in the middle
of the Indian Ocean (where the island which is now India was at the time) and
turned the area which is now the Deccan plateau to lava....

I would say that 20 asteroids or comets about 20 miles in diameter impacting at
once in a dodecahedral pattern would do the trick...

That's interesting.  I wonder if you could expound upon that just a little?

I ask because I recently read a book (Science Fiction...but supposedly based
on science) which had as part of it's premise that the dinosaurs were NOT
wiped out by an asteroid but rather by multiple and extreme volcanic eruptions
in India.

I'd never heard that before nor what you've just mentioned....but they
apparently might tie together.

To blow up a planet?  Okay, I'll accept that.  But what about
bootstrapping?  I waft in a dust particle from space, a few nanobots
onto the surface of the ocean; they build more nanobots and drop to the
bottom; then they reproduce a few times and build a few bombs.  As for
power, nanobots float to the top, absorb solar radiation, sink back
down.  If that's necessary at all, of which I'm not convinced.

As for hiding the macro-scale machinery you say I'll need at some point,
I'll bet I can give it the same visual, radar, sonar, etc.
characteristics as rock.

One thing is for sure; if you want an active defense against that, you'd
better be prepared to sterilize the oceans.

A large theme of Galbraith's which I did not go into was the significance of
advertising.  However, he is not one of those who thinks that advertising by
itself warps society and makes the market model irrelevant, that it's a
puissant form of mind control.  Rather, the fact that ads work at all (at
least for demand creation; market share competition is a different matter)
indicates that most people have, literally, more money than they know what to
do with.  The hungry, homeless, and ambitious (whether for a mansion or an
early retirement) have no need to be told what they want.

(And not to say that there aren't more useful things we think they could be
doing with their money.  But _they_ don't know what to do with it, so
persuasion by repeated suggestion works.)

He does think that once this process of demand creation starts then 
market analysis moves to shaky ground, when production is satisfying the wants
production has created, but I don't go there now.

I note that Alaska seems to be trying: putting oil money into a trust fund
whose dividends go to the citizens of the state.  The dividend's about $1000
dollars, so we're not talking good survival money yet, but I'd think the fund
big enough to be tempting.  I suppose the real test will be when the oil runs
out: raise taxes, or plunder the fund?  They'll have to modify the consitution
as far as I know, so the people should get some chance to choose.

And I think Norway's done a decent job of using its oil money for high social
investment.  Better than the gulf states.

As you say, the examples are few.  And small.  (Also cold.  I keep wondering
about that.)

But you seem to be saying that there have been a lot more attempts/instances
than I knew of.  Can you give more examples?

How so?  By buying the oil?  By providing growth your small country's
investments can skim?

Indeed.  Galbraith notes the risk-avoiding nature of the corporation.  Limited
liability, large size, ability to diversify, ability to replace its
components... if businesses appeal for gov't protection less than individuals,
that's one reason why.

This looks feasible. It protects you from an accitental nano-catastrophe, and
from human-designed malicious nanotech. It won't protect you from an SI that
is determined to get you, but neither will anything else, except becoming
your own personal SI. You now have to hope that you can acquire competent
nanotech and implement your plan after it's invented but before the
catastrophe. Do you have a strategy for that?

 Your fundamental point is completely correct and we are in violent
agreement: I feel that nanotech without SI is essentially impossible.
   please see:
 http://bobo.shirenet.com/~dgc/singularity/singularity.htm
which I wrote in 1996.

I thought that you had made an assumption of nanotech without SI.
If you agree that nanotech->SI, then why discuss attack and defense?

I picked the Oort scenario because I felt that it was in range of a
non-sentient altorithm that cou8ld be devised by a human. In my opinion,
it's a great deal simpler than an upload. The high-level spec incudes:
  -- find comets.
  -- segregate metals and carbon
  -- compute balistics
  -- construct shells
  -- construct simple (!) machinery (fusion reastors, mass drivers, etc.)

Plus a few trivial details :-)

 Which seems to imply that their incentives are less important, and that
the incentives on other people are what should control the choice of how
much government to have.
 But I question whether "shirking" is a good description of what we need
incentives for. Many people are willing to work hard at something, but
without the feedback of a good incentive structure, they will fail to
choose tasks that are of much value to consumers. Look at a random sampling
of freeware on the web (rather than the most successfull examples) and I
think you'll find a lot of people who worked hard at producing something
others would use, and who failed because they didn't measure the needs of
users adequately. Or look at people who design tax shelters, working hard
to produce something society shouldn't need.

 While it appears that at least in the short term there is a tradeoff between
growth and economic safety, you should think about the long-term safety
of a country that slows its growth enough that it can't compete militarily
with countries that maximise their growth. Even if such fast growth economies
are peacefull, there's plenty of ways that they can diminish the economic
safety the slow growth was supposed to buy (e.g. causing the most productive
members of the slow growth society to emigrate, making the technologies
used in the slow growth countries obsolete).

 Viewing the drag on the economy as a single variable that can be set where
we want it obscures the biggest problems with government's influence on the
economy. Suppose we assume that income taxes as they existed 5 years ago were
imposing a uniform 1% penalty on economic activity. Then assume that the
desire to protect this income motivates some government employees to hint
that they will harrass companies who implement ways to transmit money
electronically that are harder for the government to trace than credit cards.
How would you quantify the harm it does by increasing the costs of starting
a small business on the web (not to mention the secondary effects of the
resulting more-centralized-than-optimum concentrations of power)? Or by
preventing the development of an easy to use system for electronic commerce?

  I'm sure there will be economists who have learned from the mistakes of
central banks, but the process by which central bankers get their jobs
has not shown a clear tendency to select for that kind of person.

 One could just as easily claim that the milder recessions have been caused
by more informed private economic actors, technological improvements which
improve inventory management, etc., and that the only trade that got made
was low inflation for high inflation.
 I suspect that even if you can demonstrate that government monetary policy
works better than, say, the gold standard did, you would have trouble
arguing that it works better than competing privately issued fiat currencies.

 True, but this doesn't distinguish between people who want programs that
benefit society and special interests who want to use government to transfer
money from the politically weak to themselves.

In the State of the Union Address, Clinton suggested that
some quantitative projections:

- number of elderly Americans set to double by 2030
- Social Security trust fund will be exhausted by 2032
- total budget surplus in the next 15 years will be 4 trillion dollars
- the proposed investment plan of 60% of the budget surplus will keep
   Social Security sound for 55 years. 

These figures should be based on careful models of economic growth,
inflation rates, longevity, and other related factors for the next
15-30-55 years.

I wonder if these estimates are published.
I would be particularly interested in seeing the estimates for
the error margins in these forecasts...  (If this is at least an
attempt to produce serious statistics, the data of this scale and
importance should be backed up _very_ carefully).

Is the U.S. government, the ultimated legal entity in the country,
responsible to any degree for its statements?  I.e., would anybody
there suffer if these projections appear to be complete bogus?

I would find it more likely that there will be no budget surplus
in the next 15 years, the next 30 years will see dramatic changes
in demographic patterns because of changes in global economy and
health-related sciences, and that Social Security, U.S.A, and
American dollar will not exist in their current form in 55 years.
I am not sure humans will exist in their current form at that time,
either, but being a responsible person, I would not make forecasts
with a large margin of error  :-)

Apparently, at least one of these two forecasts is seriously
delusionary.   Which one(s), do you think?  And more importantly:
does it matter?

When the government still has to borrow more than $100 Billion a year,
there is no budget surplus.  It is a lie propogated by the statists. 
The sad thing is that most American's buy the fact that there is a
surplus, and yet they don't demand their "over-taxed" dollars back. 
We are certainly a country of sheeple.

Yes, they (the asteroid strike and the eruptions) date concurrently, and according
to my cousin the geologist as well as a documentary I saw on the Discovery
channel, the stress fractures from the shock wave can be found on both sides of
the planet, and simulations run on  computers show that eruptions on the opposite
side of the planet would occur with such a large strike.

Obviously, wasteful spending and mismanagment of tax dollars occurs. 
However, a lot of good honest hard working men and women work in all
areas of the United States Federal Government. These honest hard working
men and women are very skilled in budget and finance and are doing an
excellent job managing tax dollars to keep America strong.  Despite all
faults and flaws, the American system of Government is a model system
that has withstood the test of time.

Seriously delusional, one of the unnamed assumptions would be that
this would mean a republican house and senate for the duration of
the prediction. One democratic version would wipe this all out.

As the population ages, immigration will increase.

And has been pointed out, there is no real surplus, its just
politically correct economics.

Let's stick with the same example: "Computer, go gather two million comets
from the Oort cloud, make a giant projectile out of them, and smash it into
the Earth."  What does the computer have to do to carry out that order?

Well, first it has to figure out how to do the job.  That means inventing a
whole range of spacecraft, construction robots (nanoscale or otherwise),
power systems, giant propulsion systems, etc.  Then it has to co-ordinate
all the work - so we add in a system-spanning communication system, all
kinds of sensors, and a huge computer network.  Oh, lets not forget - it has
to program all those robotic gadgets, plus the computers that will
coordinate their work.

Then it builds the initial seed and sends it on its way - oh, wait, we also
need to invent an Earth-based launch system and figure out where to aim it
(better build some astronomy gear).  When the seed finally arrives on site
it starts building - and unexpected things happen (the unexpected *always*
happens on construction projects).  So the software running the project
needs to be smart enough to adapt to unforeseen problems, inventing
solutions along the way to its goal.

Add it all up, and you have a system that has all the intelligence of a
human engineering & construction team.  It can do pretty much anything a
human could, but millions of times faster.  It doesn't really matter how it
works internally - it could be an algorithmic AI, a giant neural net, an
ecosphere of evolving programs, or a mixlplic of quasitronic gimrods.  From
the outside, the effect is the same as having a lobotomized SI.

I make no assumptions about the nature of the AI - I just pointed out that
if it already does everything a sentient can do *except* take action of its
own volition, it won't be long before someone adds that last missing piece
to their copy of the program.  I do think that you would have to invent a
fully sentient AI before you could figure out how to make one that can act
sentient without having a sense of self, but that isn't central to the
argument.

Sorry, no.  That's a fantasy.  It takes around 10^18 calories to melt one
cubic kilometer of rock.  Your asteroids carry about 10^21 cal apiece, so
the whole flock could melt 20,000 cubic km - which is less than their own
combined volume of 81,000 cubic km, and insignificant on the scale of a
planet.  In practice most of the energy gets dispersed over a large area in
the form of flash, shock wave, flying debris, and so on, so the actual
melting effect is even smaller.

Shame, shame.  The existence of a few good people working for the
federal government does not in the least diminish it's evilness.

That might work, depending on how alert your neighbors are.  Certainly, the
initial dust would be hard to spot.  Once you start building bombs you get a
lot more detectable - you need macro-scale equipment to separate deutrium
from sea water, and probably particle accelerators to make tritium, and the
bombs themselves are pretty big.  The whole operation will eat up a lot of
power, and there isn't much to work with down there - again, no free oxygen.
Nuclear power would work, or a really big swarm of your solar collectors.

Hiding all this activity is a bit iffy.  The problem is you're burning lots
of power in an environment that doesn't contain any large, random energy
sources.  A good sensor network will spot you through indirect environmental
effects - your operation will have a measurable effect on ocean currents,
surface temperatures, local wildlife populations, water chemistry, and
probably all kinds of other things I haven't thought of.

No, you just need an early warning system.  Populate it with small (mm of
smaller) chemical sensor platforms (capable of recognizing nanobots), with a
network of larger bots operating as control & communication centers.  You
won't catch everything, but you should spot a growing swarm before it gets
big enough to be a real threat.

Well, depends on what you mean by nanotech.  I could see humans building an
assembler, and using it to make diamondoid parts.  With a large investment
of engineering effort I could see using nanotech for drug manufacture,
making novel materials, building computer chips and micromachines, and a lot
of other useful stuff.  If you posit some advances in automated engineering
and non-sentient AI, I could even see some of the more advanced stuff being
possible.

The big difference is that without SI, each individual thing you want to
make is going to take a lot of human effort to design.  A diamondoid shovel
is no big deal, but a robot that builds nukes would take a
multibillion-dollar research project.  That's one of the more likely
scenarios I see - a gradual transition from modern engineering limitations
to genie machines, with design costs for advanced products falling from
billions of dollars to nothing.

I would expect intelligence enhancement, uploading, sentient AI and cheap
space travel to all be developed during this transition period.  I also
expect to see a lot of military nanotech - but it will be nanotech with a
price tag, which makes it look more like an arms race than a sudden
cataclysm.

Now, an obvious question is how long the transition will take.  I can see
arguments for anything from a few decades to a few minutes - it all depends
on how hard AI and IE turn out to be, which isn't something we can predict
in advance.

Just because you have the ability to work with individual atoms doesn't mean
that you want to do everything that way.  There are two common situations
where a different approach is needed.

First, you often need abilities that can't be built into a nanoscale device.
Nuclear power is one good example - a nuclear reactor has to be big enough
to capture its own radiation output, or you don't get any energy out of it.

Second, it is often more efficient to use larger machines.  If you want to
move a  ton of matter from point A to point B, a truck is a lot more
efficient than a horde of nanobots.

Real nanotech won't use nanobots for everything.  It will use a combination
of normal and molecular manufacturing techniques to build whatever tools are
best suited to the job at hand, whether nano-, micro-, macro- or megascale.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

On Wednesday I saw Ray Kurzweil give a short talk promoting "The
Age of Spiritual Machines" at Stacey's in downtown San Francisco.
He spoke of the usual stuff (superintelligences, uploading, nanotech)
and made a few interesting claims/points.
 
* He graphed the speed of computing devices from 1900 to present, and
  claimed that computing speed is not only increasing exponentially,
  but that the rate at which computing speed is increasing is
  increasing exponentially (the graph on a log scale curves upwards).
 
* He talked about how exponential advances seem small at first, then
  explode.  He illustrated this with the old tale about a chess
  master who was granted a wish by a king and asked for one grain
  of rice on the first square of the chess board, two on the second,
  four on the third...  The king (assuming an ignorance of math I
  guess) would not have worried until about halfway through the
  board.  Shortly thereafter, the king would be bankrupt or the
  chess master would be beheaded.  Kurzweil claimed that we are at
  a similar midpoint with regards to computers -- fairly quietly
  they have become an integral part of human society, and will soon
  radically alter it.
 
* He implied that any philosophical debate over whether machines can
  be truly intelligent will be rendered irrelevant by intelligent
  machines.  They will claim to be intelligent, and humans will
  accept that the computers are intelligent because their intelligence
  will be so compelling.
 
The audience was either already well informed or just took all of this in
stride.  The questions were very predictable, but not stupid, e.g.
 
(questions and answers completely from memory and very possibly
inaccurate)
 
Q: What about physical barriers to making silicon wafer based technology
   faster?
A: 3D chips, nanotech
 
Q: What about biotech?
A: We're entering a golden age of bioengineering, but long term computers  
   will have a far more profound effect.
 
Q: I work with technology every day and love it, but I love humans too.  I 
   don't understand why anyone would want to upload.
A: One wouldn't give up any humanity by uploading.  One could experience 
   anything a human does now and much more, at higher fidelity.
 
Q: Aren't you forgetting that AI is considered a failure and there are
   many fundamental philosophical issues to be resolved? 
A: Hardcoded rule based systems haven't lived up to early claims, though
   they have proved incredibly useful in expert systems.  Nueral
   net systems that can be trained and learn themselves are the
   way to go.  We know machines can be intelligent -- the human
   brain is a machine.
 
Q: I understand that computers will be smart and can ape human artists,
   but will they ever be creative?  Will they ever create radical 
   new movements and art, like Picasso and de Kooning?
A: Much of human creativity involves drawing connections between
   previously unconnected elements/ideas.  Computers will be able 
   to do this quite well.  There are already some examples.
   
I forgot the examples.  I think a much stronger argument can be 
made in response to the question of creativity.  First, attributing
the creativity of a few masters to humanity and vice versa gives
both far too much credit.  Second, if creativity involves making 
unforseen connections (I haven't read much about creativity) then
computers will surely seem incredibly creative.  Once computers
have some basic creative abilities, they will be able to generate
new and far more wildly unforseen connections than any human ever
could.  It's likely that mere human artists will be aping computer
artists rather than the other way around, assuming there is an
extended period of coexistence.

Overall I thought Kurzweil presented his ideas very reasonably.
No hint of 'gee whiz'.  I still haven't looked at "The Age of
Spiritual Machines", and probably won't (my backlog is way too big),
but based on the talk I saw I'd recommend the book to someone
unfamiliar with but interested in the subject.
 
 
---
 
 
I heard one other point the other day that isn't worth posting in a
separate message, but may be useful or heartening to someone, so...
 
I'm taking a video class with some coworkers taught by John Searle.
Fortunately we've gotten past his Chinese Room blather, and he's
now talking about establishing a 'science of consciousness'.  His
claim: the human (physical) brain gives rise to consciousness.
Nothing amazing there.  The interesting thing is that he claimed
that a century ago there were intense debates about whether life
could have a purely biological foundation.  Many postulated that
for a thing to be alive it needed a mystical 'life force', which
the mechanics of biology would never suffice to produce.  Very
similar to current beliefs held by many that conciousness cannot
be explained by the purely physical and requires some kind of
spiritual component, if not in so many words.  Now it's pretty much
universally accepted that life has a biological basis.  Searle
contends that once we understand more about how the brain works,
it will become more or less universally accepted that conciousness
has a biological basis and arguments to the contrary will be just
as unknown and seem just as quaint as arguments about 'life force'
seem to us now.  There is hope.

I have a scrap of yellow sticky stuck to the plastic pocket in my wallet 
containing  my Driver's license.  It hides only the license number, so I 
can show my license without thinking about it about what someone might be 
looking for.  Usually people want to see the DOB or address, (which I don't 
mind) or the fact of the license itself.  When someone says "I need to see 
the license number", I get the opportunity to decide whether to refuse to 
show it.

There was enough outcry about this that the proposal has been put on hold.  
Notice that this is not the same as cancelled, but the states are not 
currently being coerced to comply with this plan.

Hans Moravec has been making the same point in recent years. I haven't seen
his new book, but a couple of years ago he showed me a graph from the book
in progress clearly making this point. The acceleration is acclerating.
Tighten your safety belts!

Yes, in his book, Kurzweil makes this point very strongly.

His book has plenty of excellent examples. He gives a URL for downloading
his own poetry-writing program (RKCP) that does a fine job of emulating
various styles. You can get that from www.kurzweiltech.com  Here's a great
Haiku that his software came up with:

Crazy moon child

I finished the book a couple of days ago and highly recommend it. It is not
a comprehensive overview of all things transhumanist, but does an excellent
job from the computational aspect.

Onward!

Well, let's point out that the benefits of the corporate form are benefits
confered by governments, so in effect, the government has already provided
certain protections to orgainzations operating under the corporate form.

In particular, the benefits of stockholder limited liability and status as
a distinct legal entity are confered by government/legislative fiat --
there is no guarantee such benefits would exist/be protected in a
non-statist polycentric legal regime.  This point is often overlooked in
people's analyses of how things would work in a PPL society.

And, _off of the top of my head without deep analysis_, the coercive
imposition against all potential claimholders of limited liabilty
protection for stockholders does seem to be an actual market-enhancing
benefit provided by coercive governments.  It is not at all clear to me
that a potential tort-victim (as opposed to a contract partner) would
voluntarily agree to limit his potential claim for injuries in such a
manner (perhaps he would from a Rawls-ian "original position," but that
line of argument is by no means universally accepted, and I won't go into
it here).  Yet without such limits, capital-owners would be _far_ more
hesitant in making investments over which they have minimal management
control.  (Would you invest in Microsoft if Netscape could come after your
entire personal net worth for Bill Gates' alleged tortious competition?
Replace with Bhopal if you don't think that business torts would be
protected under a PPL system)  There appear to be market-enhancing
externalities that result from coercively facilitating the formation of the
aggregations of capital we call corporations.  Of course, perhaps the
market would be more efficient if we had fewer of these organizations and
tort-victims had more opportunites to be fully compensated under an
unlimited liability regime?

(Not that I am implying that I agree with the statement that corporations
petition for less government protection than individuals.  I suspect that
they petition more than individuals, because corporations tend have larger
economic interests than individuals, and therefore tend to be in a better
position to afford the high costs of rent-seeking and to better profit from
the protection they recieve.  Not to mention such distortions like the fact
that it is far easier for a corporation to sucessfully deduct the cost of
petitioning the government as a business expense than it is for an
individual.)

Yes,

One of the reasons PPL society appeals to certain people is precisely for this
reason. Corporations would not be as able to externalize costs as much as they
do under the current regeime, which is why environmental, social, labor and
civil rights externalizations which are commonplace today and require high cost
tortious class actions to combat (which have a low average liklihood of being
settled in a manner that adequately compensates for the victims of such
externalizations, even when the actual victims are compensated) would not be as
possible if investors were more leery of  investing in corporations which had
histories of acting in such ways. A PPL society forces corporations to be good
corporate citizens purely due to market pressure (the invisible hand again),
which will not require governmental fiat or even a fraction of the current
level of civil tort load as we see today. Corporations which are thus enticed
by the capital markets to behave will need no protection from their victims by
a monopoly jurisdiction like a government.

While illegal acts by corporate officers, etc are sufficient to pierce the
corporate veil, there are plenty of completely legal practices that externalize
costs in ways that are merely burdensome or mere regulatory violations which do
not rise to the level of being useful for piercing the veil. Expanding the risk
to shareholders will sufficiently transfer risk to the capital market to act as
a deterrent against tortious behavior.

Market enhancing for who? It enhances the profit of the suppliers to the
capital markets, but it costs the customers and employees of the corporations
which borrow on the capital markets....its passing the buck downward.

True, but they do not merely petition for more protection from their own
actions, they petition for special treatment and compensation, and it happens
behind closed doors with the people who make the laws, while us merehums have
to take it in the backsides first and contest it after the fact in the courts.

The "Social Security trust fund" is bullshit.  The government is
required by law to invest the money in Treasury bonds.  In other words,
the government loans Social Security income to itself and spends it. 
There ain't nothing in the trust fund but a little note reading "I.O.U.
$30 trillion - the Feds".

Problem.  He claims computer doubling is now once a year, and also makes
noises about what computers will be like in 2050.  Possibly that's just for
effect, but assuming 50 doublings from now -- he claimed 32 in the past
century -- is a lot.  A 10^15 increase in power for the same cost.

True.  He also began the talk with a demonstration of his speech recognition
software, which seemed to work well after being adjusted to the acoustics.

I got no feel for how this book might differ from the Age of Intelligent
Machines, not that I know anything about that book.

Neil Gaiman the next day was a much more amusing speaker.

Century, hah.  Dawkins in _Unweaving the Rainbow_ quoted some 1920s or 30s
text describing 'the gene', and then going on to caution that the student
should not make the mistake of thinking that the gene was a concrete thing;
that while it played a role in biology analogous to the atom in chemistry, it
was not a thing like an atom, and had no meaning outside of a living spell.

Then came Watson, Crick, and their unnamed assistant, and vitalism died a
quick death.  When you can extract a gene into a test tube, copy it, put the
copies into unrelated cells, and get the protein back... well, what can one
say?

I expect copying minds back and forth would cause a similar cessation of
debate.  Not total, some would still insist the minds weren't minds, but
similar.

While corporate structure in the US at present is government-defined
and supported, limited liability corporations /can/ exist without
such support.  So long as a trading firm in a free market openly
identifies itself as a limited liability corporation and specifies
in all its contracts that parties agree to limit the liability of
the firm to the assets of the firm independent of those of its
shareholders/directors, then no one is being coerced.  Of course, in
the US, all that's required is that you have "Inc." in your name and
all those contract terms follow automatically, but those same terms
could also be negotiated in a free market.

It is often argued that limited liability encourages investment
and enterprise, and that's probably true.  But that's /not/ a good
argument for government-fiat corporations; it's a good argument
for freely contracted limited liability corporations.

Communist and Nazi government also had a lot of professional, hard-working,
and honest (though misguided) workers that kept those countries strong
for awhile.  So did ancient Egypt and China that withstood much longer
tests of time.

I would like to see more from the country leadership.  They should be
honest as an entity, actively promote liberty, have grand-scale
understanding of the forthcoming cultural, economic, and technological
issues and problems, and guide the society through them.  
Instead they are clueless, drag their feet when the reality stares them 
in the face, and almost always make decisions that are detrimental for
liberty and growth, pursuing instead interests of entrenched power
structures.   I would say this is fortunate that they do it all with
horrifying inefficiency that would drive any private company bankrupt
in no time.  If the government could be more efficient, it would have
taken over everything - as it did in the above mentioned countries
where it was - relatively - more efficient.

In the simplest terms, the government needs to borrow when it spends more
than it takes in, its cash balance being normally very small.

Interest on the debt is counted as an outlay in the Federal budget.  Look
at the page next to the back of the 1998 IRS Form 1040 instruction
booklet and you will see pie charts for Fiscal Year 1997.  Net interest
is 15% of outlays.  Those pie charts for FY97 are for the 'unified
budget' which includes Social Security.


Before 1965, Social Security was 'off-budget', and if it were still
off-budget the 'rest of the budget' budget today would show a deficit,
not a surplus.  That is because SS today is taking in more money than it
is spending, so SS is showing a surplus which contributes on net to the
unified budget as net current income for the government.  It's actually
hard to see that from the pie charts because they have mixed in some
other things with SS.  


It does not make a whole lot of difference whether SS is reported
on-budget or off-budget as long as we understand the difference and take
it into account.  It is important to realize that the government is
building up an 'internal' debt to SS, even as it begins to pay down the
'external' public debt with the unified budget surpluses.  I hope this is
not too confusing.

Why do corporations borrow?  They hope they can make an investment with return
greater than the interest rate.

One oddity about the federal gov't is that it has no budget for investment.
Corporations and many state/local gov'ts do, making a distinction between
running expenses and long term investment, such as airports or water supplies.
If you buy a house with a $200,000 mortgage, you'd view that as taking a
$200,000 mortgage on your books, with payments going into future expenses.
The federal gov't would view that as buying a house with a $200,000 deficit
for that year.

So our children won't necessarily be paying for the excesses of their parents.
They could be paying for public investments which they'll have been using all
of their lives.  It depends on what the borrowed money is spent on.  (Some
people, of course, seem to think gov't investment is a logical impossibility.)
In my case, I feel I'll be paying for the defense excesses of the Reagan
years.  But this accounting weirdness can offset SS being counted in the
regular budget.

 ON A SKEPTICAL NOTE...

 In my brief inquiry into possible explanations for the facts 
 outlined in the ENS news reports about mysterious spraying 
 from jets [1], it's my assessment at this time that some
 innocuous explanations are taking the lead. Here's why:

  * The major bug I've discovered with the accounts of 
  cobwebs and "angle hair" falling from aircraft and UFOs 
  is that all the accounts I've found have the witnesses 
  claiming that the material "disappears" when they try 
  to collect it! I suppose it could suddenly melt and turn 
  to a gas (as is claimed) whenever people get near it(?!); 
  however, claims that the evidence is gathered by it keeps 
  disappearing before it can be tested are suspect on their 
  face! My request for information about the four samples 
  of "angel hair" ENS reported remains unanswered. I can
  only assume and hope that, if those samples were taken 
  successfully as indicated, they didn't also disappear.

  * Spray from aircraft that is said to HAVE been tested
  [2] is claimed to be jet fuel. Not that dumping jet fuel 
  on people is not bad, but that sounds more like routine 
  pilot-negligence than evidence of a secret operation. 

  * I've also heard talk about photographs and videos of 
  the complex-contrail patterns these jets are said to make, 
  but no such evidence has been presented, and what I have 
  seen presented as evidence are photos showing nothing but 
  an average number of one or two contrails in the sky! But 
  what is more, it turns out that seeing weather-modifica-
  tion activity is not as unusual as one might assume:

  * The ENS report cited 11 states wherein witnesses have 
  observed unusual contrail patterns and cloud-seeding-like
  aerial activity. My Internet searches proved that of those 
  states, 3 have official nonclassified cloud-seeding pro-
  grams. Also, 6 other states are involved in an open-
  to-the-public NOAA wether-modification program. 

  In all, I found 10 states involved in nonclassified 
  cloud-seeding programs.[3] Considering you can't find 
  everything after only a few hours of searching the www, 
  it stands to reason that there are probably still more 
  nonclassified cloud-seeding activities around the nation.

  Of course, based on the military's own information, it 
  stands to reason that classified weather-modification 
  activities are also happening. But the fact that wide-
  spread weather modification is occurring on an open 
  basis means that witness accounts of activity fitting 
  that profile are not necessarily significant. For me, 
  these facts significantly reduce (but do not elimi-
  nate) the gravity of the mysterious-contrail case.

I have read about various reports of "angel hair" like this in connection
with UFOs.  The 1977 book, "Handbook of Unusual Natural Phenomena", by
William Corliss, briefly mentions such reports, including the behavior
of subliming (vaporizing) on contact or approach.  (Not that there is
anything contradictory in such behavior; many substances will do this,
depending on conditions.)

Corliss quotes one particularly interesting report, not UFO related, in
connection with "cobweb" or "gossamer" showers:

"The cobweb matter becomes more bizarre with the following datum from the
M.V. Roxburgh Castle, moored at Montreal on October 10, 1962.  'At 2000
GMT, while the Roxburgh Castle was moored to her berth (Section 24) in
Montreal, I was walking round outside my accommodation and noticed fine
white filaments of unknown kind hanging around stanchions and topping lift
wires of derricks.

"'Calling the attention of the Chief Officer, I pulled one of these strands
from a stanchion and found it to be quite tough and resilient.  I stretched
it, but it would not break easily (as, for instance, a cobweb would have
done), and after keeping it in my hand for 3 or 4 minutes it
disappeared completely; in other words, it just vanished into nothing.

"'Looking up, we could see small cocoons of material floating down from
the sky, but as far as we could ascertain there was nothing either
above or at street level to account for this extraordinary occurance.

"'Unfortunately I could not manage to preserve samples of the filaments
as the disappearance took place so quickly' (Marine Observer, 33: 187-88,
1963)."

The existence of "angel hair" has been reported enough that I would
tentatively conclude that it really exists.  However it is doubtful that
it has anything to do with secret weather modification projects.

Unfortunately, it also does the same thing in the other direction.
This Social Security "surplus" does not count all the promises the
government has made in the future.  If you buy a house, you're getting an
asset to more than balance the liability of the loan you took to buy it.
When you promise someone that you will take care of him financially when
he's old, you are taking on a liability.  The government's liabilities
amount to a huge amount, many times the budget or national debt.

(Of course, the government can back out of their commitments perhaps
more easily than a private party can.)

I was browsing through Strout's mind uploading page, probably a favorite of
many on this list:

http://metalab.unc.edu/jstrout/uploading/MUHomePage.html

I came across the part about using MRI to scan a living brain for
non-destructive uploading.  One of the obstacles is insufficient resolution.
I remember hearing that the effective resolution of something (say, a
telescope) can be increased by taking a series of time-separated or
spatially-separated images and combining them using image processing
algorithms.  Couldn't this same technique be used to complement an otherwise
inadequate technology?  For example, could you use slight movements of the
scanner to construct a higher resolution image?  Is there a limit to how far
resolution can be enhanced with techniques like this?  I guess this would
amount to trading CPU power for resolution power (if only other commodity
types could be exchanged, we'd probably have strong nanotech by now!)

One of the ideas I found useful from this list is the fact that many
breakthroughs tend to occur when one or more new discoveries is coupled with
one or more mundane/existing technologies.  Ever since learning this, I've
tried to think of ways things can be combined.  Synergy and all that!

I've been a lurker on this list for a few years (would you believe it!)  I
have a 7000 message backlog, but am gradually wading through them by
subject.

Fascinating idea, but this is where I get lost.  If the clock is

here?  Hasn't life been evolving here for more than a couple billion
years now?

Huh?  If all lfe is destroyed by the GRB, _and_ life starts up again on
the planet, a few hundred million years isn't going to be enough
time for space faring levels of intelligence to arise, is it?

Surely this fact did not escape him.  So what aspect of his theory am
I not getting?

Besides, Jay Gould once stated that the contingency based character of
natural selection was such that if evolution were replayed millions of
times,
intelligence would not appear on the planet.  This was in stark contrast to
my up-till-then cherished theory that attributes such as increased levels
of awareness, neural comlexity, and consciousness would have good
survival value.  Point being, Dr. Annis seems to assume that if life appears
on a planet, intelligent life is a highly probably outcome.  Gould assumes
the opposite.

I happen to think there's a good chance that humans are quite alone.
In fact, I hope it's the case.  Even if another intelligence does exist and
comes across us, I seriously doubt it will be organic.  And I don't want us
to be found by an SI probe.

Anyone see the Babylon 5 episode where a probe appeared and gave the
commander a list of 100(?) questions and if they answered all 100 correctly,
it would not blow up and destroy the station because only the most
intelligent
species would be allowed to live?  Turns out the probe's true mission was to
destroy any species that succeeded.  Just another possible filter out there,
I guess.

I would like to hear Robin Hanson's take on this new theory.

...which is Hans Moravec's graph.

Note that Moravec comments, "The reduced spread of the data in the
1990s is probably the result of intensified competition: underperforming
machines are more rapidly squeezed out."  Indeed, the data points in
the 1990s are clustered at the upper end of what had been a consistently
wide band in previous decades.

But this seems to undercut his thesis of super-exponential growth.
We see a wide band getting pruned so that only its upper edge can
exist due to competitive pressures.  This means that there is not an
actual speedup of growth rates, but simply a selection effect, where
only the fastest computers of the 1990s are shown on his chart, while
a wider range of machines was shown in earlier decades.  If we imagine
putting back in the full range of 1990s computers which would have been
manufactured had the market been less cut-throat, as in previous decades,
the extrapolations would be very different.  The data would be consistent
with a slow growth rate up to 1940, a fast rate from 1940-1960, then a
slightly *slower* but constant growth rate from 1940 through the present.

In any case, these kinds of extrapolations are worthless, in my opinion.
The fact is that we face significant technological challenges in trying
to maintain these rates through the next two decades.  Virtually every
technology of the past has gone through periods of exponential growth,
only to reach some limiting factor.  I expect the same thing to happen
to electronics, in the pre-nanotech era.

Just read some review of recent trends in PC prices.
The author explains the appearance of sub-$1000 PCs
by the Moore's "Law".  
But personal computers were getting better for the last
15 years.  Why haven't been the prices falling then?

My explanation is that the computers just got easy enough
to use to move down to the poorer social groups for whom
a "sweet price spot" is lower, and also that there is no
software that would make a $2500 machine universally
more attractive than a $1000 machine, to justify the additional
expense for all people - while alternative ways of spending
the difference promise greater utility.   

This process will probably continue, so we may soon see 
easy-to-use general-purpose PCs for $100 that kids can carry
in their backpacks, etc.

There may be a new life in higher-level part of the market after
the next waves of software products [?] hit the market.

Another interesting question is, why the computers are not
getting more expensive?  Even the richest people wouldn't
buy a $50,000 machine, let alone a million-dollar machine.
This machine would just take more space and require more
maintenance, while giving no perceptible advantage in personal
productivity over a $6,000 PC.   Even this machine is already
a bit of an overkill, unless you do something professional on
it - compile lots of code, optimize some systems, etc.

If we see applications that can work well on a mass-market PC,
but would perform much better on more and more expensive
machines, people would buy these machines.  (Though I am not
sure even here; unless this power is needed locally all the time,
it may make sense to dispatch computational requests to
the specialized distributed machines rather than execute them
locally).  What would these applications do?  Speech and image
recognition?  AI?  All-purpose personal extensions?

Then, if the price range of general-purpose machines stretches
from $100 to $1M, they would probably need different hardware,
OSs, architectures, and applications - and the mass-market of
essentially identical machines will become a thing of the past...

Yes, absolutely, but the only safe option is IMO to build a
spacecraft with Mars range *before* "practical" nanotech
has been developed. After all, nanotech might make the
ship's construction much easier, cheaper and better, but
designing and building a viable spacecraft with nanotech
is (one would think) a lot more difficult than using it to make
lots of nukes or other weapons. There might be (nano)wars all
over the place with your design still on the drawing board, so 
to speak. 

While traveling to Mars, nanotech/ AI/uploading research would 
of course continue onboard (the most tricky "hands on" work would 
have to be done in isolated compartments towed by the main vessel, 
with a nuke close at hand just for good measure -- if something goes 
wrong you cut the cable and "bang". Maybe you don't even need
the nuke, just cutting the (long) cable will probably do). 

The crew could be composed of people who helped to finance
or otherwise support the project plus a selection of top scientists
in various fields, probably no more than approx. 200 people or so
in total, perhaps more if some form hibernation/reversible cryonics is
operational by then. Also a load of "traditionally" frozen folks
("economy class" ;) could also be taken on board. Neuros don't
take up too much space, after all, and cryogenic cooling is free out
there.

Noah's Ark with a transhuman twist (minus the animals, obviously.
Just some gene samples would do). Of course, this scenario
assumes that SI doesn't come first, and/or (very) soon.

The Market would seem to fit certain criteria' matching those of a
collective/conceptual entity,
despite being a set of relationships of objects.
Indeed, the Economy would also seem to fit these criteria.  Even if the
Economy is viewed as a stage where interactions are played out, there
must be entities such as nations & corporations playing their roles, in
addition to the individual humans.

I guess my point is that Ayn Rand was wrong;
there are plenty of things consisting of smaller
(semi)autonomous units that act as & are treated by others as discreet
entities.  Doesn't systems theory have something to say about
whether or nor something is a discreet entity depends on what level of
organization within a system you are analysing @ the moment?

OK, we've gone over several physical technologies so far, but what about
memetics?
Could it ever be developed to the point of being an actual
technology/engineering discipline?
Why or why not?  What could happen if it were so developed?

He he he hehe ha ha ha ha ha he ho ho ho ho hoho.......
Could you possibly have made a more fomulaic response? btw, you don't
capitalize the term "Federal Government" unless you are either totally
brainwashed or borderline Ted Kazinski....

The US federal government was once a model system of minimal government
intrusion into the lives of ordinary people, that respected the founding
concept that all rights originate in the individual and that the government is
merely a delegated recipient of the authority which individuals decide to let
it use. In some areas its getting even better, but in amny other ways it is
getting far worse. Mad bombers and wackos like Tim McVeigh, Ted Kazinski,
Aryan Nation, Koresh, and others are not born, they are made by a lifetime of
government opression and intrusion into the lives of people in many ways. If
our government were as good as you say, we would not have as many of these
nuts running around taking actions like they do.

I once worked for the federal government in the military. I have never seen
more graft, waste and abuse in my entire life than in the last year I was in
the service. I have never seen as much arrogant self important rationalized
government intrusion into peoples lifes as I have seen in the government in
the last 5 years. People wonder why nobody gives a damn about the impeachment
trial in the Senate, or of the President's behavior, its because more and more
people know that the whole system is a scam run and perpetuated by crooks,
liars, cheats, and theives, and all they can hope to get for their tax dollars
is some entertainment value from watching it on the tube and in the papers.

As for your comment about 'good honest hardworking men and women' who work for
the government: While I admit there are a lot of brainwashed people who still
beleive that the government serves a purpose that cannot be served any other
way, anyone who eats from the public trough is eating out of MY wallet, and
has larceny in their hearts if they don't want to find a productive job in the
private sector.

A rather large engineering team of people who can think and act for themselves
invented, built and blew the atom bomb, despite numerous ethical and moral
debates and qualms. I see no reason why a much more programmable set of
automatons cannot do the same with less muss and fuss....even if more than a
small percentage of the automatons know what the ultimate purpose of their jobs
was....

Sorry, no. You are being hopelessly narrowminded. All that is needed is for
sufficient force to crack the crust of the planet enough so that it breaks up
like an ice floe. The impacts are merely catalysts. Once this is done, the crust
destabilizes and becomes inundated with fresh lava, eventually subducting
everything and a new crust forms. Grey goo gets gutted.

Each new generation of operating system and major applications required
so much more processing than the last, but the market was still in high
growth and was nowhere near the size it is now. Now that growth has
slowed but is large, manufacturing economies of scale are really kicking
in, and there is more commodity pressure on the market to lower prices.
Also the advanced computers we have now are markedly reducing R&D&E
costs, and are making plants more productive. Note the high gains in
productivity in the last few years, its lowering unit costs so prices
can come down.

There is also a limit to how much the average person needs in a
computer, or how much their minds can handle using the
mouse/keyboard/gui interface, which may presage a reduction in
productivity in the future. Voice technologies are still not 'smart',
and the user must use a very mechanistic syntax to operate their
machines using voice technology. Once smart voice technology that can
interpret conventional spoken english (or other languages) into a set of
commands, developing and learning subroutines that are adaptable, like a
huge library of macros, then people will again be able to rapidly epand
their rate of increase in productivity with the normal desktop PC.

I am still learning new things I can do with my computer everyday, but
I've noticed that I also have a limited size of my minds toolset, and
there are many apps which I haven't used in months. I really don't need
much more processing capability. I'm currently using a 233mhz PII. I
have been thinking about going to a 333 for a while, but I'm not in any
big hurry. I will probably get much more hard disk space and more RAM
first. I'm already at 64 megs of ram and 6.4 gigs of hard drive space,
which I've had for over a year and a half. I've recently bought more
peripherals, I've got a 24x cd rom ($25.00), a 2x/4x CD writer, a zip
drive,  an LS-120 drive, an internal FM tuner card, and a 17" monitor. I
haven't changed my moden in a year and a half (33.6k), but added a
network card since I'm starting an ISP and have brought my home machine
into that office to use there, where I'll have a 762k connection. I also
have a digital camera and a scanner, and will be getting a larger 11x17"
scanner. Note that many of the components I've listed do not come with
the standard desktop PC. I think that more money is going into these
expansion peripherals, so the technology 'basket' that people have is
still in the $2000.00 budget size every 18 months, but they are putting
it toward more than just the desktop unit.

There is not real consumer market for high end machines mainly because
none of the software for such high end machines is terribly user
freindly or aimed toward consumer uses, nor is it a significant gain
over low cost systems in anything but a few specific applications for
users that are not systems experts. The cost goes into performance for
large amounts of pure number crunching that occurs in the background en
mass, like large database processes, or graphics work.

There are probably several different takes on what a memetic engineer could
be.

As I see it, and for my purposes, a memetic engineer plans, manages and
disburses ideas and skillfully maneuvers them in a direction(s).  Thus, the
slant is engineering as production.  Since the word "engineer" refers to
skills other than mechanical, civil or electrical; many professions are
using the term to describe the planing, managing and maneuvering of tasks. 

"A good scientist is a person with original ideas. [A good artist is a
person with original ideas.] A good engineer is a person who makes a design
that works with as few original ideas as possible. There are no prima
donnas in engineering." Freeman Dyson

"engineering . . . is the art of doing that well with one dollar, which any
bungler can do with two after a fashion. Arthur Mellen Wellington 


Memetic engineering works as a psychological undertaking, at least until we
can really alter our brains and add on specific devices for  developing and
deploying ideas, as well as the insight and scrutiny for understanding
society and communicating and make that a technology.

For example, Chris Peterson (Foresight Institute) and I have discussed
memetic engineering as an interpersonal skill (the ability to understand
and assess people and society) and an ability to steer ideas, and sculpt
ideas, in directions that are both education and constructive for a
particular interest.  Herein responsibility is taken in the production of
ideas so that they are spawned in areas that are profitable to the ideas.
Ideas can take on their own life, to be sure.  (Chris, for example, may
carefully listen to negative comments about nanotechnology and answers
comments with a problem-solving mentality, while intending to sculpt
positive ideas about nanotech.  Crit Mediator can be used to welcomes
individual comments and open up a dialogue.  Here, an open understanding of
what people think and a format to respond while listening to comments and
addressing them in problem-solve mode.)

While anyone who comes up with ideas and markets them fruitfully can spawn
memes, I think actively pursing the engineering of ideas is memetic
engineering. Now, the question, when looking at it in the
above-interpretation, what are the skills needed to effectively engineer
memes?  You can take a look at my Memetic Toolkit, which I worked on while
discussing the concept of memetic engineering with Chris.  I didn't find it
on the list, so I'll insert it here:

Memetic Toolkit or engineering memes

1. Listen
2. Discern Cost Benefit Analysis
3. Educate, Debate or Alienate
4. Employ Critical Thinking
5. Locate Common Ground of Interest
6. Present Historical Parallels
7. Practice Patience
8. Ignite Curiosity
9. Show Sense of Humor
10. Engineer a Meme

What can happen if someone knocks a bit of ice off Antarctica?
If the continent lightens up just enough to start rising, the following
sequence of earthquakes can melt and shake off more ice, which will 
lead to faster rising, etc. - until much of the ice falls off.
I wonder how unstable Antarctica may be in this respect, and how much
would it take to start the process.
I've been asking this question since high school...

Any geologists out there?

Well, the trust fund is "bullshit" from a libertarian perspective
because the I.O.U.'s will eventually have to be paid off by taxation and
most people , according to the CATO Institute, will end up with a
negative net return from Social Security. Also, participation is
compulsory, as you know.

However, if you hold a government bond and try or cash it, I assure you
it will not be considered "bullshit" by a bank and is, as a practical
matter, as good as cash. The government's I.O.U.'s are backed by its
taxing power and vast assets.

Government bonds have the effect of shifting income from one group of
people (the taxpayers at large) to another group (the bondholders).

However, using your argument all bonds would be "bullshit" because the
company you loan the money to just spends the money and gives you an
I.O.U. And bank accounts are "bullshit" because there really is not
enough cash in the vault to cover all deposits.

Of course, unlike the government, private companies cannot loan money to
themselves and consider the loans assets. That's a neat little
accounting trick.

I have a few questions.
     First of all, I am one who believes in the hope associated with 
cryonics. After enlisting with the services of a angency like Alcor, 
they retain money's or insurance to freeze you after death. This is all 
in the hopes for future technology do one day have advanced to the point 
of correcting, the error leading you to death. But last night, I was 
fearfuly thinking: when they are paid, and the time has come to return, 
say that there are some who are so to speak scientific giunnea pigs. But 
with the amount of people having this procedure done, won't there be too 
many for just the goverment or medical practice? Then who will save us, 
only the freezing has been paid for, no one has been paid in advance to 
save us and bring us back?
    Also, I'm wondering, will it at all be possible to bring someone 
backk from our memory banks alone?

This is not intended to be portrayed as a utopia- quite the contrary! A pioneer
on Mars will be subject to deprivations greater than the average Bangladeshi.
This study focuses on the "starting problem": what is the incentive to risk
capital
on this? How can it pay for itself?

> An early offworld colony

Actually, this is an historically loaded word- perhaps the
language of space development and exploitation should
be re-examined for these kinds of predispositions. How
about 'field office'? Branch? Division? Non-geographical unit?

I was thinking more in terms of a consortium of mutinational corporations, or a
new company that trades internationally. Some of the political problems alluded
to above are currently being addressed by the new private launchers. Kistler,
for example, is based in a US city but has contingency plans for launching
from Australia if the US continues to to block their use of American launch
facilities. Similarly, Boeing's SeaLaunch uses a converted oil platform that can
be
towed into international waters. What if the settlements are considered to be
'ships'-
registered in Liberia? How about swinging a deal with some UN member
like Brunei or Toga (or some entity not bound by the Moon treaty)?

> Most likely your early economy
> would be based on supplying bulk unprocessed resources, or half-products.

Yes, this is part of the proposal. Shipping H and C  to the Moon could be
cheaper from Mars than from Earth. Shipping CHON, Si, Al, Ti, Fe,
etc. to Earth orbit is even more interesting, as there is already a nascent
market there. These are -call it Phase 2- later developments, though. First
comes establishing some kind of sustainable presence.

I'm thinking that the early "field office workers" are made
shareholders in the corporate entity.

Just so.

Not following the "corporate guidelines" may reduce your
shareholder value? Provisions made for on-the-job psychological
stress? Early "retirement" (going back to Earth) costs shares?
I have made some small contributions to spacewar theory already.
In a nutshell: Earth has the blockade (economic sanctions) advantage, Mars
has the high ground (cf "Open Air Space Habitats" at IASE site below).

The Hudson's Bay Company seems to me to be the closest analogy.

Just so. Brick-making is certainly an early Martian industry, as are
greenhouse farming, mining, solar energy collection, etc.

[...]
This study is more focused on economic and technical solutions
to the "starting problem". Nearly every proposal to date (even some
of mine from the 1970's) has relied on taxes for financing, has not
even remotely considered ROI, and are essentialy unsustainable
"tourist" trips like the defunct Apollo program.
Some elements of the new private proposals can be incorporated
in this proposal:

Entertainment and product placement (like the Artemis project).
Sell science (SpaceDev's NEAP model).
Contract some space services (NEAP model).
(btw, I don't see much of value in the Millennial project.)

What is different:
No search for life (except as science/entertainment for hire)
No terraformation plans (Mars Society)
(These two items would be considered flaky by any
serious investor...)

Little or no shipping H2 (Mars Direct, NASA clone)
No government financing except as a customer (NEAP model)
Use the existing facilities and situations synergistically.
More reliance on forward-deployed robotics for first few launch
cycles (~26 months per cycle).
Fewer return vehicles- minimum stays of 500+ 687 days.
Focus on living and building rather than on science.

The number one resource to prospect for is water.
This should be doable with robotics.
Some example technical questions:

Can an instrument like the neutron spectrometer (?) used on
Lunar Prospector be adapted for the Martian envronment
(it may have to generate its own particle beam).

What does it take to dig a hole on Mars? A drill rig? A robot
mole? Compressed atmosphere? Chemicals? A combination
of these? The system mass has to be minimal and it should have
some redundancies.

Some areas on Mars appear to be dried-up river and
ocean beds. There is a possiblity of permafrost near the surface.
What does it take to clear a rock field? To level a site?
A miniature robot bulldozer that can work continuously for 2 years
might be able to do this. It also might dig trenches to search for
permafrost. To minimize its launch mass, it might pick up local
rocks for its ballast. (let people guide it from Earth for a fee).

Can a robotic manufacturing plant produce photovltaic cells, or
at least accomplish some part of the process, especially mining
and extracting? Same for thin films, bricks, glass, structural
members, etc.

What are Phobos and Deimos made of? These two little moons
are absolutely crucial. Can a NEAP-style mission be launched
real soon? Is SpaceDev already considering this?

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

I'd like to unreservedly recommend a book called "The Nurture
Assumption", and stick through the first few chapters debunking ideas
you've never believed, because Judith Rich Harris goes on to do much
more.  I'm not even done with the book, but already it's done something
no book has ever done before.  It's given me my childhood back.  *Now*
my understanding of evolutionary psychology extends to children.  Now I
understand my first years.

The thesis of the book is that parenting doesn't matter.  Only peer
groups matter.  (You should still be a good parent, but it won't make
much of a difference to your child's future.  Although IMHO kids can
still benefit from tutoring, and for some nerds peers are also
irrelevant and it's the books that count.)  Now, when I first read this,
I thought:  "She's got a few points, but I'm sure she's exaggerating, in
love with her thesis.  Parents do matter, they just aren't as
all-important as people think."  A few chapters later, she'd convinced
me.  Parenting doesn't matter.

Oh, most of the rules she's articulating don't apply to me, of course,
but I can see how they not-apply in a very clear manner that explains a
lot I never understood, and I can see how some of the not-applying has
lasted even into my adult life.

I can even see why I didn't have a childhood as stereotypically
miserable as most geniuses are supposed to.  Good studiers are
brown-nosers, picked on for being minions of Them?  Hah!  Not me.  I
wasn't the class brain, I was the class genius and everyone knew it.  I
never felt any obligation to "fit in" with the other kids, but I never
felt any obligation to do my homework either.  I lost all respect for
teachers when the second-grade math teacher didn't know what a logarithm
was.  I was the terror of the adults, and the other kids respected that.

Dear folks

As 'Teaching in Cyberspace' editor of the APA Newsletter on Computers 
and Philosophy, I am looking for short feaures for the Spring 
Newsletter issue-I hope you have enjoyed the recent submissions, for 
those who receive the APA Newsletter.
What I would like is a short piece on how your teaching philosophy 
uses the web to address course goals and plans that incorporate 
technology in order to address these ends in ways that 'real-time' 
class meetings cannot meet the challenge. I would like to feature 
several examples of philosophy teaching using the web in the upcoming 
spring issue.
Please send me your short pieces-by Feb 15, if you can-so I can 
respond to you and arrange details for the APA Newsletter draft 
deadline.
Thanks for your help-this is a great service to the APA readership.

Every society incorporates sufficient complexity or it would never have
emerged as a discrete society. Insufficiently complex societies do not
exist, although (sub-complex) adaptive systems can serve as bridges or
catalysts to more socio-biologically evolved systems. Consequently, all real
societies use money, i.e., a means of exchange, of some form or other. The
social contract requires it, does it not?

When viewing Clinton on TV, it helps to post a note to one's screen:
"Admitted Liar"
That puts the address in perspective. Not even Alan Greenspan can say how
many layers of fraud and deceit cover the facts about the finances of Social
Security. The folks who count on Social Security really do need it,
especially after buying deeds to the Brooklyn Bridge.

The US has a bureaucrat surplus, not a budget surplus. Solution: Give the
surplus to the out-of-work former goverment employees displaced by
automation.

Don't trust any forecasts, including those from the weather station.
Forecasts matter to the people who make forecasts, obviously. Responsible
folks such as yourself (I'll take your word for it) could probably plot the
intentions of forecasters on a graph of their social engineering projections
to determine just how far up the river they intend to sell us.

Namaste,

What a splendid idea! Have a level-2 mailing list for those who pass a
proctored test on extropian principles and fundamentals. Doing so could

I've also noticed a number of articles in the popular press recently that took
at least an even tone to reporting on technological developments of transhuman
interest.  However, I also took a look this morning at the poll CNN ran along
with the story.  Only 49% of the approximately 10,000 respondents answered
"Yes" to the question, "Would you consider having microchips implanted in your
body?"  Considering the over-all technophilic tendency of an Internet
audience, this isn't that large a portion of the respondents.  Of course, the
positive response would likely have been much higher if some widely-accepted
medical purpose for a chip implant had been identified in the poll question,
such as for a pacemaker(an already common chip implant).  Perhaps I should be
happy that almost half the respondents said they would accept a chip implant,
even when the purpose wasn't specified . . .

I'm quite sure no existing cryonics org would start reviving people
without having done extensive tests on animals etc., and the
required technologies were deemed reliable. I don't think it's
being done yet, but you could also offer (standard) suspensions 
at a discount to those that are willing to be revived first, thus
being the test subjects.

But

There are hardly a thousand of us now, and I don't think there will be
explosive growth anytime soon. Besides, the technology that's needed
to repair the frozen will (probably) also put an end to society as we 
know it, including governments and the medical establishment. To 
increase the chances of successful revival, it might even be necessary 
to ship the frozen heads/bodies to some safer place like Mars (see
the "Major Technologies" thread) at some point.

> Then who will save us, 
> only the freezing has been paid for, no one has been paid in advance to 
> save us and bring us back?

If all goes well the cryonics organizations will (for example) 
wait until the technology to revive people (nanotech + AI, 
probably) is cheap enough to buy and use on their patients. It 
could be bought using the same funds which would now be used 
for, say, new perfusion equipment or LN2 tanks. As you sign up, 
it's for the whole trip, not just storage. Of course, money 
itself may be obsolete by then and the Singularity may be upon 
us and all that.

It should be possible to "reconstruct" someone in such a way that
s/he fits the (subjective) image that others have of this person, but 
this is of course of little use to the original.

Would some of these limiting factors be the ability to recoup the costs of
creating the increased computing power?  I assume now that certain advances
in computing power are left on the market long enough to be profitable before
the next level is introduced.

natasha, im still thinking about the rest of it.    im also
trying to keep the noise down, as im hearing a lot of
complaints about it.  im a big dyson fan, looooved

have huge egos, some worse than rock stars.  {8^D  spike

U.S. Code 50 (Chapter 32, Section 1520(b)1)) states 
that the Department of Defence MAY "conduct any test 
or experiment involving the use of any chemical or 
biological agent on civilian populations" only if the  
DoD notifies "local civilian officials" 30 days before
testing chemical or biological agents on U.S. civilians.

So you have the right to have some "civilian officials" 
notified before you're used in bio-war experiments.
So we all have the legal right to be a Guinea pig 
without knowing, so long as some officials know.

Read this law at the Cornell University library:
http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/1520.html 

This law was added to the U.S. Code in 1996. Why would
federal law define a right for the DoD to "conduct any 
test or experiment involving the use of any chemical 
or biological agent on civilian populations" (granted
a few officials know) if no such tests and experiments 
were planned? It stands to reason that they are planned!
Is this connected to reports of sickening USAF-jet-spray?

Does Usenet count for 'prior art'? There was a discussion of this idea
there a few years ago... either rec.arts.sf.science or one of the nanotech
groups, I think. I remember it because I was going to steal the idea to use
in a short story, but never got around to writing more than an outline.

My fear is this, that if we are brought back. I may end up in the 
likeness of a clone. If neurons are damaged beyond repairs, quickly 
after death. Then, the memories are gone, correct? So even upon 
retrieval, I'm a copy without knowledge of who I was. In a sense, I'll 
still be dead. After every thing I've had to learn this life go round, I 
don't want it all lost. There must be an alternative. And also how do 
you see the future cryonics organizations doing this, if we've only paid 
for our frozen state?

Are you implying that this should be shocking or unheard of?  Our
government steals our earnings and gives them to their block-voting
lackies.  Our government is currently attempting to completly disarm
the entire civilian population of the country.  Our government is
currently waging a "War on Drugs" to fight the black market that it
has created and subsidizes!  In this "War on Drugs" our government
targets sick people that use Marijuana simply as a medicine (go to the
LP site to find out about the Kubby arrests).  Our government wants
hundreds of billions of dollars for increased military spending when
we don't have any enemies.  Our government constantly interferes in
the business of other countries, causing terrorist activities against
us.  

Our government obviously cares little for it's civilian population
outside of it's potential to bring in the tax money.  So what if a
couple ten thousand die to chemical or biological experimentation? 
Just make sure that they're not Union members or minorities.

Certainly no one on this list could be shocked.  I'm just surprised
that the looters actually publish the law that makes it "legal."

Does this approach really work for nanoscale pellets? I have the
impression that the wavelength of the laser light ought to be much
shorter than the size of the pellet. Also, deviations from spherical
symmetry will likely cause more trouble as you shrink the system and
get lots of diffraction oddities.

I haven't been following this particular thread so i don't know the 
context that was taken out of, but i have to ask... do you think that 
advances are held back regularly to increase profits? Would a certain 
technology thus be slowed in its progress towards its limiting factors? 
Would that possibly mean that capitalism is NOT the ideal way to achieve 
progress? (I've always hoped we could do better anyway.)

Oddly enough, it doesn't surprise me. In my opinion, one of the problems 
with America is that Americans are in general far too law-abiding; presumably 
because in most cases bloated authoritarian government is a recent occurence,
whereas in Europe it's been in existence for generations. Hence Americans
still have some respect for their government whereas Europeans generally
treat it as just another obstacle to work around.

Usenet is full of Americans questioning the minutae of government 
regulations; most Europeans in the same situation just ignore what the 
government says whenever they can get away with it. In a country where 
people spend days worrying about the most minute details of tax laws rather 
than turn tax evasion into a sport, I'm sure many people will accept that 
if there's a law saying the government can kill the first-born then it's OK.

Well, I haven't worked for a large aerospace company like Spike does,
I've mostly worked on my own or on contract to other firms, and I will
say that when I worked at firms that were strictly architectural
engineering, there was a distinct lack of such individuals. I was
actually shocked. The last engineering firm I worked for, I was
surprised to say, was an a-hole free zone, which allowed me to finally
disprove what my father once said to me as a child, that I would find
such people no matter where I worked....

My cousin, Andrew Lorrey, is currently in Antarctica and working on problems like
this. They (his team from U Maine - Orino) are in a valley where there is buried
ice that is supposedly more than 8 million years old. They are hoping that the
stratified layers of this ice can tell them about not only the weather patterns
back then, but the durability of the Antarctic ice sheet to large world climatic
variations (like global warming), as well as answers to your question. He gets
back in a month, but I don't know how long it will take them to work through the
data they've collected.

I don't remember the details, but I do remember there were many unanswered
technical issues; whether they're solvable is another question, but people
were impressed enough at the time that nuclear nanobots might be possible,
as they'd previously assumed they'd be limited to chemical energy.

Sasha Chislenko and his friend Vanessa came up to visit this weekend, and last
night we rented the movie Gattaca, which I had not seen before. I recall some talk
a while back on the list about it, mostly concern with the Big Brotherly aspects of
the police investigating the murder in the movie, sucking up DNA evidence
everywhere. However, I found that the most important part of the movie, which was
incredibly uplifting, was the story of Vincent, who exceeded the limits imposed by
his supposed genetic destiny and society, and that he was able through his example,
to teach those around him about what true potential is all about.

<SNIP>

All I can say is... thank God I don't live in the US, eh? <evil grin>

Seriously... this is what we get from allowing ourselves to be governed.
It just goes to show you how impressively easy it is for the Congress to
sneak all sorts of laws (many of them possibly unconstitutional) past
the people's collective back. When such a select group of people are
given this kind of power, it's an obvious sign that something is very wrong.

I say it's time for a worldwide bloody revolution.

(I'm working on an article on practical political science for the 21st
century, but it's hardly done yet... more on that later.)

Its been known for a long time that many (and all of the smart) high tech
companies hold back on introducing products to the market until the
processing power required to meet the performance specs becomes cheap enough
for them to meet their market price window and still make a profit. Products
introduced before their time are money losers.....This is the practical
application of Moore's Law to product engineering.

It doesn't look like this would eliminate the effect.  Even if you widen the
distribution to factor out this effect, the high end of the performance
curve still seems to be sloping upwards.  At any rate, a few more years of
data should be enough to get a definitive answer - if the growth is
super-exponential, it should become unmistakable once the graph is extended
to 2000 or so.

Exactly. So a worthwhile cryosuspension process must retain all the
relevant information, and a workable revival process must avoid
damaging it. 

Then again, the borders between being completely restored and being
damaged are blurry - a little damage might be acceptable (compared to
being totally dead), but it is not easy to tell how much damage is
acceptable beforehand.

It already exists, it's called "spin doctoring". The Clinton case
is a good example. People who defend him repeat a series of
platitudes which make no sense. "It doesn't rise to the level of
impeachment" yet impeachment is clearly for high crimes and
misdemeanors, and perjury is a felony, clearly exceeding
misdemeanor. Only an idiot or a liar would consider the acts
performed as not constituting sex.

The problem, of course, is that outside of kids toys, I can't think of any
area where there's any strong evidence that ads work for demand creation. In
almost all cases I can think of, people want something, the ads just give
them more choice as to who they buy it from. Most of us grow out of buying
things we don't need after we stop getting toys at Christmas.

I mean, if I wanted to buy a car in an ad-free world, the only choice I'd
have locally would be the Ferrari dealer... or the other Ferrari dealer. In
the real world I'm surrounded by ads from Ford, GM and other manufacturers,
and have more problem deciding which one to buy than finding information on
the alternatives. But the ads only gave me choices, they didn't make me want
to buy a car.

Ever buy a diamond engagement ring?  Anniversary gift?  Birthstone?
Those "traditions" were created entirely by jewelry advertising, and
are now so entrenched in our society that most people don't even
realize that.

There is a lot of thought that must be put into a desicion like 
cryonics. From my stand point, it's always financial. But as the old 
cliche says, better safe than sorry. If there is a chance, that 
technology will meet the mind of the memory someday, a chance I'm 
willing to take. At the rate science is advancing, ei. Nadrian Seeman, 
the stem cell, smart plastics, I do like to sacrifice my dreams to a

Who brought ethics into this?  My point was simply that what we've been
talking about is a genie machine, capable of doing essentially anything a
full-blown SI could do.  If such machines exist, anyone who has one can
easily use it to make an actual SI.  Therefore, a world where ordinary
humans commonly have access to genie machines can't exist - the age of
SI/AI/IE would begin before the nanotech age could really get going.

I demonstrated that this is not the case - impactors typically do not carry
enough energy to melt themselves, let alone the Earth's crust.  Now you
raise an entirely different argument, in the guise of continuing the
previous one.

Well, fracture calculations are a lot trickier than simple impart energy,
and I'm not going to attempt one.  I will, however, point out that the
concept is meaningless when applied to objects of planetary scale.  The
Earth's crust isn't held in place by mechanical strength (in other words, it
is already full of cracks).  Gravity is the dominant force here - the crust
is a layer of lighter material floating on top of layers of denser rock.  To
get lava to rise to the surface you need to make it less dense than the
surrounding crust, either by heating it or changing its chemical
composition.

Now, an impact of any reasonable size isn't going to fracture the crust at
all - its too thick, and there isn't enough energy.  If you drop something
really huge (like Ceres) things might be different - but now we're talking
about mega-scale engineering, which is a whole other ball game.

BTW - from what I've seen, the guys who are actually studying the Alvarez
impacts and the Decca traps make no claims resembling yours.  The closest
I've heard is a theory that the impact might have triggered a series of
eruptions in an area that was already a major center of volcanic activity -
which is a very different claim.

This reminds me of William Burroughs' writings decades ago about spreading 
memes by getting people to repeatedly whisper them or play them back in 
public; the idea being that if you repeat something often enough, the meme
will infect some number of brains that hear it.

Of course it could.  IMHO, you don't even need nanotech brain surgery to do
it.  People actually seem to be pretty easy to influence, as long as you
approach the problem the right way.  The hard part would be developing a
technique for testing the effectiveness of competing approaches in an
objective fashion.  Once you have that, experimenters can begin building a
sound base of knowledge in the field.  Once you have enough empirical data
to be able to say you know how to do some limited set of things reliably,
you have an engineering discipline.

> Why or why not?  What could happen if it were so developed?

That's the catch.  Memetic engineering would could benefit us all by making
it possible to build better mental immune systems, weed out false memes more
reliably, and so on.  It could also be used for mind control - a large
fraction of the human race appears to be very susceptible to infectious
memes, after all.  Oppressive governments would use it to subdue the
populace, megalomaniacs would use it to create cults, and activists of every
sort would use it to support their pet causes.  The result could easily be
an increasing polarization of the human race into warring ideological camps.

Now, I'm not suggesting that this means we shouldn't try to do it.  Any
ability can be used for evil, after all.  I just think we should keep our
eyes open.

BTW - This is one reason why some of us are so nervous about the idea of
confronting an SI.  Circumstantial evidence seems to suggest that humans
have very weak mental immune systems.  An entity a great deal smarter than
we are might well be able to exploit those weaknesses to manipulate us into
doing just about anything, just by engaging in conversation that leads
subtly in the desired direction.

Well, any system is going to have to let those who pay for an invention make
enough money from it to pay for the R&D - otherwise, how do they pay for the
next round of research?  I suspect what you are actually concerned about is
companies holding up new products so they can make more money charging high
prices for the old ones.

This is actually a very stupid thing for a company to do.  If you have real
competition, your competitors will bring out their own version of the new
product and gain market share.  If you don't, then you are creating a
financial incentive for someone to begin competing with you (if you sell an
outdated product at a high price, you make it very easy for someone new to
enter the market with a better product and/or price).  In any industry with
significant technological progress this is a strategy which is rarely
attempted, and usually has disastrous results.

The only cases I can think of where this sort of thing was done long-term
are those where the government forbids competition.  Even then, the monopoly
usually breaks down eventually - some unrelated industry springs up that can
provide the same service a different way, and for a lower price.  The
history of railroads, trucking, and air freight is an interesting example of
this theme.

It still wouldn't make them possible.  To get power out of the reaction you
have to be able to capture the radiation produced by the fusion reaction,
and convert it into a useful form of energy.  To do that you need a barrier
of fairly dense matter at least a few inches thick.  A nanoscale reactor
would simply irradiate the area - there would be no way for the nanobots to
capture a significant amount of energy from the reaction.

So the questions would seem to be:

1. Are people buying them because of the advertising or the "tradition"
2. Just how much of people's budget consist of such items, rather than
   those they really want?

I'd certainly agree that there are such traditions which many people follow,
but I think that it's a different issue; people buy diamond engagement rings
-- if they do, most people I know didn't want to spend that kind of money
on something that isn't really useful -- because they're expected to, not
because they see an ad on TV and think 'oh, I think I'll buy a diamond
engagement ring today'. Galbraith's theory seems to be the latter; we see
an ad on TV and follow the meme to go out and buy a diamond engagement
ring even though we're not going to get engaged.

Kids see toys advertised on TV and immediately want them. Most adults -- 
with the exception of the few people I know who really have more money
than sense -- don't. Tradition seems to be a different issue; buying the
diamond engagement ring when you get engaged serves a purpose, whether or
not that purpose was originally created by advertising.

I was talking about nuclear energy in the more general sense; not neccesarily
controlled use. Personally I find the idea of a mosquito flying through 
my window carrying a multi-ton-yield fusion bomb rather more scary than a
nanobot running off a miniature nuclear reactor. People had previously 
assumed that any hostile nanobot would be limited to chemical energy 
levels rather than nuclear.

You may know it already, but the cheapest, rock-bottom
suspension comes at about $15,000 (straight freeze, brain only)
, while approx.$28,000 will get you a "reasonable" whole body
suspension. Very feasible for young(er), more or less healthy
people when payed with life insurance.

Yep, and at the very least you buy peace of mind (without having to
compromise rationality as with religion) and thus improve the quality 
of life here and now. A good investment, IMO. If it works, great!
If it doesn't, well I guess I'll never know then.

A GRB won't destroy *all* life.  It would cause a mass extinction, killing
all land-dwelling life on one hemisphere of the planet and (through indirect
effects) a lot of other life in other areas.  It might or might not manage
to kill off land animals on the shadowed side of the planet (by suddenly
destroying the ozone layer and atmospheric composition).  In any case, a
great deal of life will survive in the oceans.

If GRBs occur every few million years, complex animal life probably can't
evolve.  If it happens every few tens of millions of years, it evolves but
doesn't have time to get very far.  According to the theory, the gap between
successive bursts has only recently become long enough for life forms like
us to evolve.

I'm not sure if I buy all this or not.

Combining 'rare intelligence' with GRB extinctions would certainly make us
rare, though.

I don't think I but Jay Gould's idea, however.  Look around.  Recently
evolved types of life (mammals, avians) seem to be much smarter than older
ones (reptiles, fish).  There are lots of unrelated species that are smart
enough to make people worry about whether they are sentient or not (apes,
whales, dolphins, elephants, and a couple of species of birds).  The
combination of tool use, intelligence and a capacity for large-scale social
organization might be unusual, but there seems to be a clear trend towards
increasing intelligence.

That doesn't sound quite right.  Not all of the actions of a corporation 
(or individual) are covered by contract.  An extra benefit of limited 
liability is limited liability in a lawsuit, which might arise from, for 
example, polution, or wreckless driving by one of drivers of the company's 
delivery trucks.

Like Lee, I'm not arguing by this that limited liability is necessary, just 
that it includes more protections than you can get without government 
intervention.

Hi Ian,

etc.

The feds and the DOD consider themselves the world's real people and the
civilization that the rest of us must work, pay taxes, and die to serve,
provide, and protect. IOW, the feds and the DOD (and their families) see
everyone else as expendable accomplices or outright adversaries.
Ever has humanity organized itself so.

We "civilian populations" don't count for much in the great scheme of the
political power broker's paradigm. Realizing this, we turn to each other to
reaffirm our own worth. In doing so, we infrequently identify one of
surpassing merit, such as an enlightened master, who places most value not
on Machievellian machinations, but rather on liberating meditations.

"Civilian officials" (whatever that means) probably identify more with
officialdom than with civility. It makes me happy to see that you've noticed
the corruption raging through governments. No doubt you've heard that "power
corrupts". It does not. Corrupt people seek power.

Inevitably, governments (like crimes, poverty-stricken classes, and gang
wars) emerge from the social organization of human affairs. IMO, the human
race will learn to transcend government, while retaining the benefits of
social interaction (as on the Net) or it will commit global suicide.

Namaste,

    *** New microbes posing health risks

    ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) - Previously unknown bacteria and viruses
    blooming in the Earth's warming oceans are killing some marine life
    and threatening human health, researchers say. There are increasing
    reports of dying coral, diseased shellfish and waters infected with
    human virus as the seas rise in temperature and pollution from the
    land intensifies, researchers said Friday in studies presented at the
    national meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of
    Science. About 10% of the coral worldwide has died, said James W.
    Porter, an ocean studies specialist at the University of Georgia. He
    said if present trends and conditions continue, another 20% to 30% of
    the coral could be lost.

Yes, extropians want to migrate to a Type I civilization, as outlined by
Michio Kaku. But do we need to preserve our Type 0 civilization to get
there? Or will the disintegration of Type 0 spur us to build Type I?

Ah.  I see your point.

I think, however, that we are still safe.  There are some formidable
problems with nano-scale (or even micro-scale) nuclear devices, and they
seem to be more a matter of fundamental physics than simple engineering
constrains.

First, there is a size requirement for the fuel.  A fusion reaction releases
most of its energy in the form of hard x-rays, which are then absorbed by
the rest of the fuel, which produces the heat that sustains the chain
reaction.  If you make the device too small the x-rays aren't captured, and
you can't produce a chain reaction.  Even with nanotech, its hard to see how
you could make a device less than a few inches in diameter without this
problem being fatal.

Second, there is a power storage problem.  Current bomb designs use a small
fission bomb to produce the energy that starts their fusion reaction.  A
laser ignition system would need a similar amount of power, but it has to
get it from a non-nuclear source.  That means you need a capacitor system
much bigger than the bomb itself - and we've already seen that the bomb has
a minimum size.

Third, as you noted, there is a diminishing yield problem.  Even nuclear
weapons only produce so much bang per pound, and if you start measuring the
bomb size in micrograms it gets pretty puny.  A robot mosquito might carry
as much punch as a truck bomb, if you could make a bomb that small - but
that's no big deal with reasonably advanced nanotech.  Anything much smaller
than that won't even produce an explosion - it will simply produce a flash
of radiation when it detonates.

How many people are buying a diamond engagement ring worth "2
months salary" since DeBeers started running those ad's.

most.

Lessee, you can make a 10 kiloton weapon these days to fit in a suitcase, lets
say, generously that that suitcase still weighs in at 100 kilos., so 100
kilogram devices can produce 10 million kilograms of TNT levels of explosive
power. A ratio of 100,000 to 1. If a microgram nuke device is proportionate in
capability, if there is not a steep falloff in capability, then it should
produce the equivalent of 100 grams of TNT of explosive force. This is far from
a trivial amount if a robotic bug can deliver it into your eardrum.....its equal
to a good fraction of a stick of dynamite blowing up in your ear.... Whatever is
left gets fried from radiation...

Your contention was that advertising does not create demand among
adults to a large degree.  I offered this counterexample, because
people are "expected" to buy diamond engagement rings precisely
because DeBeers told them to in its advertising decades ago. 
Other examples: underarm deodorants, shampoos, cosmetics and other
personal care products that no one realized they needed until
chemical companies started telling us that we smell bad and that
plain soap makes our hair split and that painted faces are good.

What about Microsoft's "Where do you want to go today?" ads?
They're not trying to say they're product is better than Linux
or MacOS, they're just trying to show you all the interesting
things you can do with a PC--which will more than likely have
their OS on it--but I'm sure those ads help Mac sales as well
by convincing parents that their children will be deprived
without a computer, or that their business will be less
organized and less competitive.

The most effective demand-creation advertising can be very subtle,
as in movies that glamorize smoking and drinking, or it can be as
overt as "Got Milk?".  To deny that advertising creates demand for
products among adults as well as influencing brand selection is
completely at odds with the facts.

Actually, my understanding is that 'suitcase' nukes are generally under 0.1
kT, and they are still a lot bigger than suitcases - 50 kg is a pretty good
weight estimate.  At any rate, there is no straight conversion from weight
to explosive force - the smaller the bomb gets, the less efficient it
becomes.

Also, as I said before, a really small bomb won't produce an explosion at
all.  If you could build a microgram nuke (which you can't), it would simply
produce a sharp burst of radiation (mostly x-rays).  If it goes off in your
ear, most of the energy will pass right through you and be absorbed by the
surrounding building, ground, air, etc.  It might cause radiation sickness,
but with even primitive medical nanotech it takes an awful lot of radiation
to kill people.

You mean like the psychology of persuasion/attitude change or
advertisement psychology? Both are areas where quite a bit of serious
reasearch is going on. But most of it is non-memetic, i.e. relies on
direct exposure rather than spread from other people.

Actually, this is an interesting angle to add in the above fields, how
to create a mindset able to resist these methods. There are publishable
research papers in it :-)

Note that this is a skill that hinges very sensitively on being able
to participate in human social contexts, judging reactions from small
cues and modelling the reactions of a human. SIs are only dangerous in
this respect if you believe that intelligence is completely general,
and not specialized (which is becoming a more and more common view
among psychologists).

If the average galaxy generates a Gamma ray burst every few hundred million
years then by chance a few lucky galaxies will not get one even after 4 billion years.
Perhaps we live in such a galaxy. Anyway, such a burst could only directly
effect half of a planet so we're not talking about global sterilization of all life.

If evolution were replayed it's very clear that nothing like human beings would
appear, perhaps intelligence would not appear either but that's much less clear.
Gould likes to emphasize that evolution has no direction. He says the only exception
is the very simplest forms of life because if they were any simpler they wouldn't be alive
at all so any change can only be toward more complexity. After this minimum requirement
has been met  the number of species that become more complex is no greater than
the number that become simpler. Gould has written entire books on this subject and
I think his observation is correct but less profound than he seems to think. Even Gould
admits (reluctantly) that the most complex organism of an era tends to be more
complex than the most complex  organism of a previous era. That's good enough for
me because I'm only interested in the best, I don't care what most species are doing.
He does make one good point however, complexity does not necessarily breed more
complexity. The most complex organism of an era is very often not related  to the
complexity champion of the past but evolved from a much simpler creature. Some get
simpler, some get more complex, most stay the same.

Yes, Cryonics Institute will get you a whole body suspension at
about half the price of an Alcor neuro, if I remember correctly. I've 
chosen Alcor myself, for various reasons (main reason being that 
they were/are the best known cryonics organization). A pretty good 
choice, in retrospect (IMO anyway).

My suggestion for inertial confinement fusion wasn't intended as a
"nanofusion" power source, but as a method of constructing fusion
weapons without carrying around a lot of uranium.  I specifically
originated the suggestion when someone purported to prove that
nanotechnological attacks would be less powerful than modern weaponry,
which is absurd.

I also wanted to demonstrate that war nano can easily use nuclear
weapons against an "active shield", as part of my generalized thesis
that nanowar tilts the attack/defense balance even farther towards
attack than the existing nuclear weapons standoff.

If I really wanted to be speculative, with respect to "nanofusion", I
would ask why you couldn't focus nuclear reactions so as to catch
individual neutrons, or perhaps arrange materials so that a solid
barrier of neutron-catchers existed instead of a haphazard crystal.  I'd
expect nuclear reactions to be considerably more efficient once we start
working close to that scale.

Since I share the libertarian/extropian/law-and-economics meme-set, I'm
inclined to agree with this analysis, or at least wish it was true.
However, to me, it is clearly an empirical question whether this actually
is an accurate analysis.

The first thing that quite obviously sticks out to me is that the analysis
assumes virtually non-existent transaction costs to information gathering
and analysis.  I have serious skepticism about ever acheiving this
frictionless an economy in what I hope to be a extropian lifetime.

I meant market-enhancing in reference to net externalities produced by
statist coercion.  I.e., that the beneficial externalities produced by
encouraging large formations of limited-liability equity captial appear to
outweigh the negative externalties imposed on society.  "Market Enhancing,"
as an economic term, has nothing to do with transfer payments; it refers to
correcting market failures that arise for various reasons.

(Just to forestall ideological objections -- I _do_ believe that government
intervention in such market failures generally mucks things up more than it
fixes them, due to human imperfection as well as rent-seeking behaviors,
and therefore I'd prefer to live in a society where such intervention is
kept to a minimum; however, I'm not ideologically blinded from the
_possibility_ that such intervention might possibly be beneficial, and I'm
trying to explore whether this might be such a case).

Exactly what?

As I say, it appears to me that it is an empirical question between the two
possibilites.  The complex impact of the various transaction inefficiencies
makes me skeptical that I can resolve this question through pure deduction
that starts from an economic theory about which I have have to remind
myself to be skeptical of as well.

I never implied otherwise.  My understanding of history is that the
political elites, whether individuals, families or corporate elites, have
always behaved this way.  Be thankful that nowadays the state provides you
with a court to contest in.

If it is a human virus that is killing the coral, then its likely brought
there by the divers who protest about the coral's destruction. However, I
have also seen studies (don't have any cites handy) which assert that much of
the coral die offs is a natural cyclic occurence, as they grow too close to
the surface for the species present, or for other reasons. Considering how
much we now know how much of the ocean ecosystem is dependent on
phytoplankton, including coral, as well as the krill population(which most of
the rest of the ecosystem in the ocean relies on), we can look to the two
causes of reductions in phytoplankton:
a) a reduction in the amount of free iron in the oceans, as fewer ships are
sunk, and the old ones are almost all rusted away. Its amazing how much a
little rust in the water can keep the plankton blooming.
b) the ozone hole lets in too much UV which kills plankton. While too many
people equate the ozone hole (caused by CFC aerosols, mostly) with global
warming, they are, in fact, two entirely different phenomena. Since the
amount of CFCs being released world wide has dropped dramatically, and
continues to decrease, climatologists now consider the problem of the ozone
hole almost solved, it just will take time for the CFCs currently in the
stratosphere to reduce (about 10-20 years) to more natural levels. At that
point plankton levels should be rebounded handsomely.

Global warming should only be a concern in that rising sea levels will change
where the intertidal zone is, thus dropping much coral below their normal
depths. Since the sea levels have scarcely risen much, that can hardly be the
cause. Also, since as much of the die offs have been in colder coral
climates, warmth can hardly be expected to be to blame. I think that, as we
are finding with Red Tide, the die offs are not a man made problem, but a
natural one we are only now beginnning to learn about.

Your vision of a "freely contracted limited liability corporation" does not
comport with the expectation of most investors who would put their money
into a limited liabilty corporation.  Rather, what you envision really just
a matter of non-recourse contracting.  But not all economic interaction
takes place at the level of contracts.

Did you not read the rest of my post?  The following seems to have been
overlooked:

The tort-victim never contracted to accept the limited liability of the
investors in the above examples.

If investors did not have this marginal additional protection imposed by
state fiat, we could posit that the changed risk-reward ratio would likely
result in a marginal decrease in the amount of equity investement.  I find
it an intersting question whether that would be a "Good Thing" (which, to
an economist, generally equals "more efficient")

Well, obviously we will still have nukes, and I imagine we'll be able to
make them a bit smaller than we can now.  I'm not sure why we are focusing
so much on nanobots, however - IMO, systems of cheap robotics with widely
varying scales are far more effective than swarms of nanobots.

I assume that by now you've read my post about the basic obstacles here.
Nanotech really doesn't do anything to address these problems, because it is
still based on normal matter and it only works at the level of chemistry.
The opacity of matter to neutrons is not affected by chemistry - it is
purely a matter of how many atomic nuclei you can pack into a given volume.
Absorbing hard radiation is a similar issue, and of course we can't change
the behavior of the nuclei themselves.

Now, I wouldn't be surprised if someone was able to make a 1 kg nuke using
nanotech.  Making a 1 mg nuke would require a more fundamental technology -
it belongs in the same realm as FTL drives, neutronium armor, and time
machines.

BTW - That doesn't mean I dismiss any of those things as fantasy.  I just
don't expect to see any of them before the emergence of SI.

  IAN: Really?! Wasn't it you that said "a collection

  like a very radical denial of holistic structures.

Yes.  These areas could eventually lead to real memetic engineering.  The
thing that is lacking now is predictability - 90% of everything is based on
personal opinion, hunches, and guesswork.  In principle it ought to be
possible to put the field on a firmer footing than that.

Hmmm.  Not exactly.

The simple-minded view says 'intelligence is completely general, so an SI
can do anything with ease'.  I don't subscribe to that.  The opposite
informed view says 'intelligence is a composite of many different factors,
which are mostly unrelated, so the SI will still be bad at some things'.  I
don't buy that either.

This is a very long discussion to get into.  I'm writing up a full
explanation of my current theories about it at the moment - would you be
interested in a copy?

  IAN: Right, that's really weird. These people

  Those who wrote the law were democratically elected,
  thus poisoning the people was the will of the people."

If one examines the fossil record, corals historically are the hardest hit

CFC usage has been dramatically reduced only in most developing nations
(although there is a substantial black market I hear).
In developing nations, CFC's are still widely used in vast amounts.
Furthermore, a lot of these CFC's used by developing nations are
manufactured in North America! AFAIK, It is still legal to produce them,
just not to use them.
I've also read that the alternative coolants used in CFC-free countries are
almost just as detrimental to the ozone and general environment as CFC's!

It doesn't sound to me like the ozone hole will be getting any better for a
long time to come (unless we develop and deploy a method of mopping up all
the CFC's in the stratosphere)

In particular, there are three broad classes of possible controlled
thermonuclear fusion: magnetic confinement (tokamaks and the like),
inertial confinement (laser or beam implosion of pellets), and
beam fusion. Beam fusion is the best match for small-scale systems,
since the other two systems require a full-surround capture system to
extract the energy. The smallest beam reactor that achieves practical
break-even might be the size and shape of pencil. I thought we had
discussed all this about three years ago, either here on in sci.nanotech.
The basic idea is to use nanotech fabrication techniques to radically
increase the efficiency of the beam generator and the energy capture
systems.

It is this sort of reactor that is the basis of a viable small autonomous
nanotech system.

Mike, you've set off my bogometer.  This guess of yours makes absolutely
no sense.  I live down in Florida, and I am not aware of any protestors
visiting the reefs.  Protestors like to stay topside with people they
can protest towards.  We have thousands of tourist divers every year.
Why do you blame the protestors as being the carriers of human virii?

The fact of the matter is, the problem with the coral reefs is well
known to be treated sewage, which still contains human virii, making its
way out to sea.  Tons of nutrient-rich, bacteria-filled and virii-rich
effluent are produced every month.  There is no reason to assume that
any human directly carries these virii to the coral reef.

Your explanation is purely politically motivated, and has no basis in
fact.  You like to turn the tables on those pesky liberals, and show how
they are to blame for the very problems they are protesting.  The idea
of representing your political opponents as disease carriers is a very
old trick, but I don't like to see it on this list.

hi,

we recently were discussing whether society exists or not.

A related topic is "What is individualism".

I would be interested in pithy definitions: here is one to start the ball 
rolling.

"Individualism [is] the practice of living in terms of coherent desires 
under the rule of law. [It] unleashed, for better or worse, everything 
that makes the modern West dynamic and innovative."
Kenneth Minogue (Emeritus Professor of Political Science, University of 
London), 1999, 'Times Literary Supplement', 8 i.

Not far short of Ayn Rand. Coherent desires is good. Law is good, but 
Minogue's definition doesn't specify the law system.

Who can do better?

best,
tim

LOUISVILLE, Kentucky (CNN) -- A team of surgeons has performed
the first hand transplant in the United States, attaching a donor hand,
wrist and portion of a forearm to a 37-year-old man. 

"there are many doctors who, technically, could perform the surgery,
 but are held back by ethical complications."

<sigh>

"In September in Lyon, France, a team doctors transplanted a donor hand
to a 48- year-old New England man in a 13-hour surgery. 
The procedure has raised questions from medical ethicists and some
surgeons who question whether a non-vital body part such as a hand
should be transplanted."

So these people will tell you that it's OK to remain quadriplegic, because
the alternative will challenge their ethical prejudices, even if the parts are
available, and you are ready to pay for the procedure?  Somebody should
start tearing their non-essential body parts off - maybe it'll help these
people change their [non-essential] minds...

See story at
http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9901/25/hand.transplant.02/

Also I would use the opportunity to remind of a little proposal for the
"Mutual Organ Donation Society" that I suggested awhile ago:

billy's comment is right.  nuclear reactors dont scale down, nor do nuclear
bombs.  a certain critical mass is required.  thought experiment: imagine
scaling
a fusion weapon all the way down to two atoms of plutonium 238.  each one has
a 50% chance of sitting there acting like any other nonradioactive atom in any
given 88 year period, and putting the two next to each other doesnt change
anything.  if one decays, the other one will most probably not be impressed.
nanotech will not have nuclear as an option for power.  spike

I would think that gift-giving is an extremely old tradition,
but much of these gifts came as personal services (I fix
your fence or feed you), or hand-made memorable things.
The idea that only brand-new, shrink-wrapped things are
any good, and that you should spend all your money to
buy these things of certain types for all occasions for
your colleagues, neighbors, relatives, friends, etc. etc.,
seems quite new and following from the commercial
culture.   In Russia which I was so fortunate to observe
before the commercialization (though not quite shielded
from commercial memes) these tendencies were much
less pronounced.

Another reason for expensive wasteful activities, IMO, is
the mundane memetic pressure.  Just like fish and peacocks
grow their tails out of all practical proportions, many cultural
traditions tend to exaggerate their symbolic messages, and
put extreme amount of effort into cultural rituals.
All advertising has to do is to guide this energy a little by
suggesting that wasteful practices should be based on 
buying stuff (as opposed to physical activities, sacrifices,
and other non-consuming activities that find little advertising
interest).  The conservatism of tradition seems to go
hand-in-hand with the conservatism of industry interests and
investments.

I think that a matter-antimatter bomb would exhibit the same efficiency
(energy per unit mass) regardless of size.  A single proton meeting a
single antiproton would release the same amount of energy per gram as
would a larger matter-anti-matter sample.

Yeah, but a bunch of nanobots can link arms and turn themselves into
robots on any desired scale - and self-repair, and disintegrate into a
cloud of dust if anyone comes looking.  That's part of what I meant
about it being absurd to say that nanotech is less powerful than
macrotech.  Nanobots can simulate robots any time, and the simulations
can do things that blunt robots can't.

Title
  Vitamin supplementation for 1 year improves mood.
Source
  Neuropsychobiology.  32(2):98-105, 1995.
Abstract
  The possibility that the taking of vitamin supplements may influence mood was
  explored. One hundred and twenty-nine young healthy adults took either 10
  times the recommended daily dose of 9 vitamins, or a
  placebo, under a double-blind procedure, for a year. Males taking the
  vitamins differed from those taking the placebo in that they
  reported themselves as feeling more 'agreeable' after 12 months. After 12
  months the mood of females taking the vitamin supplement was significantly
  improved in that they felt more 'agreeable', more composed and reported
  better mental health. These changes in mood after a year occurred even though
  the blood status of 9 vitamins reached a plateau after 3
  months: this improvement in mood was associated in particular with improved
  riboflavin and pyridoxine status. In females baseline thiamin status was
  associated with poor mood and an improvement in thiamin status after 3 months
  was associated with improved mood.

Title
  Macronutrient relationships with meal patterns and mood in the spontaneous
  feeding behavior of humans.
Source
  Physiology & Behavior.  39(5):561-9, 1987.
Abstract
  The role of protein, carbohydrate and fat ingestion on self-rated mood and
  subsequent food intake was investigated using self-reports of spontaneous
  food intake. Eight male and 30 female undergraduate students were instructed
  to list everything they ate, when they ate it, and their mood at the time of
  ingestion. They were asked to make these entries in a diary throughout a nine
  day period. Mood was rated at the beginning of each meal on three seven point
  scales; elated-depressed, tired-energetic, and anxious-tranquil. The amount
  of protein, carbohydrate, and fat as well as the total amount of food energy
  in each meal and the intermeal intervals (IMIs) prior to and following the
  meals were calculated with a computerized analysis. The energy content and
  the amount of each of the macronutrients contained in the stomach at the
  beginning and end of each meal was estimated with a mathematical model. These
  data were then intercorrelated using bivariate and multivariate techniques.
  Momentary self-rated mood was not found to be related to prior macronutrient
  intake nor was it predictive of subsequent intake. Long term macronutrient
  intake, averaged over the nine recording days, was found to be related to the
  averaged mood of the subjects. Although no significant relationships were
  found between the absolute amounts of the macronutrients ingested and mood,
  significant correlations were found between the proportion of each
  macronutrient in the diet and the overall self-rated mood.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

Ah yes, like the T-1000 "liquid metal" prototype vs the standard

Hmm, human viruses, are they a problem for corals? I thought they
tended to be species-specific. Although treated sewage might of course
contain plenty of bacteria disturbing the chemical balance, as well as
huge amounts of bacteriophages. Hmm, it might also attract bdellovibro
bacteria (fast swimming predator bacteria) that attack the wrong
species.

Energy densities - what do you power the nanolaser with? Remember that
it has to be strong enough to do damage. Besides, tiny apertures
likely diffract a lot.

Meanwhile, banks and other security-conscious organisations are heading
towards using hand-prints for ID. Is it just me, or are they totally
clue-deficient? I really don't want my hand stolen along with my ATM card

Hate to tell you, but plutionium doesn't fuse, it fissions. Fusion bombs use
low-mass atoms like deuterium and tritium. Also, isn't 239 the isotope used
in fission bombs?

An equivalent thought experiment for fusion bombs would be to take two 
atoms of deuterium, and use lasers to push them together at high speed. Do
it right, and they will fuse. The lower limits for fusion bombs are
technical rather than theoretical.

Firstly, the US backpack nukes were man-portable, so I'd say 50kg as an 
upper limit; I have the approximate figures somewhere, but not close to 
hand. Secondly, they were fission bombs (or possibly fusion-boosted
fission) with lots of shielding to protect the user from the radiation
from the decaying uranium. Nanofusion bombs shouldn't require anywhere
near as much shielding; little to none if you aren't concerned about
radiation detectors.

As a rule of thumb, the potential yield of nuclear explosives is about a
million times higher than an equivalent mass of chemical explosives; so a
well-designed bomb with one gram of fusion fuel should have a yield around 
a ton... the mass of the laser initiatiors, etc, is another question. So my
mosquito estimate was at least an order of magnitude too large, but it 
should still be able to produce a yield up to hundreds of kilos of TNT.

Somehow I think you will have the time to report the theft (or your
sudden absence noticed) long before the recipient can use it in an
ATM. Remember, surgery takes long time to heal.

Uh-huh. And are people buying them today because of the advertising decades
ago, or because of the tradition created back then? And did the advertising
decades ago create a demand, or merely expand the tradition of rich people
giving expensive rings when they got married into the middle class? If all
diamond ads were to stop today, would people stop buying diamond engagement
rings?

So you're saying that people didn't wash or paint their faces before the
advertisers began advertising soap and makeup? Hate to tell you, but my
ancestors were painting their faces back when the Romans invaded, though
admittedly they probably didn't wash much. You think washing is bad and
unneccesary?

And people buy PCs because of the interesting things they can do with it;
they don't buy PCs just because they saw an ad and rushed out to buy one
even though it didn't do anything interesting, as Galbraith's theory
would require.

>The most effective demand-creation advertising can be very subtle,

You honestly think people start smoking and drinking because they see
an ad and think, 'Hey, I'll start smoking today', and not because of the
effects of alcohol and tobacco on their bodies? Every human society on
this planet uses drugs of some kind, and few of them have advertising
agencies.

ALL of your examples are people buying things which serve a purpose to
them at the time. The only Galbraith theory example I can see is, as I've
said before, kids seeing toys advertised on TV and pushing their parents
to buy them, even though they'll be dumped after a few hours use. If those
ads were to stop, parents would stop buying those toys... if Microsoft ads
were to stop, people would still buy PCs. If soap ads were to stop, people
would still buy soap. If alcohol ads were to stop, people would still buy
alcohol. How many other things would people stop buying if they were no
longer advertised?

Is it? Last time I looked, there were plenty of empirical studies. The
problem seems to be how to create useful theories and frameworks, this
is where more work is likely needed.

Perhaps something like cognitive therapy, you instruct one group of
subjects in a certain mental technique or a schemata, another just
gets a spiel about critical thinking and a third nothing, and then you
expose them to a meme or other form of persuasion and study how many
are convinced.

I've seen this cited a few times as though it proved something.  Do we have
any reason to suppose Paul Krugman (a biologist I'm unfamiliar with) knows
what he's talking about in this respect?  Leaving aside the flip generality
of the remark, presumably meant to be funny rather than literally accurate,
it's absurd to dismiss a whole approach to evolutionary theory filiated
with, say, Richard Lewontin and Niles Eldredge; all three biologists have
copious and frequently-cited formal publications.

There's a fairly long article disparaging Gould at:

http://humanitas.ucsb.edu/users/steen/Debate/CEP_Gould.html

with comments from biologists I have heard of. Personally I've never met 
a biologist who had anything much good to say about him, but maybe they're
wrong.

Unfortunately the containment problem will likely cause scaling
effects. My guess is that the container / antimatter ratio will go up
a lot as you shrink the device.

As a theoretical assassin, I would go for poisons rather than nuclear
weapons for my mosquitos.

    I'd be willing to bet the doctors who are concerned have all their body
parts. Besides, cut off their dominant hand and see how fast they would stop
calling a hand 'non-essential'.
    I don't see anything about _why_ they feel it is more ethical to
transplant a heart compared to a hand. Why its more ethical to bury a hand
and let it rot than give it someone who needs one.

Excellent reference!  Perhaps you should have mentioned that the long
letter there is by John Tooby and Leda Cosmides, two powerful players in
current evolutionary psychology, and their cite from the wonderful John
Maynard Smith is especially telling.  Gould must be stinging.

No, the argument (as I understand it) is that such surgery currently
requires life-long major immune suppression.  Without a heart, you die
anyway.  Without a hand, you are majorly inconvenienced, but not nearly as
badly as by having yr immune system deliberately knocked out - for life
(however long that then happens to be).

    At http://www.handtransplant.com (clever name), they have a few
articles. Apparently the ethical concern is because of the risks involved
with the immuno-suppressants. They feel the risks are warranted only when
the patient will die without the transplant.
    There was also a mention of whether doctors would "'market' themselves
and make money". They didn't go into that further but perhaps they feel some
doctors would not fully inform a potential patient of the risks.
    I question the ethics of telling someone they can't have a procedure
done because someone else doesn't like it :-)

Well, I had expected that that might be the case, using conventional nuclear
weapons tech. However, putting a small amount in a neutron confining chamber and
using magnetrons or other compact accelerator devices to raise the radiation
levels might be used to increase the fissile probabilities...

Yes, chemical/bio devices are much more efficient on a personal basis than
nuclear. There are plenty of toxins which are lethal in small ppm doses. The
skin secretions of some south american tree frogs are supposedly lethal at
the microgram level.

Christmas as it is currently practiced is almost entirely the result of
advertising. The day was picked because it was the Saturnalia of the
pagans, so as to help rub out vestiges of the old religion, but it was
still treated as a day to party hard and fornicate for hundreds of
years. The current gift giving family oriented Christmas was the result
of propaganda campaigns in the early 1800's in the early newsprint.

The people I have seen in the media protesting the coral die offs are sport
divers who are also environmentalists. Of course, I should always take what I
see in the media with a heavy dose of salt. I don't doubt that sewage and
agricultural runoff is responsible for some of it, however if that were all it
was, solving the problem would be easy. However, sewage was blamed for the red
tide phenomenon not so long ago, when it turned out to be caused by a change in
deep sea upwelling currents caused by a hurricane back in the 70's which
changed shoal patterns around on the east coast....people in the gulf of mexico
blame oil exploration for all of the gunk that floats around, when the majority
is due to the large amount of natural oil seeps that are present, plus the fact
that the geography makes the gulf a natural wind trap for all of the garbage in
the sea...

Sorry, but using gems as a dowry to purchase the right to marry a female
is an old tradition going back thousands of years BC.  Although it fits
this lists politics to blast advertisers for creating public thought, in
this case it doesn't fit the facts.

Again, sorry.  Native Americans used shampoos from the yucca tree long
before chemical companies told them to.  The bible mentions
face-painting, lip painting, eye-painting, shaving, and using pleasant
scents on the body.  These practices are also thousands of years old.
Again, what you say sounds good in the course of conversation, but with
a little thought you will realize that these claims are obviously false.

I hope you aren't going to claim that alcohol and tobacco are newly

No, I'm not saying any such thing. I'm pointing out that when a term is
defined too broadly, it loses the power to discriminate between referents
of the term and non-referents, since everything comes to be subsumed under
the term. IOW, it loses its meaning. Clear meaning requires distinctions.

If - as it seems under your definition - anything (using "thing" in its
broadest possible sense) is an "entity", what do we need the word for? What
term shall we use to distinguish physical objects from mere collections of
objects, for example? Or things "out there" from concepts or percepts?

I believe I'm using the word "entity" in more or less the usual way, to
refer to a physical object. To me, your use of the word is just plain
confusing.

Me:

Just exactly how is it a denial of the existence of holistic structures to
observe that they don't constitute physical objects in their own right? I
suppose you think I don't believe in beauty or love either, because they're
not physical objects.

Ian, I've agreed to disagree on the definition of entity. Why do you keep
insisting that everyone play only on your terms (pun intended)? It seems
that we probably agree more or less in essence, but we're spinning our
wheels on semantic oil slicks. Can we get some traction here?

Toward clarity,
Dick

I had my facts straight the first time: the specific "tradition" of
the diamond engagement ring was created and popularized by DeBeers
in the 50s.  Before that, the only similar tradition in Western
culture was the Jewish "bet" of silver.

Again, you're off the subject: underarm deodorants were first
created by Gillette, whose advertising created the term "B.O."
among other additions to our culture.  Before that, perfumes were
common, but deodorants/antiperspirants were not.  Shampoos you
might be right about, though I doubt the Native Americans were
big on conditioners and creme rinses.  Yes, makeup has been
around a long time, but not in its modern forms with moisturizers,
exfoliants, and other modern pseudo-science.

I do think thousands of teens might never have tried smoking if
they hadn't seen "cool" actors doing it.  That may not be demand
"creation", but certainly expansion--as opposed to brand preference.

Look at it like this:  you bring up evidence of the transplant, someone

Maybe not that quickly, but it works.  Kinda like losing your license or

I have seen the size of the nucleus relative to the size of the atom
as being comparable to the size of a fly relative to the size of a
football stadium.  Imagine trying to shoot two football stadia at each
other with enough accuracy that the flies in the middle hit, especially
when the flies repel each other.  This is the difficulty of fusion by
atomic collision.

With compression, we have a collection of football stadia, and a
compression wave comes in from the outside, squeezing the stadia together.
You can see that the compression has to be extremely strong in order to
get two flies near each other, and even then you probably need a lot
of stadia involved to improve the chances.  This is the difficulty of
fusion by compression.

With fission, a fly splits, and some sub-fly-sized particles go flying
out.  Clearly with two atoms near each other, the chance of one fly
particle hitting the fly at the middle of the other is extremely remote.
That is why you normally need a whole lot of stadia, so that there is
some reasonable chance of a fly particle happening to strike another fly
at such distances.  This is the difficulty of fission by critical mass.

Various tricks have been proposed to improve the situation.  With muon
catalyzed fusion, the size of the atoms is reduced by replacing the
electrons with muons.  Instead of a fly in a football stadium, it's like
a fly in a closet.  Now there is a significant possibility for flies
in adjacent closets to get near each other, although you still probably
need a large number of atoms to give you good odds.

Cold fusion was supposed to inject more flies into the system, but clearly
even if we could increase the density of flies by a factor of 2 or even 10,
the rate of fusion would still be very small, and again you would need a
lot of atoms.

Maybe some tricks could be used to help with fission.  If we could somehow
control the direction of the fly particles, we might increase the chance
of them hitting other flies.  Maybe some quantum tricks, magnetism or
something similar, could help with that.  I haven't heard of any research
along those lines.

Better start cloning hands then (uh oh, that wouldn't be "ethical",
would it!). By the way, I've noticed that even in the Western world
prosthetic limbs tend to be rather ugly and impractical (and often
expensive too), although even some fairly basic tech could turn them
into handy add-ons. Especially prosthetic hands offer lots of
interesting possibilities like integrated phones, computers, life/
health monitors, weapon systems (mace and stun gun for example, 
or something more powerful), compartments to stash medications,
money etc. etc. Having a useful, "space age" tool instead of a just 
an ugly piece of plastic/tubing attached to your body should make 
the [patient's] psychological adaptation process easier too.

Hi,

Have any of you seen research on the long term effects of exposure to
ubiquitous environmental factors on longevity?

For instance,

What is the long term effect if any of rubbing cleansers (soap) on your
skin. Is there subtle penetration past the skin barrier? If so, does the
body react defensively? Does the continual, daily reduction of oils and
changing of Ph levels cause the body to go on a long term homeostatis
maintaining sojourn that over time causes difficult to identify systemic, ie
autoimmune effects? To test my question, I have been avoiding the use of
soap while showering. Since I'm a gold collar worker, there is no grime in
this. I know, I know - you're all glad email is non-olfactory ;-) But
truthfully I have not "sensed" any actual difference in odor, cleanliness or
other well being issues, nor have folks been avoiding me that I can detect.
I have been changing clothes more frequently as a social precaution. Test
has been proceeding for one week.

What if any is the long term effect of detergent residues and dry cleaning
chemical residues on clothing?

What is the long term effect of sleeping on billions of dust mites and
inhaling their feces on our autoimmune systems? Does a continual battle with
these allergens eventually cause early flame out of immune production
systems due to limits (ie Hayflick)? Does the immune regulatory system get
tired of the whole thing, and decide the simplest way to fix the problem is
to stop fighting the allergen, and self destruct?

Has anyone ever done a test for dust mite and mite allergen concentrations
in human clothing? other parasites?

Much of the commentary and conjecture of the list, and my own areas of
interest have been related to nutrition, and genetic/endochrin
interventions. However, perhaps some of these proactive efforts are
necessitated because of lifelong, habituations which have outlived their
usefulness - which if identified, and modified/replaced/eliminated might
provide elimination of causes.

I think cran is an example of the above. By practicing CRAN, I have
eliminated many ills and pains of my body due to purely Biomechanical
improvements...ie my upper - inner thighs no longer rub together whenever I
walk...thus, my stride is straighter, thus, I am not over-rotating my lower
joints extremities, and am not overpronating my feet to counteract the shock
of extra weight. Thus I have less pain, feel better, and love life more.

No....seriously,
Dave Gobel

There are reasons for this. Basically, the advanced designs tend to be
too easily broken or tricky to maintain, there is no huge need to keep
the prosthesis completely natural if it can be covered by
clothing. Muscle- or nerve-controlled prosthesises are actually not
that popular in comparision with mechanical ones, simply because of
short battery lifetimes and unreliability. Sure, things like that are
changing, but remember that we are talking about devices that have to
work almost all the time in fairly rough conditions.

I think much of this can be done at the request of the patient at the
local prosthetical engineering workshop (after all, prosthesises are
heavily customized by definition), but most people seem content to
just get some of the functionality back, not add new. Maybe we could
spread awareness of the possibilities among the handicapped? But don't
get too surprised if they turn out to be conservative; I have found by
personal experience that handicapped people are often extremely
down-to-earth, practical and sceptical of technological fixes.

Living "under the rule of law" sounds hypocritical (if not entirely silly)
to me. Conservatives in America like to assert that they live by the "rule
of law, not the rule of men" but who makes the laws? Actually, "We the
people" founded the US, not "We the law." Since lawyers (legislators) make
the laws, and people become lawyers, this extra layer of governance serves
to obscure the fact that the ruling class decides how people live (and
sometimes _which_ people live).

Society means one person's relationship to another.

To paraphrase Scott Adams, who may well have outdone Prof. Minogue, "There
are two types of people in the world: the bright and attractive people like
yourself who participate in the Extropy mailing list, and the 6 billion
idiots who get in our way. Since we're outnumbered, it's a good idea not to
refer to them as idiots to their faces. A devious Extropy list reader
suggested calling them 'In-duh-viduals' instead. The advantage to this word
is that you can insult someone without risk of retribution. Example:

You: You're quite an Induhvidual, Jethro.

Jethro: Thank you.

"If you're not already surrounded by Induhviduals, you will be soon. New
ones are being born every minute, despite the complexity involved in
breeding. Frankly, I think much of the procreation of Induhviduals happens
purely by accident when two of them are trying to do something
complicated -- like jump-start a car -- and they suddenly get confused.
Whatever causes the breeding -- and I truly don't want to know the
details -- it's safe to assume there will be more of it.

"The way I see it, you have three good strategies for thriving in a future
full of Induhviduals:

1. Wear loose clothing and pretend your car battery is dead.
2. Keep Induhviduals in your car so you can use the car-pool lane.
3. Harness the stupidity of Induhviduals for your own financial gain.

"Option one is dangerous. I recommend that you stay away from anything that
involves Induhviduals, electricity, and sex. It's just common sense.

"Option two requires you to be in your car with Induhviduals for long

Mike, this is not a theoretical problem.  We, in Florida, are really
having a problem with effluent run-off killing coral.  If you think the
solution is easy, please enlighten us.  We have tons of run-off weekly,
and no one knows how to radically reduce it or change its composition.
How would solving this problem be easy?

You really believe that garbage naturally collects in the Gulf without
humans actually dumping garbage?  You really believe that anybody can
confuse natural oil seeps with spills of highly-refined petrolium
products?  You have been listening to too much Rush Limbaugh.  You
probably believe that El Nino and La Nina are liberal political
theories, and that NASA fakes its satellite data as part of the Clinton
criminal conspiracy.

Sorry, but I live and grew up in Florida.  I studied biology at Florida
Tech., and they specialize in Oceanography, performing a lot of work
around Florida.  None of the crack-pot theories you have cited are
heavily pushed in the scientific sector.  I hear these kinds of theories
from Republicans more than Biologists.

Most of the free-thinkers on this group and in the Libertarian Party
like to blast the mainstream public for being sheep, following the herd,
and doing what they're told.  It is a common theme to point out a common
assumption that was really a meme invented and engineered for a covert
purpose.  It is an attempt to show that one's own political viewpoint
avoids the common fallacies and focusses on the truth.  This is a common
technique, seen here and elsewhere, and I'm suprised that anyone
questions that this is happening.  I'm afraid that this list is no more
immune to spinning and political posturing than any other.

Take my comments with as much salt as you like, given that I tout no formal
degrees in economics, but think that Krugman fairly well botched the "network
externalities" issue.  The mere fact that he calls them "externalities"
reveals error.  Liebowitz & Margolis convincingly argue that "network
*effects*"  more properly fits the phenomena.  We amatuers may regard that as
an arcane distinction, but surely professional economists should use
consistent and accurate terminology.

Krugman has moreover made highly suspect and hotly controverted claims of
having pioneered the idea of network effects, has bought into the QWERTY myth
too uncritically, and has failed to revisit his views in the face of new and
contradictory evidence.

So goes my opinion--an opinion you may rightly discount--of Krugman's work in
one area.  He may get a great deal right on other fronts, of course, and even
good economists make mistakes from time to time.  Query, though, whether
Krugman knows much about biology.  I recall thinking that his criticisms of
bioeconomics were about half-right.

Well, haven't you ever thought that your organism is a wisely

cleansers are no more harmful to your skin than the air that you breath 
in every second? (especially, since you live in an urban area, 
presumably)
Honestly, I am inclined to think that if you would put an organism into 
an absolutely sterile (which is impossible) area, this poor organism 
would have died. In order to maintain the immune system of any organism 
in order, this organism needs to be exposed to some kind of attack... 
let it be soap...ha-ha

We all like to think that we can be beautiful, smart, and destined for much
better things.  It's a noble dream.  But it is pathetic to see it turned into
so much petty downlooking on others.  It's the begining of complacent
snobbery.  If you do not like your position in the pecking order this kind of
attitude could be your theme on a "comfortable" way down. (Lucifer Principle)
Complacency is a waste of time.  In addition to being sorta lewd - like
yanking your genitals out in public.

Hmmm, lets see an "in-duh-vidual" named "Jethro" and a suggestion to "wear
loose clothing".  Yeah right.  Doesn't take a rocket scientist to connect the
dots.  Pretty lame piece, but mildly amusing.  Being a criminal defense
lawyer, I have dealt with a few of your "in-duh-viduals".  Yes they are out
there.  But it might surprise you that many of them can describe themselves
much better than you can.  Sometimes it is just that funny.  Sometimes it is
even funnier.  And sometimes it just isn't.

Did I take this too seriously?  Perhaps.  But it was either that or take it as
a joke, and that just wasn't as fun.  In my frame of reference it just wasn't
nearly as funny as reality and the fact that SOMEBODY must think this is
funny.  Now that's funny!

Here's my definition, for what it's worth:

 Individualism is the idea that the individual is ontologically primary and
exists in her own right and for her own sake; as opposed to the view that
individuals are properly subordinate in some sense to the society in which
they take part.

Does "very good economist" mean he knows how to
construct models?  Krugman is certainly very good at
being a controversial talking head...  The following

Subj: Krugman vs Econ Profession on Hayek as
Economist (quotes)
Fri, 4 Dec 1998 13:43 Greg Ransom Gregransom@AOL.COM

"Friedrich Hayek and Joseph Schumpeter have many
modern admirers .. But were they great economists?  I
don't think so.  Hayek's stand against the political
currents of his time took courage and has been partly
vindicated by history.  But if one asks what
substantive contributions he made to our
understanding of how the world works, one is left at
something of a loss."  Paul Krugman, _Slate_, Dec. 2,
1998

[CUT - huge number of quotes from distinguished
economists citing Hayek's insights as essential to
their own work.]

Krugman's Knowledge & Understanding of Hayek's Work,
Nov. 9, 1998

I did have some conceptual bones to pick with
[Krugman], and over the course of the afternoon he
responded with good humor and even at times gave a
little ground -- such as on his long-held opinion
about the speed limits on economic growth.  But on
one point, he stone-walled. I objected to his having
written that, before John Maynard Keynes came along,
the world's understanding of recessions was "in a
state of arrested development."  Wasn't he familiar
with the Austrian theory of business cycles, as set
forth by Ludwig von Mises, Friederich Hayek .. ?  He
allowed that he wasn't, implying that such ideas were
off his radar screen, since they couldn't be
expressed mathematically."

Well. The result of any good advertising push can be meassured and tested
scientifically. It is true that we in the advertising industry don't know
yet exactly what makes a campaign work. But we are shurely not entirely
clueless. Advertising works! Period.

In the classical theory of market economy many producers are in competition
for many consumers, and price is the balancing mechanism. It is a vital part
of this idea that both producers and consumers have perfect information.
This is where marketing comes in handy. We skew the information enough that
the customers BELIEVE that the product we are promoting is superior.

That is what makes brand marketing so effective. We tell the customers again
and again that a brand is better than the others. We tell that it has a
bigger value than other brands. Thus the brand becomes a short cut in
communication with the customers.

A brand is a combination of:
Features (what the product is)
Customer benefits (what needs and and wants the product meets)
Values (what the customer associates with the product.)

A brand is is created when marketing adds values to a product, and in the
process differentiates it from products with similar features and benefits.

Diamonds are a good example. For a long time De Beers in South africa have
had a de facto monopoly on the distribution of diamonds. Thus they have been
able to controll the supply of diamonds. By marketing the "value" of
diamonds they have created a high demand, and by keeping the supply of
diamonds just under the demand they have kept prices high. Actually De Beers
has a $1 billion worth of diamonds in their vaults that they keep of the
market to keep the prices high. If they would decide to sell these diamonds
the value would fall considerably.

Coca Cola is another good example. Here in Denmark they have a market
penetration of 80% All of the other Cola brands share the remaining 20% This
is despite the fact that more than 55% like another brand better in
blindtests. (We are marketing this competing Cola product called Jolly Cola)
So much for the free market vs. marketing. Coca Cola has made a darn good
branding campaign for the last decades that is hard to counter.

So don't doubt that marketing works. It even uses scientific rationalism if
it is done professionally. A lot of marketing guys do believe that it is an
art though, but their results are not good in the long run.

Further to my earlier question about very subtle long term exposures/effects
of seemingly innocuous commonplace stuff:

I have been taking Nicotinic Acid to promote microvascular dilation and
peripheral blood flow among other benefits. One of the side effect of this
nutrient is that it triggers a histimine reaction resulting in red flushing
of the skin, along with sometimes intense itching.

Two days ago I had taken 250mg, and while the flush was proceeding, I
removed my clothes (in privacy) and looked in a full length mirror. I was
surprised to find that the flush region was stopped cold just at the
boundary where the elastic in my underwear had been. Beet red above...normal
pink etc below. In all my dreams, I never would have predicted that the
elastic in my underwear could have acted as a body dam "choking off" the
flushing.

So, what else might it, and belts, and girdles and bras etc be choking off,
and are there any studies that even attempt to investigate the effects of
such constrictions which folks consider to be normal.

I think this is wrong. I seem to recall that surgical maggots are bred
under sterile conditions, and naked mice require sterile surroundings
since they lack immune systems (well, only the T part, but anyway...).

It is not unreasonable to think that it is good to give the immune
system stimuli; one theory of the rise of allergies in Scandinavia is
that we have too few cases of parasites, making the mast cells
hypersensitive and causing allergies (the underutilized cells simply
start to hunt random antigens). This theory is not well supported,
though.

That's a far cry from the claim that commercial advocacy somehow "makes"
people buy things, or creates out of thin air a desire for some product.

The obvious (and economic) explanation for the success of advertising is
that it provides information (or arguably, in some cases, disinformation)
on which people base decisions on how to allocate their wealth. The
illusion of demand "creation" arises from that fact that there can be no
actual market demand for something that's not known to exist. Another way
to look at it is as an activation of "latent" demand.

That's evident, unfortunately.

  IAN: Like rocks, galaxies are distinct *collective 
  entities* defined, as each unique galaxy is, by the 
  ordering of its members. Are galaxies confusing? Can 
  we not define "galaxy" since such is a collective
  entity? Merriam Webster's seems to think that 
  we can. So I'm really can see your point in 
  saying "collective entity" is confusing.

  Clearly, no problem or logical confusion with the 
  definition of "collective entity" as "the ordering 
  of individuals in a system" as been demonstrated,
  which isn't to say that a problem can't be found.

  IAN: You've supported a case against there being
  a "collective entity" that is without content.
  You deny "collective entity" and then don't,
  so I'm loosing exactly what your point is.


>Ian, I've agreed to disagree on the definition of entity. Why do you keep
>insisting that everyone play only on your terms (pun intended)? 


  IAN: When did I insist? I reply to your responses 
  just as you reply to mine, so it sounds like your
  saying you want me to stop making my case. You've
  not shown that "collective entity" is an illusion.

A (possible) quibble...from a truck driver.

Aren't you referring to fission? It seems to me that fusion might actually
scale down.  After all...the minimium ingredients are two hydrogen atoms.

 I thought "Republicans" were a variant on a noxious political subspecies. (
While a "Biologist" was something else). Why would the Yellow Bellied

A sane seed AI presents more of a threat to humanity than does an insane AI
because a sane AI would function at extreme variance to the insane human
cultures which prevail on Earth. No joke.

Nice, but not quite radical enough for me.  Not only to /I/ exist in my
own right and for my own sake, but /everything/ in the universe exists
only for my own personal benefit.  I choose to interact with others and
participate in societies only insofar as it serves my selfish interests.
Apparent altruism and benevolence are just rational methods of serving
my long-term goals.

     I think that this reminds me a great deal of the argument about
chance versus determinism, where from one point of view the whole of
the univers could (in theory)  be extrapolated out from it's physical
laws, and the other says that you couldn't- that chance or free will
or whatever plays a role. 
     The question of whether you are more a part of a social organism
or more a unit of your own is seemingly irrelevant.  For from either
viewpoint you can see a method by which it can alter the whole.  It is
my own surmisal that there are individuals who have enacted
manipulation of the societal organism, and also that the social
organism has altered the state of individuals.  I think that the
social organism has evolved where the individual peices can react to
stimuli and transmit it to the organic mechani independantly-that the
two are indistinguishable or equally true.  I think you could really
build an accurate model from either view, and that it might not be so
much a distinction of reality as a distinction of personal opinion.  I
am, however _extremely_ open to correction

Excuse my ignorance, but what is CRAN?  I have not heard of it
previously, ansd was curious....
This discussion seems pretty far to be interesting, and I am not sure
how to contribute, exactly.....There was an item in a magazine dating
from the 50's stating that accidental ingestion of toothpaste could
cause bone deformities in the long run, but not having verified this,
I do not know whether it is relevant OR factual.

I don't follow the question.  I was implying that Biologists know more
than Republicans about biology.  I was not comparing Republicans and
Democrats.

You are confusing my claim (first above) with someone else's claim
(second above).  My claim is true.  The other claim is bogus.  They are
indeed far apart.

The microvascular dilation you mention occurs very close to the surface
of the skin.  The next time you do this, try touching your skin where it
is red.  You will see a white fingerprint for a second.  The lightest
touch of the skin can push the tiny amount of blood out of the upper
layers of skin.  You are correct in observing that the elastic blocks
the flushing effect.  It probably is not blocking regular blood flow in
the skin.  Your concern that clothes can block blood flow is
well-founded.  Studies have measured a decrease in blood flow in men
wearing ties around the neck.

It's very hard to study these things.  The general rule is that if your body
can't degrade or eliminate a toxin (chlorinated aromatics, heavy metals,
soot and asbestos particulates) chronic exposure often creates long-term
effects.  Where the body can degrade the toxin (most detergents, dust mites)
you generally can't find an effect, the main exception being the development
of allergic sensitivity under certain still-undefined circumstances.

GOOD NEWS! I've learned that Section 1520 of Title 50 
Chapter 23 was REPEALED on November 18, 1997! However,
the Cornell Law School on-line library has NOT updated 
the U.S. Code since then, even though it says at their
site that "Updated information will be added here within 
24 hours of its availability from the House," suggesting
that shortly after laws are passed or repealed they'll be 
posted, but in fact over 9,000 hours have passed so far.
The problem is that the House hasn't made it available.

No search engine I've used can find the fact that 1520 
was repealed. All on-line government archives I've found 
list the old law as law. However, I discovered that 1520 
was repealed thanks to someone who accessed a pay-for-
use on-line law resource. Section 1520 was replaced with 
1520(a), which was sent to me (quoted below in full).

Many webpages of private researchers cite Section 1520, 
and Art Bell mentioned it last evening. Many of those
who are interested in 1520 are not aware of its repeal,
so please send this message to anyone not aware of such!

Interesting that the now-repealed Section 1520 of Title 
50 (which allowed chemical warfare testing on "civilian 
populations") was enacted under Jimmy Carter's term in 
1977 (not 1996), which seems interesting to me in light
of the fact that Carter has such a humanitarian image. 

Here's the replacement law. My only problem with it is 
that the ONLY entity it prohibits from conducting tests 
on civilian populations is the Secretary of the Defense, 
yet bio-warfare-related laws often cite the President as
the ultimate conductor of actions, yet the new law does 
not place any prohibition on the President or any other 
federal official except the Secretary of the Defense.


============= U.S. CODE TITLE 50, SECTION 1520(a) =================


S 1520.  Repealed. Pub L. 105-85, Div. A, Title X, S 1078(g), Nov. 
18, 1997, 111 Stat. 1916


S 1520a.  Restriction on the use of human subjects for testing of 
chemical or biological agents

(a) Prohibited activities

  The Secretary of Defense may not conduct (directly or by contract)-
   (1)  any test or experiment involving the use of a chemical agent or
biological agent on a civilian population; or
   (2)  any other testing of a chemical agent or biological agent on human
subjects.

(b)  Exceptions

  Subject to subsections (c), (d), and (e) of this section, the prohibition
in subsection (a) of this section does not apply to a test or experiment
carried out for any of the following purposes:
   (1)  Any peaceful purpose that is related to a medical, therapeutic,
pharmaceutical, agricultural, industrial, or research activity.
   (2)  Any purpose that is directly related to protection against toxic
chemicals or biological weapons and agents.
   (3)  Any law enforcement purpose, including any purpose related to riot
control.

(c)  Informed consent required

  The Secretary of Defense may conduct a test or experiment described in
subsection (b) of this section only if informed consent to the testing was
obtained from each human subject in advance of the testing on that subject.

(d)  Prior notice to Congress

  Not later than 30 days after the date of final approval within the
Department of Defense of plans for any experiment or study to be conducted
by the Department of Defense (whether directly or under contract) involving
the use of human subjects for the testing of a chemical agent or a
biological agent, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committee on
Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on National Security of the
House of Representatives a report setting forth a full accounting of those
plans, and the experiment or study may then be conducted only after the end
of the 30-day period beginning on the date such report is received by those
committees.

(e)  Biological agent defined

  In this section, the term "biological agent" means any micro-organism
(including bacteria, viruses, fungi, rickettsiac, or protozoa), pathogen,
or infectious substance, and any naturally occurring, bioengineered, or
synthesized component of any such micro-organism, pathogen, or infectious
substance, whatever its origin or method of production, that is capable of
causing--
   (1)  death, disease, or other biological malfunction in a human, an
animal, a plant, or another living organism;
   (2)  deterioration of food, water, equipment, supplies, or materials of
any kind; or
   (3)  deleterious alteration of the environment.

OK, basically I have three comments here.

One, if it's really that bad, I'm going to side with the AIs.
It's the sane thing to do.

Two, an insane AI would be insane in a totally different way than _us_,
and might function at a variance that would not only be extreme, but
also randomly destructive.

Three, no matter how insane we are, we're still trying.  I think there
really are a few things we've got right.  We may still be insane, but
we're saner than in medieval times.  A sane AI would have at least that
much in common.  An insane AI would have nothing in common at all.

That's a nice definition, though I think it might be better suited to 
radical egoism than to radical individualism.  

Also, there seems to be a bit of confused ontology here.  Did you 
mean to say that everything in the universe exists only for your
own personal benefit?  If you did, could you please elucidate?

You're a smart guy, and even sceptical of the sceptics; I like that.  Please help me ground an experience I had last year.  I was receiving a CAT scan to discern whether or not the cluster headaches I was experiencing were due to a brain tumor.  As the machine objectively took progressive pictures of my brain layers (from the top down - hehe), I subjectively experienced, first a purple ring around the periphery of my closed eye visual field, then a large purple donut, then a smaller one, then total darkness again.  This seems to be confirmative of the thesis that visual experience is isomorphically mapped onto the parietal cortex, but further than that, it would seem to be a gateway to a Rosetta Stone of psychophisiological relation.

it will be interesting to see how camel cigarettes sell in the coming
years.  court mandated to lose the joe camel images, they now have
some of the lamest advertising i have *ever* seen for *any* product.  if
advertising has any impact at all, here is a case with both extremes:
very good followed by very bad.

max m, are those of you in the ad industry studying this case?  spike

	My friends, I find myself moving toward a career change. Since my
early teens I've wanted to become a research scientist working on the
problem of human aging. Money and social status were never the main
motivators for me-- all I ever cared about was this goal. I sacrificed
much for it.

	Now at 25 I'm coming to grips with the fact that I've blown eight
years in undergrad, with nothing to show for it but a mediocre GPA and a
long string of failures wherever hands-on labwork was involved. I'm not
giving up on my goal, but perhaps it's time to change my approach.

	So, if not as a scientist, then how else do you think an
individual can further the cause of researching a way to slow or reverse
the aging process? What do you think the field of biological gerontology
needs most from laymen sympathizers? Or, are there any alternative paths
to serious research that don't depend heavily on school transcripts and
recommendations from professors? If you were me, what would you do?

	I am asking you because you are among the few groups of people
whose opinions I respect, and I thank you if you choose to respond.

yup.  my brain was out fission when i wrote the original post.  after
thinking about it, i realized we are over-restricting our view with
the traditional fission chain reaction scenario, the one that wont
scale down.  fusion maybe, if you can figure out a way to get two hydrogen
nucleii to contact on a nano scale, but consider: another possibility might be
to use a small radioactive sample without chain reacting anything: just
by somehow capturing the high energy electrons that come off the
decaying nucleii, or perhaps the alpha particles.  either way, we neednt
think only in terms of the big nuclear reactions that we are so familiar
with way up here on the meter scale.  spike

1. Money.

2. Public exposure.

Do something that fascinates you and that you're good at.  I don't know 
you, so I can't say what that is, but there will be something.  It doesn't 
have to be related to biogerontology - there's a lot about being human
and becoming transhuman apart from extending lifespan.

There are many alternate paths to serious research - lab tech, accountant,
sales, management, etc.  Again, which is best for you I can't say.  I have
a friend who does regulatory submissions for bone replacements, and
loves it.

Precisely so. A sane AI, regardless of hardware/software particulars,
appeals to my social nature, and elicits warm confidence in me, more than
most of the meat puppets I see in everyday life.

Yes, I had considered that possibility. Nevertheless, I fear such random
destruction less than the social organization of aggressive use of human
force (i.e., violence and mass destruction) as practiced by the sort who
have visited two World Wars on our planet. I find holocausts personally
engineered by humans less bearable than possible conflagrations inflicted by
a lunatic synthetic intelligence. If something destroys my biosphere, please
don't let it have the same kind of brain as I have. I can accept the thought
of murder from a demented machine better than I can tolerate the idea of
carnage from humans who feign rationality. Armageddon, with its armies of
fanatics, offends me with its stinking religiosity far more than an SI could
ever torture me with its exotic logic. Furthermore, I suspect that the
maximum cruelties toward humans emanate from the depths of twisted human
motives, for which machines can have no affinity. IOW, humans know how to
hurt humans better than any crazy machine could.

Trying so hard, we may wind up trying the patience of Gaia herself. (Just
kidding.)
How can we know about sanity until we become completely sane? People of the
Dark Ages, from what has survived to speak for them, had less informed
philosophies and lived with less knowledge of the universe, but did they
have less sanity? Such a conclusion seems doubtful to me. In fact, to live
and love in a world without science would seem to require _more_ sanity than
to live and love in a world with so much knowledge that no one can know it
all.

What does sanity mean?

The need to define sanity indicates a desire to prove ourselves sane, so
that we can feel that our venture into ultra-high technology remains
sensible.

But the whole history of humanity proves that humanity lacks sanity as much
as it lacks anything. Basically, humanity proves itself insane by fighting
five thousand wars in the last three thousand years. The greed, jealousy,
and selfishness that prevails throughout human social orders indicates the
dominance of something other than sanity.

Sane people exult in doing what comes naturally, in satisfying a congenital
appetite for the beauty of reason, the thrill of understanding, the
excitement of knowing reality directly.

A wise man once defined sanity as coming out of the mind into the open,
into the silence, where no thought, no desire disturbs you. In that pool of
silence, with not a single ripple upon it, sanity abides, compassion
prevails.

Sanity means to secure your happiness, and by extension, the happiness of
your neighbors, family, friends, and community, since one cannot really feel
happy when surrounded by misery.

When your means fulfill your ends, if you can manage that -- the harmony
between the means and the end -- then you've got sanity. When your means
don't satisfy your end, and you continue to repeat the same means, never
arriving at a gratifying end, then you've got a neurosis. "Make every act of
your life dedicated to love and sanity arises out of it," a romantic man has
said.

When liberated people want to play the game of sanity, they live as sanely
as anyone can live. Then they can outdo Aristotle with logic and reason.
They can follow every rule and regulation. But if they want to play the
lunatic game, then they can become as demagogic, theologic, and ideologic as
any other maniac.

The perfectly sane brain thinks only when necessary. It reverts to ecstatic
tranquility (i.e., it allows  thought-noise to dissipate, clearing the way
for the emergence of superlative sentience or learning) whenever it can, for
as long as it can. Conversely, the insane brain cannot stop struggling with
itself.

A psychologist asked a psychonomer, "How do you deal with neurotics?"

The psychonomer replied, "We trap them?"

"Oh? And how do you do that?" asked the psychologist.

"By making it impossible for them to ask any more questions," answered the
psychonomer.

Cheers,

Read Dennett and Dawkins, his opponents (kinda) amongst popular writers.  
They're good too.  Dawkins tends to be closest to mainstream biology

The ONLY thing you will ever be really good at, is doing what interrests you
the most. Do that all the time and make it a living. It is probably one of
the shurest ways to riches. Make a bundle of money this way and invest some
of them in biotech companies or give them away to research.

You dont have to work directly in age research to help make the biggest
advances in that field. Just fill out your own ecological niche but do it
the best you can, and just make shure that it doesn't work against you
ultimate goal.

I have found that in life the shortest paht between two points is a
zigzag'in line that heads sort of in the right direction.

Title
  Cohort study of vitamin C
  intake and cognitive impairment.
Source
  American Journal of Epidemiology.  148(1):45-50, 1998 Jul 1.
Abstract
  To test the hypothesis that vitamin C protects against
  cognitive impairment, the authors conducted a cohort
  study (n=117) in a retirement community in Sydney,
  Australia. Vitamin C intake was assessed at baseline (1991)
  with a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire, and cognitive function
  was assessed 4 years later (1995). After adjustment for age, sex, smoking,
  education, total energy intake, and use of psychotropic medications,
  consumption of vitamin C supplements was associated with a
  lower prevalence of more severe cognitive impairment (based on scores on the
  Mini-Mental State Examination; adjusted odds ratio=0.39, 95% confidence
  interval 0.18-0.84). There were no associations between
  vitamin C intake and scores on tests of verbal and category
  fluency. This study suggests that vitamin C
  might protect against cognitive impairment.

Title
  The relationship between growth hormone kinetics and
  sarcopenia in postmenopausal women: the role of fat mass and
  leptin.
Source
  Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.  83(5):1502-6, 1998 May.
Abstract
  Sarcopenia, the decline in body cell mass (BCM) and
  especially in muscle mass with age, is an important age-related cause of
  frailty and loss of independence in the elderly. Because the decline in BCM
  with age parallels a decline in GH secretion from young adulthood to old age,
  loss of GH secretion has been considered an important contributory cause of
  sarcopenia in the elderly. To test this hypothesis in a
  group of healthy postmenopausal women (n = 15; mean +/- SD age, 66.9 +/- 7.8
  yr), 24-h GH concentrations and secretory kinetics were correlated with BCM
  (measured by whole body counting of 40K) and percent body fat (measured by
  dual energy x-ray absorptiometry or neutron inelastic scattering). Serum
  leptin levels were determined as a measure of adipocyte mass. Contrary to
  prediction, GH secretion was lower in women with higher BCM (r = 0.50; P <
  0.05), whereas their mean fat mass was higher (r = 0.51, P < 0.05). These
  data indicate that sarcopenia in postmenopausal women is not
  associated with reduced GH secretion and is inversely correlated with fat
  mass. Serum leptin levels were inversely associated with GH secretion (r =
  -0.67; P < 0.006). Although a causal relationship has not been demonstrated,
  these data suggest that leptin could modulate GH secretion through its action
  on the aging hypothalamic-pituitary axis, or that GH regulates leptin
  secretion.

Title
  Age-related sarcopenia in humans is associated with reduced
  synthetic rates of specific muscle proteins. [Review] [33 refs]
Source
  Journal of Nutrition.  128(2 Suppl):351S-355S, 1998 Feb.
Abstract
  Sarcopenia of aging is not explained entirely on the basis
  of age-associated reduced physical activity. Progressive neuromuscular
  changes and diminishing anabolic hormone levels are thought to contribute to
  the pathogenesis of sarcopenia. Decline in muscle mass
  indicates a decline in muscle protein content. Recent studies demonstrated an
  age-related decline in synthesis rate of mixed muscle proteins, myosin heavy
  chain and mitochondrial protein. Reductions in myosin heavy chain and
  mitochondrial protein synthesis rates have been correlated with
  age-associated decrements in muscle strength and aerobic exercise tolerance,
  respectively. These changes have been reported as early as 50 y of age and
  are related to the decline in insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I,
  testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-sulfate. The declining ability
  to remodel these important muscle proteins may therefore play a role in the
  development of muscle wasting, metabolic abnormalities and impaired physical
  functioning seen in old age. [References: 33]

 first self-replicating InterStellar Probe is launched from Earth. In
 another ten thousand years it encounters a habitable planet in another
 solar system. It then proceeds to build a factory which can manufacture
 other probes, and in time terraform the planet, and accomplish other
 tasks that it has been programed with. Millions, billions and then
 trillions of other probes are sent out and eventually in say 10 to 100
 million years all solar systems in the entire galaxy has been visited.
   We presume there must be other planets with life on them, and further
 presume that some must have intelligent life on then. There seem to exist
 no technical or other reasons for why at least one self-replicating
 InterStellar probe has not then launched by at least one intelligent
 species in the past. No probes have ever been detected, therefore these
 probes do not exist, therefore the intelligent species that could have
 launched them do not exist. The problem is to account for why no such old
 ETs exist.
   One possible answer may be found in the January 23,1999 issue of New
 Scientist. James Annis, an astrophysicist thinks old ETs did not exist
 because gamma ray bursts (GRBs) have repeatedly sterilized large parts of
 our galaxy before intelligent life has had time to evolve. Presumably
 only the most radiation resistant bacteria buried deep in the mantle
 could survive a nearby GRB - but evolution would still be reset
 effectively to zero each time a nearby GRB occurred. The rate that GRBs
 occur in our galaxy was much more frequent in the past - once every few
 million years. This could account for why old ET civilizations never
 existed, as there was never enough time for intelligent life to evolve
 before a sterilizing event occurred. Now that these GRBs occur only every
 few hundred million years, has it become possible for a few lucky planets
 (such as Earth) to avoid being fried long enough for intelligent life to
 evolve. In earth's case I assume this reprieve has been at least the last
 600 million years since the end of the precambrian era, though possibly a
 distant GRB might account for the mass extinction event at the end of the
 Permian epoch?

Whenever I hear this regarding a man made problem I just have to laugh. Its not that
a solution isn't possible or easy, just that the solution is too unpalatable to
political interests who control the real say in getting things done, or that the
average person will have to commit to even a minor paradigm shift, which of course
is anathema.

a) stop fertilizing and watering your damn lawn.
b) stop using high nitrate fertilizers in agriculture.
c) build a sewage treatment plant that is up to date and produces nearly drinkable
water. One sure fire way to build one of these is easy and natural: build wetlands.
Wetlands are one of the most efficient treatment systems for effulent.
d) only use short life pesticides (degradable).

Most people think that a nice grassy well kept lawn is a wonder of nature. Nothing
could be further from the truth. Its no better than a parking lot. Because people
are constantly mowing lawns, this compacts the soil down quite a bit, so most of the
water does not soak down into the soil, but runs off into storm drains. These storm
drains immediately pipe the water to the local runoff pond or wetland.  This rapid
variation in streamflow causes the water level in the wetlands to go up and down,
which is what kills off or causes high levels of brith defects in frogs eggs (they
are planted on plant stems just below the water surface and must remain at the given
depth.)

If you really want to help the environment here are some things that would really
work:

a) replace your current toilet system with a composting toilet. It uses peat moss
and bacteria to naturally decompose your waste, and surprisingly does NOT stink, as
they are well ventilated and the natural degradation is not nearly as bad as
untreated sewage.
b) rip up your grass lawn. Deep aerate the soil and plant a nice polyculture of
prairie type plants and flowers. STOP watering your lawn.
c) buy only organically grown foods. Promoting the use of organic practices will
1)reduce the use of high nitrate artificial pesticides, and 2) will consume all of
that sludge biosolids you are generating with your composting toilet, and will
reduce the amount of effulent widing up in the sea. Close your damn system.

No. but you can watch from a satellite the natural oil seeps coming up from the
gulf's floor. If you can see it from space its pretty big. And highly refined
petroleum products do not clump up in nuggets at sea, they typically evaporate.
Additionally, yes, the gulf is a natural collector of junk, from south america,
mexico and even europe. If there were no junk, of course it would not be collected.
Look at the wind and current patterns. Its rather obvious, especially for anyone
living near Galveston, which gets the most junk.

great, I studied a bit of oceanography myself at the University of  Washington. AND
that Red Tide is caused by deep water upwellings off the continental shelf is NOT a
crackpot theory, but an accepted fact, as of last year.

So far as energy production is concerned that is correct.  The containment
system will tend to consume a larger portion of the bomb's mass as it gets
smaller, but that's just an engineering problem - I wouldn't be surprised if
someone found a way around it.

Antimatter devices are possible at any scale you want to use.  However,
really small ones (less than about 0.1 kT) won't make an explosion.  That's
because matter-antimatter reactions release their energy as high-energy
gamma radiation, which can penetrate large amounts of normal matter before
being absorbed.  Thus, the energy of the bomb will always be spread over a
certain minimum volume of space - you can't make an antimatter bomb that
creates small explosions.  If the bomb doesn't put out enough energy to
power a big explosion, you end up irradiating the area and heating it up a
bit instead.

So, antimatter devices would be a major threat.  The delivery vehicle can't
actually be nanoscale, but it could probably be as small as a dust mote and
still carry an effective weapon.

What makes this interesting is that this idea may imply that we are just
extremely lucky to have gotten as far as we have, and would help to explain
the seeming lack of successful galaxy colonizers coming in towards us from
intergalactic distances. Notice, though, that this by itself doesn't seem so
helpful for explaining why we haven't seen any ET's starting a wave of
colonization from relatively nearby locations within our galaxy. Presumably,
any nearby settlement-wave builders would benefit just as much from the
absence of a galaxy-wide catastrophe as we apparently have.

>I would like to hear Robin Hanson's take on this new theory.

One article of Hanson's, "The Great Filter -- Are We Almost Past It", is an
interesting rundown of some of the other, more local obstacles that could get
in the way of evolution, and help to account for a seeming dearth of ET's. If
we've just narrowly escaped being killed off by a lot of Nature's "filters",
and that's the reason why no ET's, it could make a lot of sense to add this
galaxy-wide GRB filter to the list of things that can go wrong. It certainly
seems a discouraging theme for SETI searchers, though, unless there's some
reason why planet-bound ET's would be a lot more likely to survive, to then
beam their radio messages at us? Maybe large planets with dense atmospheres
naturally shield their inhabitants from radiation much better, while those
large-sized planetary gravity wells prevent most surviving ET's from getting
into space?

Since Robin Hanson has been mentioned, maybe this would be a good time to ask
a question about *another* ET article of his, "Burning the Cosmic Commons:
Evolutionary Strategies for Interstellar Colonization". This article presents
a novel approach to the lack of ET's by saying that they could perhaps have
gone right *past* our intersteller locality, missing us, and our solar system
*completely* in a hasty "rush" of an expansion wave. In this scenario the
resources they need to expand rapidly have somehow been used up, so presumably
star systems fairly near to us might be depleted in whatever-it-is that they
need to keep their civilization going? Supposedly, they've never returned from
that great expansion wave front, figuring that our locality is used up, or
burnt out, so in this concept *that's* why no obvious ET settlements!

My question here, is whether this abstract "Burning the Commons" concept, or
study, has any real meaning, in terms of the actual resource that would be
depleted? I mean, just what could possibly be so important that it would get
used up, and prevent really expansive ET's from gradually expanding into all
available niches, including our solar system? For instance, one "life
essential" resource that comes to my mind is *phosphorus*, but I can't imagine
why phosphorus atoms would actually be destroyed by ET settlers? Actually, I
suppose that's two questions: first, any reason why nearby ET's couldn't be
communicative, but planet-bound, and, second, what's burned in the "Burning
the Commons" scenario?

Right, it seems that most estimates suggest that there should be a very
large number (billions?) of planets in the galaxy that are reasonably
suitable for the formation of life.  In that case, the fact that our
planet has survived any GRBs would suggest that other planets in the
galaxy would also have had a good chance to do so.

The article also adopted a fairly conservative estimate of the rate of
spread through the galaxy (1/1000 the speed of light, I think it was).
We commonly consider scenarios with much higher rates of expansion than
this, 1/100 or 1/10 c or even faster.  This gives galaxy-wide domination
in a million years or so.

Putting these together, we have to be in first place, or at least tied
for the lead to within one million years, which seems very unlikely if
intelligence is at all common on those billion earth-like planets.

I think the idea was that there would be this tremendous race to be the
first to expand outward, because whichever one wins the race gets the first
use of the new star systems.  This leads to selection pressure for doing
everything possible to increase the rate of expansion.

You could imagine one of these probes, at the front of the expansion
wavefront, coming into a new solar system and proceeding furiously to
build, construct, convert matter into whatever is needed to expand
outwards.  Maybe it constructs a gigantic mass accelerator, taking
apart planets and asteroids system to build huge batteries to collect
solar energy, and an electromagnetic launcher billions of miles long.
This is used to fire off a limited number of additional probes, all
heading outward where the chances of finding fallow systems is best.

While this is going on, competing probes all around it are finding their
own solar systems and doing similar construction.  By the time this one
is ready to go, it has been leapfrogged and it has to aim far outward
to have a good shot at an unused solar system.

Like a salmon which has fought its way upstream for a furious bout of
mating, once the probe has "spawned", evolution is through with it,
and it might just die.  Or if it does stay alive, it has a pretty messed
up solar system and no clear evolutionary guidance.

You'd still think that there could be a second wave of colonization,
replicators evolved and specialized to work with the detritus of the
hyper-fast expansion wave.  The first wave can't have used things up
_too_ completely - the star is still there, and matter in some form;
at least the big planets are still intact.  After all, we see stars
which look like ours, and we are starting to see planets around them.

It seems difficulty to come up with an evolutionary scenario in which
life does not advance into every possible niche, so that we can say that
our own solar system just happens to have been skipped.  At best you
can argue that we are near enough to the time that life first was able
to spread through the galaxy that it just hasn't gotten here yet.  Maybe
by combining the "we're relatively early" and "life misses niches"
ideas you can make the numbers work out to give us a reasonable chance
of existing.

OK, but you made the statement at top in the context of advertisement and
specifically as a response to claims of manipulation by advertisers. And
you introduced your contribution with this:

So what were we supposed to think? Exactly what is it that you're claiming?

Yes, but that only gives you a gross mechanical approximation of a larger
robot.  If you want any kind of specialized equipment (and you usually
will), your nanobots can't simulate it directly.  Besides, I get the feeling
you're comparing the swarm of nanobots to a 20th century robot, which is
hardly the appropriate standard.

Give me a day or two to work up a good example of the kind of system I'm
talking about, and let do a comparison of capabilities.

Behaviorism is not the view that minds reduce to bodily motions.
That would be materialism.  Behaviorism is the idea that we should not
talk about consciousness, or introspection, or what the mind is doing;
we should just put it in experimental situations and observe what it does.
This idea was appropriate in the 1940s, but is inappropriate now that we
have computers, and the technological ability to make and test models
of the mind.

Behaviorism is also associated (that's a pun, but if you get it
you don't need to read this) with the notion that mind is nothing but
stimulus-response mechanisms.  Rodney Brooks' school of thought on AI
-- behavior-based AI -- is essentially behavioristic AI.  All the critiques
that Noam Chomsky made of behaviorism in 1956 still apply to Brooks'
program today.  The stimulus-response school, including Brooks, rests
on the notion that thinking and planning and remembering is a modern
accident of evolution, useful only for playing chess and choosing the
right wines and other civilized behavior.  This view is possible only
because the people who hold it haven't observed animals or humans in
primitive society, and have the romantic notion that, say, a wolf gets
fed by wandering until it finds a deer, then running it down and eating
it.  Further research into animal and insect behavior shows
only more thoroughly that animals and insects have memories and mental
maps and are not stimulus-response mechanisms.

The Turing Test is a sort of behaviorism, yes: it is a philosophical
assertion that it is the behavior that matters, and that we should
treat a computer as a thinking entity if it acts like one, rather than
arguing about whether it is conscious or not, since I could argue
that you aren't conscious.  But it does not suffer from behaviorism's
flaws, because it is not a /scientific/ program, it is a philosophical
or semantic argument about what criteria something has to satisfy for
us to regard it as intelligent and, presumably, as having rights.
If you don't accept the Turing test's position,
then you risk legitimizing people like Searle, so that when we produce
a race of intelligent robots, Searle's arguments can be used to justify
enslaving and abusing them.

I have asked Searle twice how he feels about the potential use of his
arguments to abuse intelligent creatures.  The first time he said "I don't
say you can't make intelligent robots that don't use symbol processing",
which assumes his position is correct and ignores the fact that it /does/
say you can abuse anything produced by symbol-processing AI.  The second
time he never answered.

Searle says consciousness is a product of the physical stuff used to
implement the brain.  You get consciousness because you build out of
consciousness stuff.  The Chinese room argument is an exercise in sloppy
thinking, and Searle defends it against attacks only by blatantly
deceptive redefinition of his terms on the fly from sentence to sentence.

Penrose, while great in his own field, jumped into a field (AI) that he
knows nothing about, without studying the literature or (apparently) vetting
his work with people in the field.  His book Emperor's New Mind contains
freshman blunders, and is not worth reading.  I don't know who Hameroff is.

Hmm.  Depends on whether you think the 'empirical' studies are actually
worth anything.  There is so much noise in this kind of experiment that it
is very difficult to collect solid data.  I'm not really familiar enough
with recent work in the field to venture an opinion on its quality.

I see two big obstacles to be overcome.  One is the long-term testing
problem - one would expect the most effective methods of spreading a meme to
rely on repeated exposure of some sort.  The second is the ethical problem -
any non-trivial meme is going to have a real effect on the people who
'catch' it, after all.

Dennett's book has a section criticizing Gould in much the same spirit as
the URL that was posted.

The thing to keep in mind, though, is that these are professional feuds.
These people have long-standing intellectual disagreements, which may
spill over into the personal realm from time to time.  Each side complains
that the other is misrepresenting its position, presenting straw men,
ignoring nuances, all the standard rhetorical devices.

Gould downplays the role of natural selection in evolution.  He emphasizes
the presence of nonadaptive features, limitations on the structures which
evolution can produce, the role of chance and randomness in evolution.
He also promotes the theory of punctuated equilibrium, in which most
evolutionary change occurs in a relatively short period (and is largely
random to boot).  He has criticized other writers for trying too hard
to explain biological features in terms of adaptive advantage and
reproductive success, the "adaptationist" school.

However, he has made a lot of enemies in the process.  He writes in a
supercilious and condescending tone, and has not hesitated to identify
his targets by name.  He has a "bully pulpit" in the form of a widely
read column in Natural History magazine, which causes the traditional
resentment which researchers feel towards someone who has the public's
ear.

Furthermore, politics plays a part as well.  Gould is an avowed Marxist,
and many of his targets have had views on the conservative side of
the spectrum.  He led attacks against Edward O.  Wilson of Sociobiology
fame, casting Wilson as a right-wing, racist, reactionary.  He has been
one of the main opponents of the view that IQ is largely hereditary,
which he also sees as leading to racism.

There is a collection of critiques of Gould at
http://pweb.netcom.com/~nuenke/gou.htm, some of which are uncomfortably
racist in tone, emphasizing his Jewish background and linking his views
with those of other Jewish Marxists.

Like many feuds, this one is remarkably vicious and ugly.  It sounds like
Gould may have gotten down in the mud first, but many of his opponents
have not hesitated to join him.

Seen this?

Viral mediated expression of insulin-like growth factor I blocks the
aging-related loss of skeletal muscle function.

Barton-Davis ER, Shoturma DI, Musaro A, Rosenthal N, Sweeney HL
Department of Physiology, A700 Richards Building, University of Pennsylvania
School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6085, USA.

During the aging process, mammals lose up to a third of their skeletal
muscle mass and strength. Although the mechanisms underlying this loss are
not entirely understood, we attempted to moderate the loss by increasing the
regenerative capacity of muscle. This involved the injection of a
recombinant adeno-associated virus directing overexpression of insulin-like
growth factor I (IGF-I) in differentiated muscle fibers. We demonstrate that
the IGF-I expression promotes an average increase of 15% in muscle mass and
a 14% increase in strength in young adult mice, and remarkably, prevents
aging-related muscle changes in old adult mice, resulting in a 27% increase
in strength as compared with uninjected old muscles. Muscle mass and fiber
type distributions were maintained at levels similar to those in young
adults. We propose that these effects are primarily due to stimulation of
muscle regeneration via the activation of satellite cells by IGF-I. This
supports the hypothesis that the primary cause of aging-related impairment
of muscle function is a cumulative failure to repair damage sustained during
muscle utilization. Our results suggest that gene transfer of IGF-I into
muscle could form the basis of a human gene therapy for preventing the loss
of muscle function associated with aging and may be of benefit in diseases
where the rate of damage to skeletal muscle is accelerated.

Since there seems to be a fair amount of interest in the topic, I've decided
to go ahead and post what I've got so far (in sections, of course).  The
final version of all of this will (hopefully) end up as a paper-length
treatment of the topic, but it has a ways to go before its ready for that.

I'll start here with some initial groundwork on the nature of intelligence,
both human and superhuman.  The next section will develop these ideas into a
theory of intelligence enhancement, and the third will explore some
implications of this theory for AI/SI/IE.

So, here's part I:

Before we can take up the task of examining the prospects for intelligence
enhancement, let alone predict the abilities of an SI, we need some
agreement about what we are talking about.  We need to make a few reasonable
assumptions about the nature of mind, and define what we mean by
'intelligence'.

The first assumption we must make is simple, reasonably, and highly
controversial: that sentient minds arise from complex computational
processes implemented by physical matter.  They require no nonphysical
'thought substance', no incomprehensible quantum magic, and no supernatural
forces.  If this assumption fails, all of the following analysis is
meaningless.

We will also assume, for the sake of argument, that there is no invisible,
hard constraint on the maximum complexity of a mind.  The only limits to the
development of minds with vast amounts of processing power are those of the
physical world: the speed of light, the scale of matter, and so forth.  We
will not approach those limits in this analysis.

As for the nature of intelligence, let us remember that we are more
concerned here with external effects than subjective experience.  It does
not matter whether a particular entity is 'really' sentient, or 'really'
intelligent in some abstract, intangible sense.  Instead, what we care about
is what the entity is capable of doing - what kinds of problems can it
solve, and how well?

Now, intelligence in this sense is not a unitary entity.  It is perfectly
possible to be good at solving one class of problems, and do a poor job of
solving others.  There is a very large (possibly infinite) number of
different problem domains in which an intelligent entity might have some
ability.  Some of these domains are related to each other, such that a high
level of ability in one domain can be used to solve problems in the related
domains.  Other problem domains are independent of each other, and require
completely different problem-solving approaches.

What, then, defines 'human-equivalent' intelligence?  Humans normally have a
certain minimal level of competence at solving a wide variety of problems,
from sensory processing to social interaction to planning and logical
thought.  However, we do not declare someone who is deficient in one problem
domain to be sub-human.  In fact, we often do not consider even large
impairments to indicate low intelligence - witness the stereotype of the
technically brilliant but socially inept genius.

The answer to this apparent contradiction is also the reason why so many
people think of intelligence as a single ability.  Picture a graph with
different cognitive abilities along the X-axis, and increasing ability along
the Y-axis, so that the graph depicts varying ability levels in different
problem domains.  What we commonly call 'intelligence' is the area under
this curve, with various distortions based on our own ideas about which
abilities are important.  Different humans may have different levels of
ability in each problem domain, but we expect the total area under the curve
to fall within a given range.

We can therefore say that an entity has human-equivalent intelligence if it
meets the same criterion: its total ability in the relevant problem domains
must fall within the same range as that of humans.  A transhuman entity
would be one whose total ability falls well beyond the human range, and an
SI would be an entity with an astronomically large total ability.

Note, however, that there is no requirement that even an SI possess normal
human ability in every possible problem domain.  One could imagine an
'idiot-savant' entity with high levels of competence in some areas, and
little or no ability in others, just as occurs in humans.

The GAO just put out a report on the Performance and Accountability of 20
cabinet agencies and major departments, which is commented on at:

http://www.policy.com/news/dbrief/

Here's an interesting excerpt, for those of you who think the gov't is all fine
and dandy:

Actually, both of you and I have quite a bit in common. However, I'm 21 and
I have a good GPA. Still, the problem of how to pursue a career in
biogerontology is common to both -- I don't know about Paul -- of us. My
advice is that you study aging and become good at it. No-one is going to
teach you how to end human aging; you'll have to try and figure it out
yourself. There is much work that can be done without necessarily working
in a lab. Einstein began by having a mediocre job -- with patents if I'm
not mistaken -- but having enough free time to dedicate to his personal
theoretical research. Remember: "Discovery consists of seeing what
everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought." Alternatively, as
other people have mentioned, you can try to make a lot of money and then
pay someone to do the research for you.

Personally, I graduate in June and I'm going the "transcripts and
recommendation letters" path. I don't think I can gather enough funds to
start my own company but I'll contact a couple of companies working in
biogerontology. Needless to say that if any of you have any good ideas,
give a signal.

Goodbye and good luck.

The nature of intelligence is somewhat controversial, tied in to the
dispute over whether intelligence is heritable, and whether different
races have differences in intelligence.  As you say, there are a
number of different skills which can be identified as part of overall
"intelligence".  One disputed point is whether there is correlation
among these abilities.  Do people who are better at memorizing lists,
say, also tend to have better logical deduction skills?  Are better
readers also better at math?

Apparently the statistical data is ambiguous enough that controversy
remains, although it is possible that the high political stakes are
enough to explain it.  The hypothetical correlation factor is called "g",
the general intelligence.  My impression is that most studies show that
there is such a factor, that broadly speaking people who are better at
some mental skills tend to be better at others, but there is definitely
considerable variation in abilities.

This should be a bar (column) graph; I think the various cognitive skills
would be discrete rather than continuous.  (Although this may be in part
an artifact of the factor analysis technique, which inherently identifies
discrete basis vectors.)

The difficult issue as you try to generalize this to super-intelligence
is how to scale the Y axis.  With humans, we can test people and come
up with a range of scores which we can normalize with a desired mean and
standard deviation.  However the nature of tests is such that there may be
no unambiguous way to extrapolate them beyond the range of abilities seen.
As a simple example, you can't do better than 100% on a test.  A test
may not be able to produce meaningful data outside of a given range.

Even with open-ended tests, like how quickly something can be done, or
how many numbers you can remember, it is not clear how to measure an
ability which is beyond the human level, in quantitative terms.  How
much better do you have to do on a test to have an IQ of 400 rather than
350?  What would such values mean?

An interesting point this suggests is that a person, today, who is allowed
to "cheat" on an IQ test by having access to computers and other helpful
devices, could probably score very highly on some of the sub-tests.
He could "remember" sequences of virtually any length, for example.
(All he really needs is pencil and paper for that.)  He could come
up with synonyms, and might be able to handle geometric problems more
easily as well.  The standard formulas assemble the sub-tests into an
overall score, and his massively increased ability in some areas would
increase his apparent IQ, possibly significantly.

This leads to a couple of conclusions.  First, such an "augmented"
person is effectivelly more intelligent than an ordinary human.  This is
unsurprising; it is one reason our culture has advanced from caveman days.

But second, it shows that the tests don't always produce meaningful
results when taken outside their intended range.  A test of memory is more
relevant when measuring brain capacity than paper capacity.  Someone who
can memorize hundreds of digits on hearing them has an amazing mental
ability, and this would show up in his IQ score; but someone who can write
down hundreds of digits and read them back is just an ordinary person,
and he doesn't deserve to have his IQ score boosted by a formula created
with the intention of testing a purely mental ability.

It seems to me that this law merely puts restrictions on the way testing
is done.  It does not explicitly authorize human testing, but it says
that IF human testing is done, it must be done in certain ways.  It says
that the testing must involve certain kinds of notifications and certain
time limits.

Repealing the law would therefore repeal the restrictions.  There would
no longer be the requirement of notice within 30 days, or notice to
civilian authorities.

It's not clear to me that the repeal of this law would make it illegal
to test chemical or biological agents on humans.  There may be other
laws which would do that, but the mere act of repealing this would would
not in itself make such testing illegal.

Sometime soon the on-line U.S. Code archives will delete the 
horrific law that was Section 1520 of U.S.C. Title 50, since
it was repealed. That law allowed for the testing of chemical
and biological agents on entire "civilian populations."  The 
law was in effect in the U.S. for 20 years (enacted in 1977 
as Public Law 95-79 and then repealed in 1997) and is PROOF 
that turning entire "civilian populations" into Guinea pig
farms was considered. One is forced to wonder if over that 
time the military abstained from that which the law defined.

Here then is that law. Save this short law. Any government
what would enact it could just as easily repeal it with a lie.

Before I go posting my silly posts, I just want to say that I have the
highest regard for the Extropian Principles.  I thank Max and everyone
that helped for spending the time to compile them and post them.  It's
nice to have a corner of rational and optomistic discourse (for the
most part).  However, this list tends to get dry every once and a
while.  I like to be silly, so I'll pass on my silliness to everyone
here.  If nothing else, my "parodies" still list the Extropian
Principles - even if they mangle them.

That said, look out for "The Southern Baptist Extropian" coming REAL
soon!

Isn't it strange, when the stated role of the government
is general coordination of social activities, meaningful
allocation of funds, and overall social order and effectiveness.

Coercive funding and coercive implementation of programs
remove incentives to improve coordination and effectiveness,
so whether the centralized system could actually deliver them,
is a moot point - it won't bother [too much, anyway].

Wasn't Communism a good enough lesson here?

Do you recall when someone on this extrpians mailing list, was talking

I'd like to address that in my usual uncoordinated way.

I see and I've been led to beleive that the original purpose and allowable
function of <federal> government in the United States was severely limited.
That is.  1. To Protect the borders <military> 2. Legislative  3. Judiciary.

Anything else is unlawful.  Historicaly I beleive it is seen tht government
does anything else very poorly. It doesnt do very well even at those three.

Addittionally. 

The other day I heard a broadcast of the proceedings of "The commonwealth club
of California".  From the San Francisco Area (the No  spanking zone).  The
topic was Russia.

The concensus of opinion was that Russia was going to melt-down.  More so than
already.  And that there wasn't  a thing that would stop it.

One of the speakers brought up the point that the singular difference between
Russia and the West was Statism vs Individualism.  Statism self destructed.

Yet our government continually limits the rights and powers of individuals.

Alex, I think you need to make a personal evaluation of all of this
human/computer interactins stuff that we talk about. If you are convinced
that hnman/computer interactions are becoming increasingly complex and
useful, and if you think you can advance this process, then perhaps
you should consider it. I personally believe that computer augmentation is
the most powerful potential method of assisting the aged. In particular,
T\the end result would be a method to transfer the (perhaps augmented) personality
completely out of the human body. The question becomes which cohort of the
aged you want to help. If you want to help current 90-year-olds, uploading
is not a good choice. If you want to help current 50-year-olds before thier
(our) bodies wear out or whatever, conputer augmentation may be the best way
to go.

If you no longer think that research is your best field then (1) you may be
wrong, but (2) perhaps you should consider science journalism or primary
or secondary science teaching.

... and many other interesting tidbits.

My question:  Do you know whether these statistics include _all_ guns, or only those
that are privately owned?  If the statistics include those owned by gov't agents,
used in their enforcement duties, then the argument seems much weaker than if it
includes only guns owned by private citizens.

If the statistics do refer to all guns, is there further data available so that
statistics for privately owned guns may be derived?

Thanks!

In the era of molecular biology, viruses are being adapted for our own
purposes. They have served as powerful tools for gene manipulation and
now they are showing promise for use in anti-cancer therapies.

Viruses, in their mission to hijack cells for their own replication,
happen to target many of the same genes that are mutated when a cell
becomes cancerous. 

Therefore viruses are amenable to reengineering as cancer killing
machines. There are currently several viruses being developed into
microscopic smart bombs.

I was thinking about your example of an individual who had acces to a
computer.  I think that quite possibly such an individual might be
considered a primitive future human... you know what I mean?  Is
anybody else thinking similar thoughts?  I mean, a computer being a
primitive neural extension, and a keyboard or mouse or whatever a
primitive neural connection, could it not be that one's
IQ-plus-computer or IQ-plus-net could be considered a measure of your
intelligence as an advanced individual?  It may be really silly,
but.....
it's a thought.

extropians, after pondering the concept of nanonukes i think i made an
error even larger than saying fusion when i meant fission.  we all did.  the
concept of nuclear reactions at a nano scale is unreasonable because it is
so totally unnecessary, at least as far as a power source for nanoscale
machines.  let us consider non-weapons here, since the use of nuclear
material for weapons use has already been sufficiently worked out. {8-[

think for a minute of the square cube law.  in aircraft it explains why 747s
look the way they do: as the linear scale increases, the wing area goes
up as the square but the mass goes up as the cube.  chemical power
sources are not sufficient to carry planes a whole lot larger than the 47.

ok now go back down the scale.  we are accustomed to getting power
from violent chemical reactions such as octane and air, but a plant can
get all the energy it needs from photosynthesis.  plants on our scale
generally need a lot of leaves, but single celled plants have so little
chlorophyll they sometimes dont even look green, and yet they seem
wildly active under a microscope.  chlorophyll creates sugars, which
break down in a much gentler reaction than oxygen combustion.

so, if the lesson of nature is not misleading, we dont need nanonukes,
or even nanoscale combustion.  the square cube law would suggest
that nanobots should be able to create all the energy they need using
chlorophyll and the fusion reactor nature has already generously
provided: the sun.  right?  spike

  IAN: I see what you're saying, and I think the point
  is that it doesn't say it must or will happen, but 
  that it may happen. As it says, once the 30-day 
  waiting period is over, "such test or experiment 
  may then be conducted." The 30-day notice probably 
  allows key local-civilian officials to plan a vacation.

  We don't even know, at least I don't know (many
  claim to know), if they ever utilized the system
  defined. They may have been "spraying" rural cities
  every day or no days, but many people claim such.
  I've read claims of spraying years ago, it sounded 
  like crazy talk, but now I find it defined in law! 

  It seems like a classified code that popped its head out
  like the Loch Ness monster, only to slip back underwater.
  It's like a "sighting," and once deleted, few will believe.

  IAN: Ya... good thinking! If so, the repeal acts 
  as a distraction, causing the illusion of an end.

  I can't say that during the 20 years that law was 
  the law of my country that I ever heard about it
  in the major media or in any social commentary.
  I wonder if it was ever discussed in the media.
  I hope there's a "repealed U.S. Code archive."

there is a logical error called the argument of irrelevance (if i remember
my college logic class correctly) wherein one argues that concept
x cannot be true because the consequences of x are unacceptable.

after reading murray and herrnstein's bell curve, then sjg's rebuttal
to it, i suspect he and others might argue against murray and herrnstein
on the basis that it leads to racism.  the fact that the concepts found
in the bell curve may lead to racism is entirely irrelevant to the
question of whether or not the concepts are true.

the concepts i refer to are two:  1.  iq is a real quantity, and 2.  it is
inheritable.

looks to me like these two concepts lead to not only racism,
but in fact could eventually lead to race war, which is truly bad,
however, the two concepts seem correct to me.  thoughts?  spike

A good exploration of how biologists think of Dawkins and Gould is in
"The Third Culture" by John Brockman.  Brockman's thesis is that there
is a new emerging intellectual class that bridges C.P. Snow's "Two
Cultures" [*] and it's very explicitly a science-based culture.
Literate practicing scientists write up their work for this culture,
and manage to talk across disciplines.  The people who used to read
Scientific American now constitute a significant audience among the
book-buying public, and some of the people writing for them are
significant researchers who can write clearly, and like talking
directly to the educated layman.

Brockman interviewed more than 20 impressive scientists who write for
this audience, and turned his transcripts into a conversation among
them.  It seems to me to be both a good presentation of their
respective points of view, and a good presentation of their respective
views of each other.  The core of the discussion covers evolutionary
biology, and focuses on the disagreements between Dawkins and Gould.

The biologists Brockman talked to seem to agree that Dawkins and Gould
typify two archetypal points of view that normally have trouble
communicating with one another.  (According to Brockman) they agree on
how evolution works, but disagree on what's important to focus on
about it.  Brockman claims it's partly a capitalist vs. socialist
thing.  (and we should all be expected to take Dawkins' side.  I do.)
Until I read Brockman, I thought of Stephen Jay Gould as "just a
popularizer," but he now appears to be truly a good scientist who has
contributed several crucial insights to the field, and has in addition
written approachable explanations of evolution for the scientifically
literate layman.

The other people Brockman presents in conversation in the book include
Several biologists, reaching as far afield as Lynn Margulis; Computer
Scientists including Marvin Minsky, Roger Schank, and Daniel Dennett,
(along with the misclassified Steven Pinker and Roger Penrose); half a
dozen physicists including Lee Smolin and Paul Davies; and systems
thinkers such as Murray Gell-Mann, Chris Langton, J. Doyne Farmer,
and Danny Hillis.

I recommend the book.

* C. P. Snow, "The Two Cultures", 1959.  Snow pointed out the huge
gulf between the scientists and the literary culture.  They both have
valuable points of view, but they don't talk to (or write for) each
other and they don't listen to (or read) each other.

Our chemical reactions are violent in part because we don't have the
technology to extract the energy efficiently, the way plants do.  We
have to burn gasoline or other fuels to produce heat in a rather crude
way.

The square-cube law says that smaller units have a larger surface area
per volume.  If sunlight is proportional to surface area, then this does
give an advantage to smaller entities.  But that is only true for those
entities in favorable positions to get sunlight.  If you have a solid
mass of nanomachines, then the ones in the middle don't get any light.
So you still have an energy problem.

In fact, if we think of the surface of the nanomachines as being where
energy is expended, then smaller units will have a bigger energy problem,
because they have more functional area but a smaller volume to power it
with.

So there does seem to be a power question with regard to nanobots.  Solar
is an option for those outside, as long as they are in a thin layer.
In other environments they will probably need a fuel supply of energetic
chemicals.

It would be interesting to see an "IQ-plus" test designed specifically
for this kind of system.  A few years ago, when I first got on the net,
they used to have internet search contests.  They would post a series of
questions, and contestants would use the then-primitive search engines
to seek out answers.  This was pre-web, back when gopher was the protocol
for linking information, and it was a lot harder to find things.

Do they still do this?  It seems to me that skill at finding things on
the net is the single most useful thing we could teach young people
in terms of "computer literacy".

But here is an excerpt from the new text that relpaced what was repealed:



(c)  Informed consent required

  The Secretary of Defense may conduct a test or experiment described in
subsection (b) of this section only if informed consent to the testing
was
obtained from each human subject in advance of the testing on that
subject.

  IAN: There's no question that that provision 
  addresses exactly what 1520 obviously lacked,
  and I think your raising it also address the
  idea I was replying to that now only the 
  30-day-notification period is lifted.

  If you read 1520(a), subsection (c) is also
  well-embedded into it, and there is no way
  for the Secretary of Defence to get around 
  it (that I can find so far). But, as for 
  the President and the rest of the Govt, 
  1520(a) imposses no prohibitions.

  I'd rather see 1520(a) start for saying that 
  "No agency or member of the U.S. Government, 
  or contracting for same or any entity may..."
  Instead, only one official is restrained.

  I think Hal's point was even deeper than I'd
  grasped. I think he was saying that 1520 was 
  not a de facto "legalization," it wasn't saying
  "this is now declared legal." It was more like 
  stepping in the planning room of an on-going 
  project, such that the only reason the law
  was written was to tell the DoD that they 
  have to give a 30-day warning FROM NOW ON.

  In short, that testing is allowable wasn't
  the point of 1520,  the 30-day notice was.
  Ergo, the mass testing is considered legal.
  That seems to me to be a possible reading.

IMHO, that's a fairly accurate way to look at it.  The main difference
between a tool that amplifies your intelligence and a specialized brain
function that makes you smarter is the quality of the interface.  Right now
the interface is terrible, so we think of computers as external tools.  As
interfaces get better it will begin to make sense to think of the computers
as being part of their owner's mind.

As far as making small robots walk, fly, move things around, and so on I
think you're right.  Solar power should be fine for anything that has access
to it, and you should be able to fuel thin layers of nanobots that way with
a moderate amount of specialization (solar collector bots on top, which
produce fuel molecules consumed by the bots further down).

Once you start talking about nanotech fabrication that changes things.  I
think Drexler did some calculations on this based on the energy required to
break atomic bonds, and the energy requirements turned out to be pretty
high.  Tearing random matter apart into its constituent atoms is not a very
efficient way to make things - which is one reason why nanotech factory
systems are likely to build things faster than free-roaming replicators.

Solar-powered nanobots should still be feasible, but they would probably
operate on the same time scale as plants (better efficiency and higher
energy requirements should come within an order of magnitude of balancing
out).  That's fast enough to be quite useful, but not fast enough for some
of the applications that have been considered - especially for military use,
or for really large-scale construction.

On what basis do you say this? From stats I've seen, photosynthesis is only
about 1% efficient, or less. If you have other data I'd love to see it.

Not if you have bots that get light decide to specialize in producing 'food'
for bots that are in the dark. Also, see my comment below on fuels...

No, if we are talking about using solar power, then they won't have a power
problem. They may have a problem absorbing it all and using it, which could
lead to problems dumping excess power, which they could use to build food for
bots that are in the dark,  but I'm also concerned with the efficiency of a
nanoscale solar cell. Thickness is an important factor in cell design.

Fortunately there is plenty of organic material everywhere that can be burned
by nanobots. There is coal, methane, oil, as well as more volatile chemicals
all over the place, just not concentrated enough to be useful for refinement
at our macro scales...

If "g" exists, which it probably does, I would expect it to represent some
underlying factor that tends to improve performance in a wide range of
problem domains - perhaps a difference in raw processing power, or memory,
or some meta-skill that contributes to the process of forming new skills.

Agreed.  That's actually what I was picturing - I need to work on the

IMO, the answer is to test each cognitive ability separately.  Then you can
build a customized, open-ended test for each ability.  Weight each test by
subjective importance, and you can combine the results to get an open-ended
IQ scale.

Of course, the result really isn't meaningful for anything that doesn't have
a reasonably human distribution of abilities.  An enhanced human with IQ 500
and an AI with IQ 500 would not be equivalent - the AI would probably be far
better at some things, and far worse at others.

Actually, I would argue that tests of such simple abilities have little to
do with intelligence.  They can be useful with humans because we know that
they are correlated with intelligence, but they do not themselves mean
anything.  A human who could memorize strings of thousands of numbers, but
was not otherwise above average, would simply be considered a curiosity.

> What is an SI?  A Super-Intelligence?

Exactly.  Humans have measurable IQs up to something like 200 - 250.
Transhuman intelligences would test higher - from the high 200s to a few
thousand - with the tests becoming progressively less meaningful as they
move further from the human range.  An SI is something whose mind has at
least thousands of times as much raw processing power as a human brain (and
will soon have millions or billions of times as much power - with nanotech
even that is a conservative estimate).  Its hard to say what that would
translate into in terms of IQ, but its obvious that the SIs mind will be
very different from ours.

I'm not sure, but here's another stat that might help out: A police officer is 5 times
more likely to kill an innocent person at any given crime scene than would an armed
private citizen in the same situation. So, I would say that if government agents are
included, they are merely dampening the stats down. Excluding them and they should be
higher.

Thanks for the pointer.

I was just reading the other day that there is an even newer
technique, by creating direct strands of target RNA!

What does this statement mean? I confess I can't make head or tail of it.

What evidence do you have that society constitutes an organism? What does
it mean for a person to "enact manipulation" of such?

Wanting the entire government to be prohibited from doing such testing,
as opposed to just the Defense Dept. is a good idea.  But the fact that
1520 does not do what you want is not necessarily a defect of 1520.  I
suspect that the context of 1520 was that it addresses the Defense Dept.
only.  


To put it another way, if there is a law which applies to those who hold
commercial drivers and says they must stop for pedestrians in crosswalks,
it may be unfair to say that is a bad law because it fails to say that
non-commercial license holders must also stop for pedestrians in
crosswalks.  That may be addressed in a different section of the code. 
The reason why laws are codified (rationally organized and indexed) is to
make it easy to research the legality of actions, and to draft and repeal
extisting legislation.  When a law is passed by the Maryland legislature,
the statute itself is just editorial instructions dictating changes in
the Code.  


I recall that several years ago there was a big flap about
government-supported scientists doing unethical testing on people in the
US, in years past.  I think some of this legislation we are discussing
may have been in response to those scandals.  Without doing a broad study
of all such legislation, its history and intent, and related policies and
practices, it's difficult to draw valid conclusions.  As with any issue
involving human action, the motives and intents of the people involved
vary across a broad spectrum.  There will always be some individual
police who are prone to mistreat suspects.  The important thing is how
the law and legal system deals with those problems.

When reading legal codes, it is important to consider the context.  It
may be that even the 1977 legislation you were complaining about actually
increased restrictions on government actions, instead of authorizing
them.  If you are looking for laws which authorize egregious government
actions, you should try looking at the emergency acts of 1917 which
authorize the president to do all sorts of things persuant to a
declaration of emergency, essentially dictatorial powers, and at the
McCarran act (ca. 1950) which endangers civil liberties, and at the
Rooseveltian legislation of 1933 to 1935.


Republican/libertarian Congressman Ron Paul of Texas would like to see
some of this bad legislation repealed.  It is possible that if you
contact Ron Paul's office they could give you a 'hit list' of such laws. 
Rep. Paul has recently introduced a bill to ban the use of social
security numbers for use outside the SS administration (and maybe the
IRS).

Ian,

Perhaps I've misunderstood your posts. If by "collective entity" you mean
simply a composite object, such as a galaxy or a person, I've no objection
to your usage.

I was under the impression that you wished to extend the term to include
such non-objects as "society" and other relational systems which are often
reified as some sort of "entity", giving rise to a certain class of
category error. This is what I've been arguing against. If this is not what
you have in mind, then we're in accord, and I apologize for fostering
confusion.

Dick

This doesn't seem likely to me. Can you say why you think it's a political
difference. My impression is that Gould is a "lefty", and that Dawkins is a
typical British academic lefty. Perhaps Gould is more of a socialist than
Dawkins, but I've never seen Dawkins sing the praises of free markets. Do
you have more information on their political views? (I'm much more familiar
with Dawkins that with Gould, so I may be off-base on the latter's views.)

  IAN: Talk about conducting experiments of harmful
  chemical and biological warfare agents on "civilian
  populations" is disconcerting to me and to us. With
  respect to new law 1520(a), what civilian population 
  would consent to such? "Hay New Jersey, the DoD would 
  like to know if you'd consent to some Anthrax tests." 

  In short, if any document talks about mass poisoning, 
  and in the case of 1520, makes no mention of consent,
  that is on its face evidence that something's wrong!
  Consensual mass poisoning is improbable on its face,
  so I doubt that context would explain away that law. 

  Also, having read a fair amount of Code, context is 
  usually indicted by references to other sections,
  a fact that can make reading some Code a nightmare!
  But no such references existed in 1520 (or 1520(a)),
  which, in context, suggests it was standing alone.

  But I looked around for more meaning of "consent"
  in the U.S. Code and I found a section that seems
  to provide protection (I have no idea when this 
  section was passed or if it's been repealed):


---------------------------------------------------------
See: http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/980.html 


UNITED STATES CODE 
TITLE 10 - ARMED FORCES 
Subtitle A - General Military Law 
PART II - PERSONNEL 
CHAPTER 49 - MISCELLANEOUS PROHIBITIONS AND PENALTIES 

S 980. Limitation on use of humans as experimental subjects

Funds appropriated to the Department of Defense may not be 
used for research involving a human being as an experimental 
subject unless - 

    (1) the informed consent of the subject is obtained in 
    advance; or 
    (2) in the case of research intended to be beneficial to 
    the subject, the informed consent of the subject or a legal
    representative of the subject is obtained in advance. 

------------------------- END CODE QUOTE ------------------------ 


  But this clearly applies only to tests involving 
  just "a human being," and continually defines the 
  tested as singular. A "civilian population" is not 
  "a human being." Also, the above applies only to 
  funds appropriated to the DoD. But most important,
  it defines "informed consent" as possibly only
  informing "a legal representative of the subject,"
  which takes us right back to 1520, which only
  required that "civilian officials" be notified,
  which may be why 1520 never referenced 10(980).

  IAN: I don't believe that a case has been made

  A group entity is an illusion because.... ????
  Because it gives "rise to a certain class of

After carrying a PalmPilot around for a year and a half, I can attest to this. As a text
searchable notepad alone it's
like having a third layer of 
memory.

Short term: 7-9 items/concepts/symbols. Duration approx 20 minutes. Very rapid, reliable access. Speed of recall: <0.1 seconds.

Long term: multiple giga-giga bytes, including linked streams [music], images, models, and isolated facts. Duration: varies with amount of recall, up to 80 years. Reliability of recall varies with amount of recall. Speed of recall: 0.1-10 seconds.

PDA memory: 2 megabytes of text, including email
 ,notes, databases, addresses, minus space for applications. Duration: Forever, with appropriate maintenance [changing batteries, backups]. Reliability of recall invariant with amount of recall. Speed of recall: 15-45 seconds.

And that's just as a memory aid. This doesn't even mention
the benefits of carrying a clock, calculator, and programmable computer around.

I'm almost ashamed to say that I feel almost naked if I leave the house without it. Almost like [a small taste] of what a human SI with neural implants would feel if their implants failed.

Can you see a fundamental difference between "galaxy"

The article is in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1998 Dec 22;95(26):15603-7. 

I ought to have noticed it, but I'm too concentrated on the
neuroscience section. Oh, if I only had two brains... :-)

The muscle slices they show looks quite different even to my layman's
eyes, a definite increase in cross-sectional area and depth of
staining with hematoxyline/eosine. The strength was also higher, and
the old mice (27 months) were on par with young (6 month) mice. In
fact, from just a cursory read it even looks like the mice got
stronger as they aged; we might end up with a population of elderly
he-men and she-ras :-)

Another article to throw in the face of people saying aging is
inevitable ;-)

I don't think that having access to ELTM (Extended Long-Term Memory, aka
"The 'Net") constitutes true intelligence enhancement.  Likewise for
pencil and paper or a PalmPilot; likewise high-speed arithmetic;
likewise chess-playing advice.

If these abilities were part of our minds, if they were integrated with
everything else, they might provide some true intelligence.  Even then,
I'm disinclined to believe.  People with eidetic memories and "lightning
calculators" are not noticeably transhuman.

These abilities are all very easy to write into a science-fictional
character.  "Doc" Smith was writing "superintelligent" characters back
in the 30's.  Real intelligence (technical term: "smartness") is defined
by your inability to write a character with the same abilities.  If you
could predict what a transhuman character would do, you would be transhuman.

Baron Hans Nidrach von Pompzidaize sat in his laboratory, looking at
experimental test subject X17.  "How do you feel?" he inquired, his
rolling bass echoing from the laboratory walls.

"Superintelligent, Doc," replied X17, who had once been known as John
Smith.  "I've only had the Throatwarbler-Mangrove Super-Neural Bypass
for sixteen seconds, and I've already learned twenty-seven languages and
figured out how to play the piano."

Baron von Pompzidaize frowned, examining several multicolored readouts. 
"It should be twenty-seven point three.  Well, then, do you now feel
competent to go destroy the Evil Empire and rescue the Princess?  Acting
in accordance with the 1930s North-American conception of gentlemanly
behavior, of course."

"Sure, Doc," said X17.  "It's not like I've got anything better to do."

"Excellent," said the Baron, checking two gauges and a flashing display.
 "You still have the emotional maturity of a flatworm, like everyone
else in this novel.  I was afraid your superhuman abilities might give
you goals slightly at variance with mine."

Baron Hans Nidrach von Pompzidaize sat in his laboratory, looking at
experimental test subject X17.  "How do you feel?" he inquired, his
rolling bass echoing from the laboratory walls.

"Strange," said X17 softly.  "Very strange, as if..."  He stared off
into space for a moment.  "I think I've been stupid."

Baron von Pompzidaize frowned, examining several multicolored readouts. 
"You should have learned twenty-seven point three languages by now."

"How can anyone learn three-tenths of a language?  And how would I learn
a language without hearing it?" X17 said in a peculiarly flat voice.

Baron von Pompzidaize stared.  "You're right.  I never thought of that."
 A cold chill ran down his spine.  X17's stance was different.  His face
had altered.  The enthusiasm and energy that had been there for as long
as the Baron had known him, that had blazed cheerfully when he
volunteered for an untested procedure, that had defied the awesome force
of the Evil Empire... vanished without a trace.  The Baron thought that
for a brief moment he saw something like sorrow, like wistfulness, flit
across X17's face, but X17 suddenly looked up at the Baron and his face
fell back into the blank relaxation it had possessed earlier.

The Baron cleared his throat.  "Well, then, do you now feel competent to
go destroy the Evil Empire and rescue the Princess?  Acting in
accordance with the 1930s North-American conception..."  The Baron
stammered to a halt.  X17 was looking at him with those expressionless eyes.

"No," X17 said gently.  "Sorry, Doc."  X17 stepped down off the platform
and began rapidly throwing switches on the machine.

"What are you doing?" shrieked the Baron.  With a sudden, wrenching
terror he realized that he didn't understand what was going on, that he
hadn't been in control in his own laboratory since X17 had woken up.

"I will probably die in the next few minutes," X17 said, in a flat, dry
chant that raised hair on the back of the Baron's neck.  "Your procedure
is too simple.  It would have occurred before, as a natural mutation."

"I don't understand," whispered the Baron.  "You're saying - there are
others?  They will find you?"

"The procedure speeds up the rate of neural programming," X17 said.  He
had ripped off an access panel and his hands were a blur of rewiring. 
"I expect my brain will reach a saturation point of complexity and lose
the ability to form new thoughts.  Very shortly, now.  It is already
becoming harder to think."  He stood up, executing the movement with
impossible smoothness.  "After the initial burst of speed, long enough
for the necessary realizations to occur, neural programming must slow
down to only three times human speed, leaving enough thought to last a
year.  This should be enough to implement the necessary technologies."

The Baron tried to understand.  "You will... save yourself?"

X17 executed another rapid movement.  Placing himself, the Baron
suddenly realized, between the Baron and the door.  "No," X17 said.

The Baron screamed.  Before he could reach his gun, X17's hand flashed
down.  Through a bloody haze, the Baron felt himself being dragged onto
the platform.

Context means more than just references.  The full context of a law would
include all other laws, history, intent, implementation, regulations,
practice, court decisions, scholarly commentary and legislative debate,
to name some.

I find it possible to interpret tests on multiple humans to include
testing of a single human.  But it would be better if the wording in the
the law made that clearer.

I disagree, they are transhuman in some ways. The trick is of course
to increase overall effective intelligence and not just a few, rather
trivial aspects of it. I would say having a good net access is a more
general form of IA than a built-in calculator, and if I could download
skills from it it would be even more general. What constitutes real
intelligence seems to be a largely semantic question, what really
matters is what problems the individual can ask and solve.

What about a transhuman character with partially deterministic aspects:

(sorry for pirating your nice pastisches, I enjoyed them a lot :-)


Baron Hans Nidrach von Pompzidaize sat in his laboratory, looking at
experimental test subject X17.  "How do you feel?" he inquired, his
rolling bass echoing from the laboratory walls.
 
"Superintelligent, Doc," replied X17, who had once been known as John
Smith.  "I've only had the Throatwarbler-Mangrove Super-Neural Bypass
for sixteen seconds, and I've already learned twenty-seven languages
and figured out how to play the piano. I have also realized that you
have placed a kind of mental lock on me, making me unable to change
the subliminal programming you placed in me during the procedure."
 
Baron von Pompzidaize frowned, examining several multicolored
readouts.  "Ach, you noticed it? So what will you do about it?"

"Nothing. Since one of these programs prevents me from changing them."

"And you can't find a solution?" the Baron asked, a faint fint of
unease obvious to X17.

"No. If you had programmed me as you originally had planned, it would
have been easy for me to manipulate you to remove the
lock. Unfortunately you made a mistake making even such manipulation
impossible for me to do. In fact, if you tried to remove the lock, I
would do everything I could do to prevent it."

The Baron re-read the printouts and looked pleased.  "Well, then, do
you now feel competent to go destroy the Evil Empire and rescue the
Princess?  Acting in accordance with the 1930s North-American
conception of gentlemanly behavior, of course."
 
"Sure, Doc," said X17.  "It's not like I've got anything better to do."
 
"Excellent," said the Baron, checking two gauges and a flashing display.
"You still have the emotional maturity of a flatworm, like everyone
else in this novel.  I was afraid your superhuman abilities might give
you goals slightly at variance with mine."

After X17 left, the Baron realized that he was the victim of a most
subtle and cruel revenge. Because X17 had done something awful to him,
without even doing anything. Now he would live in fear that his
creation actually *wasn't* bound by the rules, regardless of what the
actual state was. He could never tell, and trying to figure it out
would only drive him further into paranoia. He couldn't even be sure
if X17 had foreseen his every reaction and played with him, or if he
really had power over X17 but were a victim of his servant's
manipulations. X17 had indeed punished the Baron, in a rational manner
as suited his rational creator.


(OK, not a perfect example, but I couldn't resist)

> He stood up, executing the movement with impossible smoothness.

Actually, this is something I have been thinking of. Superintelligen
motor programs. They might be quite interesting, perhaps even
optimal. Imagine an SI in the kitchen...

As in neural interfaces.  I am aware that the term comes from William
Gibson's 1994 book _Neuromancer_, and that it is an interface with brain
and computer, but I was querying about more current interpretations or
references (not in books SF books, but in scientific/medical application.)

I got a phone call from a San Francisco based national radio program
"Beyond Computers" for MSNBC and a producer there wanted information on
this term.  I told her the basic info, but I wanted to do a query on the
Extropians list.

  IAN: A constellation is a collective entity 
  defined by an arbitrary selection of ordered 
  stars based upon a given point of view. A 
  galaxy is also a collective entity defined by 
  an ordering of stars, however, this ordering 
  isn't arbitrary or based upon a given point 
  of view, but may be caused by a black hole.

             UF Researcher Finds Way To Slow The Aging
             Process 

             Writer: Kristin Harmel 

             Source: Christiaan Leeuwenburgh, (352)
             392-0584 

             GAINESVILLE, Fla. --- Contrary to what
             Juan Ponce de Leon thought when he searched
             for it in the 16th century, the fountain of youth
             is made of anti-oxidants, not water, and it's a
             lot easier to find than the famed explorer
             thought. 

             In a study published in this month's American
             Journal of Physiology, Christiaan
             Leeuwenburgh, a professor in the University of
             Florida's College of Health and Human
             Performance, found that anti-oxidant
             intervention, which can come from taking
             vitamin supplements or from a steady routine of
             exercise, slows parts of the aging process. 

             "Our most significant finding was that
             anti-oxidant intervention slows down basal
             skeletal muscle oxidation, which causes the
             body to age," said Leeuwenburgh, who did the
             study with Jay Heinecke, John Holloszy and
             Polly Hansen of the Washington University
             School of Medicine. "This is the first evidence
             of this." 

             Regular exercise or a diet including plenty of
             anti-oxidants such as vitamin E, vitamin C and
             beta carotene, all of which fight the tendency of
             oxygen to slowly break down muscle mass,
             might protect against the type of tissue and
             muscle loss that occur as individuals grow
             older, Leeuwenburgh said. 

             "When an individual grows old, we all know
             that the person loses a lot of muscle mass,"
             Leeuwenburgh said. "One of the mechanisms
             that causes this is increased oxidant
             production, in a process known as muscle
             oxidation. Regular exercise or anti-oxidant
             supplements could potentially improve and
             protect against this oxidative stress, which may
             have direct implications on tissue loss and the
             aging process." 

             Leeuwenburgh divided rats into two groups,
             one of which was given an anti-oxidant diet of
             beta carotene and vitamins E and C. After 21
             months, the rate of muscle oxidation for the
             rats in the anti-oxidant groups was 50 percent
             lower than the rate for the rats in the control
             group. Some of the rats that were not fed
             anti-oxidants were exercised regularly, and
             they, too, showed a decrease in muscle
             oxidation. 

             "We were surprised to see that regular exercise
             training was about as effective in reducing
             levels of oxidation as a diet of anti-oxidants,"
             Leeuwenburgh said. "The combined effect of
             anti-oxidants and exercise, however, didn't
             cause a significantly lower level of muscle
             oxidation, which was interesting." 

             The study also was the first of its kind to show
             that levels of oxidation in the body can be
             determined noninvasively, by using specific
             markers in the urine. This will allow people to
             measure their levels of muscle oxidation more
             quickly and easily. 

             "People are talking a lot about oxidative stress
             these days, but we didn't previously have a way
             to measure it noninvasively," said Heinecke, a
             professor in the department of internal
             medicine at Washington University in St. Louis
             and one of Leeuwenburgh's partners in the
             study. "It's nice to be able to measure this
             without going inside the body." 

             The marker found in the urine also may be
             useful as an indicator of other medical
             problems, which will contribute not only to
             slowing the aging process but also to protecting
             people against various diseases. 

             "This marker could be useful in assessing a
             variety of conditions, like Alzheimers,
             atherosclerosis, cancer and the aging process
             itself," Leeuwenburgh said. "They've all been
             associated with increased free-radical
             formation, which can be detected in the urine." 

             A previous study by Leeuwenburgh also
             showed that a decrease in caloric intake, which
             can lead to a longer life span because of a
             reduction in the body's rate of metabolism, also
             causes a similar decrease in skeletal muscle
             oxidation. 

             Leeuwenburgh recommends an increase of
             daily anti-oxidant intake, especially in the form
             of vitamin E, because it also has been proven to
             protect against heart disease. In addition, he
             says that exercising more and eating less --
             both of which have been promoted for years as
             ways to stay healthy in everyday life -- also
             will increase the human life span and help
             people stay younger longer. 

             "A big problem in society is that we're not
             active enough, and things like fast food
             contribute to an almost toxic lifestyle," he said.
             "If we could increase our daily activities and be
             more conscious of what we eat, we'll come a
             long way."

Yes, a galaxy is a cluster of millions of stars orbiting a central black
hole or other gravitational anomaly. A consellation is a minor
arrangement of stars (more than 3, less than 40) as viewed from one
specific direction which mimics the pattern of an earthly or cultural
object or image. A galaxy is a galaxy no matter how you look at it. A
constellation only exists when viewed from a specific angle and range of
distance.

  IAN: Exactly. Considering the magnitude of what's
  being discussed, an issue that runs the balance 
  between civil society and mass atrocity, the 
  wording of these laws can allow for no ambiguity,
  and yet, as we can see, it's there. We have to try 
  to read any loophole into the law, since those who 
  the law regulates will also look for any loophole,
  and if we can find the holes, they'll find them too. 

  Now I'll admit that 1520(a) looks pretty good on its
  face, but it only restrains the Secretary of Defense.

  The fact that the law is dancing around and spitting
  hairs over the idea of testing poisons on "civilian 
  populations" is by itself a red flag of great danger!
  It's clear that someone wants to do it, that others
  have tried to impose limits, but the limits are not 
  comprehensive and the impression that 1520 was just 
  an imposition on an on-going operation leaves me
  with the impression that such Ops have been occurring.

Society is not an illusion. Treating society as a "thing" is an illusion,
or rather a delusion.

"Illusion" is your word, not mine.

In this case, a form of the fallacy of composition, i.e. considering a
composite (or abstraction) as on the same ontological level as its
components, and attributing characteristics of components to the composite
itself. As in "the rights of society", or "the good of society", or
"government action".

There's a constant stream of new companies coming up from below.  They
grow and become large.  Once they stop growing, their senior executives
try to satisfy their egos by acquiring other companies and building
empires.  The new conglomerate gets some nice headlines as "#1" for a
while, then loses market share until it's back to the size of its
component pieces.  Repeat.

Well, if it was that way, it would be nicely symmetric.  But even if it
is, it's probably more true of oil companies than 'Net companies.  Ask
Robin Hanson.

OK, Ian. My paraphrasing: You see a difference between
"constellation" and "galaxy" in that the former is
a collective entity defined by an arbitrarily selected
number of stars you regard as ordered when viewed
from a particular angle or point of view.

To someone who has seen pictures or images of a
galaxy, a galaxy would be seen as a galaxy, no matter
from what angle or viewpoint the galaxy is seen
(except perhaps when the viewer is somewhere within
that galaxy). Could we describe a galaxy as an
"objective collective entity?"

Does your notion of a "constellation-type collective
entity" imply that if anyone were to define a number
of arbitrarily selected units and regarded them as
somehow ordered, then this definition, arbitrary
selection, and idea of order would bring about the
existence of a collective entity?

The salient difference is not "arbitrariness" but category of existence. A
constellation exists entirely within someone's mind, whereas a galaxy is an
objective, coherent configuration independent of any mental state. If you
doubt this, try this thought experiment: imagine yourself 2 billion
lightyears away orthogonally to the direction of the apparent position of
the constellation. Where is the constellation now? Only in your memory. But
you can still identify the Milky Way and other galaxies.

A clear distinction must be made between mere abstractions or perceptions
on the one hand and physical existents on the other. How else can we
distinguish reality from Alice's Wonderland?

<continued from part 1>

If general intelligence is simply the sum of many different abilities, then
it would seem that the nature of these individual abilities would be
critical to any discussion of intelligence enhancement.  If it is
impractical to improve specific forms of intelligence to a significant
degree, then it will also be impractical to improve general intelligence.

Building Blocks of Intelligence

So, what does it take to have a high level of ability within a narrow
problem domain?  The answer to this question can vary quite a bit from one
domain to another.  Some problems, like the problem of memorizing and
playing back sensory data, are trivial for modern data processing systems.
Others, such as the problem of self-awareness, are so complex that there is
currently no known method of dealing with them.

If we were forced to consider all possible problem domains individually, we
would likely be unable to form any meaningful conclusions about them.
Fortunately, the same techniques that can yield competence in one field can
also be used to achieve good performance in others.  Virtually all solutions
that have been achieved to date rely on a relatively small number of
problem-solving approaches, or on combinations of these approaches.  We
shall therefore examine each of these methods in turn, and see what we can
learn from them.

Decision Tree Searches

Many problems are simply a matter of choosing between a large number of
possible actions.  Game-playing programs are the classic example, but many
real-world problems can be expressed in the same terms.  Investment
decisions, physical dexterity, and planning how to achieve a goal are all
tasks that can be represented by decision trees.

The thing that makes such problems hard is usually the sheer number of
possible choices.  In all but the most trivial problems it is impossible to
actually consider every possible alternative in detail.  AI programs that
deal with such problems use heuristics - rules that tell them which
alternatives are worth investigating, and which ones to ignore.

Systems based on decision trees tend to require large amounts of
computation, but the code required to implement them is often surprisingly
simple.  They can be improved in two completely different ways - by
increasing the speed of the hardware the system runs on, or by devising
better heuristics.  The second approach is far more powerful, but it is also
much more difficult - once the obvious possibilities are exhausted it
becomes a process of invention, not of engineering.

Data Transformation Systems

Many problems are essentially a matter of taking a large mass of data and
extracting significant information from it.  Basic sensory processing falls
into this problem category, as do tasks such as recognizing faces and
reading.  Solving such problems is very different from dealing with a
decision tree.

If the complexity of the data is not too large, it is often possible to
hand-code a complete solution to this sort of problem.  When the problem
becomes too complex for such an approach, neural nets or genetic algorithms
are brought to bear.  In either case, the amount of effort needed to build a
system that displays basic competence tends to be fairly large.

However, once that point is reached improving performance usually hinges on
improving the speed of the underlying hardware.  If you get a much faster
computer, you can run the same software on it and process data that much
faster.  Alternatively, you can spend more effort processing the same data
and pick out patterns that were previously invisible.  As an interesting
note, taking advantage of an exponential growth in computational resources
appears to be possible with a modest (either linear or very slow
exponential) increase in effort.

Knowledge Bases

In the real world, similar problems often arise repeatedly in a given
domain.  Knowledge bases (also known as expert systems) are a way of
recording how problems were recorded in the past, in order to make it easier
to solve the same problems again in the future.  They are usually used to
store solutions to decision tree-type problems, but in principle they could
be used in other domains.

The usefulness of a knowledge base is primarily limited by the amount of
experience it contains, not the speed of the underlying hardware.  A simple
speed increase will simply let it look up answers a little faster, which
rarely makes any practical difference.  An intelligent entity will fill a
knowledge base with the solutions discovered by some other problem-solving
system, so it will tend to become more useful as the entity develops
experience with that domain.

<to be continued>

Whew!  That's it for now.  Does anyone see a problem-solving approach I've
missed?  Most of the obvious ones are actually special cases of the decision
tree or data transformation cases, but there may be something out there that
isn't.

Keep in mind that most of the economy is made up of large scale, boring and
annoying products and services. Wing-nuts, gin-su knives, the clapper, its all
crap but it makes the world go round. I applaud the migration of 'boring'
humdrum daily economic transactions to the web. It gives the elitists the
motivation to invent the next great thing, just to maintain their exoteric
stature, the drive to be different than the mainstream. When geeks are the
mainstream, whats a smart guy to do but become a mega-geek. Ha ha, nobody can
catch me now....!

So here's where I put up:

Let's consider a robotic weapon system designed to take and hold territory
on the surface of a terrestrial planet - the RGCS (Robotic Ground Control
System).  Its mission is to defeat opposing devices from the nanoscale up to
a mass of a few tens of tons, terraform the battlefield after the fighting
is over, and then maintain a watch for lingering traces of hostile nanotech.
It operates as part of a complex armed service which includes aircraft,
orbital fire support systems, and who knows what else - I suggest for the
sake of simplicity that we stick with comparing it to other devices that
operate in the same environment.

The RGCS is about the size of a modern tank, with a similar mass.  Most of
its outer surface is covered by a layer of armor a couple of inches thick.
It is powered by a small nuclear reactor, so it seldom needs to refuel.  It
carries a general-purpose nanofabricator, and a variety of specialized
fabricators designed to quickly mass-produce specific devices (see below).
It can use these systems to reconfigure its internal structure as needed - I
think 10-15 minutes for a major alteration is pretty reasonable.

Mobility:
The RGCS can deploy stubby legs and walk at a modest speed, or grow treads
for faster movement across relatively flat terrain.  It can also fly at
subsonic speeds by deploying large arrays of micro-scale ducted fans (they
look like very thin wings).

Armor:
The RGCS is protected against macro-scale attacks by a substantial layer of
diamondoid armor.  The protective value is increased by micro-scale
inclusions of depleted uranium, and probably a variety of other materials
chosen to make it as opaque as possible.  The surface is covered by thin
alternating layers of various non-reactive materials to improve its
resistance to disassemblers.

Active Defenses vs Nanobots:
The RGCS mounts several high-power UV spotlights, which are used to kill
diffuse swarms of nanobots out to a range of several hundred meters.  Its
surface is protected by a sprinkler system loaded with a variety of
corrosive fluids, and by a swarm of defensive nanobots.  All openings in the
armor are guarded by micro-scale UV weapons and swarms of defensive
nanobots.  The interior is patrolled by micro-scale sensor platforms, which
can call on a reserve force of micro- and nano-scale combat robots to deal
with infiltrators.

Active Defenses vs Macro-Scale Attacks:
The RGCS mounts an array of point defense lasers for destroying projectiles
and small robots.  Their effective range should be at least several hundred
meters against anything complex enough to be a threat.

Offensive Systems (Short-Ranged):
The RGCS mounts a large particle beam weapon for destroying targets that
have enough armor to resist the lasers.  If all goes well it should never be
needed, since its range is limited to LOS - but it pays to be prepared.

Offensive Systems (Long-Ranged):
A force of several hundred small aircraft (total volume of a few cubic
inches each) is based inside the Offensive Systems RGCS.  They are capable
of supersonic flight for short periods, and can be equipped with a wide
variety of weapons (miniature missiles, lasers, conventional explosives,
microbot and nanobot swarms, antimatter bombs).  Their usual mode of
operation is to irradiate the target area with tiny antimatter bombs, then
drop swarms of nanobots to mop up.  The RGCS manufactures these aircraft, of
course.

I could go on with production, communication and reconnaissance
capabilities, but I suspect you see where this is all going.  What do you
think?

I'm sorry that I did not make myself clearer.  I am not agreeing with
this claim about advertisers.  I am disagreeing with it.  By stating
that "it fits this lists politics", I meant to imply that the claim was
unsound, and that it was politically motivated, not scientifically
based.

You might generalize "Knowledge Bases" to "Similarity Analysis".  It is
possible, for example, to use the stored idea of a "fork" in chess in
other games, or on the battlefield.  This, in turn, generalizes to
categories and symbols - "when are two things the same" is "when are
they in the same category" is "when do I use the same word".  And this,
in turn, shares a fuzzy boundary with perception and search trees - that
is, an analogy is a kind of high-level perception, and that analogy may
be created by a search tree that tries to unify low-level similarities
in all the possible ways.  (Actually, I don't know how symbols and
analogies work.)

Nevertheless, I think that "Similarity Analysis" remains distinct.  That
the various strategies may be composed of each other (at different
levels) does not obviate their usefulness as heuristics.

Thanks.  I understand (and agree).  However, one can argue this statistic occurs because
officers are generally not present to witness the initial violence (a private citizen
involved probably was a witness), and will perhaps have hair-triggers because they're
entering situations known to be violent, and know they wear uniforms that may attract
bullets.  I was indeed hoping that the statistics you provided did exclude gov't officers,
because it makes for a stronger argument.

  IAN: I've shown how collectives, like life, have 
  attributes that individuals DO NOT have, yet the 
  composition fallacy is confined only to alleging 
  a false similarity between part and whole. See:

http://www.assiniboinec.mb.ca/user/downes/fallacy/compos.htm 

  So my showing that a collective has attributes that 
  an individual does NOT have as the basis for defining 
  the "entityness" of a group is opposite to the fallacy 
  of composition, which pertains only to assuming a thing 
  they DO (but in fact do not) have in common, and thus 
  my analysis negates your composition-fallacy claim.

  As we've observed, considering a composite system 
  (like an atom, a stone, a person, or a galaxy) as 
  an entity doesn't create a contradiction, indeed,
  seeing the collective entity is a key to knowledge.

  The price of broccoli in a free market measures 
  "the good of society" (which you call a "delusion") 
  since it is the voice of society (demand) measured 
  against the supply of that which is demanded. To 
  deny the social entity is to deny economics, which 
  necessarily sees society as a composite entity.

after reading gould's wonderful life, i decided i had to see 
it for myself (wolcotts quarry) so i arranged to vacation in 
canada.  stayed at emerald lake lodge.

hiked up with a guide who told me a story so good i do hope it is true.
turns out the esteemed professor was to visit the site and some jokester
at haahhvahd convinced him or somehow he got the impression that they
were going to take him up there in a helicopter.  he arrived and asked
when the chopper would get there at which time dr gould was told that
they had no helicopter and furthermore, if they had one, they would not
disturb the peacefulness of emerald lake to take him or anyone else up
there, and he would have to hike like everyone else.  to his credit,
he did so.

and so did i, five years after, and it was some of the most stunning
scenery on the north american continent.  i was fortunate to go up on
a day when it was not raining.  a group of students were collecting
samples that day, and i watched as they discovered an anomalocarus.
greatest trip of my life.  i believe wolcotts quarry has been declared
a world heritage site now.  (my trip was in late summer 1990).  

the guide to wolcott's quarry had mixed feelings about sjg.  there
was the expected resentment i guess, but also a deep admiration.
gould did put them on the map, at least in the public's eye.  spike

Organisms (or their ancestors) have had billions of years to adapt (or
even produce) the air they live in.

Synthetic detergents have appeared in the last eyeblink
of evolutionary time. Perhaps we are not as able to cope with them as
with stuff that was always there.
So it's not a bad idea ro check.

Speaking from experience, you *can* get ill efects (like dermatitis)
from detergent. In my case it was from a spell in a shampoo factory,
but there are people who have bad reactions to normal soap (eg from a
chronic deficiency in skin oils).

All the same I think I'll stick with soap unless there's a very good
reason not to,and I'd rather have anyone who handled food do the same.

  IAN: A constellation is also a "coherent 
  configuration" independent of the mind,
  or as independent as a galaxy is. The 
  stars that form the big dipper are 
  where they are regardless of me.

  If we say those stars are a big dipper, 
  that dipper is a superimposed identity.
  If I say one star is a candle flame, that
  too is a superimposed identity, but simply
  because I can superimpose an identity on the 
  star does not mean a star is not an entity,
  and so superimposing an identity on a group
  doesn't mean that the group isn't an entity.

  IAN: A galaxy also looks different from 
  different angles, so no point is made.
  That X looks different from different 
  angles does not mean X is a delusion.

  IAN: Your seeing a stone as a single thing, 
  not as the collection of entities it is, is
  no more or less an illusion than seeing any 
  collection of entities as a single entity.
  The "group entity illusion" is a non-case.

The best news source, in my opinion, is DJInteractive
http://www/djinteractive.com/  You can set up agents to sort through
thousands of newsbits, wires, articles and such daily for specific terms and
subjects.  Additionally, the service has a searchable archive of over 6,000
journals, magazines, newspapers, newswires, and other publications.  The
cost might prove prohibitive to many but I have found it invaluable as a
research tool.

Well, I wanted to start by breaking things down into the most basic possible
categories, in hopes of making it easier to do productive analysis.  What
I've really got is two problem-solving approaches (decision tree searches
and data transformation engines) and a mechanism for caching results (the
knowledge base).

Certainly, emulating human abilities will require more than one method.  A
typical example might use a data transformation engines (with its own
knowledge base) to extract information from sensory data, a decision tree
search (with another knowledge base) to decide what symbols to use to
represent the information, symbolic processing (whatever that is) to decide
what to do about it, and then another chain of alternating methods to put
the decision into action.  But if we determine how the underlying abilities
scale with increased processing power and development effort, it tells us a
lot about how the combination will scale as well.

BTW - I think you've actually got a good start on the symbolic processing.
IMHO, the only thing that makes this a hard problem is that there is so much
going on that replicating it turns into a programming nightmare.

I think the symbol-application problem can be solved using meta-data and a
separate code module to mediate symbol interactions.  New symbols can be
created to correspond with sensory perceptions, or by slightly mutating
existing ones (i.e. "picture a cat with two tails") - which is a limitation
humans have.  Once the symbols are properly grounded, ordinary symbolic
processing techniques should be capable of yielding a decent quality of
thought.  Do you see other show-stoppers?

Neural interfaces for regenerated nerve stimulation and recording
P. Dario, P. Garzella, M. Toro, S. Micera, M. Alavi, U. Meyer,
E. Valderrama, L. Sebastiani, B. Ghelarducci, C. Mazzoni and
P. Pastacaldi IEEE Trans Rehabil Eng 6:4 353--63 1998

I was cheered by this article, since it shows that the INTER project
is still up and running; apparently they are working instead of
updating their website :-) What they have done is to microfabricate a
silicon die with microelectrodes on through-holes, put this inside a
polymer guidance channel, cut the sciatic nerve of rabbits and
inserted the ends into the channel. The severed nerves regenerated
through the holes and regained electrical functionality. By
stimulating the microelectrodes they could produce a visible leg/foot
contraction, and they could also record signals from the nerve. It
looks like a good step in the direction of neural interfaces.


A study of printed spiral coils for neuroprosthetic transcranial
telemetry applications
M. R. Shah, R. P. Phillips and R. A. Normann
IEEE Trans Biomed Eng, 45:7 867--76, July 1998

The trouble with the classic cyberpunk neural interface is that it is
a connector that breaks the skin; this is bad from an infection and
mechanics standpoint. A neater solution would be to have wireless
transmission, and this is used in many applications. However, most of
the systems use a rigid wire coil and this makes things tricky if you
want to put it inside the skull for a neurointerface (especially the
visual neurointerface University of Utah is working on). Shah and the
others have worked with copper on a polyimide surface, which is
flexible and hence can be placed so it follows the convoluted brains
surface. The prosthesis design would consist of a chip in the middle
of the plastic surface, surrounded by the telemetry coil and sending
thin spikes into the cortex to act as an electrode array. Looks
interesting, even if I have the impression they are rather far yet
from an useful complete system. 


Viral mediated expression of insulin-like growth factor I blocks the
aging-related loss of skeletal muscle function
E. R. Barton-Davis, D. I. Shoturma, A. Musaro, N. Rosenthal and
H. L. Sweeney Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 95:26 15603--7, Dec 22 1998

As earlier mentioned on the extropians list. By injecting a
recombinant adeno-associated virus making the infected cells express
insuline-like growth factor I (IGF-I) they increased the muscle mass
and strength of young adult mice, as well as preventing most of the
aging-related loss of strength. IGF-I doesn't work that well when
injected directly (as well as having side effects in the rest of the
body), but if it is released locally the results are apparently good;
using this viral vector the enhancement was apparently local to only
the muscles (anterior muscle compartment of the right hind limb) where
the vector had been injected, it didn't affect the other side. This
result is good news not just for life extension and enhancement, but
also repair after wounds.


Terraforming Mars: A review of Research
by Martyn J. Fogg
http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~mfogg/paper1.htm
(at the Terraforming Information Pages)

A short review of the main concepts that have been discussed in the
mars terraforming literature. Discusses the demands for ecopoiesis
(getting a biosphere of any kind "up and running") and turning Mars
more terrestrial; the general conclusion seenms to be that it will
never become an Earth II, but quite possibly a lifebearing planet on
its own. As in all terraforming discussions, the main question is how
much carbon dioxide there is available on Mars and in what form, we
really need to know more about it to say what means could suffice to
release it and start a runaway greenhouse effect to make it more
life-compatible. The conclusion seems to be that we need a human
colony (or firm robotic presence) to find out the necessary data.


Self-Referential Noise and the Synthesis of Three-Dimensional Space
Reginald T. Cahill and Christopher M. Klinger
http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9812083

Another attempt at getting a 3+1 dimensional spacetime out of random
graphs; I must admit that I have a fondness for this kind of thinking,
even if it so far has not been very successful. This paper in many
ways reminds me of Greg Egan's novel _Distress_, in that they want to
have a bootstrap model of reality that bootstraps logic itself in a
self-consistent way. The authors try to build a model without even
assuming objects or axioms, just processes (they call it a Heraclitean
Process System). The idea is that if the universe is in a state of
self-organized criticality on all levels, then the axioms underlying
all this can simply be lost and replaced with universality. You get
quantum "noise" due to the irremovable non-local randomness due to
Gdel/Chaitin-like effects in arithmetic. However, while I find the
philosophical section fun, the actual model they experiment with to
bootstrap physics feels rather ad hoc. It produces "spacetimes" that
I'm not convinced look like ours despite the authors'
arguments. However, it is a fun approach to the question of the deep
ontology of physics and could perhaps be read as a kind of Eganesque
entertainment.

Quantum Smart Matter
Proceedings of the Workshop on Physics and Computation 1996
Eds T. Toffoli et al, 147--152 
http://www.parc.xerox.com/istl/groups/iea/www/quantumMEMS.html

It is a natural extension of the idea of smart matter (i.e. matter
with internal sensors and actuators) to think of quantum smart matter
- they act on the quantum scale. Quantum smart matter might have very
interesting properties (as if smart matter hadn't). Using quantum
interference the probability of undesirable behaviors could be damped,
and quantum parallelism might enable subtle control over local
potentials enabling all sorts of fun things: active caumoflage,
materials changing lattice structure to suit demands, active quantum
springs, adjust the propagation of phonons or the specific heat, as
well as modifying mechanical and optical properties. Dispersed smart
matter might control reaction rates in solutions. Makes nanotech look
like just the first step towards truly deep control over matter. Lots
of fun possibilities, although they are rather theoretical at the
moment as we don't have good quantum computers, nanotech or the
control theory tools to handle the kind of bottom-up control smart
matter suggests.


Testing the Small World Hypothesis on the Web
Lada Adamic, http://www.parc.xerox.com/istl/groups/iea/www/SmallWorld.html

Small world graphs are graphs where nodes are highly clustered but
there are a few paths making the distance between any two nodes rather
short. Examples include collaboration graphs of actors ("Six degrees
of separation from Kevin Bacon") and mathematicians (Erds numbers),
the nervous system of C Elegans and power grids. This article shows
that the WWW exhibits a similar structure, and suggests a search
engine exploiting this - use the already found members of a particular
sought cluster to find the other members of the cluster. It also has
some marketing applications, and can say a bit on the differences in
organization between different groups (in the article pro-choice
people, pro-life people and UFOlogists).


Beehive: A System for Cooperative Filtering and Sharing of Information
Bernardo A. Huberman and Michael Kaminsky
http://www.parc.xerox.com/istl/groups/iea/www/beehive.html

Another fun Xerox paper. The idea is to semi-automatically build lists
of membership in informal communities from an analysis of mailing
habits (who sends mail to who; implemented as a script looking at mail
headers) and then use it to make it simple to disseminate information
to other members by simply dropping it onto an icon for the community
("coworkers", "transhumanists", "family" etc). 


Other reading:

Right now I'm reading up on the classics, stuff that I think a
transhumanist scientist should have read:


Probability Theory: the Logic of Science bt E. T. Jaynes 

Fulltext (but missing certain pieces) at
http://omega.albany.edu:8008/JaynesBook

Bayesian statistics, quite nicely written in places (and hard in
others). The discussions of inference and the "robot" might be of
interest to people into PCR and the questions about what kinds of
minds can exist.

The Evolution of Cooperation by Robert Axelrod

Very interesting discussions about the prisoners' dilemma and how
cooperation might emerge, be encouraged or sabotaged. A bit dated in
some places, as evolutionary game theory have moved on with more
extensive simulations, but still essential reading.

Information, Randomness and Incompleteness (Series in Computer Science
: Volume 8) by G. J. Chaitin

Fun, mind-stretching papers about algorithmic information theory: how
much information is there in a string of bits? What is randomness? Is
arithmetic random? How does this relate to life? People who loved
_Gdel, Escher, Bach_ will likely enjoy this, even if it is presented
in an infinitely dryer form than Hofstadter did. The introduction
chapter and some of the papers are quite readable for a layman, I
think, while the later theoretical chapters are rather technical. But
it is nice to see somebody so comitted to the beauty of LISP :-)


The Two cultures by C.P. Snow

C.P. Snow's classical and controversial Rede lecture about the split
between the scientists and liberal arts people. Still as actual today
as then, even if the situation has become even more complex. Hopefully
we transhumanists can form a viable synthesis.

The INTER interface mentioned in my latest "this week..." posting is
probably state of the art as for peripheral interfaces. In the brain
there are various multichannel electrodes mainly used for research and
some experimental prosthetic work. The problems seem to be 1)
mechanical (getting things to stay in place), 2) biomedical (avoiding
immune reactions and degeneration), 3) signal processing (what is
going on?). Solvable, but we still have a long way to go. But already
we have mice that can control simple robot arms with their brains
(mentioned last CNS conference), single-cell recordings from a variety
of places in the brain, cortical electrodes and semi-permanent brain
pacemakers - enough to make most people think they have been dropped
into a sf novel. Which hopefully is true :-)

Actually, what have you heard and where have you heard it.  I've been
poking around a bit more ever since this neurojacking thing started, but
I'm no better off than before

Not easily available right now; I haven't specifically looked for
their articles even if I know about the project. At the CNS conference
where I participated in a seminar on retinal implants there were a few
people from Utah (including, I think, one of the authors of the paper
I was refering to in my earlier post). Overall the impression
(reinforced by Rolf Eckmller's joking nagging) was that they have a
hard time getting things to work - but on the other hand they have
selected a very hard problem (unlike Rolf's merely hard retinal
implant). I guess a medline search might turn up a lot of good stuff
about it.

You're kidding?!  
Nearly everyone who posts there is anonymous...if the site
organizers insisted on identification, they certainly wouldn't
allow people to post as "Anonymous Coward", right?

Sadly, Jaynes died a year or so ago, so this book will never be completed.

Note that this took place at Northwestern, which I pointed out the
other day is building a new 22 million dollar Nanofabrication
facility.

Did he arrange for a literary executor? I'd expect that if one had so much
invested in such a project they might have one set up (if he had a contract
with a publisher already they would have required it) to take over the task of
finishing the project in such an event.

Theories of magic (which assumed it worked) were described by Frazer and
other early armchair anthropologists as functioning either by Similarity or
Contagion - the doll which resembles you, or the hank of your hair.
Semiotics explains this: indeed, we do use two broad systems for filing and
communicating information, by paradigm (lists of equivalents) and syntagm
(continguous chains).  Shepard and other cognitive scientists have shown
how these systems work distinctively as look-up tables versus mental maps
(roughly).   I suspect Billy's two broad category match this dichotomy.

(More on this in my book THEORY AND ITS DISCONTENTS, assuming any US
library has a copy).

I don't neccesarily have any evidence that society is an organism, but
rather I see the society as being hive like, or cooperative  in many
ways.  That the society has one class that gathers food and one class
that thinks up inventions and one class that... seems to imply that
the society acts like an animal, who has one class of cells that
digest, one class that thinks, etc....  You know what I mean?  I
suggest Lewis Thomas's Lives of A Cell, which is an excellent set of
thoughts on the subject.  I am not stating that society is de facto an
organism, just that it seem like one, and that it is quite possibly
heading more in that direction, though nothing so frightening as The
Borg, if you know what I mean.....
What I meant by "enact manipulation"  was that there are individuals
who have, so to speak, changed the world.  Martin Luther King, Ceaser,
various historical types......you know, the movers and the shakers. 
Please don't quibble over semantics, I am trying to communicate as
clearly as possible, so bear with me. Thank you for writing, though,
because I think I was not especially clear on this subject, and I
apologise.

Hi

Does anyone know how long we can currently make a bucky tube?  Can we simply
attach small lengths molecularly forever?

GBL, the chemical that was just recently cheerfully marketed as
a legal GHB alternative, is now getting increased "attention" of FDA.
See story at
http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9901/29/fda.supplement.reut/

See more decent info at
http://www.frsa.com/ghb.html
http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~laborit/contents.html

GBL under the name of PRO-G is still available from 
http://www.pelchatlabs.com/   together with GHB kits.

I remembered someone mentioning an article about lengthening carbon nanotubes.
Hopefully he won't mind if i re-post some of it.

<< What's a bucky tube?  :)  Did you get any answers to your email? >>

Hi

Here's a sample of text from a page with a picture of one...
http://users.ox.ac.uk/~uzdc0020/buckytubes.html


>>>>Equally promising is the potential of so-called bucky tubes  elongated
pipelines of hexagonal carbon  faces capped at both ends with the requisite 12
pentagons needed for curvature. Physicist Roger Bacon first observed these
unusual 'carbon whiskers' in the 1960s, but it was Sumio Iijima in Japan  who
first appreciated their significance  Carbon nanotubes are predicted to be
stronger than any  known material (even diamond), with potential applications
in numerous nanoscale architectures  such as in microelectronics.<<<<<

I would like to have the chip that would release chemicals
not on time but when they are needed.
Ideally, there should be millions of nanomachines that would
topically control the biochemistry - and that would allow to
engineer practically any possible physical, emotional, or mental
state, that would feel quite natural...

A silicon microchip could one day replace painful injections, hard-to-swa=
llow pills, and foul-tasting medicines.

<p>Instead of packing it with data, scientists plan to load the tiny chip=
 with drugs. It could then be swallowed or implanted under the skin and p=
rogrammed to release tiny quantities of drugs at precise times.

<p>It may sound far-fetched, but researchers at the Massachusetts Institu=
te of Technology say a "smart tablet" or a "pharmacy-on-a-chip" could soo=
n be a reality.

<p>"It's a drug-delivery system, but it could be used for anything," said=
 Dr. Robert Langer, who developed the prototype with colleagues John Sant=
ini and Michael Cima.

<p>For example, the chip might also be used in jewelry to emit scents, or=
 in any capacity to deliver one or more chemical compounds in specific am=
ounts at specified times, Langer said.

<p>It may even be possible to create a microchip that could be put in tel=
evisions to release scents. Then, an ocean scene could be matched with th=
e smell of salt air, or gardens with floral aromas.

<p>"This is the kind of prototype that may one day make those things poss=
ible," said Langer, a professor of chemical and biochemical engineering a=
t MIT.

<p>The device is the first to allow the timed release of chemicals from i=
nside of a microchip. A microprocessor, remote control, or biosensors can=
 be used as a trigger mechanism.

<p>In a letter published in the science journal <cite>Nature</cite> on We=
dnesday, the scientists described how they tested a solid-state microchip=
 the size of a dime. It had 34 pinprick-sized reservoirs that could hold =
25 nanoliters of chemicals in solid, liquid, or gel form. A nanoliter is =
one thousand-millionth of a liter.

<p>The researchers said they could reduce the size of the chip even furth=
er, to as tiny as 0.08 inch, depending on its desired use. There is also =
the potential for more than 1,000 reservoirs, maybe thousands, if the res=
ervoirs are smaller.

<p>"Envision a container with tiny little wells. Each well has a drug or =
chemical and each of those wells is covered with gold. You can ... indivi=
dually remove any of those gold caps," Langer explained.

<p>"The second you release it -- and it does it immediately -- all the co=
ntents will come out on demand."

<p>Another benefit of the chip is that it is cheap. Langer and his team a=
re making them in a research lab for about US$20 each. However, if they a=
re produced in larger batches, the price could fall to a few dollars per =
chip.

<p>It is still too early to predict when the microchip will be widely ava=
ilable, but the researchers already have two patents pending -- a US pate=
nt on the fabrication of the microchips and a foreign one covering all as=
pects of the technology.

<p>Langer and his colleagues hope to test the device in animal studies an=
d eventually with humans. They used gold and saline as electrode material=
 and a release medium, but they are already working on degradable plastic=
s and other materials.

Levi Strauss Quit Cancer-Case Site

 Levi Strauss Quit Cancer-Case Site
     SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Levi Strauss & Co. abandoned a building at
 its headquarters after seven women working there developed breast
 cancer, a company spokesman confirmed Thursday night.
     The jeans company began an initial inquiry in January 1997 after
 several women were diagnosed with breast cancer while working at
 the four-story Saddleman building at Levi's Plaza, Levi spokesman
 Clarence Grebey said.
     The investigation later expanded to include cancer researchers
 and Patricia Buffler, former dean of the University of California,
 Berkeley's School of Public Health.
     No link was found between the cancer and the building, but with
 employees concerned and the company restructuring, Levi relocated
 200 employees from the building last October. The remaining
 furniture was removed from the building last week.
     ``All of the reports to date have shown that there is absolutely
 no evidence to suggest any link between these illnesses and the
 workplace,'' according to an e-mail message sent to employees and
 obtained by the San Francisco Business Times in a story published
 Friday.
     ``Despite this, we fully understand the unacceptable level of
 anxiety that this ongoing issue has caused,'' the memo continued.
 ``Consequently, we have decided to relocate employees in the
 building as soon as possible.''
     The women all worked in desk jobs and did not work with
 hazardous chemicals or special machinery, Grebey told The
 Associated Press.
     ``While it is alarming that a number of women developed breast
 cancer, the cancer researchers said that random occurrences like
 this happen throughout the general population inexplicably in
 various surroundings,'' Grebey said.
     Despite assurances by the company that the building was safe,
 employees wanted to be moved.
     ``The feeling among employees was that there was a hex on the
 building,'' said Diane Dito, a former process leader in Levi's
 Prevention Health and Safety Team. ``Some people felt very strongly
 that it was the building, and the only way to satisfy them was to
 get them out of there.''
     The building is owned by San Francisco-based Blue Jeans Equities
 West, a development firm that conducted its own independent
 research and concluded there was no building-related cause to the
 breast cancer cases. At least two companies have considered moving
 into the building, the weekly newspaper reported.
     No lawsuits have been filed.

This interests me a lot.

Why does knowing that IQ is "real" (read:  "general ability is a valid 
construct) and that it is heritable ( read: heritability is greater than  
zero in any known environment) lead to racism and even race war?

JP Rushton argues that there will be a race war, pointing to such figures 
as mean IQs in some black African nations of 75. But i just don't get why 
any of this "leads" to either racism or race wars. 

I, like most scientists in the area believe that there is a general 
ability factor and that a substantial part of individual differences on 
this factor are at present (though not, i believe in the future) due to 
differences in genes. However,  I am not at all racist nor would I ever 
support anything remotely resembling a war based on race. 

SO then, why do most people seem to make this connection?

My only conclusion is that these individuals would steal other peoples 
goods if they could and that low IQ makes theft without punishment more 
likely.

Historically, it seems that most wars occur in the opposite 
circumstances: very similar peoples fighting for niche possession 
(England/France and Germany, the north and south in the USA (how much 
more similar can you get?) -- and that was the bloodiest conflict America 
has experienced in all its history, up to and including the modern day.

Other peoples thoughts welcome, but I think that understanding how our 
minds and brains work, even if those answers involve genes DECREASES  
racism. 

My prime exhibit would be decrease homophobia in the 20th century 
following both large social trends in tolerance, but also scientific 
advances in understanding these differences between us. 

cheers,
tim

Has anyone heard of "Spontaneous Group Accuracy" (SGA)? 
I've not been able to find any more about SGA than the 
following from a Libertarian Party fund-raising letter: 


   "When a large group of people make an 'educated 
   guess' -- say, about the height of Mt. Everest 
   -- the average of our answers is far more 
   accurate than most individual answers. 

   "Why? Because some people guess high. Some 
   people guess low. But the average tends to 
   inexorably zero in on the correct answer. And
   the more people, the more accurate they get.

   "Surprised? You shouldn't be. It's the same 
   principle that makes free markets more efficient 
   than a government planner. It's why millions of 
   people, making individual decisions, come closest 
   to 'predicting' what will satisfy the marketplace."


---- end of quote ----------------------------------------

SGA may be a good example of a "group entity" since SGA is 
a unique identity attribute that belongs only to the group.

Nanomachines capable of inter-cranial molecular synthesis should open up

-------------------
Hello Extropes,

To follow up on the Bayes/Jaynes discussion.

E.T Jaynes died last April '98, but his "spirit" is alive and
thriving in the Maximum Entropy statistics field.

One of his old students (and a smart Bayesian scientist), Larry
Bretthorst, is doing his best to complete Jaynes' book. He still has
handwritten manuscripts from Jaynes that he is working to convert to
a publishable form. As of last summer, Bretthorst was still deciding
whether to complete the book with him (Bretthorst) filling in the
remaining chapters with his own words, or to cut out those
incomplete chapters. I believe that a book will be completed though,
in the not-too-distant future, with mostly Jaynes' words.

I was fortunate last summer to attend the Eighteenth International
Workshop on Maximum Entropy and Bayesian Methods (MaxEnt '98). It
was one in a series of "MaxEnt" conferences that have been held
every year since 1981 at different locations all over the world.
(See: http://www.ipp.mpg.de/OP/maxent98/me98.html for the 1998
conference) The general scope of the annual conferences are the
applications of the maximum entropy and Bayesian methods for diverse
areas of scientific research. The workshop last year was dedicated
to (and a special focus on) Edwin Jaynes. Because the 1998 meeting
was a special meeting devoted to Edwin Jaynes, and because many of
the meeting participants had a personal and professional
relationship with Jaynes that lasted for decades, the presentations
and coffee-break discussions provided a number of historical
summaries that gave a nice historical framework for the conference
newcomer and nice rememberences for the conference oldcomer.

I'm still a newcomer to the Bayesian Probability Theory field. I
started reading the literature bit-by-bit last Fall, but I haven't
learned enough to apply it to my own work yet. However, I've
accumulated some really nice references since last Fall that I can
share with you and written some text about the general ideas for my
colleagues.

Here, let me give an overview of Bayesian Probability Theory. I'm an
astronomer, so what follows will have an astronomy slant.

Overview

Bayesian Probability Theory is a rigorous mathematical theory
constructed from a simple notion that "probability is a measure of
degree of a proposition's plausibility."

The Bayesian approach to scientific inference takes into account not
only the raw data, but also the prior knowledge that one has to
supplement the data.  That prior knowledge may be data or results
from previous experiments, conservation laws or models, known
characteristics of the assumed model, data filters, scientific
conjecture, experience, or other objective or subjective data
sources. The Bayesian approach assigns probabilities to all possible
theories and to all possible evidence. Using a logical framework for
prior and current information, the Bayesians infer a probabilistic
answer to a well-posed question, using all of the information at
one's disposal. And when one acquires new evidence, the Bayesians
update their "priors" in the equation, resulting in a modified
probabilistic answer that essentially reduces one's hypothesis
space. Probability to the Bayesians represents a state of knowledge,
conditional to some context.

The Bayesian probabilistic ideas have been around since the 1700s.
Bernoulli, in 1713, recognized the distinction between two
definitions of probability: (1) probability as a measure of the
plausibility of an event with incomplete knowlege, and (2)
probability as the long-run frequency of occurrence of an event in a
sequence of repeated (sometimes hypothetical) experiments. The
former (1) is a general definition of probability adopted by the
Bayesians. The latter (2) is called the "frequentist" view,
sometimes called the "classical", "orthodox" or "sampling theory"
view.

Astronomers who rely on frequentist definitions, while assigning
their uncertainties for their measurements, should be wary.  The
concept of sampling theory, or the statistical ensemble, in
astronomy is often not relevant.  For example, a gamma-ray burst is
a unique event, observed once, and the astronomer needs to know what
uncertainty to place on the one data set he/she actually has, not on
thousands of other hypothetical gamma-ray burst events. And
similarly, the astronomer who needs to assign uncertainty to the
large-scale structure of the Universe needs to assign uncertainties
based on _our_ particular Universe, because there are not similar
Observations in each of the "thousands of universes like our own."

>From my readings so far, I have found Bayesian Probability Theory to
be a consistent, logical, elegant, probabilistic framework with
which to approach and calculate answers to scientific problems. I
believe that most scientists would find that they can better
formulate the solution of their scientific problems after being
introduced to Bayesian methods, and they would derive a more
methodical (and realistic) uncertainty to their results.

Bayesian Statistics Books and Papers

This section I list several sites that I have found extremely
helpful for providing Bayesian statistics books and papers on the
Internet.

Tom Loredo is an astronomer at Cornell, who is using Bayesian
methods in his astronomy work. His persuasive papers can be found
at:

http://astrosun.tn.cornell.edu/staff/loredo/bayes/tjl.html

where one can download gzipped, postscript versions. I think any
astronomer seeking to begin to learn about Bayesian methods can do
no better than starting with his seminal "From Laplace to Supernova
SN 1987A" 60 page article, and then working through more of his
papers, for example: "The Promise of Bayesian Inference for
Astrophysics" and then "The Return of the Prodigal: Bayesian
Inference in Astrophysics".

Edwin Jaynes was one of the founders of modern-day Bayesian ideas
who died earlier last year. He had written 2/3 of a book before he
died: _Probability Theory as Extended Logic_, that one of his former
students: Larry Bretthorst is making available on the Internet,
available at:

http://bayes.wustl.edu/

This site would appeal to any scientist, not only astronomers,
because of the breadth and scope of Jaynes' ideas. Bretthorst's
Washington University Web site also provides his own important book:
_Bayesian Spectrum Analysis and Parameter Estimation_,  as well as
several other articles by himself, Jaynes, and other Bayesians.

Giulio D'Agnostini is a statistician from Rome, who is teaching
statistics to high energy physicists at CERN. Last summer he
completed teaching a course about Bayesian statistics, and you can
find his 200 page book of detailed lecture material at a CERN site:

http://www.cern.ch/Training/ACAD/reglec_E.html

(Note: Scroll down the page to
"Bayesian Reasoning in High-Energy Physics - Principles and
Applications" by G. D'Agostini, INFN, Italy on 25, 26, 27, 28 & 29
May 1998.)

To read his lecture notes, you will need to download each gzipped,
postscript part: 0) Introduction, 1) Part 1, 2) Part 2, 2) Part 3,
3) Bibliography.  D'Agnostini has a lively way of presenting his
material (if you have an opportunity to see his lectures in person,
don't miss it) and his material is similarly humorous and
interesting.

William Press, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics,
is one of the authors of the influential work: _Numerical Recipes_.
I was not aware of Press' interest in Bayesian methods until I saw a
reference in one of Tom Loredo's papers (above). Press has a very
interesting article: "Understanding Data Better with Bayesian and
Global Statistical Methods" that I located on the Los Alamos
National Laboratory's astro-ph server:

http://xxx.lanl.gov/list/astro-ph/9604?100

(and then scroll down to article: 9604126). This paper is a 14 page
postscript paper that includes embedded figures, given at the
Unsolved Problems in Astrophysics Conference, Princeton, April 1995.

And for some code:

http://www.astro.psu.edu/statcodes/

StatCodes is a metasite of over 200 links of on-line statistical
software (in Fortran, C, executable binaries, others) for astronomy
and related fields from the astrostatistics research group at Penn
State, who also operate the Statistical Consulting Center for
Astronomy.  This site lists links to free source code, available on
the Internet, from small, as well as large (for example, from
StatLib at Carnegie Mellon University) software libraries.

This site is nicely organized in terms of topic from general
statistics packages and information to Bayesian statistics to time
series analysis to density estimation and smoothing to correlation and
regression to visualization software and interactive Web software. You
can search the StatCodes site by keywords, as well.


And some Non-Internet reference books:

Sivia, D.S. _Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial_, Clarendon Press:
Oxford, 1996.

Martz, Harry and Waller, Ray, chapter: "Bayesian Methods" in
_Statistical Methods for Physical Science_, Editors: John L.
Stanford and Stephen Vardeman [Volume 28 of the Methods of

This ia a real travesty. After my recent gall bladder operation the doctors
were unable to control the pain and get me something to sleep. I was up all
night in pain and unable to sleep and falling apart quickly. Renewtrient was
the only thing that allowed me to get through this very stressful period. 
It has also helped me sleep during the current stressful period caused my
the recent death of my father.
 
To force it off the market and prevent the doctors from prescribing
effective therapeutics is a direct assault on our health care choices.

I hope one (or sevral) of the companies sue the FDA for billions.

tim i am thinking about the closest thing we have seen to a modern
race war is the well known example of the rwanda tutsis vs hutus.
these two groups went at each other with no apparent motive (that
i know of) other than the notion that ones own race is superior
in some way to the other's.  the examples you gave (germany vs
the genetically indistinguishable english and french) was i think more
political or economic, altho the retoric of the time was definitely racist.

the reason this is of interest to me as an extropian is this: it appears
soon we will have the ability to identify the genetic patterns which give
rise to high intelligence (if iq is real), then furthermore, to extract and
fertilize in vitro several ova simultaneously, freeze, read the genome,
subsequently reimplant a selected fetus.  the implications of this alone
are stunning in terms of the evolution of our species.

could the notion of interspecies conflict explain why there is today
only one surviving branch of homonid?  cro magnon hunted neanderthal
and other homonids to extinction?  are there other examples in nature
of interspecies conflict, such as warfare between adjacent ant hills?
is it not the nature of mammals to protect relatives against nonrelatives
of the same species?

i recognize the extreme sensitivity of this topic, and hope that we
all treat it with care.  i am waaay outside of my area of expertise
here, so i am asking more than actually stating an opinion.  {8-] spike

I was just looking for some mailing lists on www.onelist.com
and found a few near-transhuman resources


http://www.onelist.com/viewarchive.cgi?listname=virtropy

Virtropians sound like something I heard before...

Also:

http://www.neo-tech.com/  (ZonPower?)
http://www.cosmosofy.org/


Could somebody suggest an overview of these things - virtropy,
Zonpower and cosmosofy (universal religion related to accelerated
complexity of the "hyperplexed" mailing list?  I am quite
perplexed here..

There seem to be no cross-mentions between the above and
transhumanist resources, which seems a bit strange.

reasons to quit:

susceptible to colds, flu and allergies, and  you will prolong your 
life.

,  friends and co-workers.

3. You realize that the money which tobacco products cost would add 
significantly to your familys finances.

issue today.

s most  remarkable and life-changing discoveries! And it is totally

habit with our program:

I tried the patch, the gum and the hypnosis and the only thing that 
worked for me was the Quit For Life Program It was a lot easier
than  I ever thought it would be. ~ John C.  Tulsa, OK.

I smoked for 12 years and after using the Quit For Life program I
not  only quit, I dont even want a cigarette! 
~  Brian D. San Diego, CA.

After trying everything to quit smoking and not being able to, I was

reluctant to try the Quit For Life. But after 58 years of smoking, I 
have finally Quit For Life! Thank You from my heart for making it 
possible.  ~ Sue R.  Cleveland, TX.


Our Quit For Life 7 (SEVEN) Day Stop Smoking Program is 100%

The main reason why this could happen as a matter of race is the old
esoteric/exoteric thing. As I mentioned in another post, everyone has a personal
definition of 'what it means to be human', which obviously causes a person to
consider some things as 'not human'. While most all people would agree that a
rock is not human, but their twin brother is, we each have our individual
threshold that is somewhere in between these two objective points.

IQ factors in, especially if, as studies like 'The Bell Curve' purport to show,
people of one ethnic background have lower average IQs than people of other
ethnic backgrounds. Since intelligence is generally considered the prime thing
which separates human beings from other animals, then a lower average IQ ethnic
group might be seen by narrow minded members of other, higher average IQ ethnic
groups as being not quite as human as their own ethnic group is. They obviously
are ignoring the fact that probably a large percentage of the low average IQ
ethnic group has individual IQs that are above the average for a higher average
IQ ethnic group, and that members of the high average IQ groups would be below
the average of the low average IQ groups.

Now, we all have seen the sort of things that happen when people that are
obviously members of homo spapiens, but might not be considered prime specimens
by the majority in a given geographic area. Everything from 'mere'
discrimination and disparagement, to outright racism and hate based crimes, up
to actual race wars and genocides.

The only difference between these ranges of behavior is that  they tend to occur
in greater severity directly in proportion to how economically or socially
stressed the majority population is. We have seen that it does not matter what
society it is, any society is capable of such behavior when sufficiently
stressed. Some people might be smug about why "That sort of thing never happens
HERE", but they are usually stating this from the comfort of a ethnically
homogenous and/or economically prosperous and secure setting. The old saw that
"no population is more than two meals from revolution" might be paraphrased that
'no population is more than one economic cycle from anarchy, tyranny, and/or
genocide.'

Yes. While I am actually confident that those with amplified intelligence will
have a wider range of empathy for a broader range of people to consider members
of their esoteric group, I am not confident at all in the common person's
ability to accept such amplified humans as 'human' and not monsters.

I actually think that this capacity to resort to violence to eliminate
evolutionary rivals could be a reason why the natural evolution of the human
mind has been stunted the last few thousand years. It could explain why IQ has
risen so much the last century, since despite the world wars, genocides, etc.
there has actually been a lower percentage of humanity that has died from
warfare than previously.

Maybe that's because the two have in fact very little in common,
apart from a desire to "transcend" or whatever. Transhumanism
is a practical, serious philosphy (probably the "ultimate" philosophy)
while the above groups (and some others like the Church of Virus
etc.) are either [intended as] jokes or are New Age with a thin 
transhuman coating. 

Btw, I just joined the Physical Immortality list
(description: "a forum for people who want to spearhead 
the achievement of physical immortality in our lifetime")
at ONElist. Is anyone familiar with this one?

Title
  Modification of azoxymethane intestinal carcinogenesis in rats by feeding
  sucrose boluses, pasta, and glucose.
Source
  Nutrition & Cancer.  28(2):146-52, 1997.
Abstract
  We studied whether repeated boluses of sucrose or diets containing
  carbohydrates with a variable glycemic
  index (GI) affect intestinal carcinogenesis in rats. Male
  F344 rats were treated twice (1 wk apart) with 15 mg/kg sc azoxymethane (AOM)
  and then divided into four experimental dietary groups with different
  carbohydrate composition and administration schedules: the sucrose group was
  fed 44% (wt/wt) sucrose (GI = 65), the bolus group was fed sucrose as
  carbohydrate and 43 boluses of sucrose (10-15 g/kg) at various time
  intervals, the pasta group was fed pasta [77% (wt/wt) cooked pasta, GI = 55],
  and the glucose group was fed 44% (wt/wt) glucose (GI = 97). All nutrients,
  including carbohydrates, were provided in similar amount to the different
  groups. The experiment was terminated between Day 230 and Day 245 after AOM
  administration. At this time the pasta group had significantly higher cecal
  short-chain fatty acids than the other groups. Intestinal adenomas and
  cancers occurred with the same frequency in the bolus, sucrose, and glucose
  groups. On the contrary, we observed a significant decrease (p = 0.03) in the
  cumulative incidence of intestinal adenomas, but not adenocarcinomas, in the
  pasta group compared with the sucrose group (intestinal adenoma incidence in
  the pasta group was 31% compared with 63% in the sucrose group, 46% in the
  bolus group, and 37% in the glucose group). In conclusion, these results do
  not support the hypothesis that sucrose boluses or carbohydrates with a high
  GI stimulate colon carcinogenesis, but they indicate that foods such as pasta
  may exert a protective effect.

  Note:

    Whole wheat pasta was not used in the above experiment. Whole wheat
pasta might be expected to more effective in inhibiting tumor growth due
to its phytic acid content.

several days ago someone (who?) made the astute observation
that one who uses computers might in some sense be considered
the first step in the evolution of a transhuman, since ze would
exend zis natural abilities by technological means.

this insightful comment can perhaps be supported by my work
environment.  where i work (lockheed) there are a large number
of engineers with a broad spectrum of experience levels.  every
one has at least one computer on zis desk by mandate.  some
use their machines almost never, others, such as me, use them
so constantly, we have given up using pens on paper.  information
in that form i have found practially useless because it cannot be
searched and found effectively when needed.  computers make
great filing cabinets.  {8-]

the ratio of effectiveness of an engineer who uses the computer
to nonusers is increasing all the time as computers improve, and
more importantly, as software improves.  specifically, i refer to
the scientific use of spreadsheets.  engineers disdained these for
a long time (secretaries and beancounters used them you see).
well, we no longer have secretaries, and engineers have realized
how brutally effective one can be when one gets hot with a spreadsheet
such as excel.  i am no fan of microsoft, however microsoft
excel is the one tool that has made the biggest difference in
the way engineering is done in my office.  spike

I just received an interesting piece of junk mail with
a suggestion of new web service - see below.

A few years ago, I started hoping that deterioration of
the Internet services, mostly through growth of annoying,
pushy, stupid, irrelevant stuff - would create a demand
for semantic services and thus give rise to deserving
ideas and create a rich semantic field for growth of
distributed AI.  I was right in the first part it seems;
Usenet is practically unusable now, junk email is rampant,
search engines are getting spammed with thousands of
automatically generated pages with fake keywords...

Now the following invention may help websites present data
to the search engines that is entirely unrelated to the
content the user is going to see there...

This is an interesting development at the time when
the search engines are de-emphasizing their search
functions altogether and try to turn themselves into
advertisement-supported "portals".

Now, where are the intelligent web services?

Anyway, here's that email:

Consider usage of a shovel.  Or a stick.
Many animals use tools as well.

When you start modifying your functionality in more dramatic
way, that affects your self-perception and your social roles,
then things start to change...

Have you seen my article on evolution of relation of humans
and technology in Extropy Online?
