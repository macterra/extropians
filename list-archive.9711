  As Popper argues, all physics is cosmology.  As is all religion.


  The 'Big Bang' stuff is unscientific, untestable, and arguably 
  physically impossible.  A 'poisoned well.'

  It owes its fell origin to the disastrous philosphical memes which 
  invaded the scientific community at the turn of the century.

  Logical positivism said: "You cannot disuss a universe you cannot 
  observe.  Thus, the univere is _defined_ as that which you can see -- 
  i.e. a titchy one, around 5 000 light-years across."

  The question then arose:

  "Why does this titchy (logical-positivist) universe not self-gravitate 
  and collapse"?

  Some 'possibles':

  * It's still expanding (and that entails a point origin or 'bang');

  * or it's at a transient turning-point between expanding and 
  contraction;

  * it's contracting now;

  * it's spinning (but -- say those logical positivists -- it can't spin 
  absolutely).  It would also have a different cross-section or shape.

  * Something else weird is going on.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

  Now retrace these steps, armoured with <inter alia> Eric J. Lerner's 
  brilliant work "The Big Bang Never Happened" (Simon & Schuster, [1988] 
  -- a glorious book, very good on the embedded moralities and 
  epistemologies of physical theories, most of which are _appalling_.  
  Don't import your enemies' anti-extropic concepts all unwitting.

  Instead, our evolving Open Universe is infinite in all directions 
  (Smass, Length and Time), with emergent -- novel -- qualities

  Einstein's old GR idea of a closed but unbounded Riemannian space where 
  nothing ever changes (determinist) is defunct (See Popper, 'Unended 
  Quest'), and utterly dependent on bad methodology and bad physics.  
  Einstein himself said it GR was in error many times.  He asked for 'a 
  more objective way.'

  Nicholas of Cusa, a Catholic Cardinal, proposed in [1440] an infinite 
  Euclidean Universe with an infinity of other planets circling other 
  suns, many of them populated by beings like (as well as different from) 
  ourselves.  This predated Copernicus!  He had no trouble from the 
  Vatican 'thought-police' becaude he wasn't proposing _heliocentrism_ 
  ('Mithraism').  Anything less was uncharacteristic of an infinite God.


  The background radiation is the product of particle interactions, and 
  also accounts for the apparent (but not real) 'Hubble RedShift.'

  A ballistic (particle) theory of light describes, predicts and explains 
  the interactions nicely. See: 'Relational Mechanics' (120k paper) on:

                  http://www.demon.co.uk
 
  and numerous articles in 'Apeiron' (clicker) and Galilean Electrodynamics.

 And there's NO 'entropic heat-deat' in Relational Mechanics' -- the 
 ballistic photons (the building-blocks of matter) are reshaped by 
 gravitational accretion into new stars.  It's an _eternal_ system.  Very 
 extropic!  >:-}

 NASA use Relational Mechanics -- it's real easy to use!  So can you!

This might be the article that got me interested in Extropy! It's in
c't magazin fuer computer und technik, 11/97, page 124
It was a very positive article, and it was in probably the most well
respected computer-magazine in Germany (very independent, great
journalism with good investigation).

They're in the web
http://www.heise.de

I'll see if I can find that article there...

What's a xerox copy? If you send me your adress, I can send you a copy
(maybe xerox copy means color copy? I can't do that...)

I'm not sure if I got this - I've changed from digest mode to the normal
mailing-list yesterday. I didn't unsubscribe from the digest but haven't
received the last one. I guess I'll try retrieving it from the
mailserver (I might have missed some of the replies to my postings, too)

Unfortunately, I didn't even know Extropy existed at that time. I first
read about it in the excellent article in that German computer-magazine
(c't).

That sure would be a good thing. I'm currently discussing some of the
extropian ideas with a few friends of mine, and forwarding them some of
the postings to the mailing-list. So far, the reactions have been
sceptical - but the more they know, the more they understand it makes a
lot of sense (I, for an instance, thought cryonics were more of a
religious idea until I read the part in the Extropy-FAQ which made quite
clear what it's about - it's not a sci-fi-dream, it's just "the second
worst thing that can happen to you - the worst is being eaten up by
worms" ;-) )

Holger

Thanks !!

I think this shows, why we need a guide or if you like a central
point of information. I didn't know this stuff. And to be honest,
I don't know a lot of the other stuff I wrote down, too.
But I want to learn it, and I think I'm not the only one.

I'm trying to contribute in building a main source for Transhumanism,
nothing more and nothing less.

Maybe I'm to "light" for this job.
( please let me know !!!!!! .......... )

But at the other hand, if I understand it as newbie, I guess it can
guide a lot of new people trough the learning process.........

This is exactly why I want to work with numbers in front of the text.
It will make it easier for people to add their opinion or additional
information.

My wish is to have an easy, optimistic and entertaining story that takes
one
by the hand and shows him all the differn't idea's, aspects, science
regarding this life/universe/history/future/etc.......
.....and the role of Extropy and >H in all this.

If your new to a lot of these "things", it's hard to find a good point
to start. One that brings some structure into this scientific chaos of
options and theory's :-)

I firmly believe that if "we" want to spread this Transhuman way
of thinking, we should try to educate as much people as possible.
This can't be done by sending every one that takes a look at the list
a mail with "read this book first.....", "..as XXX explained in his XXX
work"
Etc.......... 
It's all very true, but not appealling to one who is trying to get a hold
on the main issue of whats going on here.

The power of the bible is that it gives a complete story ! Ok, I disagree
on  almost everything. But that's not the point. You want something
that sets you on the road. After, you've read the introduction, you
follow the suggestions one gives you.

But since "we" are dogma-free, it won't be a fixed bible. Instead it will
be a dynamic text, that changes every "year ?" I think the internet is
the best way to distribute it on. Because you can click directly away
from the topic you read onto the page with the other opinion.

I hope I explained better, what I'm looking for,
I also hope there are a lot of you out there with "scientific-knowledge"
who will take time and effort to translate the hard stuff into
a reasonably easy to understand introduction.
I mean, isn't it possible that we find some general story in all this
that we all can relate to in some way?
We are all on this list ! that's something.............now the only thing
"we" have to do is write it down in a story that can be read by
joe-sixpack :-)

Again, if some of you feel, I'm not the right one for the job, let me
know. I accept it without a problem. I know very well I'm not even 
halfway there...............

:-)   Have a nice weekend all !

And, completing the epistemological loop mentioned above, perhaps a

For a tongue-in-cheek, sci-fi account of how Extropians and transhumanists
(aka, "wet Extropians") regard Borganism, see my homepage at

BTW, I really *have* been working on uploading my infamous article on

I was a bit slow in responding, so I'm happy to see that there are
people who have come up with the same idea independently (shows that
it is likely viable). I would be very happy if such a list could be
set up.

exi-euro would fit in with the other local mailing lists.

A small note: it might be a good idea to include some of the
distinctions between transhumanism in general and extropianism in the
list charter; many europeans have somewhat different views on politics
than americans, and may believe you have to be a libertarian
market-worshipper to join the list. It is a good idea to dispell that
misconception from the start, so that people do not think it is just
for extropians.

It is cheering to see that so many have gotten interested in setting
up an european transhumanism network.

In my perception, the Big Bang theory is not at all unscientific. On 
the contrary, it is mainstream physical cosmology. It is true that 
some people (not only religious people) have disputed the evidence 
for the big bang theory, but the same can be said about practically

I have never heard or read any logical positivist claiming this. And 
I can't guess where the figure 5000 lyrs comes from: if we can be 
said to see stars that are 5000 lyrs away, we can surely be said so 
see galaxies that are many millions of lyrs away also.

The problem is not only that our views change, but also that we 
disagree with each other about a lot of things. I'm not sure that 
transhumanism needs a "bible", though it would surely be useful to 
have anthologies of texts we regard as important, and to have good 
introductions, overviews, history-primers, bibliographies, 
dictionaries, and web resource pages, both for people new 
to the field and for those who have been around for a while.

I have read Prometheus rising several times as well as many of RAW's other
tomes. In my experience, perceptual re-training is, indeed, possible as
well as incredibly fun. To paraphrase RAW there is nothing wrong with the
Universe, humans merely misuse their brain..instead of using your brain for
failure and misery, use it for fun and profit. My re-programming began with
a right temporal lobectomy. In the two months after surgery I was concerned
only with the basics of survival (Circuit One for those familiar with the
Leary-Wilson 8 Circuit model) during which I found it possible to
re-imprint fundamental programs about how I perceive the world, myself and
how to move from one perceptual framwork to another - that the current
framework I am using is but one of billions and if I find it not to my
pleasure, it is possible to change to a perspective that is more to my
liking.  As I gained more functions I found myself blissfully hanging out
in the 5th circuit. From the Hedonic Engineering capability of the 5th
circuit I discovered it easy to jump to the 6th and 7th so as to literally
change my world. In other words, as many before me have doneI used somatic
bliss as a conduit to expanded consciousness. The benefits are many. For me
I find joy and expansiveness comes from the ability to program the
programmer.

The experience seems akin to that described by those who sought to expand
their consciousness through the use of psychedelics.

I'm sorry I don't remember the details, but the problem with long-term
parenteral
feeding is not nutritional deficiencies.  The problem is that dumping the
foods
directly into the bloodstream disturbs one of the fundamental balances - 
acid/base, osmotic, electrolyte; I forget which.  Long-term, either you have
to
starve the patient (not enough calories) or you will kill them by deranging 
their body chemistry.  It's not the food content, it's the intake mechanism.

People can and are maintained indefinitely on elemental diets, in which all
food
is synthetic.  We don't know enough to maintain optimal health indefinitely,
but
we can manage adequate health with just the nutrients we know about.

Just because I've been using this as a tagline for so long, I feel
obliged to point out that AFAIK this maxim originated with Pamela
C. Dean <http://www.ddb.com/pddb/> in her novel THE WHIM OF THE
DRAGON, though it might have been one of the earlier volumes in
that trilogy.  I wouldn't want to steal credit by accident; I only
like to do that sort of thing when I'm deliberate about it.  ;)

Just can't get away from that yin-yang, eh?  You're quite right,
of course.  My friend Dale Carrico was also quick to point this
out to me.  My experience has been (and I hope I don't offend anyone
by saying this) that scientist-types tend to be more suspicious of
expectation and its potential to foil perception (e.g., interpretation
of the implications of an empirical experiment), whereas humanist-types
tend to be more permissive of developing new expectations and
allowing them to guide one's perceptions (e.g., a reinterpretation
of an important work of literature).

One of the things I like about the phrase "expectation foils
perception" is that having this expectation about things for a
while eventually enables one to see that expectation also enables
perception.  And after rounding this particular epistemological
loop enough times, some find it easier to deploy their filters
deliberately, rather than themselves being deployed by their
built-in filter-reflexes.

BCC = Body Centered Cubic
FCC = Face Centered Cubic
HCP = Hexagonal Close Packing

These are three ways of placing atoms in a lattice. See
http://abe.msstate.edu/classes/abe3813/prop3.htm for some (bad)
pictures, and http://matse1.mse.uiuc.edu/~tw/metals/prin.html for some
slightly better pictures.

Amorphous materials do not have a regular lattice structure; the atoms
are arranged more or less randomly.

It is likely not the solid inner core that creates the magnetic field,
rather the liquid outer core. There are dynamo processes where the
flow of conducting core material, the earth's rotation and the
magnetic process interact which could be chaotic, creating flips from
time to time. I guess a crystaline core might interact with this
process, likely as a damping term in the equation. The visible effects
do not appear to be very large, although the cosmic radiation level
would likely rise during the reversal.

Just to get this into a more transhumanistic vein: any ideas for how
to influence these processes to avoid/cause a pole reversal?

> And just to throw a nother bean into the stew...how does Gold's Primeval Oil

As far as I know, not at all. It is all about what happens up at the
crust, not down in the core.

We had a small party at work. I didn't have time for a full costume,
so I wore a scary mask. We've recently been trying to certify a
10-tear-old design (G.703 CEPT) for  new service (ISDN PRI) the
new certifications are more stringent, and we found that the
waveform doesn't quite fit within the parameters, which are
defined by a drawing in the specification document called a "pulse
mask.", So, I made an enlarged copy of the pulse mask put eyeholes
in it, and wore it. Scariest mask at the party, in context of course.

I'd say the "free software movement" generally goes well with Extropian
Ideas. Since you have access to all the source code, you can LEARN
(improving yourself), and MODIFY (improving techology). Besides, still
being a Linux newbie I can say that it also encourages some sort of
self-responsibility (I'm sure there's a better expression): since there
hardly are any centralized documents (took me a while before I found
LDP), you need to learn finding the information you need in HowTos,
FAQs, man-pages etc.

Besides, no stupid terrocrats can earn money with free software :-)

Holger

Is that a proven fact? I mean: will it NEVER be possible, even with
superintelligence?

Maybe short-term predictions will be sufficient as we gain more control
over nature. What about simulating ecologic, economic, social etc.
systems? Today, we may not have enough computing power (and probably not
the right theories and algorithms, either), but wouldn't this be a very
valuable field for research?
I came across this when I learned about different theories and models
(please correct me if those terms don't make any sense to you) for mass
communication. There were simple models that were easy to understand but
that could only be applied to simple problems, and there were
complicated models which were hard to understand but which could explain
a lot more. I believe one could think of models that don't make sense to
humans because they can't deal with them in their brains - but computers
can.

My idea was to give the computer a program that can deal with as much
data as available, start a simulation and see how similar the results in
the simulation are to those in reality. That'll give you a basis to
improve.

Since we're probably soon (or already) gonna deal with technology that
*might* mess up great parts of our environment, simulations for certain
steps (including worst-case scenarios) could trouble (trouble sounds
like quite a bizarre word in that context). One thing I have in mind are
genetically manipulated insects, or even worse - bacteria, which
accidentally (or intentionally) come into the environment. This could
cause (currently) uncontrollable chain-reactions.

Trusting people is an interesting subject of its own - I should have
stressed the "to have at least a vague idea of what they're doing". In
fact, a simple worker might know a lot better what he's doing than a
scientist working on some complicated matter.
The problem is when people who don't understand innovations (and the
possible risks), try to gain whatever advantage from them.

I've been thinking about the "education" problem today. I believe that
education is the ONLY thing I'd be willing to pay taxes for. Good
education should be freely available to all human beings. I don't care
if a "government" or another company takes care of that, but it has to
be done much better than today!

Since certain drugs might help us improve ourselves (or others, curing
mental illnesses for example), I believe this is a good place to tell
you about them (I just told them about Extropy and received some
positive feedback), I've been on that list for about a month and would
say it's quite "scientific" (but "amateur" posts are also welcome)...


ANNOUNCING MAPS-FORUM

The MAPS forum is the electronic discussion group of the
Multidisciplinary
Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS). MAPS is a 501 (c) (3)
corporation chartered in 1986 as a membership-based research and
educational organization. Currently numbering 1400 members, MAPS focuses
on the development of beneficial, socially-sanctioned uses of
psychedelic
drugs and marijuana. MAPS pursues its mission by helping scientific
researchers design, obtain governmental approval for, fund, conduct and
report on psychedelic research in human volunteers. 

The MAPS forum supports this mission by allowing members to interact
with
each other and with international experts in the psychedelic field.
Topics
may include current news, book reviews, factual questions about
psychedelics or marijuana, psychedelics and marijuana in the media,
ideas
for research and fundraising, and articles in the MAPS quarterly
bulletin/newsletter. Students who have written class papers on
psychedelic
topics are encouraged to share their work here. M.D. and Ph.D. 
researchers funded by MAPS are also asked to participate. The forum also
serves as a rapid response network when there are opportunities to
influence drug policy decisions that are critical to MAPS' mission. 
Questions about anything MAPS is doing, or suggestions for anything MAPS
should be doing, are encouraged. 

To maintain the high standards that members expect from MAPS, this is a
moderated list. Subscribers to maps-forum are assured of a high
signal/noise ratio. A maximum of five messages are selected for posting
to
the list each day by the moderator. Although questions are welcome at
all
levels of interest, the moderator prefers posted comments to be
presented
at a level appropriate for a classroom or a professional meeting. 

To subscribe to maps-forum, send email to majordomo@maps.org with
"subscribe maps-forum Albert Hofmann <youraddress>" (if your name is
Albert Hofmann) without the quotes, in the first line. Make sure
youraddress is enclosed within the <brackets> as shown. Leave the
subject
line and all other lines blank. To unsubscribe, send email to
majordomo@maps.org with "unsubscribe maps-forum youraddress", without
the
quotes, in the first line. Leave the subject line and all other lines
blank.

Subscriptions to maps-forum are free to MAPS members, and free to
non-members for a 90-day trial period. Memberships, which include a
subscription to the quarterly MAPS Bulletin, are available for
$35 (non-US: $50) for General Members, and $20 (non-US: $35) for
student/low income.

Albert Einstein wrote that "Imagination is more important than
knowledge." 
If you can even faintly imagine a cultural reintegration of the use of
psychedelics and the states of mind they engender, please consider
joining
MAPS in supporting the expansion of scientific knowledge in this area. 
Progress is possible with the support of individuals who care enough to
take individual and collective action. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GUIDELINES FOR AUTHORS
(1) Questions are welcome at all levels of interest but posted comments
should be presented at a level appropriate for a classroom or a
professional meeting. Primarily, this means to assume a skeptical
audience. Make an effort to support your assertions with argumentation
and
evidence. Clearly state the central point you are trying to make early
in
your message. Provide definitions and/or examples when using unusual
terminology or advanced concepts. Make references to the literature
and/or
URL's whenever possible. 

(2) By the same token, please provide an introduction, summary, or
discussion of all references or URL's posted to the list. Don't just
post
web addresses and say, "check this out." 

(3) A maximum of five messages will be selected for posting to the list
each day. Short posts are prefered over longer posts. Consider breaking
up
longer works into a series of installments over a week or several weeks.
If you have already received five messages from the forum in the past 24
hours, please wait until the next day to post. 

(4) Persons who have not submitted recently will be given priority over 
those who post to the list often. In general, it is prefered that 
individual subscribers post no more often than once per week and only
once 
or twice per thread (although there are numerous exceptions). Consider 
whether your response to a post is better sent to the author rather than 
to the entire list.

(5) For purposes of legal safety, first person narratives confessing
one's
own illegal drug use are always sent back to the author with a reminder
of
this guideline.

(6) Relevant cross-posts from other sources are welcome (especially when
an introduction explaining the relevance is included), but original
content is prefered. 

(7) General drug policy discussions (prohibition vs. legalization) are
not encouraged unless they specifically relate to research. Examples of
acceptable drug policy topics include: the influence of drug policy on
research, or the policy implications of research.

(8) When responding to a post on the list, *briefly* quote only the
relevant part of what you are specifically responding to, and write your
message under the quote.

I don't have the time to answer at length, but I think one can make a
very good case for the existence of actions whose outcome even Jupiter
brains cannot predict accurately. There are a lot of processes that
are simply chaotic and will microscopic perturbations (or lack of
information) will cause divergence from our prediction of them (the
canonical example is the weather). Then there are the processes that
are strictly undecidable, such as the halting problem in computer
science: it is impossible to create a general algorithm to determine
whether a given computer program halts or not. Since these two classes
of problems could well be hidden inside the consequence prediction
problem, it is most likely in general impossible to predict the long
term consequences of our actions even for SI.

It certainly would. I think we can at least avoid some of the most
obvious in retrospect disasters this way. With evolutionary modelling
we might even notice some of the more nonlinear dangers.

A good start, but simulations can fool you. It is always possible to
make a simulation conform to reality, but it may become brittle and
overtrained: when confronted with *real* data instead of the data it
has been tested on it simply doesn't work. This is why we neural
network people always try to validate our models a lot by giving them
previously unknown data.

The Big Bang predicted that as our telescopes got bigger we would find that  
billions of years ago the galaxies were closer together than they are now. 
We have. 

The observable universe has a radius of 10 to 20 billion light years,  
the big bang theory predicts that we will never find an object in it older  
than 10 to 20 billion years. So far at least nobody has, although some things  
are getting close

In 1949 George Gamow used the Big Bang theory to predict that the universe  
would be full of microwave black body radiation at a temperature of about  
5 degrees Kelvin. It was a wild idea and the Big Bang was not very popular so  
few paid much attention to Gamow, then 20 years later the largest feature in  
the universe was actually found experimentally, it had the spectrum of a 
black body and a temperature of 2.7 degrees Kelvin. To a first approximation  
the universe IS the blackbody radiation, the other stuff is just debris, so I  
don't think a theory that predicts such a huge feature is doing too badly.  
              

        >and arguably physically impossible.
              

Well, let's hear your argument.

The Big Bang was unknown at the turn of the century and only became popular 
in the 60's when the evidence for it overwhelmed competing theories.

I'm certainly not a logical positivist but that characterization is unfair,

The appalling and crazy idea is that morality can be deduced from a physical 
theory or that a physical theory can be deduced from morality.


        >Don't import your enemies' anti-extropic concepts all unwitting.


I can think of no idea more anti-extropic than that we can determine a law of 
physics or the nature of the cosmos by wishing. The Big Bang either happened 
or it did not and human political theories do not matter a hoot in hell.


        >Instead, our evolving Open Universe is infinite in all directions

It's a catchy phrase and I loved Dyson's book but infinity in all directions 
is not needed.  An infinite, never ending sequence of novel qualities is not  
dependent on infinite linear space, or an infinite number of particles, 
or even an infinite amount of proper time, but only on a infinite amount of 
phase space.  If the universe collapses and gets hotter without limit then 
the information in it can also increase without limit, not by storing 
information in the  position of particles, that will keep getting less 
important, but by storing  information in the momentum of particles.

What is defunct about closed but unbounded Riemannian space?  
              
        >Einstein himself said it GR was in error many times.    


Not quite. Einstein never lost confidence in his theory and even today no 
reputable physicist has, unless you're talking about the singularity at the 
center on a black hole, or when things gets smaller than the Plank length of 
10^ -33 centimeters or events get shorter than 10^-45 seconds.

Einstein discovered General Relativity in 1917 and the equations said that  
the universe must be expanding or contracting, at the time he thought this   
disagreed with observation so he was forced to stick on a new term, a  
"cosmological constant" to make the universe static. He always said he hatted 
it because it was ugly and detracted from the beauty of his theory, but he 
could see no alternative. 

In 1929 Hubble found that the universe was not static after all but was  
expanding, everybody was surprised and a few were delighted. Einstein  
certainly wasted no time, in the very same year he cheerfully abandoned the  
cosmological constant and called it "the worst blunder of my career".    


        >Nicholas of Cusa, a Catholic Cardinal, proposed in [1440] an

And he was wrong. The universe may or may not be infinite but it is certainly 
not Euclidean, if it were gravity could not exist. 


        >This predated Copernicus!     
              

And takes nothing away from Copernicus. A scientific theory is more than   
vague armchair philosophy, it must make testable predictions and produce  
numbers, Copernicus's theory could do that, especially after the improvements  
made by Kepler.
              

        >The background radiation is the product of particle interactions   


What particles? What interactions? What shape does your theory predict the  
spectrum of to have, that of a radiating blackbody as observed? What    
temperature does your theory predict this blackbody radiation to have?


          >and also accounts for the apparent (but not real) 'Hubble RedShift.'
              

You could argue about cause but there is absolutely no doubt that the 
redshift is real and almost no doubt that its magnitude is proportional to 
the distance an object is from Earth. If it is caused by the Doppler shift 
then it must be due to the general expansion of the entire universe, if not  
then the Earth would have to be in a privileged position, the center of the 
universe. I doubt it. 

Yes, the redshift could be caused by some mysterious force unknown to science, 
but we shouldn't invoke new physics if we don't need to and we don't need to. 
Besides, nobody has been able to flesh out this mysterious force into a 
testable scientific theory so The Big Bang has no real  competition.

I've got a sneaky suspicion that "expectation enables perception" is
exactly what the above snippet is trying to suggest. Orr's Law: what the
Thinker thinks, the Prover proves. Interesting, especially in light of the
"proofs" for much of the pseudo-science rampant on the net. One of the
exercises at the end of Chapter One of Prometheus Rising is to visualize
finding a quarter on the road. Then go walking, still visualizing, and see
how long it takes you to find one. Now when you do, is it the power of your
mind that made the quarter show up, or was it there all along? The point of
the exercise is not the answer you give, but the act of defending both
positions.

I would hazard that most on this list would find it easy to defend the
position that the quarter was always there and you just happened to be
looking at the right time. What is not so easy for the critical rationalist
is a defense of the "mind power" position. Yet, there are people who defend
such positions everyday, positions which to many of us would seem
completely untenable based upon logic and Occam's razor.

I'm extremely interested in what the universe looks like to such people --
and for that matter, to any other person who differs from me in a
significant way. For one, I'll throw in with Nicholas Bostrom's view of a
need for polymaths in the mainstream public sphere
(http://www.hedweb.com/nickb/predict.htm) and add to it the suggestion that
not only must the relevant philosopher of today be broadly educated across
disciplines, but also must be able to think creatively across perceptual
frameworks. A scientist's view of a particular trend is often quite
different than the politician (third circuit thinking versus second circuit
thinking). There is no way (yet) to determine with absolute certainty whose
perceptions are closer to objective reality and accordingly more accurate,
so a polymath with the ability to perceive what *BOTH* people perceive is
that much closer to an accurate statement about the trend.

Again, I don't know if this is possible, and I want to try a few of the
exercises in PR to see where they take me. If anyone is interested in doing
the same, I'd be psyched to discuss privately.

Right. I like the way you put that. I envision an arsenal of perceptual
filters deployable and retractable in any combination. Sort of like holding
control variables constant while you reassess the data. With so many
configurable filters, a data set represents orders of magnitude more
information than it originally would have with a single viewpoint evolved
through a long process of experiential imprints. "No, can't make it to the
meeting, I was planning on watching Schindler's List from the viewpoint of
a Nazi Stormtrooper this afternoon ..."

I agree, and this is one of my more specific points. The brain is powerful
hardware, but limited by its software -- its operating system, to stretch the
metaphor. Of course, the primary difficulty is transcending the operating
system to modify it, or even replace it entirely. I must admit that I'm a bit
skeptical about circuits six through eight, but of course this is a result of
the operating system I'm currently using (Microsoft's Rational-Critical Law
Student <grin>).

Can you give some specifics? I don't see any radical surgery in my future, but
I'm sure you've acquired some knowledge I would find helpful.

'Star Wars' Artifacts at Mythic Museum Show

 3:02pm31.Oct.97.PST -- WASHINGTON - Twenty years ago, in multiplexes 
not too far away, Star Wars made a name and a fortune for George Lucas. 
Today, artifacts from the films are in a national museum, where 
organizers bracing for a blockbuster. 

"Star Wars: The Magic of Myth," a 5,000-square-foot exhibit featuring 
costumes, characters, models and artwork from the film trilogy, opened 
today at the National Air and Space Museum for a one-year run. 

 The crush is expected to be ferocious for the run of the show, and 
museum officials stressed that tickets are required, even though 
admission is free. The draw is so powerful that more than 300 volunteers 
already have signed up for crowd control at the hangar-sized museum on 
Washington's Mall. 

A similar exhibit, "The Art of Star Wars," was held two-and-a-half years 
ago at San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center for the Arts. 

Lucas, who envisioned the trilogy and plans six more films as part of 
the saga, said he hopes the exhibit will "inspire young people who are 
interested in art, science, and computer technology to use their skills 
and imagination to create new worlds and pursue their dreams." 

The more fanciful characters from the first movie - the giant, hairy 
Chewbacca, the rolling computer R2-D2, the effete chrome-bodied droid 
C-3PO, the loathsome Jabba the Hutt, and the heavy-breathing Darth Vadar 
- are part of the new exhibit, as are some of the vehicles and models, 
which are set near a display of real space technology from the US-Soviet 
space race. 

Lucas is comfortable with this juxtaposition. "A lot of the great 
scientists and adventurers and pioneers were inspired by works of 
fiction," he said at a breakfast with reporters this week. "The line 
between make-believe space fantasy and real space fantasy is very 
thin.... This [actual space exploration] is the more exciting side ... 
even though kids don't realize it." 

Lucas said he has finished shooting the first of three films that are 
set 20 years prior to the first three movies. This film will be released 
in 1999 after 18 months of post-production work and animation. He also 
plans a final trio of movies, set long after the first Star Wars films. 

 Lucas avidly follows space exploration efforts, and believes that 
extraterrestrial life will be found in this galaxy, probably on another 
planet's moon. 

"Obviously, it's going to be a microbe but it's a significant step," he 
said. "I don't think our aloneness is as significant as people once 
thought."

Hard. We have been working on that for a few centuries now, and while
there have been considerable progress it is rather clear we do not
have the whole picture yet.

On the other hand, I think your basic idea is sound. I have tried to
write something like that several times, but usually I diverge into
discussions of evolution and physics. A common transhuman meme is the
idea that we continue a long process of change and evolution, now
adding the new factor intelligence to the equation.

This sounds almost like en Encyclopedia.

I think these should be re-ordered a bit; "nothing became something"
is rather vague, I would suggest a more empirical description of a hot
dense state and ignore the question of what was before or put it as a
footnote-web. I'm not sure what came first, time and space or cooling,
since we need entropy to create an arrow of time. Overall, I think
this section can be largely lifted from standard popularizations of
cosmology.

Study Suggests Brain May Affect Religious Response
>From a Times Staff Writer

New Oreleans- No one knows why humanity felt its first religious
stirrings,
but researchers at UC San Diego reported Tuesday that the human brain
may be
hard-wired to hear the voice of heaven, in what researchers said was the
first effort to directly address the neural basis of religious
expression.

In a provocative experiment with patients suffering from an unusual form
of
epilepsy, researcher determined that parts of the brain's temporal
lobe-which
the scientists quickly dubbed the "God module"- may affect how intensely
a
person responds to religious beliefs.

They emphasized that their findings do not suggest religion is simply a
matter of brain chemistry. "These studies do not in any way negate the
validity of reilgious experience or God," the team cautioned.

I see two approaches to all of this. The first is to use the usual
methodology of study involving double blinds and the like, all of which
have resulted in no measurable effects. The second is to regard these as
experiences within the brain, with the unfortunate phenomenon of these
experiences being "absolute" or "more real" than normal experience.
Those untrained in scientific methodology and unaware of the ease with
which unconscious emotional needs and alter the meaning of experiences
fall into the trap of thinking that this "absolute" aspect is physically
true.

I also caution you to note that your list has quite a few items there.
OBEs are probably brain states. Spontaneous healing is more complex;
does my recovery from the flu qualify?? And witchcraft is a combination
of herbal healing, which can be seen as applied pharmacology using
plants, trance and hypnosis, which is also sometimes valid, and
religion, another area entirely.....

      OK: let's look at this.

      BTW:  My Relational Mechanics paper (almost no equations!) is at:

                      http://www.agora.demon.co.uk

      As a preliminary remark: wonder a bit about optical illusions before 
      unthinkingly giving primacy to 'observations.'  Newton constantly 
      used his theory to correct Astronomer-Royal Flamsteed's 'observations'
      using his (Newton's) theory. (Drove Flamsteed crazy, actually!).

      All 'observations' are theory-impregnated. A straw partially immersed
      in water 'is observed to be' bent.  Is it _really_ bent or 
      _objectively_ straight?


      The velocity of light is (approximately) constant at 'c', but only 
      _relative to the emitting charge_.  In a Galilean framework (i.e. 
      'position-space', which is _logically inescapable_ once you abandon 
      locality -- see Bell, Aspect etc.), velocity addition is clearly 
      demonstrable as well as being logically necessary.

      However, there is a constant process of absorption and re-emission 
      as photons travel from A to B (there is no perfect vacuum in space 
      -- some of the most perfect vacuums around are probably right here 
      on Earth). Accordingly, all the photons arriving here from stellar 
      sources are ineluctably travelling at around 'c' relative to the 
      interstellar 'particle soup' which is what's actually emitting them.

      NB: It is _extremely_ difficult to measure the velocity of a photon 
      without interposing interactions which entail absorption and 
      re-emission, thus destroying the original velocity.

      Let's see _your_ proposals for measuring photon velocity...  >:-}

     In space, the free electrons are particularly voracious absorbers and 
     emitters of photons.  The photons perform _work_ on the electrons as 
     they're absorbed and re-emitted.  They move the electrons around. 
     This (along with photon-photon interaction -- see Jean-Paul Vigier 
     et. al.) is the cause of the cosmic (Hubble) redshift, which is of 
     course directly proportional to the distance stellar photons have to 
     travel to get here.

>        >untestable,

      It's untestable because it's unrepeatable (or so you should hope!).

      No way, Jose!  As Leibniz pointed out, the same facts can be 
      explained by an indefinitely large number of different theories.  
      Since all 'observations' are theory-impregnated also, the absurdity 
      of the assertion you cite should be plain enough.  >:-}

       Oh, c'mon!!!  The cosmologists are 'explaining away' astronomical 
       artefacts older than the estimated age of the Universe all the 
       time!!!  As is always the case with degenerating scientific 
       programmes, they scrap the evidence rather than their pet 'BB' 
       theories.  "Normal-Science" physicists crave emotional security...


> To a first approximation the universe IS the blackbody radiation, the 
> other stuff is just debris

      NoNoNo; the Universe _includes_ the debris.  And it's the 
      interstellar debris which is scattering the stellar radiation, 
      giving rise to the uniform background.  It accounts for it very 
      well, actually.

      That's because you're looking for _confirmations_ rather than 
      _refutations_, as I am.  Remember the mediaeval scholasticism "All 
      swans are white"?  Millions of white swans 'confirmed' it, but the 
      black swans were there all the time, over in Australia...

      One word.  'Singularity.'  That is, 'impossible within known physics.'
     
                       "Ex nihilo, nihil fit"

      You've been reading too many childrens' histories of physics!  Go 
      read 'Subtle Is The Lord' by Abraham Pais (who is far from agreeing 
      with me on his hero Einstein, BTW).  It's fairly definitive 
      scientific biography.  Once people 'bought into' the positivist idea 
      of 'the observable universe' being identical to 'the universe', they 
      _had_ to explain why the titchy island universe hadn't 
      self-gravitated long since.
      
      How else would _you_ possibly explain this problem-situation?

      The positivists don't _allow_ you to plead _absolute rotation_, 
      remember -- _you can't have rotation relative to * nothing *.


        >Logical positivism said: "You cannot disuss a universe you cannot

        Well, thank Heavens for that, John!  It's a dead philosophy!

        Read Pais...  They _had to be_ that dumb.  Positivists are like 
        that -- their metaphysics gives them no choice in the matter!

       Humans invent and select (i.e. _choose_) our preferred theories and 
       Methodological Scientific Research Programmes.  Ineluctably, 
       metaphysics is prior to physical theories -- it's unavoidable.

       I have -- extropic -- 'touchstone tests':  If General Relativity 
       depicts a four-dimensional Parmenidean Block Universe, within which
       nothing ever changes, and in which free will is a delusion, I 
       _choose_ to say 'to Hell with it.'   
       
       If Ernst Mach tells us that all life is physically determined, with 
       consciousness being a mere _epiphenomenon_, I _choose_ to say "To 
       Hell with him too.'  And his positivism along with him.
       
       If a 'scientific socialist' says that all History is 
       materialistically determined, I say "To hell with all that" (tens 
       of millions of people indeed went to various Communist Hells via 
       just that notion).

       My touchstone tests tell me that theories are volitional human 
       inventions, and their acceptance a matter of _choice_.  If anyone 
       tries to tell me anything different, I just say 'To Hell with them 
       too.'  It's a methodological decision.  We do it all the time.
       
       We _all_ take metaphysical positions, like it or not.


> The Big Bang either happened or it did not and human political theories 
> do not matter a hoot in hell.

       We will never know.  We cannot travel back in time in any way which 
       could permit us to be certain.  Compare and contrast:
       
       "The statement 'God exists' has meaning, and it may even be true.  
       But since there is no conceivable observation which could _refute_ 
       such a statement, it is _unscientific_." -- Bryan Magee, 'Popper.' 

       I had a nice chat with Bryan Magee the other day -- read his recent
       "Confessions of a Philosopher."

      Again: read Pais, "Subtle Is The Lord."  He thought GR was wrong, 
      and spent decades trying to come up with 'a more realistic theory' 
      (like mine!  >:-} Actually, it wouldn't matter a bean to me whether

      So, which General Relativity are you advocating: GR-with-added-CC or 
      vanilla-GR?  Everyone seems to 'understand' a different version of 
      GR, anyway...

      NoNoNo... Hubble observed a redshift of the specra of stars, which 
      is cleanly and easily accounted for by the interactions of stellar 
      photons with interstellar debris, which I have discussed previously.


> "the worst blunder of my career".    

      The worst blunder of Einstein's career was to steal Walter Ritz's 
      ballistic [(particle) theory of light without keeping Ritz's 
      Galilean Relativity framework.  Alas, as did everyone back then, 
      Einstein had to keep 'in' with Lorentz to get anywhere. (Einstein's 
      Special Relativity and Lorentz's electrodynamics are functionally 
      identical -- SR is a mathematical formalism of Lorentz's physical 
      theory).
       
      There's a (little-noticed) Ritz-Einstein paper on their agreements 
      and differences I'd like to get hold of.  Anyone, pretty-please?

      For all practical purposes, Walter Ritz _invented Quantum 
      Electrodynamics_  Ritz [1908].  Richard Feynman _must have known this_ -- 
      he and Wheeler knew Ritz's work intimately well.

      That verges on the absurd ... Relational or Faradayan or Newtonian 
      or Graviton-mediated gravitational force gets along just fine in a 
      Euclidean framework.  What the hell are you talking about?  GR?
      

>        >This predated Copernicus!     
              

> And takes nothing away from Copernicus.

      It sure as hell takes away Copernicus' _priority_, just for starters!


> A scientific theory is more than vague armchair philosophy

      However, scientific theories are human inventions -- their _origin_ 
      is mostly impenetrable, and - mostly - irrelevant.  All that we can 
      fairly ask of any scientific theory -- a _hypothesis_  -- is that we 
      can deduce testable descriptions, explanations and predictions from 
      it.
      
      There's an Adam-Smithian division of labour in these matters.  A 
      theory may come to you in a dream (Kekule's benzene ring, 
      ferinstance).  You post it here in 'Extropians', and it becomes 
      World III Objective Knowledge, existing quite independently of your 
      consciousness, and fully discussable by us.  We then work with it.
      
                    p1  --> t1 --> dp --> ee --> p2
      
      Where p1 is the initial problem;  t1 the tentative theory; dp the 
      deduction of testable propositions; ee is error elimination via 
      refuting experiments, critical discussion, etc.; and p2 is the 
      resulting -- secondary -- problem-situation.  Everything begins and 
      ends with problems and guesses.

      As above.  The redshift is a function of the ratio of interstellar 
      debris (including other photons) to distance of space traversed.
      
      
         >and also accounts for the apparent (but not real) 'Hubble RedShift.'

      I fully agree.  Clumsily put!

      Wrong way round...  _If_ it's a Doppler shift, _then_ the Universe 
      is expanding.  See?  _If_ it's caused by stellar photons losing 
      energy on their way through the 'interstellar soup', the Universe is 
      moving around a bit, sure, but not 'expanding' overall.  An infinite 
      Universe has nowhere to expand _into_.  Right?


      I thank you for an interesting discussion; I hope others here are 
      enjoying it too!

|The Crack the CIA Coalition in L.A. (which drew 4000 people into the
|streets of downtown L.A. last February behind the demands of Full
|disclosure and accountability for government involvement in drug dealing
|and other human rights abuses, dismantle the CIA--end all covert ops and
|secret wars, reparations for the affected communities, community controlled
|drug rehabilitation, stop the phony drug war, sentencing disparities and

|the media whitewash) is calling for demonstrations in response to the
|Inspector General's report on the CIA's involvement in the contra-cocaine

|What will have changed in the period since the Gary Webb stories again
|focused attention on these crimes?  The media whitewash has intensified;
|the government has rejected even sentencing commission recommendations to
|eliminate the sentencing disparities; the phony drug war continues and is
|the pretext for even greater US military aid to the generals involved in
|drug dealing in Colombia, Mexico and elsewhere in order to attack insurgent
|movements in those countries.
|
|The Monday evening after either the CIA inspector general or the Justice
|Dept reports are issued, we will be demonstrating at the downtown L.A.
|federal building, Los Angeles and Temple L.A. from 4 - 6:00 pm, and we urge
|others around the country to do the same.  We are also organizing a
|national conference and demonstration in L.A. to crack the CIA Feb. 14 and

|Nowadays, the NSA's mission is to collect as many electronic

|This is called the ECHELON Dictionary.  Domestic law enforcement

|to ECHELON.  Those other nations are part of the UKUSA Security 
|Alliance, and recently, many EU nations were invited to a FBI meeting 
|in Quantico, VA to discuss their inclusion.   
|
|A watchlist would typically consist of names and telephone numbers of

|
|To read about how the DNC used ECHELON for fundraising, see:

|
|My friend "Information Security" wrote a book called the

Since literally all of my experiences lead me to conclude that actual
identification of an entity (physical quantity) or a relationship is by
objective differentiation, I must necessarily adhere to this criteria unless
or until someone or something reveals it as error. The article in question
evidences no recognition of such criteria.  There is no definitive
differentiation between scientific and non scientific, nor any
differentiation between religious and non religious, nor any differentiation
of "God" as an objectively identifiable entity; indeed, there looms the
everpresent question: How does one mentally abstract an "infinte god" in
absence of limited quantity, a pre-requisite for identification of a thing?
If one knows something is true, one will also feel that it is true. However,
this does not work in reverse as seems to be a popular notion.

For further analysis of the alleged "scientific research", see the
aforementioned post of 10\30\97.

A Scientific American article of about 2 years ago addressed the

I went to a Halloween party as Cryo-Woman, in a blue leotard and 
cape, and with my brain-in-an-ice-cube Cryo-Wand (79 cents at 
7-11), with which I travel the landscape saving unfortunates from

No, not even the belief that libertarianism is a good thing. Libertarianism
is quite strictly defined (even though there are different ways of defining
it). I don't think it would be accurate to call any view that allows *any*
taxation to be libertarian. Any form of taxation seems to violate
libertarian principles. Even minimal statists (like Rand) try to find
non-coercive (by the libertarian standard) methods of financing their
minimal state -- user fees directly for services, lotteries, etc. The
Extropian Principles affirm a valuing of spontaneous order and
self-ownership. While, again, most of us might call ourselves libertarian,
it seems to me perfectly possible for someone to affirm those principles
yet not count as a libertarian.

Here's a possible extropian who is not a libertarian: This person affirms
all the principles. She thinks free markets are, overall, the finest
mechanism for coordinating activity and that government coercion is
generally a bad thing. She opposes government ownership of business and
favors practically no regulation other than the enforcement of private
property rights. (Libertarian prefer not to describe this as "regulation".)
But she believes education vital to extropian goals and does not believe
that it will be adequately provided if left entirely to voluntary action.
She sees state schools as a disaster and so opposes government-run schools,
but favors taxation to fund education vouchers to be used at private
competitive institutions. After carefully examining the evidence, she
regards global warming and ozone depletion as real threats. While in almost
all cases she thinks pollution and resource problems are best handled by
careful definition and enforcement of private property rights, she thinks
that approach will not work in these cases and so favors international,
governmental action.

Such a person, who can strongly favor spontaneous order and self-ownership
but who allows some role for government beyond that of the strict
libertarian view, can be an Extropian. The Extropian Principles suggest
certain attitudes and values that we affirm, not specific political
implementations. 

As for Eric, he went much further than suggesting that a totally "pure"
market economy might not work well. He was heavily statist in a way that
seems to me to go well beyond possible compatibility with extropian
attitudes. He clearly opposed spontaneous order and self-ownership in so
many ways that he definitely was "debating the basic." The basics are
Spontaneous Order and Self-Ownership, not libertarianism.

While the Principles do not specify specific political implementations,
there will certainly be political systems that clearly conflict with the
attitudes and values expressed by the Principles. We cannot draw a sharp
line to separate those polities incompatible with the Principles from those
that are compatible. Obviously there is a fuzzy region, not a sharp
boundary. A Stalinist system, or a system of strong state control of many
aspects of life would clearly conflict with the two SO principles.

Your specific example above is set up so as to be more tricky. (Nick, I can
tell you're a philosopher from the way you set this up!( It's like asking a
peaceable person whether they would kill someone in a lifeboat situation.
You're specified that a worldwide dictatorship is probably the only way to
avoid a catastrophe. *How* likely does this have to be? IF someone really
held this belief, then if survival is the primary value, and if they
thought dictatorship would not forever end their extropian goals, I suppose
they could support that system temporarily while seeking a better solution.
However, I doubt that any of us believe dictatorship is the only way, or
the best way, or even a workable way of avoiding such a danger. Under
anything remotely like normal assumptions, no, an Extropian could not
advocate dictatorship and still reasonably call themselves extropian.

This sounds pretty good. One caveat: I wouldn't put it in the form that
"the Extropian Principles are *right*. That suggests a view of values as
objective. That is obviously a highly controversial matter. (Note to
Delmar: I haven't forgotten to respond to your long post. It's on my list!)
I'd rather say that Extropianism is transhumanism in the specific form of
an affirmation of the Extropian Principles.

I think this is a really important issue for the propagation of
transhumanism. I think you may be right about standard Christians, Muslims,
and Mormons. After all, Muslims believe fundamentally in submission to
Allah. That and typical Christian beliefs in an active God whose plan for
us must be followed clearly does conflict with transhumanism. Your citation
of my passage suggests that.

However, I do not think we should rule out everything called "religion" as
being compatible with transhumanism. "Religion" carries multiple meanings.
If we take it merely to involve a belief in a god who created and designed
the world -- as the deists believed (as distinguished from theists who
believe in an active god who expects worship and who defines morality),
then I don't see this as incompatible with transhumanism. Though I see no
reason to believe it, it *could be* that our universe was designed by a
being in some kind of "higher" reality. Moravec suggests that our universe
could be a simulation in the higher-dimensional computer of a superbeing.
While I don't grant such an idea any credence, I can't rule it out. If a
transhumanist believed such a thing (more strongly than the evidence
suggests) I would think them uncritical. But I wouldn't see such a belief
as incompatible with transhumanism so long as the person didn't look to
this being for guidance or purpose.

"Religion" also (and I think more essentially) involves a *way* of
believing. Religion involves faith -- a belief in things in the absence of
or contrary to the evidence. In that sense, religious thinking clearly
cannot be reconciled with the rationalist approach of transhumanism.

The question is: Can any actual religions be held compatibly with
transhumanism? I retract my previous suggestion: Standard Christianity and
Islam cannot be compatible. (Though, and this is important, one can be
mostly transhumanist and extropian and Christian. David Ross seems to be an
example of this. I find his combination of beliefs thoroughly odd and
mysterious but he seems quite happy believing in the divinity of Jesus
along with uploading, physical immortality, and the importance of reason.)
Hinduism, in some of its variations, might be compatible with
transhumanism. I'd be interested in what others think of this. Are there
other practices counted as religious that might not conflict with
transhumanism?

Consider also that there have been religious humanists, such as Pico Della
Mirandola. He clearly held many tenets and attitudes that we call humanist,
yet he believed and praised a creator. He saw that creator as having given
us a unique nature such that we could choose whether to become more
animal-like or to evolve higher. His views did not support any passive view
of life. If you grant that there can be religious humanists (even if you
don't count them as totally "pure" humanists) perhaps there can be
religious transhumanists (though you may not count as pure as secular
transhumanists).

So, I think that religious faith is incompatible with transhumanism, but I
would not feel confident declaring that all specific religious beliefs are
incompatible.

Onward!

Actually, the prediction by Geo. (which he pronounced `Joe') Gamow was 50
degrees K.  So he was out by an order of magnitude.  Not bad for a standing
jump.

(I recently wondered whether the background hiss might be due not to
residual heat from a BB but to leakage of what David Deutsch calls `shadow

the stochastic nature of galactic and stellar formation, there must be
stars in every part of the sky in all those overlapped cosmoses.  But I
don't have either the mathematics or the physics to play with this notion.
Anyone for photonic tennis?)

Subject: QUOTE: Bey on extropians
Sender: postmaster@extropy.com

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

Here are 2 quotes from essay called "Primitives and Extropians", 
found at    http://www.elnet.com/~lrobin/frames/bey/primitiv.htm
by Hakim Bey, author of The Temporary Autonomous Zone (TAZ).

"reprinted from Anarchy: a journal of desire armed #42, Fall 1995."

Even when Bey paints us as an extended Jetsons family falling into
Cogswellian traps, I like how he paints.  Anyway, the quotes:

    By contrast, the anarcho-extropian or futurians are also forced to 
    reify the eschaton--since the present is obviously not the utopia of 
    techne' they envision--by placing perfection in a future where 
    symbolic mediation has abolished hierarchy, rather than in a past 
    where such mediation has not yet appeared (the ideal Palaeolithic of 
    the primitivists). Obviously for the extropians, mediation per se 
    cannot be defined as "impurity" or as the invariable source of
    separation, alienation, and hierarchy. Nevertheless, it remains 
    obvious that such separation does in fact occur, that it amounts to 
    immiseration, that not all technology is "liberating" according to 
    any anarchist definition of the term, and that some of it is 
    downright oppressive. The extropian therefore lacks and needs a
    critique of technology, and of the incredibly complex relation 
    between the social and the technical. ...

    ...

    I must admit that my own taste inclines neither toward Wilderness 
    World nor Spaceship Earth as exclusive categories. I actually spend 
    far more time defending wildness than "civilization," because it is 
    far more threatened. I yearn for the reappearance of Nature out of 
    Culture--but not for the eradication of all symbolic mediation. The 
    word "choice" has been so devalued lately. Let's say I'd prefer a 
    world of indeterminacy, of rich ambiguity, of complex impurities. My
    critics, apparently, do not. I find much to admire and desire in 
    both their models, but can't for even a moment believe in them as 
    totalities. Their future or eschatology bores me, unless I can mix 
    it into the stew of the TAZ--or use it to magic the TAZ into active 
    existence--to tease the TAZ into action. The TAZ is "broad-minded" 
    enough to entertain more than two, or even six, impossible ideas
    "before breakfast." ...

Hi Everybody,

This evening the inner circle of Excedo met in Utrecht to socialize,
eat/drink and discuss plans. Aside from the usual discussions about all
kinds of ideas and technologies (some explanations on the bean-stalk were
in order ;-) we also did some practical work.

Henri has been working on our website (not just him, but he did most of the
work). Soon it will be launched, including an english part. Both Berrie and
Dalibor have made contributions to the site in the form of articles, some
of it will be translated to english as soon as we get the basics
up-and-running. Since Berrie is a bit overworked and I'm back in the
world/normal life, I'll be taking over the work he started on the creation
of a single document to bring 'newbies' up-to-speed on the basics of
Transhumanism and Extropy. For us this will be most usefull to introduce a
whole 'package' of memes to potential new members. Personally it think it
would be a great idea to have a single text that contains all the basic
stuff we more or less agree on. Emphasizing the similarities between the
various local Transhumanist organisations would help in positioning
Transhumanism as a truly global movement.

There are already many good texts on the web that will provide pieces of a
general introductory text, I'll cook up something this week, post it and
hope it will grow into something usefull with help of many thinkers and
writers on this list.

We are all very enthousiastic about a European network/list/gathering.
Aside from sharing of information and social events we could cooperate on a
legal and organisational framework for Cryo-suspension. Dalibor den Otter
is now a full-fledged Alcor member (first in the Netherlands!) and is very
anxious to get underway with the practical problems of creating a 'rescue
service' for European Alcor members. We still have a long way to go on the
European mainland before anyone can feel safe that reaction-time willl be
short enough and all authoroties will cooperate in allowing a person to be
suspended. Dutch law at this point does not allow freezing deanimated
persons or storing them in a privately owned facility. We're going to work
on influencing the media and institutions like the Dutch Cancer Foundation
who have contacts with many politicians. Meanwhile we'll all get a mobile
phone, carry a document with instructions and keep our fingers crossed ;-)

We also discussed changing the name of the society because some people
think it might be confused with Extropy (both have Ex in 'em). Any ideas
(English or Latin) are welcome and will be considered. We'll keep you
informed.

More on all this later, now my limited body needs to get a few hours sleep,
I have a meeting in five hours :-(

greetings,
Arjen

      A preliminary note: Popper makes the point that the value of any 
      discussion is inversely proportional to the time spent on discussing 
      definitions (one Popperian writes to another...  >:-} ).  Nothing 
      much hinges on words and definitions, although some words are worth 
      fighting for (a Goldwater Liberal writes...  >:-} ).  Good 
      definitions read 'from right to left' anyway.
      
      For me, libertarianism _is_ a mindset or world-view or value system 
      that places great (even oparamount) importance on maximizing 
      self-liberation, autonomy and a maximally (positively and 
      negatively) free and open society. Bryan Magee emphasized to me from 
      our first correspondence in 1977, that he was _above all things a 
      libertarian_.  As Milton friedman says, there is no ascertainable 
      and unambiguous ontological basis to property rights.  Property 
      rights are ineluctably consensual social constructs.
      
      As Robert LeFevre pointed out, to assert an exclusive claim to a
      territory or piece of property (other than one's own body) is one 
      thing (hand-waving or argument).  To initiate aggression or violence 
      to enforce the claim against another is _wrong_.

      At Geelong Grammar School in Australia, kids used to tell me of 
      their parents going on Aborigine hunts at week-ends, because the 
      'Abos' wouldn't respect (settler) property demarcations (fences) and 
      ownership of animals (sheep).  So their parents shot and poisoned 
      the 'Abos'... For _recreation_ and for _social control_... 
      
      Australia was declared -- dishonestly -- 'Terra Nullius' (unoccupied 
      territory) by the British colonial authorities.  The Aboriginal 
      occupants had no concept or convention of personally owned real 
      estate or livestock. They roamed over vast territories (roaming 
      rights which the present Courts are increasingly recognizing).


      What rational objection can you have to people negotiating 
      agreements to the _particular_ 'Wertfrei' catallaxy or economic 
      system they will consent to participating in, with (something like) 
      taxes constituting their fee for participation in a 
      (Pareto-optimal?) catallaxy?

      Popper contrasts two views of religion:
      
      [A] "Dominate, or prostrate yourself."  -- _Rationally and morally 
      unacceptable_.
      
      Compare and contrast with:
      
      [B] Always remember that -- while men are not gods -- each of us has 
      a divine spark." -- Acceptable.  Viz: 'The God of Spinoza.'

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------
       
      Judaism doesn't involve faith -- Judaism is a matter of 
      _observances_ and _practices_.   Interestingly, a great many 
      libertarian writers come from a Jewish background, or so Chris Tame 
      tells me.  Barry Goldwater, ferinstance...  >:-}
      
  "Freedom means doing whatever you damn well please." -- Barry Goldwater.

      Jewish Cabbalistic doctrine holds that Nature, the Universe and God 
      are all the same.  Even the gematria matches this, oddly enough.

      Scientology?  http://www.scientology.org

      How about Classical Greek mythology?  (Read 'Practical Greek Magic" 
      by Murry Hope (Aquarian, [1985]).  It's brilliant, quite rational, 
      witty and profoundly inspirational.  "The Heroic Path!"

      Hello, John,
      
      'Mind Machines'
      
      I have hereabouts a cross-comparative review of all the major 
      products in this field.  I bought the report from an outfit in 
      Boston, USA, who advertized in 'Popular Science' (PopSci@aol.com.  I 
      bought a Zygon kit first, but soon realized that the Synetics 
      MindLab machine is far superior for most purposes.
      
      It's compact and portable,  has onboard microprocessors, 
      rechargeable batteries, volume and brightness controls, a 
      sophisticated press-button control panel, complex brain-frequency 
      entrainment options (relax, stimullate, sleep, learn etc.); 
      hemispheric activity equalization routines; and it can download 
      further programmes.  The effects are scientifically well-attested.
      
      It also has a 'son-et-lumiere' option where you can connect it to 
      your stereo! There are custom CDs with program tracks, and it will 
      auto-generate a custom light-show from standard audio 
      (CD/tape/radio/record/live) sources.  Street-legal psychedelia!

      I purchased my MindLab kit from 'Life Tools' here in the UK.  Three 
      months old, perfect condition, half price (UKP 150).
      
      I hope this info helps.
      
      Try a Web search on 'Synetics' and 'MindLab'


      All Best Wishes,

Relative to anything.

I hope not, because if so that means logic must be inconsistent. We know from 
experiment that Galilean or even Newtonian physics is wrong.            


        >once you abandon locality -- see Bell, Aspect etc.),     
 

Aspect proved experimentally that Bell's inequality is violated and that 
means weird quantum effects that move instantly and  do not weaken with 
distance do exist, but as these effects can carry neither energy nor 
information I don't see the relevance to the Big Bang or General Relativity.

Rubbish.

The index of refraction is a measure of how much a substance will slow down 
light, water is pretty dense so light is only about 80% as fast as in a  
vacuum for example. 
                

        >there is no perfect vacuum in space       


But pretty damn close, on average about one hydrogen atom per cubic meter. 
Radiation is only scattered if the particles are about the same size as the 
wavelength of  the photon, yet the redshift has been detected from radio 
waves to X rays, an enormous range, and the shift is always exactly the same 
for all wavelengths. This can not be the cause of the redshift.
                

      >some of the most perfect vacuums around are probably right here on       
      >Earth.       


Nope, we can't even get close.      
                

        >In space, the free electrons are particularly voracious absorbers

OK.  
                
        >The photons perform _work_ on the electrons as they're absorbed and

You're still on solid ground.
   

        >This (along with photon-photon interaction -- see Jean-Paul Vigier

And now you enter the Twilight Zone. All elements produce a unique set of 
emission and absorption lines in their electromagnetic spectrum, a redshift 
means that the information on the  relative position of these lines is 
preserved, they're just "shifted" to a longer wavelength. There are only 2 
things known to science that can produce a redshift:

 1) The Doppler effect.

 2) Gravity. (an effect discovered by Einstein by the way)

The huge redshift seen in distant galaxies does not produce fuzzy lines but 
sharp ones, so the gravitational field would not only have to be enormous but 
also constant over thousands of light years, over an entire galaxy. Nothing  
known to science can produce a gravitational field like that. It also seems  
very strange that the gravitational field of all objects is proportional to  
their distance from a small planet called Earth.

You claim to have found a third way to produce a redshift, some sort of 
mysterious inter galactic gas, well that's jim dandy, but until you can show 
me the stuff and let me watch it do its thing in the lab your theory remains 
just that, gas.

I sense desperation, I can't think of any other reason you would invoke the 
name of a man dead for 300 years to dismiss with a wave of your hand hard 
experimental data obtained in this very decade. I also note  that in my last 
post whenever I mentioned a scientific fact in favor of the  Big Bang your 
only rebuttal was to tell me to read books by various philosophers but that 
just doesn't wash. It's science that must give marching orders to philosophy 
not the other way round.

Yea yea, I've heard it a million times, cosmologists are hiding evidence and  
engaged in a huge conspiracy of silence, probably related to the JFK

Does it produce a blackbody spectrum? Is the temperature close to 2.7 degrees

        >You've been reading too many childrens' histories of physics!        


I need your help to explain something, I can't ask momey or daddy because 
it's  past my bedtime and I'm not supposed to be playing with the computer 
this late. If I'm wrong then at least one of the following 3 things must be 
true  but I can't figure out which one:

 1) The Big Bang was known at the turn of the century and popular because    
    those naughty logical positivists loved it so much.

 2) The Big Bang did not become popular in the 60's.

 3) Despite the fact that The Big Bang theory was the only one that predicted     
    universal blackbody microwave radiation and said how hot it would be, 
    when evidence for it was actually found nobody was impressed and most of 
    the advocates of competing theories did not conceded defeat.


        >TRUTH has a central regulating role in values AND facts.       


Science is about what is, morality is about what we want, confusing the two  
is disastrous to both. Consider Lysenko's nitwit communist genetics or the 
social darwinist's nitwit morality.
          

        >If General Relativity depicts a four-dimensional Parmenidean Block

Don't get me started on free will, I spent months debating that topic on this 
list.
          
        >"The statement 'God exists' has meaning, and it may even be true.

        >such a statement, it is _unscientific_." -- Bryan Magee, 'Popper.' 
          

OK, but what does that have to do with the price of eggs? The Big Bang can  
be refuted, at least in theory, but nobody has done it yet. 
          

        >He [Einstein] thought GR was wrong, and spent decades trying to come         
        >up with 'a more realistic theory' 
          

Nonsense. Like all scientific theories General Relativity does not cover 
everything, it says nothing about the strong or weak nuclear forces, Einstein 
spent the last 20 years of his life trying to extend it into those areas and 
he failed, but that certainly doesn't mean General Relativity is wrong. 


        >His theory is methodologically flawed and empirically falsified.
          

Empirically falsified? In his first paper Einstein predicted that the 
precession of Mercury's perihelion should shift by 43 seconds of arc a 
century more than Newton says it should.  It does. 

In the same paper Einstein said that light from a star that just grazes the 
surface of the sun should be deflected by 1.75 seconds of arc. It is.

General Relativity predict that time runs slower in a gravitational field,  
such as on the surface of the Earth than it does in open space far from any 
large mass. Because it's a scientific and not just a philosophical theory it 
can give you numbers and tell you exactly how much slower, just use the
following formula:

                 __________
                /     v^2
               /  1 - ---
            \/       c^2


If you plug in v as the Earth's escape velocity at the surface, about 7 miles  
per second, and c as the speed of light in a vacuum, 186000 miles a second,  
you find that a clock on the Earth's surface is only running 99.99999993%  as 
fast as a clock in deep space. This has been confirmed experimentally and has
become important commercially. Global Positioning Satellites contain atomic 
clocks and send out timing signals, they enable a receiving station to 
calculate his position within a few inches, if General Relativity was not 
taken into account this would not be possible, instead we have a multi 
billion dollar industry.
    
The gravitational field on the second story of a house is a little weaker 
than it is on the first story 10 feet below, General Relativity predicts that 
time will run slower down there, 3 parts in 10^16 slower.  Incredibly even 
this tiny difference has been detected experimentally, and it was done more 
than 30 years ago, using the Mossbauer effect for which he received the Nobel 
prize.
         
        >>Me:        
        >>The universe may or may not be infinite but it is certainly not         
        >>Euclidean, if it were gravity could not exist. 
         
        >That verges on the absurd ... Relational or Faradayan or Newtonian

        >Euclidean framework.          


Yes, and they get along just fine with your philosophy, but they don't agree 
with experiment, in such a confrontation the victor is clear. Your philosophy  
may insist that an instrument produce a certain reading but if it stubbornly  
refuses to do so then its time to find a new philosophy. 

Aristotle was like you, he somehow deduced from pure philosophy that women 
have fewer teeth than men. They don't. Aristotle had a wife, he could have 
counted her teeth at any time but never bothered because he already knew the 
answer, or thought he did.


        >What the hell are you talking about?  GR?
         

Give that man a cigar.

By the way, if as you say the universe is infinite in all directions and thus 
is infinitely old and has an infinite number of stars, how do you explain 
Olber's Paradox. Why is the sky dark at night? 

Pick any point in the night sky and extend a line from you to that point, 
eventually the line will hit the surface of a star, so the entire sky should 
be as bright as the sun. Put it another way, all the light emitted by an 
infinite number of stars would have nowhere to go, it would accumulate and 
vaporize the earth. Your interstellar gas would be no help because it would  
heat up too.

The Big Bang theory has no trouble with Olber because light from stars more 
than 20 billion light years away has not had time to reach us yet.


        >An infinite Universe has nowhere to expand _into_. Right?


Wrong. I'm the manager of a hotel that has an infinite number of rooms and 
all are occupied, you walk in and ask for a room. No problem, I just tell 
guest #1 to move to room 2, 2 to move to  3, 3 to move to 4 ect.  

An infinite number of guests walk in and ask for a room. No problem, I just  
tell guest #1 to move to room 2, 2 to move to 4, 4 to move to 8 ect.

Incidentally, the universe does not expand into space, space itself is  
expanding.

The month of September is the best time for a visit to Vienna. Visit the
Stephansdom, relax at the prater where you can take a trip with the
Riesenrad, eat the world's best pastries (e.g. the original Sacher-Torte)
in one of the famous coffee houses, listen to an opera at the Vienna State
Opera, or visit one of the many museums, such as the famous Klimt
Collection in the Belvedere Castle.

Post-conference tours to Wachau, Salzburg or Prag may be organized. Please
mail your preferences to the symposium organizer.

Damien I think you're wrong, ah, the stuff you said about Gamow I mean, 
the things about me were rather more accurate. (:>)

On page 142 of The Principles Of Physical Cosmology by P.J.E. Peebles:

 "Alpher and Herman (1948) corrected some numerical errors in Gamow's   
  calculation and used the result to compute the present temperature 
  predicted  by this theory. Their value, 5 degrees K, is the first numerical 
  estimate  of the present cosmic blackbody radiation temperature and again 
  quite close to what is observed. [2.7 K]"

On page 283 of Black Holes, Quasars And The Universe second edition by 
Harry L Shipman:

 "they put it at 5 K in their 1949 paper. Four years later Gamow set it at   
  7 K."

Actually I did make a mistake at the end of my last post when I talked about 
my Hotel with and infinite number of rooms, I said:

 "An infinite number of guests walk in and ask for a room. No problem, I just   
  tell guest #1 to move to room 2, 2 to move to 4, 4 to move to 8 ect."

I should have said move guest #1 to room 2, 2 to 4, 3 to 6, 4 to 8, 5 to 10  
etc. That way all odd numbered rooms are free and my infinite number of new  
guests have a place to sleep. Speaking of sleep, this should teach me to go 
to bed and not post to Extropians when I get sleepy.

On Thu, 30 Oct 1997 I incorrectly suggested that
Robin Hanson once said something to the effect that
economists don't study non-linear models.  And Robin
naturally replied:

< I have no recollection or record of saying this,
and economic models are most certainly "non-linear". >

VERY SORRY; I should have been more discriminating
before making such a silly statement!

The thread was "Great Filter, Low Profile,
Cryptocosmology" and I asked "What would economists
call the type of mechanisms (for trying to modulate
chaotic systems, rather than eliminate them)", trying
to get some idea of the scope of what Robin meant by
"Mechanism Design" and "signaling games" and whether
these had any application to chaotic systems.

On Tuesday, October 22, 1996 1:31 PM Robin Hanson
replied:
< Economists don't focus much on systems described by
differential equations in time.  So they don't have a
snappy name for it. >

Now, if I was a Fortune 500 executive and you were
briefing me and said something like that, I would
probably send you back to your campus and go hire
someone like Michael Rothschild who could speak my
language (of course, I'd likely be making a big
mistake ;-)

This relates to another thread, that I noticed while
digging up the above reference, where Robin was
wondering why people accept advice from computer
salespeople but not from economists or other social
scientists.

I mentioned Paul Romer's New Growth theories and
Robin replied:
< Romer's work is solidly within the standard 
"equilibrium thinking" framework.  (In economics, 
equilibrium doesn't mean statis.) >

I'm sure it is, and ideas of endogenous growth
complement Krugman's work on 'free trade'.

I guess, then, that most political scientists today
would not agree with the concluding paragraph of
Friedrich Hayek's 1945 essay "The Use of Knowledge in
Society" where he warns:

"Any approach, such as that of much of mathematical
economics with its simultaneous equations, which in
effect starts from the assumption that people's
knowledge corresponds with the objective facts of the
situation, systematically leaves out what is our main
task to explain. I am far from denying that in our
system equilibrium analysis has a useful function to
perform. But when it comes to the point where it
misleads some of our leading thinkers into believing
that the situation which it describes has direct
relevance to the solution of practical problems, it
is high time that we remember that it does not deal
with the social process at all and that it is no more
than a useful preliminary to the study of the main
problem."

                  REVIEW OF THE INTERNET  by Jane Affleck
                  =======================================

Here is a selection of sites on the Internet that I have found interesting. 
However, it is only a very small selection, and is not intended to be in any
way comprehensive, but only to give some indication of the type of information
available (with some bias towards those areas that may interest Lobster
readers).  Other points worth making: using the internet can be very time
consuming - and expensive - if you don't know what you're looking for, and
access can be variable, being very slow, or even impossible to connect, at busy
times.  The usenet newsgroups are for discussion of issues and anyone can
contribute;  some of the contibutions are pretty far out, or just plain
abusive, and much of the material is US-orientated.  The content of newsgroups
is continually changing, and the examples I have given are of topics listed
recently.  However, there is a lot of useful and interesting information out
there, as I hope the following will indicate.

Also that HAARP could provide a tool to replace the EM pulse effect of
atmospheric nuclear devices, that HAARP could wipe out communications over a
very large area, replace the ELF submarine communication system, that HAARP
could help detect incoming low level planes and cruise missiles, and help
verify nuclear  non-proliferation. (Quotes a White House adviser in 1958 as
saying the US defence department was studying ways to manipulate the charges of
the earth and sky and so affect the weather by using an electronic beam to
ionise or de-ionise the atmosphere over a given area).

That is indeed the question.  In my research there is little direct
evidence for the effectiveness of Sound & Light entrainment devices, but
quite a bit of evidence for the effectiveness of Neurofeedback devices.

For example, see the collection of papers & abstracts at: 
http://192.147.157.51:8000/galaxy/Medicine/Therapeutics/Alternative-Medi
cine/Biofeedback.html

and:
http://192.147.157.51:8000/galaxy/Medicine/Therapeutics/Alternative-Medi
cine/Biofeedback/Neurofeedback.html

or do a Medline search on "Neurofeedback".

These studies collectively show a number of correlations between certain
observed brainwave states (via EEG) and certain observed
behavioral/physiological states.  Further they show that with training
subjects can learn to directly modulate their own brainwave activity,
and that this can have benefits in directing attention, augmenting
visual ideation, controlling pain, eliminating stress, dealing with
addiction, etc..

Sadly studies to date have been focussed on eliminating "pathologies"
such as Attention Deficit Disorder or addictive behavior and relatively
little experimental work has been done on the potential of this
technology for augmenting human capabilities beyond societal norms.

However if I'm allowed to step into the realm of anecdotal evidence, er,
I mean postulated models of attentional processing :), then I'd add the
following points:

* EEG measurements of those with a fair bit of training in Neurofeedback
or a fair bit of experience with Mind Machines look quite similar to
those of extremely experienced meditators, either in the Vipassana
(insight) style of meditation, or the more-scientifically-studied
tranquility meditations, such as Transcendental Meditation.

* Some studies (I wish I could vouch for their accuracy - any comments
from the peanut gallery?) have found an extremely large IQ boost in
twice-daily practitioners of TM.  20 points on average if memory serves.


* Among ADD sufferers, studies of neurofeedback protocols routinely show
a 20-30 point IQ boost over a period of several months.

I would hesitate to take any one of the studies that show such drastic
benefits at face value, but similar results have been replicated by
numerous researchers.  It's my hope that in the next few years we'll see
more research focussed on using these technologies to augment "healthy"
individuals rather than merely as corrective tools.

Finally, to come back around to Mind Machines (Sound & Light Entrainment
Devices), I should say that while there is little in the way of
published studies of their effectiveness, there apparently /is/ a
well-documented entrainment effect where brainwave activity falls into
cadence with rhythmic visual & auditory stimuli.  The similarity between
the effects & observed EEGs of Neurofeedback subjects and meditators
suggests that a third entrypoint to the same EEG state (such as a Mind
Machine) would produce similar effects.

While not all of us can afford an EEG at home, most of us can afford a
small Mind Machine.  Net, I'd advise you to try one out, perhaps
borrowing one before you buy, and experience for yourself how it affects
you.

Sender: postmaster@extropy.com

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

I read in The Times newspaper yesterday that a researcher had managed 
to transplant monkey heads and keep them alive for up to a week after 
the operation. We have discussed the possibility of  brain 
transplantation at some point on the extropian or the transhumanist 
list, and we concluded that it seemed unlikely (at least before the 
arrival of nanotech, at which time there wouldn't be any use in 
transplanting heads anyway). The reason we thought the project looked 
hopeless was that the task of making the nerve fibers in the spinal 
core match up correctly after the transplantation looks absolutely 
staggering.

What we overlooked was the these nerves don't need to be matched up 
in a certain way or even reconnected at all! What the researcher I 
read about had done was to keep the brain stem of the donor body. 
This makes the donor body continue such functions as respiration, 
heart activity and digestion, thereby supplying the transplanted head 
with oxygen and nutrients. The transplanted brain has control over 
the facial muscles and would thus be able to read, eat, and in some 
way or another communicate. But it has no connection with the brain 
stem or the rest of the body, so the animal is 90% paralysed.

To me it seems unnecessary to have a donor body: might it not be 
possible to replace it with a heart-lung machine?

I don't think that this breakthough will have any major practical 
consequences, but it represents yet another development that forces 
people to come to terms with the weirdness of the future and of the 
present day. Perhaps the shock value of head transplants will help 
desensitize people so they become more accepting of, say, the idea of 
cloning?

I'd like to share my definition because I think it works very well with
Extropianism:

I never considered myself religious because I never believed in anything
I couldn't prove to myself. Now, I don't say "god doesn't exist", I just
say I don't know and I don't care. A few years ago, I discovered that I
very much like some of the ideas behind Buddhism and Hinduism. I didn't
have the time to really dig into those religions and what they are all
about, but one thing seemed pretty clear from the literature I've read:
those religions are about EXPERIENCE instead of dogmatic laws for people
not capable of living nicely together without a "god" that threatens
them with "hell" if they don't obey those (very sensible) rules.

I've also read a little bit about primitive cultures, who used drugs to
alter their state of minds. I'm not sure if this can be called
"religion" - but I like considering religion is something positive,
something valuable (instead of misinterpreting it with inquisition).

Reading about these rituals reminds me a lot of today's clubbing
culture.

I've discovered that with the right music (that I really like), and the
right people (that create a good atmosphere), I can pretty well get
myself into a mood of "trance". It's quite different from doing drugs,
even if drug use may have inspired "going that direction". And this mood
of "trance", with the whole event is what I call "religion". It's quite
impossible to describe the feelings involved - but the effect is quite
positive: simply a different perspective :-)

It's - simply put - a form of very intense relaxation. It's the kind of
thing that makes you go "wow", and two days later, you still say "wow" -
but you're able to concentrate on things that are more down-to-earth.
Oh, and it's rather inspiring (in terms of giving you creative ideas,
both about art and solving problems).

I'm not sure, but this might be pretty similar to meditating (meditating
calms you down, while this pushes you real hard - but I consider both
rather "spiritual").

Anybody with similar experiences? I believe that I achieved this kind of
control simply by seeing what was possible, and then trying to
self-improve myself.

later,
Holger

This is the current lead article from the 'Boycott Microsoft Website'.
There's much more. Make sure to check their monopoly clock, it's now 11:54,

           Why Microsoft is a Threat to Freedom

           It's bad enough to have a company
           sell shoddy products, stuff that should
           never have seen the light of day, or that should
           have been permanently recalled. It's bad enough
           to have a company get away with this for years,
           even making billions of dollars in immoral profits from
           its defective merchandise. Further, it's bad enough to
           have  this company held in high esteem by its clever
           manipulation of the press, the educational system, and
           the politicians.

           But what really hurts is that this company,
           Microsoft, will never be satisfied no matter how much power,
           influence, and money it accumulates. This is because the head
           honchos at Microsoft exhibit a compulsive need for control that
           is the epitome of megalomania, a paranoid approach to all of
           life's challenges. This is a company whose stated goal is 100%
           control of every market it enters, and it enters a new market
           every time it finishes devouring the previous one.

           What, you may say, is the harm in such "success?" Well, do we
           feel good that Russia has only Aeroflot? Are we complacent
           when a single religion holds sway over a state or a country?
           Don't we feel a sense of urgency, a fear of loss of freedom, if
           one political party begins to have too much power in congress
           or other branches of government?

           Ah, but this is just business, you may say. Microsoft is not some
           kind of cult or party with an agenda, is it? It's just about making
           money and increasing its market share, right? That's the
           American way!!

           Except the market for information is not supposed to be for
           sale. The market for information is supposed to be the ultimate
           free market, and the very design of government in the U.S. has
           always been about ensuring some degree of "free press" and a
           diversity of opinions. Will that freedom be maintained if one
           company controls the tools by which the press, the media, the
           information channels we depend upon, get their job done?
           Would we accept the notion that we would be guaranteed
           freedom of choice if these tools were owned by a Jerry Falwell
           or a Richard Nixon?

           America's great blind spot today is its affection for commercial
           giants, big business wheeler-dealers like Ted Turner, Steve
           Jobs, Bill Gates, and other public figures. It seems like these
           folks have free pass to control as much of the media and the
           educational system as they want, because they don't profess
           any particular ideology. Maybe that's the key: they have an
           ideology of nothingness, of emptiness, of merely the voracious
           desire to accumulate power for its own sake. This is an
           ideology of codependency, a dependency upon marketplace
           acceptance. A single holdout who decides he or she does not
           want what this person offers is viewed, not as an open mind, but
           as a stain, a spot to be removed, a defective element in an
           otherwise perfect demographic monolith.

           It is this ideology of squashing freedom of choice at all costs --
           because freedom to choose something else means rejection is
           always possible -- which is the heart and soul of not just
           Microsoft, but the entire business world today. The difference
           between Microsoft and other companies, though, is that the
           tools used to control public perception, the tools of information
           exchange that corporations need to regulate the markets they
           control, are increasingly being held by Microsoft: digital
           television, Internet software, PC systems, and more and more
           educational products and toys. If Big Business is a boss,
           Microsoft is the Boss of All Bosses.

           The threat to freedom is not merely that a religious cult or a
           band of political whackos will take control; rather, it is just as
           probable that a band of ruthless, greedy control freaks who use
           commerce instead of crime, who use information instead of
           guns, will exert a cultural influence that will produce a
generation
           made up exclusively of morally impotent wimps. Greed and
           powerlust are agendas just as religious in their nature as any
           form of theology, and even more dangerous to freedom.

           The threat is real; the solution, a bitter pill to swallow: like a
           junkie going cold turkey, businesses who have invested deeply
           in the Microsoft agenda must pull out. Now. Completely. At all
           costs. Short-term results may be troublesome, but the long-term
           results of freedom of choice have always been greater than the
           short-term benefits of appeasement and immediate
           gratification. A little lesson from history explains why.

           First they came for the DOS users, but I laughed at DOS. So the
           DOS users were consumed. Then they came for the OS/2
           users, but I never tried OS/2. So the OS/2 users were
           consumed. Then they came for the Apple users, but I wasn't an
           Apple user. So the Apple users were consumed. Then they
           came for the UNIX users, but I didn't understand UNIX. So the
           UNIX users were consumed.

           Then they came for me, but there was nobody to stand up for
           me. So I was consumed as well.

I should have gone to my shelf.  Here's Geo., in THE CREATION OF THE
UNIVERSE (1952):

`Thus when the universe was 1 second old, 1 year old, and 1 million years
old, its temperature were 15 billion, 3 million, and 3 thousand degrees
absolute, respectively.  Inserting the present age of the universe (t=10^17
sec) [...] we find

		Tpresent = 50 degrees absolute

which is in reasonable agreement with the actual temperature of
interstellar space.' (p. 48)

I quoted from Gamow's THE CREATION OF THE UNIVERSE (1952):

`Thus when the universe was 1 second old, 1 year old, and 1 million years
old, its temperature were 15 billion, 3 million, and 3 thousand degrees
absolute, respectively.  Inserting the present age of the universe (t=10^17
sec) [...] we find

		T present = 50 degrees absolute'

but perhaps should have noted that the calculation using this elided formula

		1.5 by 10^10
temperature =   -------------------------
		[time]^1/2

used an age since BB of only 3.2 billion years (if I'm adding on my fingers
correctly), which gives 21 degrees K (ditto) for what is currently regarded
as a more plausible 16 billion years.

So no visible light was out there 20 billion years ago?
If the universe is expanding do you think that space should be filled 
with light generated before it got so far a way?
Take two flashlights facing each other and move them apart,
unless they move FTL or stop facing each other 
there will be no gap of darkness.

NASA gave me the impression that the more powerful my telescope was 
the more galaxies I could see in the emptiest part of the sky.

After finding yet another quote in a book called "The Big Bang" by Joseph 
Silk saying that in 1948 a 5 degree K temperature prediction was made I 
thought I had you, then I checked your quotation from Gamow's own book found 
you were absolutely correct. I'm wrong.

But not entirely wrong, apparently there was a 5 K prediction made in 1948  
using Gamow's theory, but it was not made by Gamow.

- From "Exploring the Cosmos" by Louis Berman page 361:

 "It's [the cosmic blackbody radiation]  possible existence had been first 
  theoretically predicted by G. Gamow in 1934 and later elaborated upon by   
  R. A. Alper and R. C. Herman in 1948."

- From "The Evolution of Radio Astronomy" by J.S. Hey  page 174:

 "His [Gamow's] research students, Alper and Herman (1949), estimated the   
  residual temperature of the cosmic radiation after expansion at about 5K".


- From "Lonely Hearts of the Cosmos" by Dennis Overbye page 132:

 "In a paper published in NATURE in 1949, two of his [Gamow's] disciples,
  Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman calculated that the present day temperature
  of the universe should be about 5K."
               
Evidently the paper was submitted in 1948 and published in 1949. Alper and  
Herman also predicted that about 25% of the universe should be made of Helium, 
and it is.

       [1] A photon is absorbed and emitted by electrons as it passes 
       through a glass block.  The photon is decelerated, held, then 
       re-emitted. Unless you believe that instantaneous transition from 
       rest to 'c' is possible, the photon _must_ travel at intermediate 
       velocities.

       [2] Your mistake is in the focus on (mythical) 'observers' rather 
       than on objective reality.  If you plot the ineluctably necessary 
       positions of emitting charges and photons in 'position space', you 
       see quite clearly that the relative velocities are often quite 
       other than 'c'.   Just take the known initial and terminal points, 
       and plot the intermediate positions and thence velocities.  Simple, 
       innit?  Invariant Mass, Length and Time.

      Obviously absurd.  Relative to an adjacent photon in a coherent 
      laser beam?  Or a parallel 'near-luminal' electron beam?  C'mon...

I hope not, because if so that means logic must be inconsistent. We know 
from experiment that Galilean or even Newtonian physics is wrong.

      concepts can be applied." -- Werner Heisenberg.

      You fail to understand the problem, then.  Once you say that two 
      events are absolutely (not relativistically) simultaneous, you have 
      'position space.'  Special and General Relativity _cannot survive_ 
      the loss of relativististic simultaneity.  See Popper, "The

      Notice the absurdity you're slipping into there.  Water

      space is a _perfect vacuum_ (except for the photons).  

      Are your photons now travelling sub-luminally in a vacuum, pray?

      You must be sensing your own desperation, then.  I merely assigned

      problem-situation he raised, rather than how long ago he pointed out 
      this rather obvious and inescapable problem.  'Hard experimental

Empirically falsified? In his first paper Einstein predicted that the 
precession of Mercury's perihelion should shift by 43 seconds of arc a 
century more than Newton says it should.  It does. 


      [ FX: "RTFM!!!" ] 

      From my Relational Mechanics paper on:

            http://www.agora.demon.co.uk

<quote> 

 {X1} Mercury's Perihelion Advance
      ============================

     While it was for a long time the strongest argument for it, this is not
now considered a corroboration of Einstein's theory.  There was an observed,
long-standing and acknowledged anomaly between the classically predicted
movement of the planet Mercury (circling the Sun in a nearly "closed" or
stationary ellipse, with a small perihelion advance caused by the gravitation
of the other planets) and the observed advance of the perihelion (Mercury's
closest approach to the sun), a difference of 43 seconds of arc
(approximately 0.012 of a degree) per century.  (Ritz's, Weber's and
Neumann's theories of gravity as a propagated far-action also give
approximately this result).

     The existence of another - intraMercurial - planet, "Vulcan", was
suggested as a cause, but no planet "Vulcan" was found (sorry, fellow "Star
Trek" fans).  However, in 1970, the American astronomer Robert Henry Dicke
suggested a (partial, 10%) classical cause for the anomaly as due to the
oblateness of the Sun (a flattening at the poles caused by rotation).  And
the force of gravitational attraction is only a uniform central force for
orbits lying in the equatorial plane of the sun; Mercury's orbit lies 7
degrees off the plane of the ecliptic.  The sun's equatorial rotation on its
axis is 25.38 days; Mercury circles the Sun in 88 days.  The sun's magnetic
force and atmosphere extends far past Mercury; so does the "solar wind."
There is a rotating accretion disc of particles, gas and dust extending on
the plane of the ecliptic from the sun.  The other planets affect Mercury's
rotation.  Light-pressure from sunlight acts on the planets.

     Most significantly; the sun's magnetic force transfers the Sun's angular
momentum to Mercury; this will continue to advance Mercury's perihelion,
until the Sun's angular velocity and Mercury's orbital velocity become more
nearly synchronized.  Compare this with Larmor precession.

     Since general relativity predicts an additional 45" +/-5 per century
precession advance without allowing for any of these factors, it is hardly
likely to be correct.  The observed precession is also at variance with that
calculable using special relativity, as are other anomalies within the solar
system (e.g.  abberances in the moon's motion).  Interested readers may also
want to read E. Gerjuoy, "Feasibility of a non-relativistic Explanation for
the Advance of the Perihelion of Mercury;" American Journal of Physics, 24:3
[1956].  Recent microwave measurements of solar system distances were
reported to be .5% different from previous measurements.  This indicates
opportunities for further interesting discoveries.  There have been no
successful measurements of any velocity of propagation for gravitational
force.

 {X2} Eddington and Cottingham's Hyades Starlight Deflection Observations
      ===================================================================

     Johann Georg von Soldner, in [1801], calculated the bending of light
rays grazing the sun's disk.  (Also referred to in Stanley L. Jaki,
"Foundation of Physics" 8, [1978]).  A hundred years later, Einstein repeated
the prediction that starlight passing by the Sun would be deflected by the
sun's gravity, so that the apparent distance between stars either side of the
Sun when viewed during an eclipse would be smaller.

     According to Will, a deflection of 0.875 seconds of arc for
gravitational deflection only was calculated by von Soldner, using Classical
Mechanics and a hypothetical light velocity of around 300,000 km. per second.
Einstein's special relativity predicted .83 on Newtonian grounds (Einstein
[1920]); his general relativity 1.75; in [1919], it is asserted that
Eddington and Cottingham, in only one of sixteen photographs, measured 1.98 +
or - 0.12; 1.61 + or - 0.15: and six months later on November 6 that year,
Frank Dyson announced further results of 1.72 + or - 0.01 and 1.82 + or -
0.15. Eddington staged a publicity coup, announcing this at the Liverpool
Physical Society, causing Oliver Lodge to walk out.  Similar as well as
different observations have been made since that time.  This evidence is now
considered to be inconclusive with regard to Einstein's theory.

     If a ballistic theory of light is accepted, so that light has mass and
is therefore subject to gravity, then the Eddington eclipse observations of
[1919], rather than requiring acceptance of Einstein's 'curved-space' theory,
provided further data to calculate the properties of starlight from the
Hyades, and the forces governing its travel, as well as the characteristics
of the Sun.  The moon's gravity also deflects light, as was shown by Warren
Marrison, January 24, [1925].

     The sun's corona extends past Mercury's orbital path; the sun's
chromosphere extends 10,000 km from the sun's surface.  A gas-lens effect
therefore deflects starlight passing through it.  This is complicated by
extreme acoustic effects imparted to the chromosphere by events on the sun's
surface.  The "solar wind" of particles (mostly protons) extends outward
indefinitely.  The sun's intense magnetic and electrical forces can cause
deflection of light (the Zeeman and Stark effects).  There may also be a
"diffractive" as well as a gravitational deflection.  And the cooling of
Earth's atmosphere during the eclipse period must affect measurements by
altering the atmosphere's refractive index.

      <Sigh>.  Here, you have to understand a most basic methodological 
      point.  If I assert that -- in a gravitational field -- the 
      frequency of a quartz clock slows, due to gravitational force 
      modifying the structure of the quartz molecules and the electron 
      orbits, that's not the same as saying 'time itself slows down.'  
      That's your same old positivist dreck again.

      The frequency reduction is an empirical question -- the explanation 
      for it is quite another matter.  

      Relational Mechanics handles GPS just fine.

      Same positivist argument again.  You say 'time slows':  I say the 
      clock slows. In Relational Mechanics, _all the metrics_ (Mass, 
      Length and Time) are _invariant_.  It's a great theoretical 
      strength, invariance.  Einstein's positivism focused him on physical 
      constants ('c', Planck's constant, Boltzmann's constant).

      Actually, I gave up smoking the day Yul Brynner died (he left a --

      ciggies a day, and asked his fans to stop smoking in remembrance of 
      him.  I stopped right there and then.  11 October, 1985).

      Good question.  The key is the (average) ratio of stars to volume of 
      space in the Universe.  The 'cosmic soup' scatters the starlight, 
      and gravitational accretion reconstitutes the photons back into 
      stars again.  It's a true 'steady-state' system.  Perpetuum Mobile 
      -- there's 'no way out of the system.'  

      No 'entropic heat-death' in this, our Relational Mechanics Universe, 
      thank you!  Strike the Second Law of Thermodynamics...

Religion is about experience.  Most of the sophisticated or "world"
religions have ethical systems, cosmologies, and various other gewgaws
bolted on, but the reason you can't argue a religionist into an atheist
is not a lack of mental ability on their part but because words and clear
logic simply can't compare to the visceral, tangible, personal experiences
they've had.  

We may shake our heads and say, "Gosh, wasn't that Torquemada character a
jerk?" but we have no grounds for assuming his spiritual experiences were
any less personally profound than the Saharan sorceror's, the Promise
Keeper's, or the Brahmin's.

The real question in all of this is, what is the origin of the religious
experience?  and is it necessarily a bad thing from an extropian
perspective?  As someone on this list said a while ago, religions do a lot
of commendable things; we just don't need the antirational baggage.
That's one of the things that excites me, too, about the rave phenomenon.
Lights, rhythm, and all that unleashed tension make for a hell of a
ego-melting, tribal experience that has _nothing_ to do with dogma,
philosophy, or propositional thought.  It makes me wonder what a
consensual borganism might be like.

While I have nothing against a voluntary consumer boycott, why is
it that the MS-bashers always seem to want someone to use guns, like
the FTC, rather than actually competing with them?  Why are those
who don't like Microsoft's tacics not using those same tacticts,
since they obviously work?  (And don't give me any bullshit about
how morally upstanding a company Netscape is).  Why do they always
complain simultaneouly that (a) Users must be told to band together
to stop using MS products, and (b) MS products suck?  Obviously,
one of those two must be wrong, because if the products sucked, you
wouldn't have to tell anyone not to use them.

Here's a free clue: the MS monopoly /will/ fall, as every so-called
monopoly in history always has, despite the fact that the government
will do everything in its power to keep it in power.   And it won't
be because some clueless group of whiners staged a boycott; it will
be because someone with courage, vision, talent, and creativity will
have made a better product.  If you want to hasten that day, fine:
don't avoid MS products; just keep buying good ones.  Innovation is
what kills monopolies, and MS has never innovated in its life.

Someone should go the idea futures exchange and make the following
proposition, so that I can buy shares:

"By January 1, 2010, Microsoft Corporation (or the aggregate of all
sub-entities it may have been ordered to split into) will own less
than 50% market share in its product with highest sales."

Stars obviously shine and are not reflective. However, absorbing dust
clouds have been proposed by proponents of a static universe, but the
clouds would heat up due to the absorbed radiation until they shone
equally bright.

Perhaps, but I fear that the opposite may be true. Even more demands

I agree very much with this! I believe that Linux is one better product - 
but it doesn't "sell", yet.

Some Linux user-groups are starting to actively promote Linux, and I 
think that's the way to go. So, instead of doing anything against MS 
(which will always be wasted energy) - do something *for* Linux (or 
whichever OS you find superior).

I tend to believe that every (or at least most) religion(s) are BASED on 
that. My experience with religion (christian protestant church in 
Germany) was completely void of any "experience" - it was just words, and 
second-hand information about experience.

Yep, that's exactly the point. But unfortunately, it seems as if the 
antirational baggage was one very important motivation for promoting 
religion - because it allows certain power structures (when people 
believe you)...

The problem I see is that one could use that in the same manner people 
used other "experiences" before. When I look at great parts of the rave 
scene today (in Munich, Germany), most of the people that go there, go 
because they think it's cool. They pay $30 for a rave with 30 DJs and 
5.000 people, just to 'be there'. And many of them don't even smile 
anymore...

Maybe this has just been commercialized - but fortunately, the hype 
usually doesn't for to long, then there's no more money in it, and people 
who are in it for the money look for something else ;-)

Holger

	While I have no idea on whether the universe is infinitely large or not, 
an answer to this "paradox" seems a bit obvious.  Imagine you have a star, 
and a senser right next to it.  You would be reading a great deal of energy 
from the sensor.  Now, move the sensor several light years away.  You would 
read a great deal less energy, since most of the energy from the star would 
be radiating away from the sensor.  Basically, all that energy from an 
infinite amount of stars would be radiating away into an infinte amount of 
space.  That's why our skies would be dark in an infinite universe.  As for 
the heating up part, <excuse me while I violate Occam's Razor (sp?)> there 
could be energy abosrbing objects that create mass . . . or, the universe 
can't create enough energy to fill an infinitely large void . . .

	I wonder if there is anyway to show that the universe is infinitely large. 
 Start counting stars? <grin>

No. The amount of radiation you get from a star decreases with the
square of the distance. But the number of stars grows with the square
of the distance, so the total radiation from a given distance is
approximately constant. This means that in an infinite universe the
radiation diverges.

I've gotten first hand experience with this. I have implemented a few
Linux boxen here at work, and it's an uphill battle. The suits only
care about appearances, and a production box running 'shareware' in a
$3bil/yr company is verboten.

I agree. The strides made in the OS in recent months are quite
impressive. It does run better on Sparcs than Solaris does. Dont even
mention DEC Unix. Oracle has had a Linux port for over a year, but
refuse to sell it. They dont see a 'Market'. Today, it's the best
place to do DNS, Web, and Mail. (OK, that's a bit of a personal
opinion creeping in there.)

I have the dubious distinction of spending time on Linux based IRC
Channels, where, as you can imagine, anti MS sentiment is rather
Rabid. My comment to all of these people who chide me when I say that
I dont have anything specifically against microsoft, is that I refuse
to bash Microsoft and Bill Gates just because it's cool and hip to do
so. Instead of getting indignant, just dont use their
software. There's almost nothing I do during the course of my day I
cant do with Linux. And the stuff that I cant, I keep a win95 box
around for. (Though it's sorely underused.)

Their habit of lashing out at MS reminds me of a sitcom I saw many
years ago where a group ofstudents staged a sit-in at their school
(To be socially conscious), but in absence of any real pressing social 
ills, they were protesting the replacement of real bacon bits on the
cafeteria salad bar with Baco's. Dont have anything to protest? Make
something up.

I'll address this in two points. First, not being an Econ expert, I'll 
ask the honest question... Is DeBeers not a monopoly? and if so, are
we worse off for it? 

Second, I agree. MS will be split, much like the Baby Bell's. OS,
Apps, and Internet are the obvious splits. Perhaps a divestiture of
mice keyboards and joysticks. The point is, however, while their
so-called monopoly doesnt particularly bother me, they do practice
some rather underhanded methods. THAT is what will limit MS. The DOJ
and FTC, if they successfully hamper Microsoft's ability to illegally
coerce companies, will make them play on a more even field. And quite
frankly they cant compete on products alone.

I'd buy some shares of that. Who picks up the lost market share? A
rejuvenated Novell? Borland? Corel? Their new Video Network Computer
uses Linux as its OS and they own WordPerfect 8. At the risk of
sounding like a blind Linux Zealot (I'm not) I do see the Free
Software movement making huge strides here.

I have seen nothing on this on the net or in newspapers here in the USA.
Who did this? From what University?

According to the report:

"The latest developments in the 20-year project, including the vital
step of achieving respiration in the transplanted heads, have been
reported in an American scientific journal by Robert White, professor
of neurosurgery at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.

I have not been able to find it in Medline, though. Anybody else who
can dig up the original reference? Somehow I think the Times may be
exaggerating things.

That question bugged me a lot until I read the Extropy-FAQ. There, you 
find a description of uploading - which is a process where you add 
technology to your brain one at a time, so your consciousness gets used 
to it. This way it's always you (but an improved version of you)...
(I'm sure someone else can explain this a lot better)

If you copy your brain, I'm quite sure that there will not be any change 
to your consciousness - but you may have created a new instance of you. 
It will probably develop independently from you. This means: you remain 
the same, but there's another 'being' who exactly resembles you in the 
beginning. Since you will have different experiences, after a while there 
may be two quite different 'beings'...

I think there's also something called merging (which would probably be 
very interesting), but I know nothing about that...

I think the major question is: where is your consciousness. I believe 
that a 'consciousness' can only exist in one single instance that is 
somehow networked (that means, a network could have a consciousness - but 
not two seperate networks). This means that uploading your consciousness 
can only happen gradually.

later,
Holger

"No more than" is a bit strong.  But I think most economists 
and political scientists would agree that information dymamics 
are near the center of most interesting questions. The 
big change is that now, 52 years later, we have powerful tools 
for studying these information dynamics. Most of my study and 
research has been into various types of information processes, 
and very little has been in supply and demand type reasoning.  
And I am far from unusual.  

Critiques of economics for neglecting the "problem of knowledge" 
are somewhat like critiques of engineers for neglecting 
computers, or critiques of biologists for neglecting DNA.  
They may have been valid in 1945, but hardly today.

I enjoy taking a contrarian view to the usual Microsoft bashing. In that
contrarian spirit, here's a selection from a book review in the current
Business Week of Apple: The Inside Story of Intrigue, Egomania, and
Business Blunders by Jim Carlton:

"Is mismanagement at Apple isn't news, some of Carlton's insights about
Microsoft may be. While Gates is considered eveil incarnate in Mac circles,
this book shows him to be far more a patient friend than a vicious foe.
True, Gates has long made a killing by selling Mac programs but he once
tried to steer Apple toward a strategy that would have made the Mac, not
Windows, the software standard in the PC industry. The book not only
includes the full text of a 1985 memo that lays out that plan but also
reveals that Gates actually called executives at Hewlett-Packard Co. and
AT&T to make sure there was real interest from possible cloners before
sending the note.

"Gates repeatedly leaves the door open to tighter links, despite shoddy
treatment from mistrustful Apple executives. Take Apple's 1995 sneak attack
lawsuit against Microsoft over a tiff that Gates had thought he had
straighted out. Lambasting Spindler for Apple's "lack of candor and
honesty," he nonetheless reaches out a hand to an already-weakening Apple.
"I still feel that a constructive dialog between you and me would be
helpful... I think the Macintosh has a bright future," says Gates. It's a
much kinder and gentler Gates than we usually hear about now."

Several excerpts from the 11-2-97 London Sunday Times follow:

"Monkeys are given head transplants 


by Lois Rogers 
Medical Correspondent 



SURGEONS have transplanted monkeys' heads on to fresh bodies,
paving the way for a new era in human transplant technology. 
By maintaining the brain stem,  which deals with reflexes such as 
breathing, heart function and digestion, the research team has been
able to keep the new brain supplied with fresh, oxygenated blood. 

A series of experiments involving up to 30 animals has allowed
surgeons to perfect a technique of minimising loss of blood supply
to the heads during severance operations. 

The researchers also believe there was little disturbance to the 
monkeys' higher brain functions as a result of the procedure. 

The animals were able to maintain the cycle of waking and sleeping. 
They were capable of visually tracking laboratory staff and could
react to voices and noises. 

Their facial nerves were still operational and they could eat and
drink normally. When a member of the team put a finger into an
experimental animal's mouth when it seemed irritable, he was
bitten. "....

"The latest developments in the 20-year project, including the
vital step of achieving respiration in the transplanted heads, have
been reported in an American scientific journal by Robert White,
professor of neurosurgery at Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland, Ohio. 

White believes the technology will benefit people facing
multi-organ transplants because of serious injury to their bodies;
sufferers of degenerative diseases, and ultimately those who want
a new lease on life by transferring an old head onto a younger
body.".... 


"I have devised the operation that would need to be done in
humans," said White. "I have been to autopsy rooms and dissecting
rooms and examined the sort of incisions which would have to be
made, and at what level, and how the various vessels would need to
be reconnected. 

"We are talking about an operation that could be done on humans.
Whether it should be done is another question." 

So far the bodies pumping blood through the transplanted brains
have  remained completely paralysed because researchers have been
unable to reconnect the nerve fibres from the spinal cord in the
body to the brain. 

The brains can think and are conscious, but cannot communicate with
the limbs. "I have no doubt this treatment will be available in the
public arena within the next 25 to 30 years," White said. "There
will be a lot of ethical and moral arguments, but I think they are
inappropriate.  What we are trying to do here is to prolong life.
The human spirit or soul is within the physical structure of the
brain. I don't think it's in your left arm or anywhere else." 

However, he admitted the definition of brain death would have to be
altered to allow bodies, possibly those in a persistent vegetative 
state in which there was still some brain stem activity, to be used
as donors." ....

"Peter Hamlyn, a leading neurosurgeon at St Bartholomew's Hospital
in London, who helped set up the British Brain and Spine
Foundation, said the work was cruel and irrelevant. "...
[comment: and penning animals for life in order to slaughter them
is not, I suppose?]...

"Your head might as well be in a jar as attached to another body.
The fact that it is tied to a body acting simply as a pump would
just be an inconvenience because you would have to drag the body
around. [comment: he completely ignores the fact that successfully
reattaching the spinal column may well be only a matter of time and
technique]

"There might be a few cranks who would want it done, but for normal
people the whole point of having a brain is that it interacts with
the body," he said. 

Other ethicists and theologians are worried that the technology
could be exploited for cosmetic life extension. [ comment:
"cosmetic life extension"? Sounds like an oxymoron to me]

"It is indicative of the disastrous route that Western medicine is 
taking," said Richard Nicholson, editor of the Bulletin of Medical 
Ethics. "Is any individual so important to society that we should 
tolerate attempts to lengthen their existence in a way which most
people would find abhorrent?" 

David Jenkins, the former Bishop of Durham, said he was concerned
by the social trend represented by head transplant research. "I do
get more and more alarmed that people refuse to see limits. To try
to put a head on a different body would be totally destructive of
the personality. I would sooner be totally dead than half and
half."

	I don't understand how one can compare one infinite number with another 
(such as an infinite volume of space and an infinite number of stars).  If 
there is an infinite space per star, it seems possible that it won't get 
filled.  One infinite amount does not necessarily equal another.  For 
instance, how big is an infinite amount of space squared?  Is it bigger 
than a "regular" infinite amount?

Clemens Pittino <pittino@magnet.at> asked about the copy paradox:

> If you digitize your brain, you can copy it exactly. Who am I, if I
> would let run my mind on 2 hosts ?

	There are many forms of the copy paradox idea.  The most
popular deals with the idea of a "transporter" in the Science Fiction
Stories of Star Trek so I'll give what I feel to be the answer to this
issue based on the transporter idea.

	For discussion purposes, I'll use the names Dup and Trans.
Dup1 walked into a non destructive transporter and walked out of this
same machine unchanged, yet scanned.  Then an identical Dup2 walked
out of the reproducer part some distance away from this scanning
machine.  Trans1 walked into a similar scanning machine but was
completely taken apart atom by atom before an identical Trans2 was
constructed out of different yet identical stuff some distance away.

	The problem of what it would be like is similar to the problem
of other minds.  Of course if you are Dup1 you will be extremely
annoyed at the way Dup2 continually says he is the real Dup.  And of
course you wouldn't want to be Trans1 because he was destroyed even
though Trans2 claims he is the same.  If you were Trans2 you would
have no way of directly consciously knowing or remembering that Trans1
was destroyed and believe that you were the original transported
Trans.  Also If you were Dup2 you would believe that you were the
original Dup and Dup1 would equally annoy you by claiming he was the
real Dup.

	The primary answer is, if you are the same, you will not be
able to tell the difference between the two, including the particular
feelings and memories being felt by the two now separate copies.  If
you were dup1, you would feel exactly the same as dup2.

	"Then what is it that is you?" one may ask.  I believe, it is
your state or shape.  If you organized the proper stuff(*1) into this
proper shape it would be you.  Whether it was done a googol years ago,
whether it was done in a googol years from now or whether it was done
in a newly created similar universe different and completely separate
from our own and whether it was done a googol times here today.  (Even
though you may have to be like God to be able to do this or at least
to come up with the complete information required to duplicate someone
that was say cremated 1000 years ago.)  This shape of you is self
existent.  This fact about you can't be created by any God nor
destroyed by even the universe ceasing to exist.  It is a logically
necessary fact that you can exist.  Your existence proves this.

	Dup1 and Dup2, after living a day, their state would start to
diverge.  Hence, they would become different people.  This would be
similar to the way you are different than the you that existed
yesterday because of your new memories and other changes.  To the
degree that we are the same as our parents, we are the same person.
To the degree that we are in a different state, we are different
people.

	One of the primary reasons we are unsatisfied with such an
answer has a lot to do with the philosophical "problem of other
minds".  We simply can't "eff" what it is like to be us, and we
thereby can't know if our copy is really indistinguishable from
ourselves.  Maybe the copy is some unfeeling (or "absent qualia")
zombie simply acting the same?  If we can solve the problem of other
minds by discovering what qualia and consciousness really are
objectively we can eliminate such dilemmas or "conundrums", or
"paradoxes".  We simply must be able to "eff" the ineffable.  Such
(mind melding?) will solve all these problems.

	I believe that we will be able to some day augment our brain
with generic qualia experiencing machinery similar to that which we
have now that can reproduce the consciousness going on in others
brains, by monitoring and duplicating whatever activity is producing
such, in our own brains.  To me such direct conscious communication or
"effing" is a much easier thing to do than the duplicator/transporter
we are talking about.  Discovering what qualia/consciousness are and
then effing such in this way is surely easier than creating a
duplicator.  (Maybe we'll have to wait until God gives us such "mind
meld" technology?  ;) If you have such an augmented brain you will be
able to connect up with or monitor the other Dup in such a way that
you are conscious of both what you are experiencing and what the other
Dup is experiencing.  Such would solve the problem of other minds,
eliminate the "conundrum" or the "paradox", and allow you to say yes
that other Dup is indeed the same as me.  ("Your different than me
because thats not the way salt tastes to me!", you may say when
monitoring my brain with your newly augmented brain.)

	So, there is no copy paradox, or even problem of other minds,
if we can achieve the ability to eff what others are experiencing.

(*1) If you insist on something mysterious or ghost like being
included in this "stuff" that you are made of the argument still
applies although at a slightly different level(*2).  If one of you
exists it simply proves it is possible for you to exist.  I think you
could create another identical universe with the same set of souls no
matter what the soul is.  I believe it will be possible to duplicate
whatever it is that is us.  Even if you have to be like God to do it.

(*2) Unleas of course you believe in some sort of you that is not
duplicatable.  But this is an extremely pessimistic view since if your
not duplicatable then you are probably also not fixable or improvable
and you will forever be stuck with being less than or equal to what
you are today.

Alife fans may indeed want to check this out.  But alife is about
as small a fraction of economic information analysis as it is
of engineer's use of computers.  My point is that dominant
mainstream economist is very information centered, just as 
standard engineering practice is now very computer centered.

Guns? Real or otherwise? Haven't seen those. What's the FTC, some US
Federal agency?

The fact that a tactic works is not always a reason to use it, the way
Saddam Hussein runs Iraq obviously works, he's still got his job unlike Mr.
Bush. That doesn't make it OK (I think). The people at Netscape problably
aren't angels but at least they don't treaten my free choice in Operating
systems and PC-applications.

I use OS/2 for most 'small' stuff and AIX (IBM UNIX) for 'big' stuff.
Haven't been able to find a good mailer for OS/2 (something that can beat
Eudora) so I use a Win 3.X box for that. OS/2 is pretty good, but you don't
find as many nice app's on the net. The same for games, most are designed
to run under DOS or W-95 (which is basically DOS with a nice shell). I
really regret that IBM didn't market OS/2 correctly since it has always
been (technically) better than windows.

Was is not the US governement that broke up the monopoly of Standard Oil,
thus ending a monopoly that consumers and the competition could not break?
How about the diamond monopoly that DeBeers company has, they own more than
95% of all the diamond mines in the world and are working hard to buy those
that remain, they have been dictating prices for a century or so now. Their
monopoly can only be broken by a new technology (Like MNT) that makes
diamond mining obsolete, but even then they may buy the patents of such a
discovery and thus keep control.
It is well known that Shell (Royal Dutch Oil) frequently buys patents for
solarenergy and hydrogen fuelcells and puts them in a vault.

Anbody that tries to make a M$ competing product will be aquired by MS or
will be cut of with technical incompatibility tricks. That failing, the
legal team of MS will create some clever licensing article that makes it
illegal for end-users to effectively use such a product in combination with
any MS-product (they tried that against Netscape).

 >and MS has never innovated in its life.

Here we agree 100%
And in spite of this they (effectively) have a monopoly, so talent and good
product are apparently only (a small) part of the equation. Carpet-bomming
marketing technique also has a lot to do with it.

Daniel, with all due respect, why do you have such an unshakeble faith in
the free market mechanism as the best, only and ultimate resource
allocator? Isn't it a bit dogmatic? While free market is probably the best
system in many cases it is _far_ from perfect and in some situations other
mechanisms can complement it. There's nothing wrong with aknowledging that
some things can't and won't be solved by market forces.

The idea that there is a single method/solution/answer to all problems is
(IHMO) denying the complexity of some of those problems. How much would
people have been willing to pay to win the cold war? I don't think the
zillion dollars it cost. But it was money well spent considering the
alternative and, in retrospect, maybe even a good investment with the
technology spinn-off and the Chinese market opening up and such...

I read something about the 'idea future exchange', anyone have an URL? Thanx.

You can't use these weird quantum effects to make your clock and define time 
because you could find a relationship between any two instances in time with  
them, and that means there would be only one instant in time, and that means  
your clock and time itself become useless concepts.

All a red filter does is absorb blue light and transmit the red, it does not  
shift spectral lines. Do you really think that intergalactic gas can produce 
a redshift from X rays to radio waves if the gas is red? Do I really need to  
explain this? 
         

      >Philosophy has priority -- physics used to be known as  'natural

Some fields of knowledge are so little understood that we don't even know the  
correct questions to ask, so we can't yet use the full scientific method on  
them. It does no good to tell me not to think about such problems because 
they aren't scientific enough, I can't ignore them, the problems are just too
interesting. Physics was once like that, so was Astronomy, and that's why 
they were then part of Philosophy, but no more, they have graduated to a 
science. 

We just don't know how to use the full scientific method very well on some   
things, not yet, so we do the best we can, it's called philosophy.

Dicke claimed to have found a very flatten sun, a difference in the diameter  
of 1 part in 2500, and that was 250 times larger than anybody else had ever 
found. If true this would indeed be disastrous for Einstein but his results  
are not generally accepted today because nobody has been able to repeat them.

Why would you want to strike the Second Law of Thermodynamics? All it says is 
that entropy always increases, nothing pessimistic in that, it would  only be 
so if the total amount of information was constant. We'd be in very  bad 
shape if Entropy did not increase, that's the very definition of the heat 
death of the Universe, but as long as entropy ALWAYS increases infinite life 
is possible.

I know I haven't addressed all the points you raised, but life is too short 
to get into a theology debate about what the measurements unmeasurable 
photons must have, UFO's, assassination conspiracies theories, water powered 
cars or the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin.

Not the a reference to recent work, but a review of his earlier work:

Neurol Res 1996 Jun;18(3):194-203 

The isolation and transplantation of the brain. An
historical perspective emphasizing the surgical solutions to
the design of these classical models.

White RJ, Albin MS, Verdura J, Takaoka Y, Massopust LC, Wolin LR,
Locke GE, Taslitz N, Yashon D

Division of Neurosurgery, Cleveland, Ohio 44109-1998, USA. 

Following an historical review of earlier attempts to develop
separated head and brain preparations and their contributions to
modern-day understanding of the neurophysiology and neurochemistry of
the central nervous system, the experiments that eventually led to the
first successful total isolation of the mammalian brain are presented.
The operative strategies emphasizing the anatomical and physiological
problems requiring solution that resulted in vascular and neurogenic
separation from the parent body and cephalon are described. The
innovative engineering concepts that were utilized in the design of
miniaturized equipment to maintain the isolated brain in a living
state under conditions of cross circulation, extracorporeal artificial
perfusion and transplantation are elaborated. Investigations employing
isolated brain and cephalic preparation documenting tissue substrate
requirements, metabolic and rheological conditions prevailing at
various low temperatures and the immunologically privileged state of
the separated organ are briefly presented. The unique opportunities
these isolated brain models offer for study are emphasized as well as
the complexity of their surgical preparation, which, to date, has
limited their universal applications.

Yes, I'm using "guns" here metonymously for "government"; the FTC is
the US Federal Trade Commission--the agency responsible for preventing
free trade in our fair country.  The Department of Justic (DOJ) is
also looking at Microsoft for the hideous crime of freely negotiating
contracts with PC-makers.  We have to put a stop to that, of course.

No, it was not, though most American history books will tell you that.
When the US passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, Standard's market share
was less than 60% and /falling/, having once been 90%.  This happened
because of agile competitors, not guns.  Don't confuse the politician's
excuse for a law with the actual results of a law.  The former is what
gets written in hitory books, but the latter is what really counts.

Patents are government-enforced monopolies, not free-market ones.

December 21, 1996

"EDMONTON JOURNAL"

Getting tired of your body? Why not try a new one.

ALASDAIR PALMER
Sunday Telegraph

"The Holy Father has never voiced any objection. As far as I
know, there isn't a problem with the operation from a theological or
an ethical point of view."

Dr. Robert White, professor of neurosurgery at the Case University in
Cleveland, Ohio, speaks with authority, both on surgery and on the
Pope.

A frequent visitor to the Vatican, White is a member of the
Pontifical Academy of Sciences. He helped to set up the John Paul II 
committee on medical ethics.

So it is a surprise to discover "the operation" White refers to is
the removal of one person's head and its surgical attachment to
someone else's body.

The most common reaction to the idea of a head transplant is not=
merely a question of 'How could anyone do that?' but 'Why would any
sane person want to?

"That's a very uninformed reactions," says White, a sprightly
70-year-old. "We really have to grow up -- and we will. There was a very similar
reaction when organ transplants first became possible nearly 40 years
ago.

"And I have no doubt that within the next 50 years head transplants
will be as common as kidney transplants are today."

White is not joking. In fact, he believes that he could perform the
operation successfully now.

It is more than 20 years since he transplanted the head of one
monkey on to the body of another.

"The monkey could see. His eyes followed you round the room.
He could eat, and if you were stupid enough to put your finger
in his mouth, he would have bitten it off."

Unfortunately, the monkey could not move. He was paralysed from the
neck down.

"How to connect up the spinal cord to the new head is a difficulty I
haven't tried to solve. It's an immensely complex problem. But it will
be solved, in my view, and before too long."

You might think that in the absence of knowing how to "connect up the
spinal cord," head transplants would be of little use. According to
White, you'd be profoundly wrong.

"When I was working on transplanting the heads of monkeys in the
Seventies, my interests were those of pure research: it was the
only way
to study important aspects of brain-functioning and chemistry.

"For instance, I discovered the enormous benefits to the brain of
temperature reduction. At normal temperature your brain would die in
about three minutes if starved of oxygen. But at 15 C, I could shut
off oxygen and blood for half an hour and there would be no adverse
effects."

Understandably, animal rights activists are not fond of White. He
faced death threats and needed FBI protection.

"I do not accept any criticism from those people. They have behaved
disgracefully to me and my family. I cannot accept that animals are
comparable to people."

You can recognize that point, yet still feel uneasy when looking at
the footage of the transplanted monkey's head. The information White
gained from that experiment was clearly interesting but hardly
significant enough, in terms of the possible benefit to humans, to
show that yuk is not the appropriate response to it.

But White insists the operations "have real life-saving potential."


White believes that "total body transplantation," as he prefers to
call it, could help quadraplegics enormously. "They die from multiple
organ failure. They are not thought to be suitable targets for organ
donation. If we could give them a new body, then they could live much
longer."

Already, people have put their names down for White's operation, in
the hope that some day soon, he will be allowed to perform it.

Craig Vetovitz, left paralysed from the neck down by a diving
accident, would like to be the first. Vetovitz stresses he is "well aware of the
risks. But if it can promote and accelerate this type of research . .
 I'd be prepared to do it."

While Vetovitz and others like him might be willing to undergo
White's pioneering surgery, no one in authority will let him perform it, at
least not in the U. S.

For now, there is no chance of ethics committees approving it,
White concedes. He does not think this is because the operation raises
serious ethical issues.

"I would not be performing experiments on people. I have already
done the appropriate dissections on human cadavers."

So what's the problem? "The media circus that would surround the
operation if it was performed in America. That and the fact that we
do not yet know how long someone with a total body transplant would
survive."

But White says that was the problem with heart transplants when
they were first done.


White might simply decide to do the operation outside the U.S. He has
been invited to the Ukraine. "They have very fine neurosurgical
facilities," he notes. And they also have no ethics committees.

"Sure," adds White. "But ethics are really not the issue. We're talking
about saving lives here."

Others are not so sure. Brian Jennett, who recently retired as
professor of neurosurgery in Glasgow, is sceptical of the value of White's
research.

"As far as I can see, this kind of operation, whether on animals or
humans, does not have much value in terms of furthering knowledge.


"And the crucial question is: 'What is its practical result in
terms of benefit to the patient?' I haven't seen any evidence that there is a
significant benefit."

As a committed Catholic, White would be deeply concerned if the
Catholic Church was opposed to head transplants. It is unlikely to be
a problem, he says.

"The Church accepted the concept of brain death. It is now
recognized that if the brain is unable to function at all, then the person is
clinically dead, even if his or her body is intact, and can function.
Brain-dead people will be the source of the bodies to be transplanted
on to new heads."

But what about God? "Head transplantation does not violate any
fundamental theological principle," says Dr. Helen Watt of the
Catholic Lincare Centre for Medical Ethics.

"The religious objections are essentially practical. They centre on
such things as the effects on the donor's relatives of his body being
attached to a different head."

It is easy to imagine those effects could be traumatic. It would, at
the very least, be extremely disorienting to have (say) your wife's
body used in a head transplant operation -- particularly if the
problem of connecting up the spinal cord was solved, so the new
individual could be as= mobile as the old one.

Who would the new person be? Your wife with a new head? Or a
different person who had been given her body?

These questions raise profound questions about the nature of
personal identity. White does not have much time for them.

"I think everyone accepts that personality lies in the brain."

He also recognizes a person's identity is not exhausted by his
brain. "The soul defines identity."

However basic the contradiction may seem to others, White does not
experience any tension between his religious and scientific
outlooks.

"Operating on the brain is an almost mystical experience.

"When you start to understand it, you just cannot regard it as a
wholly natural product. When I look at this 3 pound lump of
white jelly, and think what it can do . . . it amazes me."

Well, inspired by him.  Actually I previewed the manuscript for _The
Transparent Society_ and I liked most of the ideas.  It's less a
coherent logical argument like the Communist Manifesto or the
Libertarian Party platform than an expression of attitude and an attempt
to change how people think about the issues.  Like some of Freeman
Dyson's books.

My blurbification of attitude;

Freedom is more important than privacy.

Privacy owes more to freedom than freedom owes to privacy.

Security may come from arms races, but probably not pleasantly or
stably.

Better to live with a press corps and no constitution than a
constitution and no press corps.

If you try to ban something that restricts it to the powerful and
criminals.  If you try to legally restrict the flow of information 
that means the powerful and criminals will have more information 
about citizens than vice versa.  This is not good.

I don't fully agree with your discussion, although I believe that it

I'm not sure what you mean by "what it would be like".  It seems quite
easy to me to imagine what it would be like to be any of the people
(who are alive) in this experiment (assuming I were the person who was
involved at the beginning).  It is hardly more difficult than it is for
me to imagine what it will be like for me to go to the gym this afternoon,
or undertake any new experience.

This does not seem similar to the problem of what it would be like to be
another mind.

> Of course if you are Dup1 you will be extremely
> annoyed at the way Dup2 continually says he is the real Dup.

No, I wouldn't, for two reasons.  First, Dup2 would not say such a thing
in those words.  He would recognize that the whole issue of "the real
Dup" is poorly defined in this situation.  He would argue that he had
as much claim to being a continuation of the original as Dup1 does, and
Dup1 would fully agree with him.  Each would recognize the symmetry of
the situation and each would fully agree about the facts.  There would
be no annoyance at the other.

> And of

I had the impression that "Trans1 walked into a similar scanning machine".
I would have no objection to being the person who walked into that
scanning machine, so long as the disassembly was quick and painless.
(I'm unclear on the difference between Trans and Trans1.)

Trans2 would not claim he was the same, because he would know that such
simple-seeming claims rely on our intuition from a world where copying is
not possible, and are inappropriate in this situation.  He would, rather,
claim to have as justifiable a claim to being a continuation of Trans1
as a person who wakes up in the morning does to being a continuation of
the person who fell asleep the night before.

Assuming you are aware of the workings of the machine, you would know
these things even without having directly consciously experienced
the disassembly of Trans1 (or your own assembly, for that matter).
You would not believe that simple questions about whether you are the
same as someone else have simple answers until you have defined your
terms more precisely.

There would be no annoyance, as I described earlier.  Both parties are
fully informed and agree about the situation.

I'm not sure that the concept of trying to tell the difference between
the two (from the inside!) is meaningful.  It calls to mind an image
in which our consciousness first exists inside dup1, then flies over
to the inside of dup2 where we poke around and see whether things seem
about the same or not.

Actually each of dup1 and dup2 has their own fully integrated
consciousness.  They start off in the same state and immediately begin
to diverge.  I am sure we all agree about this.

This definition has a couple of problems.  It is a bit misleading to use
the term "shape" because that often refers to the external boundaries of
your physical being, in other words, the shape of your body.  Your term
"state" is more reasonable, but the problem is that the state is constantly
changing.  "You" can't be defined as any one state, or else you would
only be you for one tiny instant.  You need to describe what kinds of
variation of the state are permissible in order to still have it be "you".

Their state would start to diverge instantly.

I was following this OK until you mentioned our parents.  We are not the
same people as our parents.  This is not at all analogous to the way that
we are the same people as we were yesterday.  There is no continuity of
brain state from parent to child, among humans.  Maybe this analogy could
work with a race which reproduced by fission, like amoebas, or like we
will become once uploading or duplication is possible.

For myself, the answers I find are completely satisfying, and I don't
see that it has much to do with the problem of other minds.  Since we
are dealing with duplicates, the minds at the moment of duplication or
identical and there is no otherness.

> We simply can't "eff" what it is like to be us, and we

Not sure what "eff" means here, but if it refers to some form of
perception, it is odd that you would claim that we can't tell what it is
like to be us.  Most people would say the opposite, that we can *only*
tell what it is like to be ourselves, but that we can't tell what it is
like to be someone else.

> Maybe the copy is some unfeeling (or "absent qualia")
> zombie simply acting the same?

No more reason to suppose that than to suppose that I am a zombie.  The
duplicate is structurally identical to me.

Besides, nobody takes seriously the prospect that other people are
zombies.  This is not what I think of as the problem of other minds.
Rather, that is the problem of what it is qualitatively like to be someone
else, how their sense of self differs from our own.  Again, in the case
of a duplicate we have every reason to believe that at the moment of
duplication the qualia are in fact identical for the two duplicates.

It's not clear to me how mind reading or mind melding would really solve
anything related to duplications.  I suppose it would put to rest the
fears that other people may be zombies, but that is not something I take
seriously.  It would presumably also confirm that the mental states at
the moment of duplication are matches, which would certainly be expected
given that the brain states are the same.  It would therefore rule out some
bizarre nonphysical theories of brain behavior (like God breathing our
thoughts or something), but these are unlikely to be taken seriously
even without mind reading.

Some quick notes on this last paragraph..

"Light-pressure", if what you mean is actually the 
Poynting-Robertson effect, has effect only on small particles,
ie micron-sized particles.

Einstein didn't "predict" Mercury's perihelion advance, it was
known. He used his GR to explain it.

And the dust in our solar system is not really a "rotating accretion
disk of particles." I worte a long essay on dust evolution in the
universe here:

http://www.amara.com/ftpstuff/dustevolve.txt

with some new text on interplanetary dust from results that were given 
at Exo-zodiacal dust workshop at NASA-Ames last week. The solar system 
dust cloud is very complex with lots of structures (bands, trails, 
resonant rings, wakes, etc.)


Here's my solar oblateness text.  (Copyright Amara Graps 1997).


-----------------------------------------------------------------
Einstein's General Theory of Relativity and Solar Oblateness
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction.

One of the big tests for Einstein's General Theory of Relativity was
whether a planetary orbit would drift, or precess, when that object was
very close to a large mass. At that point, according to Einstein's
theory, the Newtonian theory of gravitation should fail to obey the
inverse-square law of mutual attraction. The reason the Newtonian theory
of gravitation fails is because the properties of space-time in the
vicinity of the large mass is modified (its magnitude is changed) by the
presence of the gravitational field of the large mass.

Models/Theories/Controversies.

Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun. When it's at perihelion (the
spot in it's orbit closest to Sun), it will be most affected by the
Sun's gravitational attraction according to General Relativity, and
Mercury will never repeat it's orbit exactly -- the position of its
perihelion is no longer constant.

If one accounts for the gravitational effect of the nearby planets on
Mercury using Newton's gravitational equation, then Mercury's major axis
of its orbit still has 43.03 seconds-of-arc perihelion precession rate
per century that cannot be explained. Einstein, in 1915, showed that his
General Theory of Relativity altered the gravitation equation by just
enough to explain the unexplained portion of the motion of Mercury's
perihelion. The motion of the planet Mercury, was one of the first 
successes of Einstein's theory.

But what if the Sun's shape had an effect on Mercury's perihelion
precession rate? If the Sun were not a perfect sphere, but had an
equatorial bulge (i.e., was "oblate"), that would cause Mercury's orbit
to precess slightly. Then Einstein's Theory would not "neatly"
explain the observations, and modifications to his theory would be
needed.

How could our Sun be oblate? Rotating gaseous balls should be slightly
oblate, so that the poles of the ball "flatten" and the equator of the
ball "bulges". Astronomers have thought that this simple process should
cause our Sun to be shaped as a (slightly) oblate sphere.

In 1967,  Robert Dicke proposed the concept of the shape of the Sun as
an oblate sphere affecting Mercury's perihelion precession rate. In fact
at that time, it was already thought that the Sun wasn't a perfect sphere.
But is the Sun oblate "enough" to result in the General Theory of
Relativity not fitting the observations? According to Dicke at that
time, the answer was 'yes'.

In the 1960s, Dicke and Goldenberg claimed to have detected a much larger
solar equatorial bulge than the solar models predicted. The solar bulge
was large enough to destroy the neat agreement between General
Relativity and Mercury's orbit, but the solar oblateness was not large
enough to permit a Newtonian explanation.

Dicke presented a scalar-tensor theory of General Relativity, in which
only about 93% of the observed excess rate of perihelion advance could be
explained by relativistic effects (as opposed to Einstein's General
Theory of Relativity, which neatly explains the entire excess perihelion
advance). The remainder could be supplied by the quadrupole moment of
gravitational field which arises due to an oblate shape of the Sun.

The direct way of measuring oblateness in the Sun is to take the ratio
of the radius of the poles and of the equator. But the measurement is
very difficult because the Sun is a large gaseous ball, so where exactly
is the Sun's limb at these locations? In addition, due to observational
wavelength selection effects, astronomers see higher photospheric layers
towards the limb, an effect called "limb darkening." And the Sun's shape
changes over time, by very tiny (but measurable) amounts. 

Techniques to Investigate the Solar Oblateness

Solar physicists have created a collection of ingenious methods to measure
the shape of the Sun. For example, one can measure the rotation of the
interior by measuring modes of oscillating sound waves. This method uses
the frequency splittings of the normal (spherical) modes of oscillation
to give a measure of the internal solar rotation.

Today, using helioseismic instruments, one can also observe the Sun's
limb at the equator and the poles at a sensitivity of 10 feet (i.e. one
can measure gases move by that amount). 

---------------------end of my solar oblateness text   --------

If you search on keywords "Solar Oblateness" on the NASA ADS abstracts, 
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/ads_abstracts.html  

you will turn up hundreds of references from the last 10-20
years. This is something that scientists are interested in, and
working on.

The following is an abstract from results given at the American Geophysical
Union conference last December 1996 by Jeffrey Kuhn, and some members
of my Stanford Solar Oscillations Group which has a helioseismology
instrument (Michelson Doppler Imager) on the SOHO spacecraft.  

The result from this work shows that the sun is almost a perfect sphere. 
The SoHO/MDI helioseismology instrument found that the Sun's
shape is distorted by only about one mile of its nearly 1 
million-mile diameter.

---------------------------------------------------------
SoHO and the Solar Oscillations Imager Experiment Measure Tiny
Changes in the Shape of the Sun

Jeffrey R. Kuhn (National Solar Observatory/Michigan State
University), Rock Bush (Stanford), Rick Bogart (Stanford), Luiz Sa
(Stanford), Xania Scheick (Jackson Community College, MI), Phil
Scherrer (Stanford).

>From the constant environment of space, the SOHO/MDI experiment
provides researchers with the longest series of finely detailed
electronic images of the sun we have ever obtained. Because the
spacecraft is above the blurring effects of the atmosphere, and with
the help of sophisticated computer analysis, it is possible to
measure exceedingly small changes in the shape of the sun. These
changes are caused by "oscillations" analogous to terrestrial
earthquakes. Other ground measurements have observed such
oscillations before, but never have we been able to actually detect
the shape of the sun fluctuate because of these sound waves. The
SOHO/MDI experiment is able to detect the edge of the sun move by
about 10 feet. This sensitivity is equivalent to measuring the size
of a quarter placed at the edge of the moon as seen from the surface
of the earth.

---------------------------------------------------------

I hope this provides some food for thought.

Ok, wait a moment while I don my impressive mathematicians robe
(complete with chalk dust)... :-)

Infinities are tricky, but if you know the rules and are a bit careful
you can handle them with no danger. Yes, there are differently "sized"
infinities, some much "larger" than others. But in this case it is
much simpler.

In the star example, let's say there are around 1 star per cubic
lightyear. That means that on a sphere of radius r there will be
around 4 Pi r^2 stars. The intensity of a star at distance r is L/r^2
where L is a constant (I assume all stars are equally bright now, for
simplicitys sake). This means that the 4 pi r^2 stars on the sphere
around us will shine with a total power of 4 Pi L - the two r^2 terms
cancel each other. So the total luminosity from a spherical shell
around us is independent of it's radius. This means that if we get one
unit of light from all stars 1 lightyear away, we will get one unit
from the stars 2 lightyears away, one from all stars 3 lightyears
away, and so on. As you sum up the contributions from all the shells
the sum get's larger and larger. And if you assume an infinite
universe you will have to sum up the contributions of ever more remote
stars, and the total luminosity will become larger than any finite
luminosity.

If you want a real in depth treatment of infinities, I suggest reading
up on basic calculus and perhaps set theory.

<generalization>
I'm not sure Brin is "distrustful" of encryption as such, so much
as he is disdainful of the cypherpunk community in particular, and
frankly I tend to agree.  As much as I admire encryption technology
itself, and welcome its consequences such as electronic trade and
elimination of copyrights, the community of cypherpunks itself has
always struck me as a bit juvenile and paranoid.  I don't have that
big a hard-on for privacy, and most of the people I've met who do
just aren't as interesting as people who are less concerned. 
</generalization>

It is also worth noting that the technologies of strong encryption
are just as useful at ensuring openness as privacy.

Actually, just the other day, The Learning Channel had a program on
entitled "Unnatural Science" which discussed Dr. White's research in
addition to other controversial topics such as cloning and germ-line gene
therapy.  They had video of the transplanted monkey head, I believe the
monkey survived for a month (not sure about the amount of time but it was
significant) although it couldn't move it's new body.

Dr. White was forced to stop his research in this area due to death
threats by animal rights activists and a lack of funding.  He is
considering resuming his research on "total body transplants," as he
prefers to call it, at a Ukrainian neurosurgery facility.  You can read a
brief article that contains most of the same information at:

http://www.southam.com/edmontonjournal/archives/122196head.html

A quick search of medline turned up the following articles, which someone
with an interest and access to a medical library might be able to look up
(and summarize for the list - please!)

"Selective hypothermic perfusion of canine brain." White RJ, Takaoka Y;
Neurosurgery 1996 Dec; 39(6):1271

"The isolation and transplantation of the brain. An historical perspective
emphasizing the surgical solutions to the design of these classical
models." White RJ, et al.; Neurol Res 1996 Jun; 18(3):194-203

"Postulates for brain transplantation. [Editorial]" White RJ; Surg Neurol
1991 Feb; 35(2):164

"Brain transplantation." White RJ; Surg Neurol 1985 Apr; 23(4):449

"Primate cephalic transplantation: neurogenic separation, vascular
association." White RJ, et al; Transplant Proc 1971 Mar; 3(1):602-604 

There were some additional articles that looked interesting, but these
seem to be the most relevant.  The first article, I assume, is regarding
the short-term cooling of the brain during surgery, but I wonder if it
would be at all applicable to cryonic research?  I believe the final
article is the one in which Dr. White reports the full body 
transplantation.

I just finished reading Moravec's "Mind Children".  I was intrigued by
Moravec's idea of robots gradually building a"real world simulation database"
to help them adapt to the real world without constantly having to reinvent the
wheel every time they are confronted with a situation.  A good idea, which did
not seem to occur to Moravec, would be to have each robot in the world to
download its "simulation database" to a central robot database every night (or
week or whatever).  At this central robot database location, the aggregate
experiences of every robot in existence (and those no longer existing) would be
downloaded to all robots every night while they replenished their power
supplies or experienced downtime.

This idea of a central robot database would exponentially increase the rate at
which robots "evolved".  Where as one robot might take years to compile a
database of experiences sufficient to achieve a certain level of sophistication
with regards to "dealing with the real world", a million robots worldwide might
achieve this objective in a single day.  An analogy would be if you had a
million humans striving to achieve their doctorate in astrophysics.  As the
human condition is now, each would have to spend years compiling the knowledge
base necessary to deserve such a degree, but if they could share their
knowledge they could achieve the objective in a much smaller amount of time.
Actually, in such a situation, students could change their approach by having
one group focus specifically on one aspect of astrophysics (say quantum
mechanics) while others targeted other areas (say symmetries in various
theories) to vastly increase the rate of knowledge accumulation by reduced
levels of redundancy.

I don't want to sound the convinced jerk I am, but I actually wrote on
the 22nd of October;
About body transplants using cloning to create new bodies, it's not such
a futuristic achievement. Did you know that there has already been body
transplants
is monkeys and dogs? And that there are plans to try it on humans on a
near future? Besides, human cloning can be technically possible in a
very short time (some claim that it is already possible in the present).

Anyway, about the procedure, I think we should look at other
alternatives. Body transplants are not only too dangerous - whatever the
scientific progresses are -, but
they are also extremely demanding in terms of resources.

See ya, sorry for having to point out this detail but I also like some
credit to myself once in a while,

ECONOMIC MEANS TO FREEDOM - PART V


ALTERNATIVE CURRENCY SYSTEM
===========================

by Frederick Mann

						11/4/97
Introduction
------------

This is a proposal for an alternative currency
system to be developed, launched, and implemented
as a matter of urgency.

One of the reasons for urgency is that the
international monetary/financial system could
be a house of cards.  The banksters in control
may be able to prop up the system to recover
from the current "Asian crisis," but they
may not be able to keep their system going
indefinitely.

I propose that the new system be roughly based
on the ideas of E.C. Riegel as described in 'The
New Approach to Freedom' and 'Free Enterprise
Money.'

Riegel called this type of system a "split barter
system."  Currently there are numerous "barter
clubs" in operation.  Strictly speaking, they are
generally not barter clubs in that they utilize
some "barter currency" as medium of exchange.
Some call this type of trade "reciprocal trade."
It is characterized by utilizing a medium of
exchange other than those issued by coercive
political agancies.

This is the fifth in a series of articles on the
Economic Means to Freedom.  The first four articles
are available at <http://www.buildfreedom.com/eco1.htm>.
The emphasis of the Economic Means to Freedom is on:
(a) Building freedom, rather than "fighting tyranny"
or "fighting for freedom";
(b) Bringing about a massive shift of economic power
into the hands of individuals.

information in accordance with the right to free
speech.  Nothing in this article is to be interpreted
as legal, accounting, tax, currency, banking, or
investment advice.  Anyone seeking such advice
should consult a properly qualified and accredited
professional.  All readers of this article are
emphatically advised to obey all laws on Earth
and in the Universe to the letter.


1. Currency
-----------

"The pinnacle of power today is the power to
issue money." -- Thomas H. Greco Jr., author
of 'New Money for Healthy Communities' see
Appendix 2.

The currency of the new system could be called the
"Exchange Dollar" or "E$."  Each member in the
system has the power to issue currency or E$s.
Riegel called this the "individual money power"
-- see Appendix 1.

Currency is created when an individual wants to
buy something, but doesn't have the necessary E$s
to pay for it.  In this case, a transaction takes
place, the buyer's net balance decreases, and the
seller's net balance increases.

Currency is redeemed ("destroyed") when a buyer
with a positive balance buys from a seller with
a negative balance.

A principle of the system is that the total E$
balances of everyone in the system will always
be zero -- the total positive balances always
equal the total negative balances.  Hence the
E$ is inflation-proof.

The currency is backed by:
(a) An initial 80% guarantee -- see below;
(b) The expectation that those with negative
balances will produce and sell products and
services to eliminate their negative balances;
(c) Default insurance -- see below;
(d) Allowing negative balances based on the
established trustworthiness of debtors -- see
below;
(e) The pledging of assets as collateral to
safeguard large negative balances -- see below.

For more information on E.C. Riegel and alternative
currencies, see Appendix 2.


2. World Business Exchange
--------------------------

The E$ system is to be managed and operated by
a group of individuals who form a business or
company called World Business Exchange (WBE).

WBE is responsible for the rules of the system,
managing and operating the system, maintaining
a system to determine creditworthiness of members,
processing transactions, providing default insurance,
etc. -- see below.

WBE should be "domiciled" in a venue, such as
Belize, which provides the greatest economic
freedom, privacy, and security.  WBE should have
no physical office or assets in its venue of
"domicile." 


3. Computer System
------------------

WBE would require a computer system to manage
and operate the system.  Ideally, all transactions
will take place via Internet.  However, it may
be necessary to allow for some transactions to
be manually presented to WBE for processing.


4. Initial Value and Guarantee
------------------------------

The initial value of the E$ could be set at FRN 1.00
(US$1.00).  During the first six months of operation
of the system, WBE could guarantee that anyone with
a positive E$ balance can exchange those E$s at a
rate of FRN 0.80 for each E$.


5. Convertibility
-----------------

World Trade Clearinghouse (WTC) could be requested
to make a market for E$s.  This would make the E$
convertible into gold, silver, platinum, and the major
currencies handled by WTC -- see <http://www.wtc-info.com/>.
[If you decide to open a WTC account, please specify
"AE001" as your sponsor.]

A major drawback of practically all other "barter
systems" (more accurately called "split barter systems"
or "business trade exchanges") and alternative currency
systems is that their currencies are not convertible
and that some members get stuck with large positive
balances they can't easily spend on products and
services they need or want.


5. Interest
-----------

I propose that interest of one-half-percent (1/2%) per
month be paid on negative balances to WBE, and that
positive balances receive one-quarter-percent (1/4%)
per month from WBE.  WBE thus earns one-quarter-percent
(1/4%) per month on all negative balances.  At the end
of every month, WBE adjusts account balances to reflect
interest payments and receipts.

It would be desirable for the E$ to not only gradually
rise in value compared to other currencies that are
being inflated, but also to at least maintain its
purchasing power.


6. Limits and Defaults
----------------------

Obviously, a weakness of the system is that someone
can buy products and services, building up a negative
balance, and then dropping out of the system and/or
disappearing.

For each member of the system, a limit negative balance
can be set, depending on the creditworthiness of the
member.  This limit can be changed from time to time
to reflect the changing creditworthiness of the member,
based on criteria to be determined.

Rules need to be specified to determine what constitutes
a default.  Members with negative balances are expected
to "pay off" or "produce off" their debit balances over
time.

Members may "pay off" debit balances by making payments
to WBE in gold, silver, platinum, or major currencies
at rates to be published by WBE on its website, or by
purchasing E$s on the "WTC market," should WTC decide
to make such a market.


7. Default Insurance
--------------------

A negative balance comes into existence when a seller
sells to a buyer who doesn't have a sufficiently positive
balance to pay for the item or service.  The seller is
effectively granting credit to the buyer.

I propose that default insurance be paid in respect of
any additional debit to a negative balance (i.e., account
becomes more negative) resulting from a transaction.

Sellers have responsibility in granting credit.  Buyers
have responsibility to eliminate their debit balances
over time.

I propose that buyer and seller each has to pay deposit
insurance to cover half of the amount involved.  The
rates will be determined by WBE depending on the trust-
and creditworthiness of the buyer and seller, respectively.

WBE will maintain a fund to cover defaults.  A member
who defaults is removed from the system and the amount
of the default is deducted from the fund.

WBE may also grant permission to others to provide
default insurance, subject to conditions to be
determined by WBE.


8. Credit- and Trustworthiness
------------------------------

A formula can be developed based on:
(a) References provided by existing members;
(b) Past performance;
(c) Other criteria to be determined by WBE.

A trust- and creditworthy index could be calculated
for each member and would be available to other
members.


9. Product/Service Listings
---------------------------

The WBE system would include a "buy register" and
a "sell register" -- respectively consisting of
products/services wanted and products/services
offered.  This would make it possible for buyers
and sellers to link up.

A classification system will be necessary and the
registers would have to be searchable.

WBE will charge a fee for listings in the register.


10. Transactions
----------------

When a buyer and a seller agree to a transaction,
each will submit the relevant and necessary
information -- including verification details --
to WBE, wherupon the transaction will be recorded
and the necessary account balance adjustments
made, subject to limits not being exceeded.


11. Escrow
----------

WBE may want to allow for escrow transactions --
see WTC <http://www.wtc-info.com/> for examples
of how this might be handled.


12. Commissions
---------------

Barter clubs typically charge a commission of
10 - 15% on transactions.  I recommend that WBE
charge a much lower commission, e.g., 2% - 5%
on the transaction amount paid by both the buyer
and the seller.  There could also be a minimum
commission and a sliding scale depending on
the transaction amount.

The commission would be higher for manually
presented transactions that would involve
data entry by WBE.


13. Membership
--------------

Any individual, group, business, or company is
eligible for membership, provided they satisfy
criteria to be determined by WBE.

One of the criteria should probably be that
coercive agencies are not eligible for membership.

There should be a small membership fee -- maybe
of the order of E$10 per month -- possibly with
discounts for advance payments.

They could also be different classes of membership,
e.g., a special class for compnanies; or even a
number oc company classes, depending on size of
company.  There could be a range of account classes,
paying different fees and commissions, with different
credit limits, etc.

(The membership for a company in a typical barter
club is several hundred dollars per year.)


14. Simulation
--------------

A skeleton computer system needs to be developed
as soon as possible, with the various percentages,
fees, etc. as variables.  Then the system needs
to be simulated, using various assumptions and
parameters, to determine workability and
viability.


15. Pledging Assets
-------------------

There needs to be provision for an individual or
business to pledge assets as collateral for credit.
This service could either be provided by WBE, or
by other institutions.


16. Privacy and Security
------------------------

Communication between members and WBE needs to be
encrypted, private, and secure.

WBE could provide a module enabling members to
communicate to each other via automatic encryption.
(WTC has such a module <http://www.wtc-info.com>.)

WBE needs to maintain confidentiality of all
transactions.  WBE needs to be "domiciled" in a
venue that requires no financial reporting.  Thus
WBE will not do any reporting to coercive agencies.

If any members want to report their transactions
to coercive agencies, that's up to them.  A
potential problem that needs to be catered for
is the eventuality of one party to a transaction
wanting to report the transaction while the other
doesn't.  At the time of entering into a transaction
this issue needs to be settled by mutual agreement.


17. Disputes, Mediation, and Arbitration
----------------------------------------

WBE, or one or more other entities, need to procide
for mediation and arbitration services to settle
disputes.


18. Additional Features
-----------------------

The WBE design team needs to analyze current barter
systems, particularly those on the Internet, to
determine what additional features need to be
incorporated in the WBE system.


19. Potential Markets for the WBE System
----------------------------------------

(a) Members of other barter clubs (WBE provides huge
advantages not available from the others);
(b) International traders;
(c) People involved in barter and countertrade;
(d) Businesses owned by freedom lovers;
(e) Freedom-loving individuals;
(f) Businesses with "expiring commodities" -- hotels,
airlines, radio stations, restaurants, etc. have
"expiring services" -- if the hotel room isn't rented
in time, the plane seat not sold, the radio advertising
not sold, the restaurant seat not occupied in time, that
potential revenue expires and can never be recovered --
"expiring service" businesses are hot prospects for the
WBE system;
(g) Businesses that would like to have access to an
additional market for their products and services;
(h) Professionals such as doctors, dentists, lawyers,
accountants, consultants, etc. with "expiring time"
-- if available time isn't being paid for by a client,
the potential revenue from that time is lost forever
and can never be recovered;
(i) People in the alternative currency movement.


20. Sales Force
---------------

WBE would need a sales force.  Sales Reps could earn
a commission, calculated as a portion of the membership
fee as well as a portion of the transaction commissions
of everyone they enroll into the WBE system.


21. Growth and Decentralization
-------------------------------

If the WBE system becomes successful, it will eventually
become necessary to have decentralized local exchanges
in addition to "headquarters."  I envisage that every
sizable city could have its own exchange.  Local members
would be able to access the product/service registers
of other exchanges and transact with anyone else in the
overall WBE system.


22. Credit Cards and ATMs
-------------------------

Once WBE has become a viable operation, it will be
relatively easy to organize the necessary interfaces
with existing systems to enable members to use credit
cards for purchases and to withdraw cash at ATMs.


23. Coinage and Banknotes
-------------------------

I envisage that WBE will not get involved in the issuance
of coins and banknotes, though this option should remain
open.  When it becomes feasible, some group or entity
needs to issue coins and notes representing an honest,
stable, inflation-proof currency.  Ideally, this needs
to be done before current monetary systems collapse.


24. Participation
-----------------

If you're interested in playing a role in the development
of the WBE system, please contact Frederick Mann at
f-prime@activist.com and/or subscribe to the Advanced
Freedom Solutions List <mailto:afs-request@maillist.dundee.net>
with "subscribe" in the body of the message.  The development
of the WBE system will be discussed on the AFS List.  Subscribe

Appendix 1 - The Money Power In You
-----------------------------------

[Extract from E.C. Riegel's 'The New Approach to Freedom']

There is a treasure buried in your consciousness.
If you will dig it up from the debris of superstition
and fear that covers it you will gain a freedom and
self-mastery that will lift your life to a higher
plane.

This is the money power in you.

The power to create money with which to purchase
wealth, health and happiness actually lies dormant
within you.  You have thought of the money power
as something remote from you and beyond your grasp.
You have dreamed of the good you could and would do
if you had money power.  You have blamed others for
not accomplishing this good.  You have blamed them
for evil economic and political conditions; for
unemployment, for poverty, for crime, for war.

It is quite logical to blame these maladies upon
the malfunction of the money power, but you have
not suspected that the money power resides in you
and because of your failure to exert it the world
is afflicted with miseries.

You have the power; you have the responsibility.
The power and responsibility to banish poverty,
unemployment, insecurity, misery and war rests
entirely with you.  You, in cooperation with
other intelligent persons, can drive economic and
political evils further and further from the area
of your life and ultimately they may be driven
from the face of the earth.  You can do this by
the money power in you, expressed first in your
own prosperity and happiness, and radiating to
others.  You can do it and you must do it.  There
is no power outside of you that can bring these
blessings to you.  Petitioning the Government is
like writing to Santa Claus.

You need no laws -- there is a law, a natural
law that governs your money power.  You need no
government aid.  You need only cooperation with
and from persons who, like you, have resolved to
exert the money power inherent in us all.  This
power in each of us needs only the recognition
and respect of our fellows to spring forth and
exert its blessings.  We need not petition
Congress and we need not waste time to denounce
bankers, for they can neither help nor hinder
our natural right to extend credit to each other,
and this is the perfect basis for a money system.

Banish monetary inferiority from your consciousness
and resolve to exert the dignity, the responsibility
and the power for personal and social betterment
that is rightly yours.  Inspire others to join
these qualities with yours and out of of it will
come mutual action that will realize money mastery
and a richer life in a better world.

FLIGHT FROM INFLATION: The Monetary Alternative
by E. C. Riegel

A very well-written explanation of the nature of
money and inflation, has a good short U.S. monetary
history, and calls for a fully-private money system.
This book was well ahead of its time (late 1940's),
and predicted the inflation that has ravaged us since,
and ultimately, the complete destruction of the dollar
[still possible with today's rampant inflation via the
credit markets]. (hardcover) 168 pg. ........ $5.95

'Flight from Inflation' is also available from Thomas

NEW MONEY FOR HEALTHY COMMUNITIES by Thomas H. Greco, Jr.

This book: 
* Is the how-to-do-it manual for local trading systems. 
* Describes exchange alternatives which reward people
fairly and reflect the reality of an abundant earth. 
* Shows how voluntary groups can revitalize local economies. 
* Outlines the true nature of money and new approaches
to transforming money.  New Money for Healthy Communities
takes the reader well beyond the rutted road of orthodox
thinking, describing in detail the essential features of
equitable and dynamic exchange systems, and shows how they
can be set up by voluntary local associations. It describes
both past and present examples of local currencies and
exchange systems, including their strengths, limitations,
and errors. It then proposes innovative ways of transforming
exchange, using mechanisms which are democratic, humane,
ecologically sound, sustainable, and implementable at the
grass-roots level.

New Money for Healthy Communities is based on thorough
research conducted by the author, a former professor of
business, over the past dozen years. It is well-illustrated,
footnoted, and indexed, and provides extensive lists of
contacts, resources, and references.

"New Money for Healthy Communities lifts the veil on the
secret power of money creation and lucidly explains how
alternative currencies can give this power back to those
who create wealth. It is destined to be a classic handbook
for community activists and all conscious people." -- Gordon
Davidson, co-author, Spiritual Politics, Builders of the Dawn.

  That's my favorite point, Doug.  There will be a network of knowledge servers
collecting experiences, generalizing algorithms, beta-testing them on some robots,
and either downloading them into robots on as-needed basis, or just performing
"remote thinking" for them.  An individual robot would be just a semi-intelligent
and semi-autonomous front-end (sensor and actuator) to the global system, with
some individual adjustments.   People are already working on different aspects
of such systems, as always, without understanding what they are doing.

  This thought occurred to me about 3 years ago, after reading Moravec's next
book on Mind Age, and I wrote a response to it, starting from the above
considerations, and taking them in a few different directions.
You can find the essay on my website.  
I have more interesting considerations now, but have not written them down,
largely because I do not get much criticism for my papers, so sharing my ideas
doesn't do much to help me advance.  I would be quite happy to discuss this
stuff if you are interested though.

Not to mention more capital than exists anywhere in the computer industry 
except at Microsoft.

And of course "someone" will have to include full Microsoft backwards 
compatability, which probably entails including the last version of 
Windows with your shiny new operating system.  Oops! That means that 
Microsoft still wins, doesn't it?

Actually, I suspect that backward compatibility will be one of the
major things that cripples MS, and one of the reasons Linux has failed
so miserably to be the contender.  When consumers start realizing that
small smart $20 products can accomplish their needs without the great
edifice of MS-DOS 7.1 (aka Windows 98) or the outrageuously bloated
X/Motif, or the process overhead of Unix, the limited application base
of new systems will matter less and less.

What will matter in the coming decades are communication standards,
data organization, and latency (assuming we manage to stay ahead of
the legislature fast enough to accomplish these things).

WARNING, POLITICAL ADVERTISEMENT:

Along those lines, I'd like to point out that West Publishing
has successfully purchased Congressman Coble, who has introduced
HR 2652, the "Collections of Information Anti-Piracy Act".  This
act basically allows West publishing to claim ownership of the
text of court opinions your taxes paid to produce and West has
collected.  To be clear, this is not talking about West's own
annotations which they already have copyrights on, or access to
their databases which they already control, but the actual text
of the court opinions themselves, which we have already paid for.
It in currently in committee.

The bill is probably unconstitutional under Feist v. Rural, but
since its language echos that of international treaties such as
the WIPO charter, it's possible that it will be found valid under
treaty despite the constitutional defect.

if u=c, then the other object sees the photons moving at

The relative speed of two photons traveling together is

A filter is not a shift.  The light of a sunset is not shifted to red
(as light from a receding star is): it's red because the blue is scattered
out of it (to make the day sky blue).  What's left is the *same* red
that forms part of the white light of day.

By the way, if the speed of light depended on the emitting body,
interferometer telescopes would not work.  They do.

<bold>"The Other Half of Hypertext" Web Software 

to be Demoed and Released for Free Use


</bold>"Father of Hypertext" Engelbart praises new web tools


-----------------------------------------------------------

Summary: New free web tools enable users to put their own comment links
into any web document.  Links of this new type are displayed, along with
the original author's links, on a one-screen graphical display showing
who agrees and disagrees with any document on the web.

-----------------------------------------------------------


Just as the original World Wide Web was created by a small group of
programmers making a tool for their own use, new web tools for "the other
half of hypertext" are being delivered for free public use by a tiny
group of hypertext advocates.  The tools will be demonstrated Thursday,
November 6, 8:45 PM, at a free evening session of the Foresight Institute
annual conference at the Hyatt Hotel in Palo Alto, California.


Foresight Institute has set up a free web site to enable web users to
engage in Critical Issues discussions.  The site's URL will be announced
at the Thursday demo.  At this new site, users can:


*  Use <bold>CritLink</bold> to add their own comment links anywhere in
the text of any web document.  For the first time, readers can "mark up"
others' documents to agree, disagree, ask questions, or make a general
comment.


*  Use <bold>CritMap</bold> to display all of a web document's links --
both links made by the original author and reactions by others -- in a
graphical display.  For the first time, readers can see, on one screen,
who has linked to a given web page, and whether they agree or disagree.


*  Use <bold>CritMail</bold>, a new version of Hypermail which takes
email discussions and converts them into web documents where quoted text
is linked to its original location.  For the first time, readers can
easily see a quote as its author meant it to appear -- in context.


Doug Engelbart -- known as a pioneer of hypertext as well as inventor of
the computer mouse and graphical user interface -- said the Crit toolset
is "Another good step in web evolution toward the complete feature set it
needs to truly revolutionize how we collectively develop and apply
knowledge -- in business and throughout society." 


Foresight's chairman Eric Drexler, a long-time advocate of full-featured
hypertext publishing, said, "Making progress on the complex technology
issues that we face requires better connections between statements of
contrasting views.  Our hope is that these new social software tools will
enable a higher level of quality in web-based discussion."


Users read and comment on web documents by viewing them with the new
tools, which run on a web server.  Users need no additional software of
any kind; the tools work with their web browser.


The developers of these technologies -- Ka-Ping Yee, Terry Stanley, and
Peter McCluskey -- are providing source code for free use and
modification by individuals and companies who wish to use the new tools
on their servers.


Foresight Institute (http://<bold>www.foresight.org</bold>) is a
nonprofit foundation specializing in education on emerging technologies. 
Foresight sponsors the development of social software designed to improve
the quality of critical discussion of public policy issues in
technology.

The rules of arithmetic are very different and non intuitive when you deal 
with infinite numbers, mathematicians call them Cardinal  Numbers.  The rules 
for infinite arithmetic were discovered by the German Mathematician 
George Cantor (1845-1918). Today he is universally recognized  as one of the 
greatest mathematicians in the last 100 years, but during most of his 
lifetime he was thought a fool by his colleagues and treated quite shabbily. 
They thought the idea of mathematical infinity was stupid. He died penniless 
and quite insane in a mental hospital. These ferocious attacks a century ago 
on the leading advocate of mathematical infinity remind me a little of the 
attacks on the leading advocate of physical infinity today. I hope Cantor's  
fate does not befall to poor Tipler. 

Cantor proved that the number of integers, call it A, is the smallest 
cardinal  number. He proved that the amount of even numbers is the same as 
the amount of all numbers. He proved that N*A =A if N is any finite number, 
and he even  proved that A*A =A. However  he also proved that 2^A is NOT 
equal to A. 

Cantor's crowning achievement was when he proved something we now call 
Cantor's Theorem, it states that if B is any cardinal number then B < 2^B.   
This means there are an infinite number of cardinal numbers, an infinite   
number of different infinities.  However he was not able to figure out if 
there is an infinite number between the number of integers and the number of  
points on a line, and even today it is not known.           
     

        >how big is an infinite amount of space squared?  Is it bigger than a         
        >"regular" infinite amount?


No. The number of points in a line or in a square or in a cube or in a 
hyper-cube of finite dimensions are the same, that is, you can put them in a 
one to one correspondence.

By this do you mean that there are B integers and 2^B points on a line, and
we don't know if there's anything in between?

Also, where do aleph-null, aleph-one, etc. fit into all this?  My dictionary
says that aleph-null is "the first transfinite number".  Is that what you call
A?  If so, is aleph-one what you call 2^A?

He suffered from schizophrenia, I have read, so it must have been  
easy for a causual observer to dismiss him as a crackpot & madman. 
There seems to have been a large number of outstanding logicians 
that had, or were redarded as having, psychological problems 
(Goedel starved himself to death because of paranoia, Russell 
suffered from depression, Whitehead was on the brink of nervous 
breakdown, Turing was regarded as psychologically disturbed because 
of his homosexuality. I'm sure somebody could make the list much 
longer, but it might well just be a coincidence.

That is to say, the smallest *infinite* cardinal number. There are 
also finite cardinal numbers.

Yes, we are very interested in this. At least I am, and I think I 
speak for many other people here as well. A good way to start the 
discussion might be if you post a couple of paragraphs outlining a 
particular controversial idea you might have; that is likely to 
spark a more general discussion.

I've always felt with the Cypherpunks that while they are on the
fringe, they are pulling us in the right direction. Sometimes you have 
to go to far in one direction to bring the rest with you, even if
halfway.

I seem to remember an article in Wired Mag about the Extropians, and
the disdainful letters in the letters column the next month. The
general feeling was "It's a shame the extropians couldnt use their
powers for good and not spend their time with their heads in the
clouds." and painted Max and crew as juvenile daydreamers, not unlike
your juvenile paranoids in the Cypherpunks.

Subject: PROPOSAL: New list focusing on mind, brain, and intelligence
Sender: postmaster@extropy.com

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

I would like there to be a transhumanist discussion list which
focuses on topics like:

- Intelligence augmentation
- Neuroscience, connectionism, brain modification
- Artificial intelligence, uploading, superintelligence
- Philosophy of mind
- Relevant issues from computing (e.g. distributed computation,
  new computational media, etc.)

In other words, everything to do with minds, brains, and
intelligence.

I want such a list because this is such a crucial nexus of
topics. The Singularity is often held to be about the rapid
emergence of superhuman intelligence. The desirability of mind
uploading rests upon a particular philosophy of mind. And it's
in everyone's interest to know all they can about the brains
they already have.

One of the attractive features of the extropian and transhuman
lists is the synthesis of ideas that goes on, but I suspect
that the complexity of the overall discussion exceeds anyone's
grasp. I would hope that this particular combination of topics
is broad enough to benefit from synthesis and narrow enough
to remain comprehensible as a whole.

I'd love to conclude by saying, "And you can join the list
by following these instructions", but I haven't been able to
pull that off. I'm not even sure what the list should be 
called. But if anyone wants to create such a list, they can 
add my name straight away.

This is a good explanation.  My objection to transporters is that I may
go through one, like Dup1, and never be able to know if Dup2 had been
created.  Is it OK to kill me?  I would say no, because I do not want to
experience death.  The existance of Dup2 does not influence my decision.

More important than the question "Is Dup2 me?", is my assertion that the
original ME is still me.  I object to most uploading theories, even the
ones that replace my neurons one at a time very slowly.  They require
the ability to create a complete duplicate and functional copy of my
brain, even if that brain is dissassembled as individual neurons.  If
such a copy can or has been made, then there would be or could be two
copies of me.  Destroying the original and ending up with only one copy
strongly implies that there has been a death of one individual, namely
ME, the original.

I am still wrestling with the ideas of uploading and/or duplication. 
Any scheme that requires the destruction of my original copy to prevent
it from living beyond the time that the duplicate is created, is not
acceptable to me.  Even if the original brain is deconstructed slowly
while the new brain is constructed does not alleviate my concerns.

I think the question of whether the new copy is "ME" is just semantics. 
I don't care about definitions or logical debate (except that it's
fun!).  I want to avoid the experience of death and the cessation of
experience.  No matter how many similar units continue to experience,
*I* want to continue from my subjective viewpoint as well.

Interestingly enough, I had the same thought. some time ago I created
a list on my box to cover similar issues, and never got around to
announcing it. Here at work we use the term Headspace to describe
mental capacity. When a user does something particulary dumb, we refer 
to it as a Insufficient User Headspace Error. So I called the list
'headspace'.

To subscribe, send an email with just the word subscribe in the
subject to headspace-request@x4.net.

Submissions will go to headspace@x4.net.

The original impetus for the list was to discuss ways to enhance
mental performance. I personally would like to know what people out
there know or suggest about Attention Deficit Disorder in adults.

I'm open to suggestions on a charter, or lack thereof. Someone should
at least write an info file to be sent out at subscribe.

I can also provide web space for a web page dealing with these issues, 
or any >H issues, really.

P.S. - Or, just smack me around and tell me I'm way off base.

The way I see it, if it is to be advisable to create a sublist for a 
certain topic, then not only must there be a substantial number of 
people who are interested in that topic (this condition is clearly 
satisfied), but there also have to be a substantial number of people 
on the original list who are *not* interested in the topic -- 
otherwise, why can't we have the discussion on the main list? (We 
could even use a prefix like MIND: ). The main way I can think of how 
a transhuman mind-list could be useful is that it might pull in 
non-transhumsnists interested in the mind. But one would have to 
double-post a lot of messeges, or n-post, if one includes the 
transhuman mailing list, the philosophy of AI newsgroup, PSYCHE 
mailinglists...

In conclusion, I am not convinced that there is at this point "enough 
necessity". But I would certainly join the list if it were created, 
since I don't want to risk missing any of the interesting posts 
that Mitch and others would contribute.

      John;

      This discussion would be a __lot_ easier and more fruitful if you'd 
      take the trouble to read the Colloquium, "Criticism and the Growth 
      of Knowledge", Lakatos and Musgrave, eds. [1976].

 
>

  <Sigh>.  You completely miss the point.  Science is _difficult_.  There 
  are _unsolved problems_.  If we find anomalies, we should work hard to 
  explain them within the Scientific Research Programmes, or explore the 
  problem-situation to discover previously unknown forces, quantities etc. 

  So the question I seek to answer is:

  "What is it, out there, that is causing the redshift?",  NOT:

  "Gimme a new theory, I can't solve the problem with the one I've got..."

  Popper explains this neatly with propensities.  Propensities are real 
  properties, albeit a little like 'hidden variables.'  A dice has a 
  propensity of one in six to come up 6.  The _physics_ of dice throws is 
  very complex.

     Electrons only 'spiral into the nucleus' in aether theory.  In 
     Relational Mechanics, they're held in various orbits of near-constant 
     radius by electric force, and the requirement for their sinewave 
     circular tracks to be non-precessional -- self-equilibrating to 
     integer frequencies, that is. Photons alter the electron masses and 
     characteristics, necessitating shifts to different orbits.  It's 
     beautifully simple, and extraordinarily powerful -- especially for 
     nanotechnology.

     Bohr's [1913] model of the hydrogen atom is very nearly a classical 
     mechanical explanation, albeit with ad-hoc postulates.  
     Unsurprisingly, since Bohr and Einstein both originally sought to 
     extend classical mechanics into the microworld.  As I do now.  I 
     provide physical explanations insted of ad hoc hypotheses.  This, we 
     call a 'progressive problemshift.' >:-}

  Relational Mechanics handles lasing easily.  It's a quantized phenomenon 
  - (RM includes the ballistic -- quantized -- theory of light). What's 
  your problem?

  The Michelson-Morley experiment perfectly corroborates the ballistic 
  theory of light.  Doesn't everyone know this?  I'll bet the bank on it.



> 5) Gravitational redshift.

  Sheesh!!!  Gravitational redshift is perfectly predicted by the 
  ballistic theory of light.  Go look up 'Ballistics.'

  But this is an _emprirical_ matter on which Relational Mechanics takes 
  no position -- it doesn't have to.  You just factor in the velocity of 
  propagation of gravity, electromagnetism etc.  Ideally, I'm looking for 
  non-linear equations of force interactions, instead of Waldemar Voight's 
  linear algebraic Doppler stuff, purloined (without any acknowledgement) 
  by Lorentz and Einstein.



> Just curious but is there anything special about the number 6?

  Good question...  Remember, you did ask...  >:-}

  'The Prisoner' TV series -- Number Six?  

  "SIX: Symbolic of ambivalence and equilibrium, six comprises the union 
  of two triangles (of fire and water) and hence signifies the human soul. 
  The Greeks regarded it as a symbol of the hermaphrodite.  It corresponds 
  to the six Directions of Space (two for each dimension), and to the 
  cessation of movement (since the Creation took six days). Hence it is 
  associated with trial and effort.  It has also been shown to relate to 
  virginity, and to the scales."

  and:

  "SIX is, like two, a particularly ambiguous number:  it is expressive of 
  dualism ( 2 x 3 or 3 x 2 ).  However, it is like four in that it has a 
  normative value as opposed to the liberating tendencies of five and the 
  mystic (or conflictin) character of seven."

  or:

  The Sixth Enigma of the Tarot is The Lover, symbolizing enmeshment, 
  union, antagonism, equilibrium, combination...

  Then, there's the Zodiac...  Libra, equilibrium?  >:-}

> General relativity predicts  42.98, the observed value is 43.11 +- .21

   The point you insist on ignoring is that the velocity of propagation of 
   gravitational force (if any) is not a feature of Classical or 
   Relational Mechanics.  In Newton's theory, gravity acts instantaneously 
   at a distance (even though he also says that it doesn't, because that 
   would have been 'occult' and could have gotten him executed).  Stop 
   conflating incompatible propositions, fer Chrissake!!!

  Sheesh!!! Time is a _dimension_.  You never studied Dimensional Analysis?

      Again, you miss the point.  I'm asserting that there are alternative 
      explanations, one of which -- 'time dilation' is positivistic.  I 
      don't buy into positivistic stuff -- it's all obsolete.

      Einstein's four-dimenional Parmenidean Block Universe idea sure 
      does.  Since when is a (more or less) steady-state 'Perpetuum 
      Mobile' the same as 'static'?  Where do you log-in from?  >:-}

      Because it's _incorrect_.  Continually recombine the (material, 
      massy) photons back into stars via gravity, and 'heat-death' just 
      doesn't ever happen.

Kennita;

      Have a look at Chris R. Tame's superb analysis of 'The Prisoner',
      originally published in Samuel E. Konkin III's 'New Libertarian', 
      and re-published as a reprint by the Libertarian Alliance.  Chris is
      hereabouts on the Extropians List.

      'The Prisoner' was conceived by George Markstein [MI6], and 
      exemplifies the conflict between the foreign-intelligence mindset, 
      which encounters the State as obstacle/target/mortal enemy, and the 
      internal-security types, who see 'defending the status quo' as
      the primary objective.  MI5 exists to prevent _any_ kind of radical
      change in the 'United Kingdom.'  No wonder Russell got excluded!
      
      In the US, it's the FBI.  Look at the way that notorious 
      serial-killer J. Edgar Hoover murdered, tormented and destroyed 
      radicals of every kind.  Frances Farmer, Jean Seberg,
      anarchists, individualists, the list goes on and on and on...
      
      The FBI is an _appalling idea_ -- combining counter-espionage and
      policing functions was the structural basis of the Nazi and Soviet
      States.  Inevitably, they start thinking 'we know better than the
      politicians', then they cease to 'serve' and instead aspire to rule.

      
      Hoover had _vast_ media and political 'assets' to work his fell will.
      Ferinstance; Nixon ('Emperor Palpatine') was his creature.  Ditto 
      half the 'Republican' Party.  He hated CIA, as a rival to his 
      Sauron-like power-grabbing.  Howard Hunt said there were two kinds 
      of people he'd never met in 20 years in CIA; one was an assassin; 
      the other was a fellow-Republican!  >:-}
      
      (Hunt designed the 'Watergate' scam to bring down Nixon, BTW.  Yo!).

Depends on your philosophy. It doesn't seem to be an
observer-independent answer.

One way of dealing with this is my identity calculus, see 
http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Cultural/Philosophy/identity.html

Most likely both host-mind systems would consider themselves to be you.

Harvey Newstrom <harv@gate.net> had some great objections to

	Yes, this is precisely the problem.  The way to solve this is
to use merged minds and effing of consciousness.  Imagine that the
duplicate has some kind of communications connection that merges it's
consciousness with the original.  Essentially making them the same
supper conscious entity.

	It's hard for us to imagine this since the conscious space in
our brain is currently primitively very fixed, non expandable, and has
only one point of view.  So to make it more intuitive, think of the
seeing part of your consciousness being dup1 and the hearing part of
your consciousness being dup2.  Together you can both hear what is
going on in the "to" or copy location and see what is going on in the
"from" or original location but you are, together, one conscious
being.  If the dup1 is to be destroyed, it would be like being
temporarily blinded, but you wouldn't be dead.  You would of course be
able to reproduce the seeing part of your consciousness within dup2
restoring your sight.  Though part of you temporarily died, because of
effing of consciousness all of you would not have died.  This would
mostly solve your intuitive objection to the idea through conscious
continuity.  Of course destruction of any part of you is always a
problem and avoidance of such is always desirable if possible.  But,
if you are consciously spread across multiple platforms, you will
always know that you can regenerate that particular part in some other
location or time if necessary.

	The important part is understanding what of and how our
conscious worlds are made, and then learning how to connect these
conscious worlds so that we can eff feelings, sensations... and share
minds to preserve consciously continuity.  As you correctly assume,
you must be directly (via effing or actual mind merging) aware of the
creation of dup2 and be able to directly experience what it is
experiencing.

	By the way, Hal Finney <hal@rain.org>, made some very good
comments about what I said.  Thank you for this feedback, Hal, with
which I very much agreed.  I'll make modification to address some
of your good criticisms.

Anders,

	I enjoyed your "The Calculus of Identity" page, very
interesting.  Within it you seem to consider the "self function" to be
a kind of "relative" thing based on opinions or whatever of whatever
the particular self thing is.  But of course such opinions can be
mistaken can't they?  You said:

> the self-function need not be universal, it is unique for each
> system (I identify myself with my actions, you might identify with
> your memes and somebody might identify with their body). So if we
> assume the existence of some kind of abstract "superself-function"
> which for any system gives us its sense of identity

	For a moment let's assume that there is no such thing as an
immortal spiritual ghost inside our body that is ourselves.  If a
person identifies himself as such a fictional "ghost" which he might
sincerely believe is inside his body, then his concept of self would
not exist right?  Since his false ideas had no correspondence to
anything in reality.

	You said you identify yourself with your actions.  This is
only partially true isn't it?  Wouldn't a very different body that
acted the same as you be different than you?  To get an accurate
concept of self you must consider all things that make us what we are.
Though a virtual copy of ourselves running on silicone, might have
identical virtual actions, there are obvious differences which should
not be ignored, though some of the difference may not be to important.

	So, shouldn't a self() function, rather than be something that
is relative to the particular system or person, be something that is
more absolute and universal?  Shouldn't it consist of all true
attributes of the self and none that are false or not really existent
attributes?

	Of course everything else would still apply, such as "Identity
Horizons" beyond which one would cease to be themselves, but any place
you placed such "horizons" would seem somewhat arbitrarily placed
along the continuum that can be us.  What does it really matter
whether I define myself to be different than I was when I was 2 or
not?

Where can I find some good information about this (effing etc.)? At the
moment, this doesn't seem quite realistic to me, but I'm willing to
learn :-)

later,
Holger

hi

an answer finally came from an astronomer about the moon within a tetrahedron
within the earth scenario.  Someone on here proved it wrong because they were
using a triangle and not a tetrahedron.  read on...

Don Barry:

If memory serves, the size of a sphere inscribed within a tetrahedron
inscribed within a sphere is that of one quarter the radius of the 
external sphere.  And the Moon is roughly one quarter the radius of the
Earth.  There is no physical relationship between the two: neither the 
Moon nor the Earth is a perfect sphere, and the relationship isn't 
exactly a 1:4 match.  But pick any rational number, and you'll be able
to find a geometrical configuration producing it somehow.  

interesting...

     Just heard on the local TV News in Detroit that Ian Goddard and Salinger
have apologized to the Navy for spreading charges that the Navy shot down TWA
800!  Is this true!??

    The announcer said Goddard admitting to making unfounded charges just to
decrease faith in the government thus promoting his libertarian philosophy.

I certainly agree that extremists--i.e., those on the bleeding
edge of progress in any field--are a valuable resource, often
unjustly ridiculed for no reason other than being extreme.  I'm
an extremist myself on many scales (anarchy, for instance).

Perhaps Brin's and my discomfort with cypherpunks is only that,
but I think it is more: as I said, in my experience, those who
attach great value to preventing the spread of information about
themselves I find strange.  It is not a reasoned judgment, only
an emotional reaction, but it is a prejudice that serves me.

I suppose I should also note that this group in particular is
very good at finding exceptions to my generalizations.  For
example, on the net in general, I find that a silly "handle" is
usually a quick way to sort out those who probably don't have
to be taken seriously.  Indeed, I dicovered Extropy institute
before I started subscribing to the list, but dismissed it at
first because I had a hard time taking seriously anything
founded by guys using the names "Max More" and "Tom Morrow" (or
wherever he puts the zeros).  I've since discovered that those
handles have serious minds behind them, as do "The Low Golden
Willow", "Hara Ra", and others.  Outside this list, I continue
to save time by not reading anything with an name like that
attached to it, unless it is specifically referred to me, but
here on this list I can't use that filter.

So I'm sure the cypherpunks in this group don't fit the mold
of those I've met elsewhere, either.

It is generally believed (I don't follow the mathematics culture
enough to know if it has been proven or not) that the "continuum"
(i.e., the number of points on a line or plane or space) is indeed
Cantor's Aleph-1.  Aleph-0 is the cardinality of the set of
integers; Aleph-1 is the number of possible subsets of integers,
or 2 ^ Aleph-0.  Aleph-2 is the number of possible subsets of a
set of cardinality Aleph-1.  If Aleph-1 is indeed equivalent to
the continuum, then Aleph-2 would be the cardinality of the set of
all possible drawings, for example (where "drawing" is a subset of
points on a plane).  I can't think of a useful example of a set of
cardinality Aleph-3 offhand.

It /is/ provable that the continuum /must/ be greater than Aleph-0
(this was Cantor's ingenious "diagonal" proof).

This implies, but does not state clearly, that this event is open

I also reviewed a draft of Brin's book.   Brin has a lot of
interesting things to say, but I think the weakest part of 
his analysis is the idea that everyone is as suspect as 
governments.  Brin argues that if you want government 
officials to be open in what they do, then you should want
everyone to be open, because big business, big crime, and 
everyone else can also do you harm in the dark.  So Brin
is against crypto for you and me essentially because he is 
for sunshine in government, and can't see a principled 
difference between the two cases.  

In my opinion, history provides much stronger reasons to 
be worried about governments.

Hutchinson has a later book, _Mega Brain Power_ which is pretty complete
and rife with references (25 page bibliography).  I don't accept
everything he says but it's an excellent overview of research in the
area.

You should be aware that many cypherpunks are not motivated simply by
some kind of privacy fetish.  There are a couple of practical motivations.

One is fear that without cryptographic assurances, virtually all privacy
will be lost.  We are moving down a path towards a surveillance society,
in which all our purchases, hobbies, subscriptions, and activities are
recorded by others.  As more transactions become electronic it will
become that much easier to achieve this.  Super-databases will come into
existence which integrate the disparate data from your video downloads,
your on-line payments, your web surfing habits, into a complete dossier
on you.

Another motivation is the belief that crypto technology could increase
options for voluntary interactions and reduce the impact of coercion.
It is hard to enforce a minimum wage law when the two parties interacting
know each other only by crypto pseudonyms and payment is made by
untraceable, anonymous electronic cash.  Likewise many other kinds
of laws where third parties try to meddle in voluntary interactions
could be thwarted by the availability of strong cryptography.  In fact
some libertarians predict that crypto will bring about the collapse of
the state, as most commerce moves into untraceable electronic forms,
depriving the state of tax revenue.

It's been shown that you can assume either that the number of points on the
line
is aleph-one or aleph-infinity and you'll get no contradiction.  It's much
like Euclidean vs. non-Euclidean geometry.  Most people work with the
assumption
that the number of points on a line = aleph-one = 2^(aleph-null), just
because
it makes the math easier.  This is called the "Continuum Hypothesis" (or
axiom).

That the Continuum Hypothesis can be assumed to be either true or false
without
trouble seems weird.  I conceptualize it by thinking that the number of
points
on a line is an ill-defined thing.

>By this do you mean that there are B integers and 2^B points on a line, and

I don't think there's any cardinality between aleph-null and aleph-one.  
If you assume the Continuum Hypothesis then there's nothing between the
integers
and the line.  If you deny it, then aleph-one, aleph-two, etc.  all come in 
between.

Yes.  Aleph-two is 2^(aleph-one) and so on.  There's also an "extended
continuum
hypothesis" which holds that the number of all possible functions is
aleph-two.
I believe it's also undecidable but generally used because it makes life
easier.

In response Brin would laugh hysterically.  "We know you have money.

Just to clarify: what's been proved is that the Continuum Hypothesis
is independent of the ordinary (Zermelo-Fraenkel) axioms of set theory.
This is done by constructing "models", universes of sets which satisfy
the ZF axioms and which also satisfy whatever postulate regarding the
cardinality of the continuum you've chosen to work with.

How to interpret this situation is not clear. Some would see it as
evidence that the transfinite is just a product of the human
imagination. Goedel, I think, felt that it simply meant that the
current axiomatizations of set theory are incomplete, and that by
further thought and clarification of concepts we would eventually
see what the extra axioms should be.

My understanding: the Continuum Hypothesis is 2^(aleph-null) = aleph-one.
The Generalized Continuum Hypothesis is that 2^(aleph-X) = aleph-(X+1).
There is no cardinality between aleph-null and aleph-one by definition;
aleph-one is *not* defined as the number of points on the real line
("the cardinality of the continuum"), but simply as "the next biggest
cardinal after aleph-null". I think the original demonstration of
a model of ZF that contradicted the CH (Philip Cohen, 1963?) *can*
work with cardinals of the form aleph-N, where 0 < N < infinity.
Finally, what one *can* say about the number of all functions (from
the reals onto the reals) is not that it's aleph-two, but that it's
2^(2^(aleph-null)).

Earlier this year I  read a very peculiar book by one David Morehouse, a
former spookish `remote viewer', and concluded it was almost complete
horseshit.  I hadn't then read Jim Schnabel's new book on remote viewing
for purposes of calibration.  A copy recently came my way, courtesy of a US
anomalies research journal which asked me for a review.  In the event (as
you will see), my notice was insufficiently cool and scholarly, so the
journal was obliged to decline it.  I thought I'd inflict it on you lot,
since questions relating to mysticism and exotic science (or `science')
crop up from time to time.  My own book on parapsychology research, and
possible applications if psi turns out to be real, is THE LOTTO EFFECT:
TOWARDS A TECHNOLOGY OF THE PARANORMAL (Melbourne, Australia: Hudson, 1992,
ISBN: 0 949873 41 1). Herewith:

Reviewed by Damien Broderick

For more than two decades, the US government ran several research programs
into the military use of paranormal powers, or anomalous cognition.  This
is not fiction, not *Dark Skies* or *The XFiles*.  The sponsors' chief
goal was to implement `remote viewing' for intelligence gathering: use
trained psychic skills to access places, events or persons distant in time
and space.  Now they've stopped.  The money has dried up.  Or so they say.
Other opinions abound.

Professor Jessica Utts, a statistician at the University of California,
Davis, and Professor Ray Hyman, a psychologist at the University of Oregon,
were contracted several years ago by American Institutes for Research (AIR)
to evaluate the program.  Under Pentagon pressure, the 23year program was
terminated late in 1995 (Schnabel, p. 3867).  One might suppose that the
evaluators had examined the best results from the various wings of the long
project and found them wanting.  Not so, or not quite.  Curiously, Utts's
report had concluded: `It is clear to this author that anomalous cognition
is possible and has been demonstrated. This conclusion is not based on
belief, but rather on commonly accepted scientific criteria.'  

Hyman, a wellknown sceptic, predictably disagreed, but admitted: `I tend
to agree with Professor Utts that real effects are occurring in these
experiments'.  Irritatingly, the assessors were not given the `operational'
remote viewing material, just laboratory results from governmentsponsored
research done from the early 1970s at Stanford Research Institute and from
1989 to 1994 at Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).
Most of the real material, according to Utts, is still classified (personal
communication). 

Is the Truth, as Agent Mulder hopes, really Out There?  The subtitle of Jim
Schnabel's thorough if journalistic account calls it `The Secret
History...'  A little earlier, a very strange book by retired major David
Morehouse, PhD, was subtitled `The True Story...'  Morehouse's remote
viewing stint was with a Fort Meade, Maryland, army unit   although he
suggests that the CIA's oncesecret STAR GATE later assimilated the Army's
SUN STREAK, meanwhile running their own parallel project.  Ingo Swann,
arguably the *eminence grise* of the defunct official RV programs, is
releasing chapters of his own history on the World Wide Web (after it was
declined by America's `top five mainstream publishers' due, incredibly, to
a perceived lack of public interest in the paranormal).  It provides a
quirky if unfinished triangulation on the two books under review:

`If nothing else,' Swann writes, `the American intelligence community is
VERY mainstream.  The odds of a "psychic" (as I unfortunately was to be
dubbed) of even entering into the realms of mainstream structured
international espionage, much less surviving for some eighteen YEARS within
the abundant machinations  well, such odds were nonexistent as of 1971'
(chapter three, his uppercase).  Weirdly written in a voice that yokes *La
Cage Aux Folles* to stilted  bureaucratese  the Vietnam War, he remarks,
led to `the wide spread realization that the rationale for that war was
nutso whacko'  this jumbled blend of immodest autobiography and strange
history is unabashedly titled *Remote Viewing  The Real Story*.

How `real and `true we should deem versions of that `secret story is
perhaps up to each reader, and opinions will vary considerably.  Schnabel's
account seems to me believable.  Perhaps it's because he stands carefully
back from the fray, despite having learned successfully How2RV from both
Swann and former Fort Meade officer Ed Dames.  As with his previous
splendid books *Round in Circles* (on the cerealcircle hoaxes, and lunatic
mythologies that grew up around them) and *Dark White* (an hilarious,
definitive study of UFO `abductions'), he allows the deluded, hallucinated,
crackpated, prankish and felonious to reveal themselves, while playing fair
with genuine intimations of mystery.  If Morehouse were to be believed, by
contrast, it is a matter of plain (if, perhaps, stillclassified) record
that Defense Intelligence Agency personnel performed psychic overhead
flights of the Gulf War, spoke to the dead, surveyed UFOs buzzing crop
circles and under the sands of Mars, and locked on to the hidden Ark of the
Covenant.  Just as well the major was outofbody in that last-mentioned
sacred place, for otherwise he'd have `perish[ed] instantly... vaporized'
(Morehouse, 132).  

Desert Storm's oilwell fires, it turns out, were a coverup for US
chemical weapons tests on its own soldiers.  Dave, out of body, saw the
open canisters (169).  That's why the Army hounded him into court (and let
him go, after he ended in the Walter Reed psychiatric ward, with an `other
than honorable' discharge).  Earlier, they'd tried to kill him and his
family.  Or maybe not.  As Morehouse admits, his book is heavily
fictionalised, appropriating the experiences of others (some of them given
proper or at least different attribution in Schnable).  It's under lavish
contract for the movies, perhaps to star Stallone.

So did the US program really develop effective methods for getting `into
the ether' (lovely dumb 19th century term!), whizzing back and forth in
space and time, contacting those toiling in the afterlife, angels,
extraterrestrials in UFOs and on distant worlds?  If even the least of
Morehouse's assertions were correct  and Schnabel corroborates the least
lurid of them  if his unit's methodology for psychic espionage actually
did work (bolstered by data from regular spies), it's hard to see why
university parapsychologists at Edinburgh and Princeton and elsewhere are
still fiddling about with their penny ante lab experiments.

Schnabel's 1995 British Channel Four special `The Real XFiles: America's
Psychic Spies', lightly mapped his book's territory in a bizarre *Twin
Peaks*meets*American Gothic* style.  Despite these gestures of postmodern
mockery, he claimed to have learned effective remoteviewing from Swann.
And while he is cautious and very fleeting in his book on the topic of
Morehouse's alleged exploits, Schnabel gave free vent to his distaste in an
article recently posted widely on the Internet:

`To me, his story is not just about the depths to which one human can sink.
 (Morehouse is, in the end, perhaps only a sleazier, crazier version of the
old Sgt. Bilko character.)  Somehow his story also reflects the current
state of things in America, a country that seems to be going insane...
What else to call a people who feed hungrily, via *The XFiles* and other
forms of that hugely popular genre, on paranoid conspiracy fantasies
otherwise found only on psychiatric wards?'

It's intriguing to compare Morehouse's own account of his life (tragically
misused by evil manipulators, but saved from suicidal depression by eternal
love for his angelic wife   plus some actual kitschy angels   and his
patriotism and decency), and Schnabel's relentless savaging in that
article, excluded mysteriously from his book: Morehouse the scummy
womaniser, the guy with `a small home improvement business, House Tech,
that he ran on the side.'

Can this be the same Morehouse who rails against the shocking state of
morale and morals in the spook bizz (the other sort of spooks, you
understand)?  `And some of their private lives!  A few staff members hardly
bothered to conceal extramarital affairs...  It was a real Peyton Place,
and I hated it...  Let me top my description off with the colonel who sold
Afghani rugs out of the trunk of his car in the parking lot' (Morehouse, 157).

The major's alleged sexual improprieties, even his goldbricking while on
the payroll of the Defense Intelligence Agency, are finally irrelevant.  We
all have our little quirks.  It's notable, though, that none of this
material is touched in his book, either, not even to rebut it.  The jacket
mentions his PhD (in Education Administration, I learned).  `My doctorate
is from LeSalle University in Mandeville, LA.,' he told me by email.  He
meant La Salle.  In a rather odd disclaimer, he added: `I did not simply
buy my degree  believe it or not, I had to work for it' (personal email
communication).  

It'd be easiest, obviously, to discount Morehouse as a former, or feigned,
psychotic with schmaltzy style and delusions of grandeur.  But we are meant
to accept that this kind of operative provided the psychic material that
the CIA and DIA and other dark powers once found impressive.  It stinks of
a disinformation package to me, rich in odours attractive to New Age
nostrils and *XFiles* fans and just as certain to wrinkle the snooty noses
of sceptics.  Schnabel's *Remote Viewers* is a fine counter to Morehouse's
vulgar concoctions.  

Meanwhile, former military remote viewers such as Lyn Buchanan, Ed Dames
and Joe McMoneagle, some selling ambitious coaching and psiforhire
programs, are represented on the Net  Dames by PsiTech, Buchanan by
P>S>I>.  The latest excited news from Buchanan's site is that, perhaps due
to the benign influence of morphic resonance, remote viewing skills can
currently be learned with astonishing rapidity.  In just a few concentrated
days or weeks, for a hefty fee, students can master powers over time and
space that used to take months under Swann's structured protocol (*CRV:
Recent Developments in Remote Viewing training*, on the P>S>I> website).

Swann's way was a sequence of neologised Stages: One, minimal sketched
`ideograms'; Two, basic sense perceptions and emotional impacts,
progressing through `dimensionals' to Three, large autonomous sketches;
Four, listing of `tangible' and `intangible' quantities; Five, prompting
for detail from specific target objects; Six, building a solid model in
clay, like the UFOobsessed seers in *Close Encounters* or perhaps, to be
fair, like an architect externalising her blueprint; Seven, uttering
freefloating phonemes in order to elicit meaningful cues and clues; and so
on (Schnabel, 242252).

By his own account (although one might ponder as to its exact truth), Swann
is a prodigy who had read the entire 30 volume *Encyclopaedia Britannica*
before he entered kindergarten, and flowcharted the *Taote Ching* when he
was seven (*Real Story*).  No less polymathic was the scientific mind
behind Stanford Research Institute's psi program, Dr Hal Puthoff, who in
1985 would walk away from SRI to research a fabulous alternative paradigm
in deep physics, `zeropoint' or `vacuum' energy (Schnabel 323), a quantum
alternative to general relativity.  Did Puthoff use his disintegrating RV
team's somewhat unreliable powers of precognition to select this risky
venture?  Schnabel does not say, and neither does Puthoff.  It is
intriguing, though, that Puthoff did employ `associational remote viewing'
 a method of coding future market movements to binary targets, and earned
$25,000 in a month for a community school (322).  

Of course, one's lingering doubt as to the true efficacy of the RV method
might fix itself to this kind of success story.  If Puthoff and his team of
charitable RVers could precognise the stockmarket, and if, in a famous
earlier debacle, silver futures had been traded with some success (265,
322), why, then, are we still arguing over the merits of the method?  

Schnabel lists numerous eye-openers, some familiar from Russel Targ and Hal
Puthoff's *Mind-Reach* (1977), others fresh.  What must CIA anaysts have
made of the detailed drawings Pat Price provided SRI of a secret Soviet R&D
target south of Semipalatinsk?  Here is the unusual, rail-tracked,
eight-wheeled crane, the metal spheres being welded together, confirmed
later by spy satellites.

If government drug busters and armed forces and CIA and DIA and NSA and who
knows what covert agencies attained some measure of astonishing accuracy in
RV tasks  as Schnabel and Morehouse and McMoneagle and Swann and Buchanan
assure us that they did  why were these programs allowed to whimper away?
Why were they closed down as their early champions fell from grace or
retired  men so wellplaced as General Bert Stubblebine, chief of the
Army's Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM), General Ed Thompson,
Army Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, and Jack Vorona, head of
the DIA's Scientific and Technical Intelligence Directorate?  Is it enough
to blame the resistance of stolid scientific paradigms, the contamination
of lunatic cultisms, or the ebb and flow of social currents like the
complex blend that saw nuclear power lauded one decade and despised the next?

In any event, at least one former member of the remote viewing unit, an
INSCOM officer, has vouched for Schnabel's account: `It appears to be very
accurate....  While I do think Joe McMoneagle wrote a good RV book [*Mind
Trek*, 1993], he was restricted in what he could say at that time.
Schnable has certainly done his homework.'   But can such allegedly
classified details truly be reliable?  I asked Lyn Buchanan, and he kindly
provided this comment:

` Jim Schnabel's book is probably the only one available to the public
which sticks closely to the truth and real history of the unit.  There is a
lot which is totally in error - in spite of the fact that it was
information he should have had an easy time uncovering, and a lot which is
surprisingly
correct, in spite of being information he shouldn't have been able to get.
It seems that he got many of the easy facts wrong, and really aced the
stuff that should have been highly classified.  At any rate, it still
sticks most closely to the truth and real history.  In summary, it isn't a
totally accurate account, but it's the best available at the moment.
Anyone wanting to know about the unit would be best to start here
(personal communication, 4 November, 1997).

Clearly the same cannot be said of Morehouse's souffle.  In any event, to
me, as an openminded sceptical outsider agog at the reported accuracy of
the best cases Schnable cites, the obvious gnawing question remains.  If
this methodology works perhaps 50 percent of the time, especially when
bolstered by signalenhancing measures such as redundancy (tasking several
viewers without their knowledge at the same target), how could such power
be left to slip away?  

`Even if a remote viewing of a specific target proved to have been accurate
and useful,' Schnabel concludes, `its user, afraid of the giggle factor,
could almost never acknowledge the fact' (338).  Prejudice and paradigms,
the usual suspects.  I can't buy it.  If D. D. Home returned and flew
through the air in front of video cameras, wired to the eyeballs with slick
neuroscience electronics, I suspect he'd be whisked away promptly to a
military lab, giggle factor or not.  

If Mel Riley and Tom Nance and the rest really did pluck data from the
vasty deep, how could any paradigm resist?  I disbelieve in iridology and
homeopathy in part because my instinct tells me that if these laughable
ideas endured the sieve of scientific testing, they would be by now the
proprietory lines of Swiss billionaires.  Same with remote viewing.  I'm
not so much dismayed by the coarse hallucinated mythos its shamanic
practitioners seem to generate as they `bounce off the walls' (Schnabel
73ff)  the pregnant Martian females under the New Mexico desert (377), the
visions of the Ark of the Covernant  as flummoxed by their failure to have
bought out Bill Gates by now.  Like Agent Mulder, I'd be quite happy to
believe, but the state of the world hints it isn't so. 

But Schnabel's charming history makes it very tempting to relax my guard.

There is a difference between a surveillance society and a
transparent society. In a surveillance society only the government can spy
on people, whereas in a transparent society everyone can spy on
everyone else.

Of course David Brin's transparent society is not completely transparent,
since you'd still have your private thoughts. For that we need an
implantable chip that provides a public read-only interface to the
wearer's memories and thoughts. If these are cheaply available, should
everyone be forced to wear them? I think the world would be a better place
if everyone _did_ wear these chips, because it would completely eliminate
all waste caused by people hiding information from each other. However,
I'm not sure that the world would be a better place if it turns into
Brin's transparent society, because in it you can still hide
information--it's just more costly. It's not clear if the total amount of
waste would be larger or smaller.

I don't know how David Brin proposes to achieve his transparent society. 
It does not seem like a future that is reachable from the present. I think
the mostly likely scenario for the near future is some mixture of
surveillance for the offline part of our existance and anonymity for the
online part. Slightly further off most of our activities will be online
and anonymous.

Yes, if B = aleph-null.  Think of the set of real numbers (points
on a line) as expressed in binary: B bits running to the left, B bits
running to the right, thus the members of the set are 2^B.  Cantor
used a charming trick to show that this set is non-countable, i.e.
cannot be mapped one-to-one with the set of integers.

	That's the problem.  This kind of stuff seems so basic to the
philosophy of mind that it is utterly surprising to me that there
isn't more scholarly stuff written about this kind of stuff.  I've
been attempting to write some of this kind of stuff myself but, as you
can probably tell, I'm not much of a writter.

	I've rewritten my original response bassed on much of the
feedback I've received here.  It contains some more information about
what I'm trying to talk about and hopefully it will answer some more
of your questions.  Let me know if it is any better.

================================================================

	There are many forms of the copy paradox idea.  The most
popular deals with the idea of a "transporter" in the Science Fiction
Stories of Star Trek so I'll give what I feel to be the answer to this
issue based on the transporter idea.

	For discussion purposes, I'll use the names Dup and Trans.
Dup1 walked into a non destructive transporter and walked out of this
same machine unchanged, yet scanned.  Then an identical Dup2 walked
out of the reproducer part some distance away.  Trans1 walked into a
similar scanning machine but was completely taken apart atom by atom
before an identical Trans2 was constructed out of different yet
identical stuff some distance away.

	It could be likely that if you are Dup1 you will be extremely
annoyed at the way Dup2 continually says he is the real Dup.  And of
course you wouldn't want to be Trans1 because he was destroyed even
though Trans2 claims he is the same.  If you were Trans2 you would
have no way of directly consciously knowing or remembering that Trans1
was destroyed and believe that you were the original transported
Trans.  Also If you were Dup2 you would believe that you were the
original Dup and Dup1 would possibly equally annoy you by claiming he
was the real Dup.

	The primary answer is, if you are the same, you will not be
able to tell the difference between the two, including the particular
feelings and memories being felt by the two now separate copies.  If
you were dup1, you would feel exactly the same as dup2.

	"Then what is it that is you?" one may ask.  I believe, it is
your state or shape.  If you organized the proper stuff(*1) into this
proper shape it would be you.  Whether it was done a googol years ago,
whether it was done in a googol years from now or whether it was done
in a newly created similar universe different and completely separate
from our own and whether it was done a googol times here today.  (Even
though you may have to be like God to be able to do this or at least
to come up with the complete information required to duplicate someone
that was say cremated 1000 years ago.)  This state of you is self
existent.  This fact about you can't be created by any God nor
destroyed by even the universe ceasing to exist.  It is a logically
necessary fact that you can exist.  Your existence proves this
absoluely.

	The state of Dup1 and Dup2 would immediately start to diverge
since they would now exist in different locations.  Hence, they would
become more and more different people as time went on.  This would be
similar to the way you are different than the you that existed
yesterday because of your new memories and other changes.

	One of the primary reasons we are unsatisfied with such an
answer and uncomfortable about being transported and destroyed and
taken apart atom by atom has a lot to do with continuity.  It is
similar to the problem of other minds.  You know what it is like to be
you, but if you look at another person, you don't know for sure that
that person is conscious in any way like you.  As dup1 looks at dup2,
he doesn't really know if that copy is some mindless mechanical zombie
that is merely mimicking his actions and claims to the same identity.

	These problems exists because actual conscious experience is
"ineffable".  We say that the taste of salt is "ineffable" because you
can't tell someone what salt tastes like, you can only experience the
taste of salt for yourself.  But, since it is ineffable you can't know
for sure if what the other person experiences when he put's salt in
his mouth is the same as your experience.

	When salt chemicals stimulate our taste buds, this produces a
salty sensation in our brain.  There is a chance that the particular
sensation in one brain is different than the resulting sensation in
another brain.  Salt really isn't "salty" there is just a reliably
correspondence to salt on your taste buds and the resulting salty
qualia that ends up being produced by your brain.  A salty quale
models the chemical salt and it's nutritional value or meaning to us
in a very information and intelligent way.

	Our consciousness is a collection of all these sensing modes.
We know that a salty quale is not like a honey quale.  We also know
that a salty qualia is not anything like a color quale like red.  Our
brain uses salty to represent sodium chloride and red to represent
700nm electromagnetic radiation.  We even know that a memory of red is
similar, but not anything like real red.  Our consciousness is able
to experience and contrast these sensations.  It knows what they are
each like and knows how they are different.  But, we don't know if
someone else uses these same quale to represent these things because
we can't directly experience what they are experiencing.

	It is conceivable, however, that this barrier can be crossed.
Just as evolution has added all of our modes of sensing so that our
mind is directly aware of them so that we can compare and contrast
them we will surely some day be able to enhance our brain and add
additional cortexes that experience other sensations.  Once we
discover what qualia are, we should be able to construct scanning
devices that watch particular areas of the brain and determining when,
say, a particular salty sensation is occuring.  This information could
then be transmitted to a brain augmented with a generic qualia
producing device whereupon it produces the identical qualia in the
consciousness of other brain.  I call this "effing".  One my say:
"That isn't what salt tastes like to me!"

	The key is integrating this additional cortex into the
consciousness just as all our sensing modes are integrated into our
consciousness now.  It is even conceivable that multiple brains could
be merged in this way to produce multiple points of view in the same
mind.  This, of course, would be mind merging.  The single
consciousness would be directly aware of everything going on in both
minds.  It would be able to compare and contrast the sensations and
directly know if they are different or the same.

	Once we have accomplished such abilities, we will have solved
the problem of other minds, and will have developed a tool to solve
the transporter problem.  Dup1 and dup2 could have their consciousness
connected, either by complete merging, or at least by an effing link
where the same multi brain experiences were being produced in both
minds.

	It's hard for us to imagine this since the conscious space in
our brain is currently primitively very fixed, non expandable, and has
only one point of view.  So to make it more intuitive, think of the
seeing part of your consciousness being dup1 and the hearing part of
your consciousness being dup2.  Together you can both hear what is
going on in the "to" or copy location and see what is going on in the
"from" or original location but you are, together, one conscious
being.  If the dup1 is to be destroyed, it would be like being
temporarily blinded, but you wouldn't be dead.  You would of course be
able to reproduce the seeing part of your consciousness within dup2
restoring your sight.  Though part of you temporarily died, because of
effing of consciousness all of you would not have died.  This would
mostly solve your intuitive objection to the idea through conscious
continuity.  Of course destruction of any part of you is always a
problem and avoidance of such is always desirable if possible.  But,
if you are consciously spread across multiple platforms, are able to
transfer data and memories between them, you will always know that you
can regenerate the particular part that was destroyed in some other
location or time if necessary or possible.

	The important part is understanding what of and how our
conscious worlds are made, and then learning how to connect these
conscious worlds so that we can eff feelings, sensations... and share
minds to preserve consciously continuity.  So, once we discover how to
do these things, we will have solved the problem of other minds and
discovered a way to help us feel more comfortable about being
transported.  Our mind is built out of phenomenal qualia and somehow
merged into a unified consciousness.  Continuity of mind, and direct
experience of what others are experiencing are important for these
kinds of problems and indeed for understanding consciousness itself.
Once we discover what qualia are and how they are merged together to
form consciousness, we will finally know what consciousness is.

(*1) If you insist on something mysterious or ghost like being
included in this "stuff" that you are made of the argument still
applies although at a slightly different level(*2).  If one of you
exists it simply proves it is possible for you to exist.  I think you
could create another identical universe with the same set of souls no
matter what the soul is.  I believe it will be possible to duplicate
whatever it is that is us.  Even if you have to be like God to do it.

(*2) Unleas of course you believe in some sort of you that is not
duplicatable.  But this is an extremely pessimistic view since if your
not duplicatable then you are probably also not fixable or improvable
and you will forever be stuck with being less than or equal to what
you are today.

Tony;
This discussion would be a __lot_ easier and more fruitful if you'd take the  
trouble to read any high school science book or at least a good grade school  
one.            

        >>Me:

        >Popper explains this neatly with propensities. Propensities are real

But there is no way Newton or Galileo of Faraday or Maxwell can explain this: Shine a light on 2 closely spaced slits and it
will produce a complex interference pattern on a film, even if the photons 
are sent out one at a time. If a photon (or an electron) goes through one 
slit it wouldn't seem to matter if the other slit, the one it didn't go 
though, was there or not, but it does!

Or place a polarizing filter set at 0 degrees over one slit, and one set at  
90 degrees over the other, and the interference pattern disappears. Now place  
a third filter set at 45 degrees between the slits and the film and wait  
until AFTER the photons have passed the slits to do it. The interference  
pattern comes back! Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle does not enter in any 
of this, it's not that the photon goes through one slit and we just don't  
know which one, it goes through both slits, and neither. 

Don't tell me that all this is crazy because it's not my fault, I'm sure I  could have done much better but unfortunately I was
not given the job. Tell God He's crazy.             
        
A word about philosophers; I like them, especially Popper, I always find that
sort of stuff entertaining, but Stephen Hawking has some amusing things to  
say about them that contain more than a little truth.
- From "Black Holes and Baby Universes:

 "philosophers have mostly not had enough mathematical background to keep up  
  with modern developments in theoretical physics. There is a subspecies   
  called philosophers of science who ought to be better equipped. But many of 
  them are failed physicist who found it too hard to invent new theories and 
  so took to writing the philosophy of physics instead. They are still  
  arguing about the scientific theories of the early years of this century,  
  like relativity and quantum mechanics. They are not in touch with the  
  present frontier of physics."


        >A dice has a propensity of one in six to come up 6. The _physics_ of         
        >dice throws is very complex.


The 2 slit experiment is not complex and complexity has nothing to do with it.
        

        >Electrons only 'spiral into the nucleus' in aether theory.       


Newton says an object moving in a circle is accelerating toward the center of 
the circle. Maxwell says an accelerating charge will radiate an 
electromagnetic wave and give up energy. BUT...

An electron is a charge. The electron does not usually radiate an  
electromagnetic wave. The electron does not give up energy. The electron 
does  not spiral into the nucleus.                 


        >In Relational Mechanics, they're held in various orbits of 
        >near-constant radius by electric force         
   

The electron has a negative charge. 
The nucleus has a positive charge.       
The electric force pulls the electron and nucleus together.
The electron and nucleus do not come together. 
Something else must be stopping them.        


        >Relational Mechanics handles lasing easily.  


But the margin of your E mail message was too small to contain the marvelous 
proof of it that you discovered.


        >The Michelson-Morley experiment perfectly corroborates the ballistic         
        >theory of light.  Doesn't everyone know  this?          


No, everyone doesn't know this.                


        >Sheesh!!!  Gravitational redshift is perfectly predicted by the

This said from a man who thinks a red filter produces a redshift.

Rather a cavalier attitude to take toward experimental results from someone

          >on which Relational Mechanics takes no position   
          

Then you've been beaten by the competition because General Relativity did 
take a position, it predicted the gravity waves would exist and said exactly 
how intense they'd be. Taylor and Hulse proved the prediction correct.  


In my last post I mentioned the orbit of Mercury and said:  
" General relativity predicts  42.98, the observed value is 43.11 +- .21"

Tony responded to my comment with the following:

It's English, I recognize the words and it seems to obey the rules of  
grammar, but if anybody has an idea of what the above could mean I wish  
they'd drop me a line.


        >Sheesh!!! Time is a _dimension_.  You never studied Dimensional         
        >Analysis?


You say time is a dimension and you say it's a dimension that doesn't measure 
anything. You might as well say time is a teapot. I'm going to  repeat my 
question and see if you'll answer it this time, but you'll probably just say 
"ballistic theory" has it all figured out or point to another philosophy book.    

If this thing you call "time" is not a measure of how particles of matter and 
energy interact, such as the particles in my clock my body my brain or my 
world, then why should I be the slightest bit interest in it? 


        >'time dilation' is positivistic. I don't buy into positivistic stuff         
        >it's all obsolete.


I close by quoting again from Stephen Hawking's book:       

  "I have been variously called a nominalist, an instrumentalist, 
   a positivist, a realist, and several other ists. The technique seems 
   to be refutation by denigration: If you can attach a label to my 
   approach, you don't have to say what is wrong with it. Surely everyone 
   knows the fatal errors of all those isms. The people who actually make 
   the advances in theoretical physics don't think in the categories that 
   the philosophers and historians of science subsequently invent for them. 
   I am sure that Einstein, Heisenberg, and Dirac didn't worry about whether 
   they were realists or instrumentalists. They were simply concerned that 
   the existing theories didn't fit together"

No.  B is alpha -null (the number of integers) and C is the number of points

equal to alpha-one (2^B) has never been proven and remains of the great
mysteries of mathematics.

Cantor also showed that C^C = F > C where F is the number of all one valued 
functions,  there are more curves in the plane than there are points. 
It's known that F is one of the alpha numbers (alpha -two?) but it's not 
known which one.

0) I walked into a non destructive transporter.

1) I walk out of it and look at machine and say: "I am the original"

2) I walk out of reproducer and look at machine and say: "I am the copy"

What is the problem?

Another scenario: 
I walk out of reproducer that look outside as a non destructive
transporter and look at machine and say: "I am the original". Then I
see the original and here is discussion:
There ensues discussion about who is original.
Result: I don't know who is original, somebody has cheated somewhere,
but so what. I think that I'm either original or copy and so thinks
that other too.

Here is another:
What it 'feels' like dying? Okay lets try it. I make a copy myself.
1) I'm listening what my copy says and following brain waves.
2) I'm going to jump into a volcano. I'm going to die but so what.
Original still continues and only thing that is actually lost is more
detailed information about how it feels like dying. I guess that
someday I should make this test make detailed recording about firings
between neural cells. I tell it to original. I'm not actually dying
because I'm not losing memory of past neither future of doing several
things because I'm continuing living in original. It would be
different if this happened year after copying... Know I'm not losing
anything expect I need some energy and material to make another
copy. Im jumping. It's hot...

Summary:
Hardest thing is to stop associating yourself with your body.  Your
memories and algorithms (thoughts) are kind of immaterial.  For example:
I can express letter 'A' in several ways: Write it into paper. Bits in
computer. Thought in my mind.  So letter 'A' while needing
material/energy to exist is kind of immaterial or independent any
particular material expression.

  CNN's IAN GODDARD TWA 800 "PLOT" 


  (c) 1997 Ian Williams Goddard

  I've tried to decisively extricate myself from my TWA 800 
  inquiry, but it seems that CNN and the gov't don't want me
  to go. CNN is spreading gross misinformation on television, 
  indicating that I said my inquiry into TWA 800  was part of 
  a "sham" and a "plot."  That is FALSE!! I've always promoted 
  what I believe, and now I believe promoting the Navy-missile 
  theory was a big mistake! I believe that the evidence is not 
  sufficient to blame the Navy and I wish to move away from 
  that and all areas of conspiracy inquiry forever. But I 
  never said my inquiries were a "plot" or a "sham."

  Christine Negroni with CNN contacted me a few days ago to 
  ask about my change of direction,  I did not contact her. 
  CNN reports now suggest that I said my conspiracy inquiry 
  was part of a "plot" (a secret scheme) to do damage to 
  the government's reputation. That's 100% FALSE !! 

  My only crime is honesty. I'm honest enough to admit, 
  as I have for months, that my inquiry into TWA 800 was
  an effort to identify untruth in the government. I have
  a fact-based bias against government, I'm a libertarian. 
  My webpage was entitled "Anti-Authoritarian Journal," 
  identifying my bias up front, unlike most sources.

  Such up-front honesty is NOT a "plot," as CNN attempts to 
  portray it. The fact is that anything that is labeled what 
  it is up front is by definition NOT a plot. I'd say CNN 
  has a bias for the gov't line, however, does CNN label 
  its journalism "Authoritarian Journalism?" No. 


  WITNESSES NOT MY FAULT

  I did not invent nor am I to blame for the fact that 150+ 
  witnesses reported having seen something fly upwards and 
  explode at the spot TWA 800 was. That there were such wit-
  nesses, up to 154, has been widely reported in the media. 

  CNN just reported in reference to me:

      Joe Lychner of Houston, who lost his wife 
      and two daughters in the crash, told CNN 
      that Goddard and Salinger owe an explana-
      tion to the American public.

  The basis of the missile theory are the witnesses, and I 
  did not invent the witnesses. If anyone owes America an 
  explanation for the missile theory I think it's the wit-
  nesses, not me. All I did was report what they said and 
  commit the error of theorizing that maybe that fiery 
  thing shooting up was a Navy missile and the Navy is 
  covering it up. I also did not invent the Navy-missile 
  theory. My explanation for that theory is that the Navy 
  is known to have many missiles and is known to be off-
  shore where the plane crashed. However, an inventory 
  showed that all Navy missiles were accounted for...

  OK fine, I'm ready to move on, but it seems they aren't:

  National Transportation and Safety Board spokesman Peter 
  Goelz told CNN that my re-reporting of witness accounts 
  and theorizing that the Navy was at fault has done "real 
  damage" and "caused innumerable people great agony." Wow! 
  It seems I'm a human monster of immense proportions.

  I am sorry for that, yet it would seem that the fault 
  lies in part and primarily with the major media for ever 
  having reported the witness accounts in the first place. 
  I then made the mistake of suggesting that the Navy may
  have been at fault and is covering it up, which I now see
  as a mistake, for I could be wrong and if I'm wrong I've 
  impugned the reputations of America's finest, which is 
  something I should not and do not now want to do, and
  for which having done in the past, I am very sorry.

  I don't know what happened to TWA 800, and at this
  point I don't care! I just want to be left alone and 
  no longer harassed by the major media and others over 
  the TWA 800 case. I'm sorry I thought the Navy did it.
  It was a mistaken thought. I'm sorry my thoughts have 
  "caused innumerable people great agony." I'm a humani-
  tarian and have been a vegetarian for 19 years because 
  I want NOT to cause suffering to any living being.


  CNN's "SECRET SCHEME" THEORY

  I've never published anything I thought was false. I 
  even published errata notices when required. All claims 
  I've made were meticulously referenced so that readers 
  could check up on what I said for themselves. Providing 
  not just referenced information and ideas but all the 
  links necessary to access the larger body of information 
  about the case is what made my reports so popular and 
  what made this little guy the focus of world news. 

  My plan has been to end my "war on the Establishment."
  Wanting to move on from conspiracy theory and set a new 
  course, I asked Doctor David Stern, who hosts the DEEP 
  TIMES webpage, to remove my conspiracy reports. However,
  due to CNN's misleading charges that I've admitted to 
  having been engaged in a "plot" and thus that I will-
  fully attempted to mislead people to believe what I 
  knew to be false, I have requested that David Stern 
  temporarily replace all my reports so that people can 
  judge for themselves if I was the liar CNN suggests. 

  It will take David some time to get the reports back 
  up, but when they are up you can access them directly 
  at: http://www.copi.com/articles/Goddard or indirectly 
  at: http://www.copi.com/articles/. Please check the 
  first site within the next few days.

Yes and no.  Silicon-germanium technology does fill in the mid-range
semiconductor spectrum between gallium arsenide and silicon.  However,
gallium arsenide still offers advantages in areas such as energy efficiency
and in ultra-high performance.  As for the effect on TriQuint's business
(an impact that will take at least a year to materialize), it will be on
the low-end of their market segment, where they have been competing against
silicon for many years.  They will most likely remain competitive in the
high-end arena, which is where they make most of their money anyway.  Note
that in addition to ASIC and general purpose gallium arsenide fabrication,
a significant part of their business is also in high-performance
communication semiconductor design.  They have significant experience in
developing gigabit datacomm switches (up to 20 Gbits/sec off-the-shelf) for
fiber and high-speed wire applications.

This is not quite right; it is easy to show that 2^B equals C, where B
is aleph-null.  Simply identify the points on the unit segment with their
representation in base two.  The number of possible binary representations
of length n is 2^n, so the total number of binary representations of
length aleph-null is 2^aleph-null, and that is the number of points on
the line.  (This is a slight oversimplification but it is the basic idea.)

The Continuum Hypothesis does say that C is equal to aleph-one, but the
issue in question is what is aleph-one.  There are no sets known to
have the cardinality of aleph-one, as I understand it.  Aleph-one is
defined as the smallest cardinal greater than aleph-zero.

The Continuum Hypothesis (CH) is known to be undecideable under current
axioms of set theory.  Here is what Rudy Rucker says about possible
resolutions, from Infinity and the Mind:

"In the late 1960s, Kurt Godel did suggest some new axioms that would
decide the size of C.  These were the so-called omega-square and
aleph-one-square axioms....  At first it was thought that these two
axioms, plus one other, implied that C = aleph-two.  But then Gaisi
Takeuti showed that on the basis of the two square axioms alone, one
can prove that C = aleph-one.  At present, there are no very popular
axioms that imply that C is not equal to aleph-one, so it may be that
CH will come to be accepted in the future.

"One might hope that simply by thinking about C and aleph-one, one could
decide whether or not CH is plausible.  In 1934, Waclaw Sierpinski did
womething like this in assembling a book of eighty-eight statements
equivalent to CH.  But none of these statements is obviously true or
false - although in his famous 1947 essay, 'What is Cantor's Continuum
Problem?,' Godel claimed that some of the equivalents of the continuum
hypothesis were 'highly implausible.'"

This is something they don't talk about much in math class - what do
you do when your axioms have failed you and can't decide a question?
What kind of reasoning works, how do you approach the problem?  It is
related to such issues as Penrose's "proof" that Godel's theorem implies
that machines cannot think.

The question is whether the task of finding new axioms is itself one
which can be described formally and axiomatically, or equivalently,
one which can be captured in a computer program.  Or do we somehow
have a non-axiomatic component which leads us to truth, as Penrose
believes?  This problem might be a good test case.  It sounds like the
preference is to set C = aleph-one, although maybe Godel was pushing
for C = aleph-two.  Would Penrose claim that we have an infallible
non-axiomatic intuition which guarantees that we make the right choice?
I don't understand his argument well enough to know what he would say.

Yes, if found out of context.  However, as used in the word "entropy", 
My American Heritage says "...Greek 'trope' [long e], 'transformation'", 
then introduces more complexity in the definition of the Indo-European 
word root "trep-", covered in the Appendix.

Transformation and change are fine Extropian concepts -- i.e., "tropy"
is fine, it's entropy we shun.  "Entropy" was a coined term to begin
with (Maybe it was a depressed German who decided to use "in change" to 
mean basically "running down").  Both "negentropy" and "extropy" place 
a Latin prefix on a Greek root (yes, "en-" is also Greek), but so what?
They get the point across.

Hello all,

Yesterday we went to the Notary to sign the papers for Alcor.
I explained my family what was expected of them by signing
these papers. Some of the papers have their name on it and are not
really necessary to complete the sign-up process. Still it can make a
few things a whole lot easier, if you get their permission up front.

The notary however started with a statement in which he said he
didn't have much faith in the US-law and that he recommended them
to re-read carefully once more. Regardless of this claim the atmosphere
changed in the office, as you can imagine. To keep the discussion
clear and free from a lot of emotions, I decided to not go ahead with these
forms, and re-read/discuss them at home. We did sign the papers needed
for me personal an I also learned that my testament/will (in English by
Alcor)
wasn't accepted by the Dutch law according to the notary.
Again, I did go ahead to keep the process going, but I will investigate
this
of cause.

My Sister had a good point though, which I also try to sort out.
Since the papers of Alcor, ask some sort of "active" cooperation when 
you are found to be dead, she foresees to much involvement in a time
when she's not in a "state" to help. This is by far the best reason to have
our own network in the Netherlands. So that we can help each other, all
people who really understand the wish, and see/feel what's at stake here.

Anyway, for my own family matters and to inform people on our site, 
I hope some of you will share some of their experiences with me regarding
the sign up process, and the involved relatives. All communication
aspects regarding the above are welcomed, since I want to learn myself
and inform others to the best of my knowledge. 

Thanks all,

Greetings,

Berrie

I've thought a little bit about this (because at first I found it a 
really weird statement). I myself always was very 'open' with 
information about me, not really paying attention on who might read my 
eMail, for an instance.

Unfortunately, it turned out that the wrong people DID read SOME of my 
private mail, and got a completely wrong impression. Now I have to say 
that anybody who writes anything not adressed to a public (like in 
mailing-lists) unencrypted is simply naive. The problem is not that much 
revealing something about your personality, but people who only get parts 
of the information and misunderstand it - without you having control over 
that. The greatest 'threat' I see is simply being quoted out of context 
by people with prejudices - and not even getting the opportunity of 
straightening such things out.

Same thing here: 'quoting out of context'. You could say that by giving 
yourself such a name, you provoke misunderstandings - on the other hand, 
why not express certain ideas in your name? Simply put: if you miss 
something interesting by prejudice (people with 'freaky' names can't be 
taken seriously or the like), it's your own fault.

Maybe the problem is people identifying themselves with something like 
'cypherpunk'. This is, btw, one thing I'd criticise about Extropianism: 
in many places, you can read something like 'Extropians do this or that'. 
It may not be a problem for people who understand extropianism because I 
think it's quite explicitely about diversity and openness, but with any 
closed group, where people identify themselves with the group (with 
statements like "I'm a pothead", or "I'm a communist"), I've often seen 
how people hide their identity behind a group-name, which might explain 
why some of 'cypherpunks' are not really interesting (and I still would 
first listen to what such a person has to say)

later,
Holger

|
|  CNN's IAN GODDARD TWA 800 "PLOT"
|
|
|  (c) 1997 Ian Williams Goddard
|
|  I've tried to decisively extricate myself from my TWA 800
|  inquiry, but it seems that CNN and the gov't don't want me
|  to go. CNN is spreading gross misinformation on television,
|  indicating that I said my inquiry into TWA 800  was part of
|  a "sham" and a "plot."  That is FALSE!! I've always promoted
|  what I believe, and now I believe promoting the Navy-missile
|  theory was a big mistake! I believe that the evidence is not
|  sufficient to blame the Navy and I wish to move away from
|  that and all areas of conspiracy inquiry forever. But I
|  never said my inquiries were a "plot" or a "sham."
|
|  Christine Negroni with CNN contacted me a few days ago to
|  ask about my change of direction,  I did not contact her.
|  CNN reports now suggest that I said my conspiracy inquiry
|  was part of a "plot" (a secret scheme) to do damage to
|  the government's reputation. That's 100% FALSE !!
|
|  My only crime is honesty. I'm honest enough to admit,
|  as I have for months, that my inquiry into TWA 800 was
|  an effort to identify untruth in the government. I have
|  a fact-based bias against government, I'm a libertarian.
|  My webpage was entitled "Anti-Authoritarian Journal,"
|  identifying my bias up front, unlike most sources.
|
|  Such up-front honesty is NOT a "plot," as CNN attempts to
|  portray it. The fact is that anything that is labeled what
|  it is up front is by definition NOT a plot. I'd say CNN
|  has a bias for the gov't line, however, does CNN label
|  its journalism "Authoritarian Journalism?" No.
|
|
|  WITNESSES NOT MY FAULT
|
|  I did not invent nor am I to blame for the fact that 150+
|  witnesses reported having seen something fly upwards and
|  explode at the spot TWA 800 was. That there were such wit-
|  nesses, up to 154, has been widely reported in the media.
|
|  CNN just reported in reference to me:
|
|      Joe Lychner of Houston, who lost his wife
|      and two daughters in the crash, told CNN
|      that Goddard and Salinger owe an explana-
|      tion to the American public.
|
|  The basis of the missile theory are the witnesses, and I
|  did not invent the witnesses. If anyone owes America an
|  explanation for the missile theory I think it's the wit-
|  nesses, not me. All I did was report what they said and
|  commit the error of theorizing that maybe that fiery
|  thing shooting up was a Navy missile and the Navy is
|  covering it up. I also did not invent the Navy-missile
|  theory. My explanation for that theory is that the Navy
|  is known to have many missiles and is known to be off-
|  shore where the plane crashed. However, an inventory
|  showed that all Navy missiles were accounted for...
|
|  OK fine, I'm ready to move on, but it seems they aren't:
|
|  National Transportation and Safety Board spokesman Peter
|  Goelz told CNN that my re-reporting of witness accounts
|  and theorizing that the Navy was at fault has done "real
|  damage" and "caused innumerable people great agony." Wow!
|  It seems I'm a human monster of immense proportions.
|
|  I am sorry for that, yet it would seem that the fault
|  lies in part and primarily with the major media for ever
|  having reported the witness accounts in the first place.
|  I then made the mistake of suggesting that the Navy may
|  have been at fault and is covering it up, which I now see
|  as a mistake, for I could be wrong and if I'm wrong I've
|  impugned the reputations of America's finest, which is
|  something I should not and do not now want to do, and
|  for which having done in the past, I am very sorry.
|
|  I don't know what happened to TWA 800, and at this
|  point I don't care! I just want to be left alone and
|  no longer harassed by the major media and others over
|  the TWA 800 case. I'm sorry I thought the Navy did it.
|  It was a mistaken thought. I'm sorry my thoughts have
|  "caused innumerable people great agony." I'm a humani-
|  tarian and have been a vegetarian for 19 years because
|  I want NOT to cause suffering to any living being.
|
|
|  CNN's "SECRET SCHEME" THEORY
|
|  I've never published anything I thought was false. I
|  even published errata notices when required. All claims
|  I've made were meticulously referenced so that readers
|  could check up on what I said for themselves. Providing
|  not just referenced information and ideas but all the
|  links necessary to access the larger body of information
|  about the case is what made my reports so popular and
|  what made this little guy the focus of world news.
|
|  My plan has been to end my "war on the Establishment."
|  Wanting to move on from conspiracy theory and set a new
|  course, I asked Doctor David Stern, who hosts the DEEP
|  TIMES webpage, to remove my conspiracy reports. However,
|  due to CNN's misleading charges that I've admitted to
|  having been engaged in a "plot" and thus that I will-
|  fully attempted to mislead people to believe what I
|  knew to be false, I have requested that David Stern
|  temporarily replace all my reports so that people can
|  judge for themselves if I was the liar CNN suggests.
|
|  It will take David some time to get the reports back
|  up, but when they are up you can access them directly
|  at: http://www.copi.com/articles/Goddard or indirectly
|  at: http://www.copi.com/articles/. Please check the
|  first site within the next few days.

At this very moment, I don't think there is that much need to solve this 
problem. The technology to copy yourself is out of reach, isn't it? 
Before that, we're facing another problem: what about simulated 
consciousness. We kill most animals without really caring, but what about 
killing a simulation of a human identity - simply switching the power off 
and deleting the information?

We are all humans and believe that we all have consciousness, currently, 
I don't see any way to prove this. I know that I am real, and that I have 
a consciousness, but the whole world around may be just simulated 
(maybe we've had nanotech milleniums ago, and my current 'experience' is 
just an attempt to understand ancient biological organisms). It's 
pointless to discuss this, but I think it illustrates the problem very well.

Even when you completely understand the brain, it's just like completely 
understanding a computer. Does Eliza have a consciousness or not? If I 
scan my brain, and have a simulation of my personality in a computer 
(which will probably be easier than copying myself), does this simulation 
have a right to 'live'? Even if I can't experience what this simulation 
experiences, I'd still try to protect it because it could completely 
replace me (maybe the computer is simply better), and then could be the 
one who decides about what is done with me (the simulation also can't 
prove that I have a consciousness).

That's something you could control: before duplicating yourself, 
understand that after duplication, you can either be the real one, or the 
duplicate - then, look at the place where you get scanned, and the place 
where the copy is 'created'. After duplication, you have an easy way to 
decide whether you're the original or the copy - but you will also know 
that to the outside world, it doesn't make ANY difference. Of course, you 
will remain in your body. You could consider your duplicate some sort of 
'child' - only that from the first moment, it has your 'functionality'.

That's the major problem: the world will never find out that you were 
actually blown out of existance.

YOU won't be dup2, but you can be sure that dup2 feels exactly the way 
you do (at least for the first few moments).

That's quite an interesting thing: _I_ would probably go mad after 
transportation, because my new instance couldn't deal with the fact that 
I was wiped out. Someone who believes that it works (that the 
consciousness is transported with the information), would feel fine (and 
the original wouldn't care because it simply does not exist anymore).

The way uploading is described in the Extropian-FAQ seems possible, but 
if that works, 'transporters' like in Star Trek will be completely 
obsolete (you simply download a part of you to any place, then scan that 
'instance' of you after it made some experiences, and by that expand your 
consciousness - you won't be able to experience what your new instance 
experiences first hand, unless you're connected in any way - but that 
doesn't really matter... only if that instance gets destroyed before you 
can access the new information)

This is the concept of 'soul' right? I do exist, but only because my 
brain and body exist (the brain seems more important, but it will 
probably be possible to simulate the body, so my 'consciousness' won't 
even realize it).

I think this is the most relevant part. I think I do understand what you 
mean by effing now, but I don't think it will help finding out where 
'consciousness' is. This will be quite interesting, for example you'll be 
able to experience things exactly like other people, maybe even computers 
- but it's still YOU who makes this experience, and it won't help you 
prove another consciousness. It will also not help transferring your 
consciousness. Mind merging could be possible, though.

I don't think so. By certain substances, you can alter the chemistry in 
your brain, which also changes your consciousness temporarily. If you 
know how extreme some of these substances are, this gives you a vague 
idea what 'uploading' means, I guess (it's even more different... a LOT 
more different).

I don't think this really helps (at least it doesn't make it clear to me)

I wish one could finally prove 'soul' - that would make it SO much 
easier! If 'soul' was a not yet discovered energy, you could look 
for ways to redirect that energy. Unfortunately, this does not seem to be 
'real'...

sorry for the long posting, I hope it showed some new aspects...

later,

      How To Make People Hate 'The Authorities' _On Principle_

   (Actually, I dare say that many of the Framers of the American

   responsible for attacking Shirley Allen in such a manner.  Is the

 Roby Ridge Siege Ends. Now we must:
 
                      REMEMBER ROBY!
 
      "We must never forget how Illinois State Police Trampled the U. S. 
      Constitution and The Bill of Rights in Roby, Illinois"
 
      By WebToday Staff Writers
 
      Saturday, November 1, 1997, 3:15 p.m. Central Time USA 
 
 ROBY, ILLINOIS (November 1, 1997)-- After being assaulted over the 
 weekend with nine canisters of police pepper, Shirley Allen was long 
 overdue for some fresh air.  After all, Illinois State Police gave their 
 word they would not use force any more on her, so perhaps 51-year-old 
 widow Shirley Allen believed them.  But when she stepped out of her home 
 and on to her porch a group of grown men jumped out of the
 bushes, shot her in the chest with hard rubber bullets, and tackled her.

 Certainly these bullies couldn't be from the police, could they?
 
 They certainly were. On Thursday, October 30, 1997, the longest police 
 siege in Illinois history ended on day 39.
 
 From that point on it was rather routine. Just as Jack Nicholson fought 
 the good fight against Nurse Ratchet in One flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest 
 only to be given electroshock treatment to the point of becoming a 
 compliant vegetable, so Shirley Allen was involuntarily committed to the 
 mental wing of St. John's Hospital for "psychiatric evaluation."

 
 What will become of Shirley Allen only God knows. Having absolutely no
 history of violence, Mrs. Allen's only blemish on her record is a ticket 
 for running a stop sign.  Yet her case is sealed and not available to 
 reporters or the public.


 Associate Judge (not even a full judge) David Slater issued a court order 
 (not even a warrant) for the involuntary commitment of Mrs. Allen during 
 a hearing she not even allowed to attend in a flagrant end run around the 
 Constitution.

 
 For over 30 days of the siege Mrs. Allen was deprived of food, water,
 electricity, heat, telephone, clergy visits and legal counsel. During 
 that time she was was subjected to day and night psychological warfare, 
 the likes of which could have put any sane person over the edge, 
 including 6 grenades of tear gas, 9 canisters of pepper gas, and a 
 cowardly dog attack (that the resourceful Allen countered by
 mercifully shooting he dog through the nose rather than killing it). 

 
 Beyond that, police for many successive days assaulted Allen with sleep
 deprivation techniques including waking her every 15 minutes day and 
 night with electronically amplified voices and blaring music that was so 
 loud neighbors could hear it two miles away. It was a miracle she 
 survived the prolonged torture that eclipsed limits imposed by the Geneva 
 Convention for humane treatment of prisoners of war.

 
 Have the citizens of the United States now become the enemy? How is it 
 that government officials have the right to risk driving an allegedly 
 suicidal woman to the brink of suicide?  The sad fact remains that we may 
 never know how much of Shirley's current mental condition was a direct 
 result of nearly of a million dollar taxpayer financed obsessive war game 
 waged against a single citizen by Illinois State Police Director Terry 
 Gainer.

 
 Several glaring questions remain during Shirley Allen's closed door
 "evaluation."  Have we learned anything from the 39-nine day siege? Who 
 will tend Mrs. Allen's mortgage free 46 acre estate? Who will receive the 
 royalties from the oil well on her property? What happened to Mrs. 
 Allen's Certificates of Deposit (in excess of $100,000) she inherited 
 from her deceased husband? Will any legislator submit legislation to 
 reform mental health laws in Illinois? Will Terry Gainer be dismissed
 or promoted? 

 
 We must never forget how Illinois State Police trampled The U. S. 
 Constitution and The Bill of Rights in Roby, Illinois from September 22 
 until October 30,  1997.  We must Remember Roby. We must Remember Roby. 
 We must...


             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------
   Practical action steps that may be taken on behalf of Shirley Allen:
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

 * Call St. John's Hospital, Springfield (217-544-6464) and ask to speak 
 with Shirley. If denied access, ask for the attending physician.  Ask 
 them to take into consideration that Shirley had no record of aggressive 
 behavior prior to the siege, and that she has been through sleep 
 depravation and denied water for over a month, and that any sane person 
 might exhibit less than stellar mental health after that ordeal.

 
 * Ask to speak with Shirley's appointed lawyer and ask if he would
   work with Jerry Spence or any other capable lawyer (or pro se advisor) 
   who is willing to help her. 

 * Call Illinois Attorney General Jim Ryan to allow Shirley to choose her 
   own lawyer, and a psychiatrist rather than state employees who may be
   beholden to the establishment. 

 * Contact Gubernatorial Candidate George Ryan (Currently Secretary of 
  State) to intercede on behalf of Shirley. 

 * Call Sangamo County Associate Judge Robert Hall. He is the new
  judge who is involved now. Judge Slater is a Christian County Judge. Now
  Shirley Allen is incarcerated in a psychiatric wing of a Sangamon County 
  Hospital.  Judge Hall will set time and date of a sanity hearing against 
  Shirley.  He also will appoint a lawyer for her. He has enormous power 
  for an Associate Judge (not even a full judge).
 
 *  Demand a jury trial for Shirley. It's her right according to Illinois 
    law.  The catch is that she must request it and she probably doesn't
    know it's her right. Ask the judge if he's notified her of that right. 
    If not, ask him to notify her of that right immediately.

      I occasionally see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel on

      John, here's a reprise of my school-days odyssey...

      I grew up uner the shadows of thermonuclear weapons, and as a kid, I 
      depserately wanted to get (some of) us off the planet, and into some 
      sort of open future off-world.  I read a lot of science fiction, and 
      -- as I read the stories -- thought on three levels:

      [1] Is this idea physically and technically possible?

      [2] If not, how near can we get to it?

      [3] If we can't do it, what can we do which will achieve the same 
      purpose?


      Aged 11, despite various barbarisms (ferinstance, being repeatedly 
      caned on the outstretched fingers of my left hand, in a - failed - 
      attempt to make me right-handed), I 'won' the top scholarship in my 
      primary school, despite only three years of formal education.  (I 
      was near-autistic for a while -- I used to 'disappear' into books 
      and their 'alternative universes' for hours and days on end).

      Read Alice Miller, "For Your Own Good", on the horrors of 
      contemporary pedagogy...

      At my Dulwich College entrance interview, I was asked by the 
      headmaster what I wanted to do.

      I replied honestly: "I want to be a rocket scientist, and get us off 
      this planet."

      I was told that there would be no rockets; therefore, there would be 
      no rocket scientists; and that I would instead be made into a a 
      _lawyer_... 

      This -- to me -- stated: "There will _be no future_."

      (You will notice that the 'United Kingdom' now has no space 
      programme, except for a small piece of Arianespace; oh, and some 
      militarily useless American Trident missiles, dependent on -- 
      American -- terminal guidance).

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

      Still, I persevered.  In the -- hopelessly ineptly-taught -- physics 
      classes, it was clear that we were being taught _obsolete rubbish_.  
      Equally clearly;  if I wanted to get bits of paper ('credentials') 
      to be an engineer or physicist, I had to (learn to) absorb and 
      regurgitate their absurdities.

      Worse:  the moment the 'authorities' spotted that you _wanted 
      something from them_, they used that to _control you_.  I didn't 
      want to be 'controlled'...  Among the methods of 'control' were 
      savage and protracted beatings (often in front of invited audiences, 
      who got their 'jollies' from watching avidly, while they did rude 
      things to themselves 'discreetly' under newspapers); endless  
      'detentions' (that is, three hour imprisonments); and physical 
      ordeals of various kinds (five mile runs after lessons, etc. etc.).

      I was 'suspended' seven times, and 'asked to leave' _twice_ (a 
      record of sorts, I understand!).  On the final occasion, aged 
      sixteen [1958], I was ordered to cut up sheets of newsprint with a 
      blunt pair of scissors, for use in experiments tracing the paths of 
      light through glass blocks, using pins as line-of-sight markers.

      [ FX: "Pinlighting is a hell of a way to earn a living..." ]

      True story: In frustration, I hauled out my bright, shiny 11" bladed 
      Bowie knife, and hacked the paper into handy-sized pieces...  The 
      physics teacher (one Mr. Tapper -- "One Nation under Surveillance, 
      with Wiretaps and Mail Covers for All"), turned white, summoned me 
      into a box-room, and told me to discard this terrible instrument.  I 
      did so, but there was a hell of a 'clunk' as the matching holstered 
      .22 caliber pistol hit the shelf...  >:-} ).

      Later that day (one of the happiest of my life!)  I was told by my 
      Mum that Dulwich College had phoned, and had said that I would not 
      be returning to them. Victory!!!  "Free at last!!!"

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

      So, you see, I don't really want you telling me I should read school 
      textbooks (i.e. prison instruction manuals -- just another 
      subjectivist 'argument from authority').  I have _already_ read too 
      many of them -- it's their _failures_ that played a large part in my 
      learning to use my _own_ intelligence. Indeed, it was <inter alai> 
      Jeremy Bernstein's -- utterly incompetent -- book on Einstein's 
      'Relativity' that stimulated me to _solve_ these problems for myself 
      -- and hopefully for others also.

     The ballistic theory describes, predicts and explains interference. 
     Ballistic photons have _frequencies_ -- they're like tiny rotating 
     electric dipoles.  You _have_ to learn to understand this stuff. 
     Feynman can -- why the hell can't you?

      I'm not telling you She's crazy.  I might ask you to be a bit less 
      credulous.  I have here a brilliant, glorious, funny book,  "Catching 
      the Light", Bantam, [1993], by Arthur Zajonc, Fulbright Scholar and 
      Professor of Physics at Amherst, which -- after a bewildering series 
      of polar flip-flops on the wave-or-particle nature of light issue -- 
      finally owns up, and tells us that all these 'quantum weirdness' 
      light phenomena only exhibit themseves with single-photon 'quantum' 
      light sources, which are very recent... atomic cascades, and 
      two-photon, parametric, down-conversion sources.  Don't try your 
      intellectual intimidation on me -- I _know_ all this stuff...
      
      I don't say it's impossible, but you might try to find a solid 
      citation for single-photon interference.  Obviously, you cannot 
      possibly demonstrate it with just one photon.  (This is obvious, 
      isn't it?)

      And you might at least make an effort to understand the idea of 
      individual photons having inherent physical propensities (along with 
      velocity, polarization, mass, frequency, direction and intensity), 
      which govern their behaviour within the overall propensities of the 
      experimental situation.

      Here's Arthur Zajonc with a last word on the likes of Hawking:

      "When we are confronted with the black void of pure instrumentalism, 
      the temptations of reactionary idolatry are very near.  Having lost 
      the Gods, we fall in love with the beautiful idols we can raise in 
      their places.  Atoms, quarks, tiny black holes... they are reified, 
      garlanded, and dragged forward to assume a place in the temple.  
      Calling them real, we animate them with the false life of fear, our 
      fear of the unknown being of Nature."

      Let me be more exact:  electrons in orbits around oppositely-charged 
      nuclei are in 'free-fall'; their _angular velocity_ is constant, 
      which is what matters for these purposes.

      "It's the inertia_, stupid!"  The goddamn photons have _intrinsic 
      mass_.  They're -- ipso facto -- subject to _gravitational force_.  
      That's what 'ballistic' _means_, fer chrissake!

      The problem you stubbornly fail to grasp is that -- as David Collier 
      says -- to write a full history of light is to write out the history 
      of physics.  Light ties the whole subject-area together -- that's 
      why it's so difficult for some people to see different theories of 
      light and compare them.  It shakes the whole foundation of physics 
      as people understand it.  Makes them feel _insecure_.

      You just tell me the bit in lasing that you think the ballistic 
      theory _doesn't_ explain.  Start with the standard quantum 
      explanation.  Don't ask me to post a book-length treatment of 
      lasers...

      Every half-way competent book on the subject acknowledges this.  
      The light-source remains stationary with respect to the entire 
      apparatus.  The apparatus does not alter in its dimensions. 
      Therefore, the ballistic theory predicts that since there is no 
      shift in the length of the light-paths, nor any change in the 
      velocity of light within the apparatus, the interference fringes 
      will remain unchanged whatever the orientation in space of the 
      apparatus.  How simple can anything get?

      You consistently fail to distinguish between Methodological 
      Scientific Research Programmes (like Relational Mechanics and 
      Quantum _theory_), and specific empirical questions, or auxilliary 
      hypotheses which are absorbed into the programme.  Relational 
      Mechanics handles it like this:

      "If (and only if) gravitational force is propagated with a finite 
      velocity relative to its source, the paths of distant bodies will be 
      altered from the paths predicted by an instantaneously interacting 
      gravitational force."

      It's so simple, yet so powerful.  Truly!  See it yet?

      (I think you'll find that's an overstatement of Einstein's position).

      Relational Mechanics says: "If you want to find out the velocity of 
      propagation of gravity (if any), here's how to go about it."  It's 
      _immensely_ powerful, as well as beautiful.  You just don't seem to 
      see this, for reasons I might speculate upon sometime.  >:-}.

     It doesn't get any simpler than this. It means that you can predict a 
     perihelion anomaly from a hypothesized finite velocity of propagation 
     of gravitational force;  AND:  that you can predict the velocity of 
     propagation of gravitational force back from the observed precession, 
     as compared to the predictions for instantaneous gravitational force 
     interaction.

      Time is a _dimension_, a measure-ratio, a _metric for Duration_.


      Here's Alfred O'Rahilly, Institute for Advanced Studies, Dublin

      "In the case of short time-intervals we have a primitive perception 
      of equality and inequality just as we have for short 
      space-intervals.  This is especially noticeable in the case of 
      auditory rhythm, e.g. the sound of a clock ticking or of an engine 
      running or of a musical instrument playing....  

      "Nowadays we measure long intervals by the periodic motions of the 
      heavenly bodies (rotation of the earth), and short intervals by 
      recurrent isochronous devices we may call clocks.  Here, as in other 
      cases such as that of temperature, we make successive refinements of 
      measurement by introducing corrections outside the previous limits 
      of accuracy.  For example, we make an immediate judgement that the 
      ordinary pendulum is isochronous, owing to the observed regularity 
      of its ticking.  With such a measure of time, we can verify the laws 
      of motion within the limits of experimental error.

      "With more refined instruments we discover small residual errors 
      below the limits of the initial direct observation.  We can account 
      for this by advancing (1) supplementary hypotheses (disturbing 
      forces), or (2) a slight modification of the suopposed law, or (3) a 
      small discrepancy in the isochronism.

      "In making a choice there is undoubtedly a mixture of convention with 
      observation.  But usually the probability is overwhelmingly in 
      favour of (3), so that the law keeps its original simple form and 
      yet accounts for apparent discrepancies without additional 
      hypotheses.  Our belief is corroborated if our improved clocks show 
      the laws to hold with a much higher degree of accuracy than that 
      with which we started.  There are in physics many examples of this 
      intensification of accuracy by successive corrections of a system of 
      measurement."

Anton, I missed your original post, catching it only via Kennita's response,
so I might have missed some vital context. 

I'd written:
>:...The roots "ex" and "tropy" essentially mean "out of" and "disorder."...

to which you responded (at least in part):
> Er, Tom, I think you'll find that _tropy_ means `turning'

Indeed, but it has other, more relevant meanings, too.  As Kennita pointed
out, the Greek root also means "transformation."  Furthermore, the definition
of the suffixed form "trop-ay" as in "entropy" is "change."  Granted that is
not *exactly* "disorder" but I hedged my claim with "essentially" to cover
the gap between literal definition of the root and modern understanding of
its use in the context of "entropy."  In the name of Bob, I thus call for
some slack!

Kennita charitably added:

>Both "negentropy" and "extropy" place a Latin prefix on a Greek root
>(yes, "en-" is also Greek), but so what? They get the point across.

My source on Indo-European roots classifies "ex" as a Greek root meaning "out
of, from," so I don't think that "extropy" improperly mixes roots.  It is
also a Latin root, with a similar meaning, but that shouldn't throw us.

The point here is, that different people have different senses of
self, and it might even vary during time or when they are in certain
states. So I introduced my two-variable self function to deal with
this. Of course, when you apply the self-function to somebody else,
you will most likely be wrong about that person's sense of self.

No. His self(me, myself) would evaluate to something. If this dualist
then realized the error of his ways he would become a slightly
different person, and his self(me', myself') could evaluate to
something else (but likely he would think he had not become somebody
different, just a bit more enlightened).

In what way? I would consider another entity which acted just like me
as another instance of me, a me-over-there which is another physical
instance of the abstract class 'Me' (of which I'm currently the only
instance).

Can you have an erroneous sense of selfhood? If I ask you if you are
yourself, would you be able to be mistaken? I would say that is not
possible; we may have stupid ideas about who we are, the philosophy of
identity or what we think is our self() functions, but deep down we
all feel a sense of identity to some extent. The attributes of our
selves are not relevant, what I was trying to model is personal
experience of self.

Knee jerk reaction (I'm tempted to say that's typical

another knee-jerk response ;-)  Speed-reading can

someone hypnotized by pseudoscience if you've
followed most of what he has posted to this list.

Thanks Damien for a very interesting post:
I had tried to read some of Ingo Swann's Web essay
but found it as inpenetrable as a remote-viewer's
report ;-)  Lyn Buchanan's Web site is another story,
particularly his critique of the Utts and Hyman report.

I'm not saying I 'believe' in this controled remote

principle.  It's interesting precisely because any
serious falsification of it is likely to teach us a
lot about  both the human mind and quantum uncertainty.

I considered this question myself and after reviewing Ander's identity calculus
paper I believe we have some of the same ideas.  However, for those of you
unwilling or unable to navigate Ander's mathematical arguments, here's a more
simplistic rendering.  Note:  This is my own version which may or may not agree
with Ander's work in its entirety.

Given that a person's mind is uploaded then what you actually have is a
snapshot of that person, not the person itself.  However, the person someone is
is the result of a process.  The process is the person navigating through
his/her experiences in life.  Those experiences, more importantly the reactions
the person formulates to those experiences, shape the person.  The concept of
personal identity has been generally attributed to the individual person
because a more profound or articulate definition has not been needed.

When a person's mind is uploaded and then "copied" or "downloaded" to two
separate forms, you now have a situation almost entirely alien to human
experience.  You now have two people with initially the same "mind" now able to
go off and have totally separate and different experiences.  The result of this
incongruity of experiences between the two means two different people will
result, perhaps not vastly different people but if you then compared their
minds there would be inconsistencies.

The big question is if you were the person initially uploaded and subsequently
downloaded into two different copies, which one would you be after a year's
time?  My view?  It's not easily answered.  If Copy A went to China and Copy B
went to New York City, odds are each would have vastly different day-today
experiences.  Thus, these different experiences would influence different
aspects of the original mind (the one initially uploaded) in different ways.
What if Copy B experienced a hard life while trying to attend college in NYC
where it was exposed to the starkness of city life and maybe even violently
robbed or attacked  while Copy A spent its time travelling the rural villages
of Mongolia and learning more of their culture.  Copy B might emerge a ruder,
more paranoid, more pessimistic person while Copy A might emerge more tolerant
of people's differences and more benevolent.

Now, back to the original question, which copy is you?  I think the problem
people have with this question is the word "You".  We continue to follow that
"self-identity related to a single body" concept when thinking of words "You",
"I", "Me", etc.  That concept is no longer tenable in this situation.  The
answer in my opinion is that BOTH copies are "You".  Copy A is what you would
be like after spending a year in NYC, Copy B is what you would be like after
spending a year touring Mongolia.  Both experiences would appear to be equally
valid, meaning Copy A is not a "better" approximation of you and Copy B is.

Permutations:  An interesting idea would be for a third copy of you to be made
using the original uploaded mind.  This Copy C could then "interview" Copy A
and Copy B and determine which one he/she (Copy C that is) liked better.  If
Copy C chose Copy A, then Copy C would have its mind "updated" with Copy A's
mind and Copy B could be "dealt with".  I use the phrase "dealt with" because
determining the rights a copy has is going to be a very interesting issue for
the legal systems of the future.  Is Copy B an experiment owned by Copy C to be
disposed of as Copy C wishes?  Or does Copy B's existence as a human give it
certain sovereign rights independent of the original mind?  Maybe I'll discuss
my thoughts on that at a later date.

Everyone's impression of me is wrong anyway, and always will be.
They make bad judgments even in the face of plain English in
context, so of course they'll do even worse faced with forgeries
or out of context quotes or misattributed statements.  That's life.
The question then becomes "Why do you allow yourself to be bothered
by other people's mistaken impressions?"

And the set of "people with prejudices" is mathematically equal to
the set of "people".  Prejudice is a universal, useful cognitive
function; it is often mistaken, but that's the tradeoff--speed for
accuracy.  Everyone makes those decisions as needed.

I do try to correct impressions when I can, but if someone is
content to think I'm an idiot or a jerk based on eir impressions,
and doesn't want to hear me argue otherwise, that's eir right,
and I just have to live with it.

Would you really be willing to jump into a volcano, just because another
copy of you will continue living?  I wouldn't, and I assume that copies
of me wouldn't either.  The problem is that some people believe that
copying is an acceptable way to prolong my life.  Even if the technology
becomes available, this solution is unacceptable to me, as I will not
experience any lengthening of life.

      John, here's a reprise of my school-days odyssey...

      I grew up uner the shadows of thermonuclear weapons, and as a kid, I 
      depserately wanted to get (some of) us off the planet, and into some 
      sort of open future off-world.  I read a lot of science fiction, and 
      -- as I read the stories -- thought on three levels:

      [1] Is this idea physically and technically possible?

      [2] If not, how near can we get to it?

      [3] If we can't do it, what can we do which will achieve the same 
      purpose?


      Aged 11, despite various barbarisms (ferinstance, being repeatedly 
      caned on the outstretched fingers of my left hand, in a - failed - 
      attempt to make me right-handed), I 'won' the top scholarship in my 
      primary school, despite only three years of formal education.  (I 
      was near-autistic for a while -- I used to 'disappear' into books 
      and their 'alternative universes' for hours and days on end).

      Read Alice Miller, "For Your Own Good", on the horrors of 
      contemporary pedagogy...

      At my Dulwich College entrance interview, I was asked by the 
      headmaster what I wanted to do.

      I replied honestly: "I want to be a rocket scientist, and get us off 
      this planet."

      I was told that there would be no rockets; therefore, there would be 
      no rocket scientists; and that I would instead be made into a a 
      _lawyer_... 

      This -- to me -- stated: "There will _be no future_."

      (You will notice that the 'United Kingdom' now has no space 
      programme, except for a small piece of Arianespace; oh, and some 
      militarily useless American Trident missiles, dependent on -- 
      American -- terminal guidance).

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

      Still, I persevered.  In the -- hopelessly ineptly-taught -- physics 
      classes, it was clear that we were being taught _obsolete rubbish_.  
      Equally clearly;  if I wanted to get bits of paper ('credentials') 
      to be an engineer or physicist, I had to (learn to) absorb and 
      regurgitate their absurdities.

      Worse:  the moment the 'authorities' spotted that you _wanted 
      something from them_, they used that to _control you_.  I didn't 
      want to be 'controlled'...  Among the methods of 'control' were 
      savage and protracted beatings (often in front of invited audiences, 
      who got their 'jollies' from watching avidly, while they did rude 
      things to themselves 'discreetly' under newspapers); endless  
      'detentions' (that is, three hour imprisonments); and physical 
      ordeals of various kinds (five mile runs after lessons, etc. etc.).

      I was 'suspended' seven times, and 'asked to leave' _twice_ (a 
      record of sorts, I understand!).  On the final occasion, aged 
      sixteen [1958], I was ordered to cut up sheets of newsprint with a 
      blunt pair of scissors, for use in experiments tracing the paths of 
      light through glass blocks, using pins as line-of-sight markers.

      [ FX: "Pinlighting is a hell of a way to earn a living..." ]

      True story: In frustration, I hauled out my bright, shiny 11" bladed 
      Bowie knife, and hacked the paper into handy-sized pieces...  The 
      physics teacher (one Mr. Tapper -- "One Nation under Surveillance, 
      with Wiretaps and Mail Covers for All"), turned white, summoned me 
      into a box-room, and told me to discard this terrible instrument.  I 
      did so, but there was a hell of a 'clunk' as the matching holstered 
      .22 caliber pistol hit the shelf...  >:-} ).

      Later that day (one of the happiest of my life!)  I was told by my 
      Mum that Dulwich College had phoned, and had said that I would not 
      be returning to them. Victory!!!  "Free at last!!!"

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

      So, you see, I don't really want you telling me I should read school 
      textbooks (i.e. prison instruction manuals -- just another 
      subjectivist 'argument from authority').  I have _already_ read too 
      many of them -- it's their _failures_ that played a large part in my 
      learning to use my _own_ intelligence. Indeed, it was <inter alai> 
      Jeremy Bernstein's -- utterly incompetent -- book on Einstein's 
      'Relativity' that stimulated me to _solve_ these problems for myself 
      -- and hopefully for others also.

     The ballistic theory describes, predicts and explains interference. 
     Ballistic photons have _frequencies_ -- they're like tiny rotating 
     electric dipoles.  You _have_ to learn to understand this stuff. 
     Feynman can -- why the hell can't you?

      I'm not telling you She's crazy.  I might ask you to be a bit less 
      credulous.  I have here a brilliant, glorious, funny book,  "Catching 
      the Light", Bantam, [1993], by Arthur Zajonc, Fulbright Scholar and 
      Professor of Physics at Amherst, which -- after a bewildering series 
      of polar flip-flops on the wave-or-particle nature of light issue -- 
      finally owns up, and tells us that all these 'quantum weirdness' 
      light phenomena only exhibit themseves with single-photon 'quantum' 
      light sources, which are very recent... atomic cascades, and 
      two-photon, parametric, down-conversion sources.  Don't try your 
      intellectual intimidation on me -- I _know_ all this stuff...
      
      I don't say it's impossible, but you might try to find a solid 
      citation for single-photon interference.  Obviously, you cannot 
      possibly demonstrate it with just one photon.  (This is obvious, 
      isn't it?)

      And you might at least make an effort to understand the idea of 
      individual photons having inherent physical propensities (along with 
      velocity, polarization, mass, frequency, direction and intensity), 
      which govern their behaviour within the overall propensities of the 
      experimental situation.

      Here's Arthur Zajonc with a last word on the likes of Hawking:

      "When we are confronted with the black void of pure instrumentalism, 
      the temptations of reactionary idolatry are very near.  Having lost 
      the Gods, we fall in love with the beautiful idols we can raise in 
      their places.  Atoms, quarks, tiny black holes... they are reified, 
      garlanded, and dragged forward to assume a place in the temple.  
      Calling them real, we animate them with the false life of fear, our 
      fear of the unknown being of Nature."

      Let me be more exact:  electrons in orbits around oppositely-charged 
      nuclei are in 'free-fall'; their _angular velocity_ is constant, 
      which is what matters for these purposes.

      True (usually, though check out neutrons).

      "It's the inertia_, stupid!"  The goddamn photons have _intrinsic 
      mass_.  They're -- ipso facto -- subject to _gravitational force_.  
      That's what 'ballistic' _means_, fer chrissake!

      The problem you stubbornly fail to grasp is that -- as David Collier 
      says -- to write a full history of light is to write out the history 
      of physics.  Light ties the whole subject-area together -- that's 
      why it's so difficult for some people to see different theories of 
      light and compare them.  It shakes the whole foundation of physics 
      as people understand it.  Makes them feel _insecure_.

      You just tell me the bit in lasing that you think the ballistic 
      theory _doesn't_ explain.  Start with the standard quantum 
      explanation.  Don't ask me to post a book-length treatment of 
      lasers...

      Every half-way competent book on the subject acknowledges this.  
      The light-source remains stationary with respect to the entire 
      apparatus.  The apparatus does not alter in its dimensions. 
      Therefore, the ballistic theory predicts that since there is no 
      shift in the length of the light-paths, nor any change in the 
      velocity of light within the apparatus, the interference fringes 
      will remain unchanged whatever the orientation in space of the 
      apparatus.  How simple can anything get?

      You consistently fail to distinguish between Methodological 
      Scientific Research Programmes (like Relational Mechanics and 
      Quantum _theory_), and specific empirical questions, or auxilliary 
      hypotheses which are absorbed into the programme.  Relational 
      Mechanics handles it like this:

      "If (and only if) gravitational force is propagated with a finite 
      velocity relative to its source, the paths of distant bodies will be 
      altered from the paths predicted by an instantaneously interacting 
      gravitational force."

      It's so simple, yet so powerful.  Truly!  See it yet?

      (I think you'll find that's an overstatement of Einstein's position).

      Relational Mechanics says: "If you want to find out the velocity of 
      propagation of gravity (if any), here's how to go about it."  It's 
      _immensely_ powerful, as well as beautiful.  You just don't seem to 
      see this, for reasons I might speculate upon sometime.  >:-}.

     It doesn't get any simpler than this. It means that you can predict a 
     perihelion anomaly from a hypothesized finite velocity of propagation 
     of gravitational force;  AND:  that you can predict the velocity of 
     propagation of gravitational force back from the observed precession, 
     as compared to the predictions for instantaneous gravitational force 
     interaction.

      Time is a _dimension_, a measure-ratio, a _metric for Duration_.


      Here's Alfred O'Rahilly, Institute for Advanced Studies, Dublin

      "In the case of short time-intervals we have a primitive perception 
      of equality and inequality just as we have for short 
      space-intervals.  This is especially noticeable in the case of 
      auditory rhythm, e.g. the sound of a clock ticking or of an engine 
      running or of a musical instrument playing....  

      "Nowadays we measure long intervals by the periodic motions of the 
      heavenly bodies (rotation of the earth), and short intervals by 
      recurrent isochronous devices we may call clocks.  Here, as in other 
      cases such as that of temperature, we make successive refinements of 
      measurement by introducing corrections outside the previous limits 
      of accuracy.  For example, we make an immediate judgement that the 
      ordinary pendulum is isochronous, owing to the observed regularity 
      of its ticking.  With such a measure of time, we can verify the laws 
      of motion within the limits of experimental error.

      "With more refined instruments we discover small residual errors 
      below the limits of the initial direct observation.  We can account 
      for this by advancing (1) supplementary hypotheses (disturbing 
      forces), or (2) a slight modification of the suopposed law, or (3) a 
      small discrepancy in the isochronism.

      "In making a choice there is undoubtedly a mixture of convention with 
      observation.  But usually the probability is overwhelmingly in 
      favour of (3), so that the law keeps its original simple form and 
      yet accounts for apparent discrepancies without additional 
      hypotheses.  Our belief is corroborated if our improved clocks show 
      the laws to hold with a much higher degree of accuracy than that 
      with which we started.  There are in physics many examples of this 
      intensification of accuracy by successive corrections of a system of 
      measurement."

In reading this, a old question of mine pops up: Is a war really a good
thing for an economy?  I any history class, you'll hear over and over that
a good war will pick up a sluggish economy.  Is this true?  Has anyone
analyzed this phenomenon?  I think it would be useful to debunk this (if
it's a myth) since it can be packaged in a very pro-conscription meme.
(ie. we *need* conscription to boost our economy!)


Thanx,

Geoff.

Very possible, but even then they've slowed any competition down

That's not my experience.
Because why are so many European governements privatising things like
railroads and telecom then? Giving away control over transport &
communication to 'the market'? Not the thing power-hungry 'terrocrats' (one
of the strangest - and paranoid - terms I've learned on this list) would do.

maybe we have different ideas about what a 'minor inconvienence' is, or
what effects could emerge by _not_  superseding the market every now and
then (see below).

Maybe I've misunderstood but AFAIKT all market mechanisms basically are
driven by the desire of sufficient induvidual consumers to pay for a
distinct product or service (but sorrect me if I'm wrong, I'm not an
economist).

The system of governement can be used _alongside_ market allocation-systems
to provide soloutions to large-scale problems that no commercial company
could solve (and that maybe a lot of consumers would, initially, not want
to pay for)

 >How much would people have been willing to pay to save Stalin in 1942?

Keeping the USSR not going in '42 was not really an option, just letting
the Germans have all those resources that they controlled in the Ukraine
(lot's of coalmines and such) would have made things a lot tougher on the
west front.

I don't know about the grain, over here agriculture is heavely subsidized
and I don't agree with that at all. Why subsidize producing a product that
nobody wants (aparently) and that causes as lot of pollution on the side
(The NOx output of the Dutch cattle is greater than that of the the Dutch
traffic)?.

Ah, but the world is larger that the US (Really!). I for one sure am glad
the US-gov was guarding 'our' side of the Berlin wall because without
US-aid Europe could very well have been overrun by the USSR. So thanks,
remind me to buy you drinks if/when we meet ;-)

And altough the foreign policy of the US this century has some nasty
aspects, it's lovely compared to the things Stalin would have done if given
a chance. Don't think he would have stopped his tanks once he had western
Europe, Britain & France made that mistake in the 30's, allowing a little
annexation to satisfy a little dictator. Things quickly got out of control,
and Uncle whiskers had to clean-up the mess.

Of course it is a US-interest to keep as much of the world more or less
capitalistic, you make products, you need customers to buy 'em.

If the US had not fought the Cold war (and WW-II) many more people would
have died. There was no alternative, you can't coexist with the likes of
Stalin and the German guy. You win the war or you get dead/annexated
(almost as bad).

 >What research never happened, because the money to do it
 >was taxed away to spend on war?

Historically research (especially applied-technical) is always done faster,
and on larger scale, with larger budgets during a war or threat of a war.
The spinoff of this research pays for it almost always (Aluminium alloys,
Teflon, Internet) after such a war (this doesn't make war a less terrible
thing, I'd like to see the same resources going into space-exploration now
as during the sixties but this seems hard to sell to the general public).

 >How the Cold War is relevant to Microsoft, I'm sure I don't know.

The Cold War is relevant in the argument that certain problems cannot be
solved by consumer demand, because of their scale and complexity. This
discussion is relevant to MS to the extend that I do not believe that
monopolies will dissapear in a anarcho-capitalistic society (contrary to
Daniel and others ;-).

But maybe I still do not fully understand anarchocapitalism. In such a
society, without a state of any sort, who makes and upholds law's? or is it
every person for him/herself?

How do you go from the present situation to such a system?

Are these questions explained in a practical manner in any of the books on
the Extropian Reading list? (no I haven't read them all, still busy)

Thanx for the info.

Arjen

   If we follow someone like Dan Dennett's theory(that there is no Cartesian

   Perhaps each physical entity would continue to persue it's goals and

Thank you for explaining this to me, because until now I found
Brin's stance on these issues to be incomprehensibly extreme.
The cypherpunk stance is not one of being eager to prevent the
spread of information about oneself; the cypherpunk stance is
one of being eager to control the spread of information about
oneself.  As Eric Hughes put it, privacy is the power to
selectively reveal oneself to the world.  I don't know what sort
of boddhisattva Brin imagines himself to be, but I myself am too
much the animal to wish to be put on display in the zoo.

That's fine unless the people with the incorrect impressions are
a judge and a prosecutor who have way more control over the selection
and information of their jury than such people would have had in
the US a hundred years ago or so.  Nowadays, not exercising control
over the impressions such people (judges and prosecutors) form of
you can result in your being imprisoned unjustly (or as we say in
more ordinary circumstances, surrealistically kidnapped to no
apparent end).  About 400,000 cannabis users in the United States
who currently reside in our charming and expensive Federal prison
system can attest to this, for instance.

Rhetoric may fix this sooner or later, but in the meantime, I'd
feel safer knowing that I have mathematics protecting
information about myself, and don't need to rely merely on a
Constitution and Bill of Rights that is far too often completely
ignored by the local mafiosi, er, I mean, government.

In *any* history class, or in any history class taught by
government employees?

The classic debunking of this one is, I think, Henry Hazlitt's (not
sure if it originated with him, might have come from Frederic
Bastiat) story of the broken window.  It's a simple homily from
economics, but if you understand it, then you understand what sort
of effect war has on an economy.  Sorry I can't come up with a more
specific reference (I did run a few web searches).

If someone tried to foist this sort of propaganda off on a roomful
of children while I was present, knowing what I (think I) know now
and did not know when I was a child, I'd have a hard time controlling
my temper, I think.

	Hmmm, I guess I'm still struggling with what this erroneous
self(me, myself) would be, other than a fantasy, and why it would be
of any importance since it would have no relation to fundamental
reality.  Sure we can have fantasies about what we are, but what I
want to know is what is it, fundamentally, that such phenomenal
fantasy is really made of or consciously represented by.  To me, what
fantasies (and accurate precepts of reality) are really made of is the
stuff of consciousness, and this stuff is what we fundamentally are.
A computer that has similar behavior to you may have abstract models
that represent information like your phenomenal conscious models do
but an abstract binary number is nothing like a real phenomenal red
sensation is it?  Regardless of whether this red is a dream of a
fantasy cherry or accurately representing a real sumptuous juicy one
you are about to eat, it is much more than an abstract number right?

Of course, if the discussion of you were public, you *would* have the
opportunity to straighten things out.  The problem arises not so much from the
loss of privacy as from imbalances in privacy - the more public individual is
at a disadvantage when faced with hostile conspiracy.  In this case, the
hostility is unintentional.

I find publicity serves as a substantial disincentive to unethical behavior.
Secrecy lets people get away with things.

Just for the record, I find the specifics of Brin's arguments
just as incomprehensibly extreme: distrust of those who value
"privacy" and spreading openness memes is one thing; banning a
communication technology is quite another.  Not only irrational
in its goals, but a complete waste of time to even consider as
a possible reality.  It makes about as much sense as gun control
or nuclear weapon bans; yeah, let's just pass a law against the
/things/ and pretend that they'll go away, and pay no attention
to the reasons people do evil with those things.

I'm no economist, but here is one way that war could seem to help.

In an economy, there needs to be a balance between consumption and
production.  A certain level of production can support a certain standard
of living.

In practice, it seems that often these factors are slightly mismatched,
and lead to oscillations in consumption/production levels.  Consumption
is a little too high (unsupportable standard of living), and then there
is a recession and consumption is a little too low (too much forced
saving).  This is a vastly oversimplified picture of the traditional
business cycle.

In a war, there is more forced saving.  People are called upon to
sacrifice.  There may be propaganda or nationalistic sentiment which
furthers these feelings.  People forego consumption which they would
normally enjoy.  The excess is taxed away or donated to the war effort.

This forced saving fuels gains in production which carry on even
after the war is over.  The result is rapid post-war growth.

Even though the growth is obvious, it is not necessarily worth the cost.
During the war years, people are forced to make sacrifices which they
would not have been willing to do voluntarily if there had been no war
- rationing, taxation, possibly even forced labor.  Afterwards they
enjoy the benefits of the savings.  But if the benefits were worth the
sacrifice, they would have saved voluntarily in order to achieve future
benefits.  Since they did not do so, presumably the payoff at the end
is not worth the years of sacrifice.

Brin doesn't advocate banning encryption.  He does suggest an encryption
tax, a la suggested bit taxes.  He also suggests setting up a standard
mechanism for pseudonymity whereby the identity would be revealed after
20 years, or something.

_The Transparent Society_ is more an expression of attitude and ideas
than a coherent manifesto, I think.  "Accountability, good.  Our
civilization, good.  Secret conspiracies, bad.  Public panic after
someone blows up a city, extreme.  Compromising with public concerns
ahead of time, wise.  Cheap cameras, here or coming."

Your explanation of electron orbitals is highly simplistic and does not
reflect the actual complexity.

For example:

	Using the above theory, how do you explain d-shell and f-shell electron
orbitals?


Your planetary model of electron motion around the nucleus is a bit dated.

ECONOMIC MEANS TO FREEDOM - PART VI


IRS, Schiff, and Economic Freedom
=================================

edited by Frederick Mann

						11/6/97
Introduction
------------

This is the sixth in a series of articles on the
Economic Means to Freedom.  The first five articles
are available at <http://www.buildfreedom.com/eco1.htm>.
The emphasis of the Economic Means to Freedom is on:
(a) Building freedom, rather than "fighting tyranny"
or "fighting for freedom";
(b) Bringing about a massive shift of economic power
into the hands of individuals.

This article deals with my seventh principle of the
Economic Means to Freedom: Exit tax systems to the
extent you can do so legally -- with an acceptable
level of risk; and the eighth principle: Terrocrats
(coercive political agents or terrorist bureaucrats)
are neither omniscient nor omnipotent.

and in the Universe to the letter.


Irwin Schiff's 'PUBLIC NOTICE'
------------------------------

The following paid advertisement appeared in the
'Las Vegas Review-Journal' of November 6, 1997:

Irwin Schiff

620 South 11th St. Suite 7
Las Vegas, Nevada 89101
(702) 385-6920
FAX (702) 385-6917
Web Site: http://www.ischiff.com


An open letter to:


U.S. Senator Harry Reid
U.S. Senator Richard Bryan
Congressman John Ensign
Congressman Jim Gibbons


Dear Honorable Gentlemen,

During the last 20 years I have been exposing -
in numerous books, publications, lectures and
litigation - the unlawful activities of the l.R.S.
I have also, during this time, developed procedures
that allow Americans to protect themselves from
such I.R.S./government behavior.  Essentially, I
have been doing your job which is to protect the
constitutional rights of your constituents - a
task for which you took a sworn oath.  In conformity
with that oath, l would ask you just one question,
"Are there specific laws making Americans 'liable'
for and/or requiring them 'to pay' income taxes?"

I am herein requesting that you, individually or
collectively, provide me and your constituents with
the date and time when you would be available to
appear at a Town Hall meeting to be held in Las
Vegas, where you would identify those laws which
specifically make Americans 'liable' for and/or
requiring them 'to pay' income taxes.  If no such
laws exist, then there is no reason why Americans
should sustain the kind of I.R.S. harassment and
abuse recently documented on "60 Minutes" and
revealed in the recent Senate hearings.

I will assume all costs for the Town Hall meeting
and further agree to pay $50,000.00 to any charity
of your choice, if you can cite the specific laws
as requested above.

Looking forward to your immediate reply,

Constitutionally yours,

(signed)
Irwin Schiff

Terrocrats are Neither Omniscient Nor Omnipotent
------------------------------------------------

The eighth principle of the Economic Means to Freedom
is that terrocrats and their systems are often laughingly
incompetent and inefficient.  I don't think the IRS is any
exception!  There are millions of people who don't pay and
who don't get in trouble.

As an informed individual, your chances of beating the IRS
are very high.  Tax attorney Donald W. MacPherson ('Tax Fraud
& Evasion: The War Stories' -- 1-800-BEAT-IRS) calculates
the chances of an individual being prosecuted in any given
year being about 1 in 70,000; and the chances of being
jailed at 1 in 146,000.  As a general rule, the IRS goes
after the "easy pickings."

In reality you don't deal with the "IRS monster," but with
individual bureaucrats -- often not the most competent
individuals.  Once you know the major weaknesses of the IRS
-- the soft belly of the monster -- you have little to fear.
You don't have to passively submit to their "taxtortion."
To the informed individual, the IRS may be a paper tiger.

The year 2000 date problem may spell the death knell of the
IRS as it is now constituted.  Not only do they have to
review 62 million lines of computer program code, they
almost certainly have to reformat hundreds of computer
files and data bases.  And they almost certainly have to
write programs to convert their data.

But some of the IRS terrocrats do carry guns, and they can
be vicious and capricious.  Some of them are probably quite
sadistic and may enjoy destroying your business and/or your
life.  So you have to be very careful!

The website <http://www.buildfreedom.com/> contains a wealth
of information on dealing with bureaucrats, including
"taxtortionists."


Is the IRS Dead?
----------------

"Under cross-examination by nationally prominent tax attorney
Lowell H. Becraft, Jr., Ms. Jeu (expert IRS witness) conceded
that the IRS uses a secret code to classify people.  Mr. Long
(the defendant) was classified by the secret code of the IRS
as not liable to file a tax return or pay income tax."
-- Recent landmark tax case lost by IRS --
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07b.htm>.


Many Americans May Not Be Liable for Federal Income Tax!
--------------------------------------------------------

In the above amazing court case the jury agreed with the
defendant -- prosecuted for willful failure to file income
tax returns for 1989 and 1990 -- that the "income tax" is
actually an excise tax and applies only to certain classes
of people.


Maybe Neither You Nor Your Business Is Liable!
----------------------------------------------

Imagine what your life or business would be like if you
didn't have to keep records for the IRS, if you didn't
have to file tax returns, if you didn't have to pay the
IRS, if you didn't have to fear IRS audits.  Maybe there
are practical ways to effectively eliminate the IRS from
your life and reduce the risk to almost zero!


What If The IRS Runs on 90% Bluff, 10% Terror, and 0% Substance?
----------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe through Freedom Technology <http://www.buildfreedom.com>
you can acquire the KNOWLEDGE and PERSONAL POWER to call
their bluff, deflect their terror, and render them harmless
to you.

Many people will agree that one of the biggest indignities
they suffer is having to deal with the IRS.  Of course, most
of all, the IRS hurts our pockets.  Fortunately the IRS can
be defeated, as happened in the landmark case mentioned above
and described in 'Report #TL16F: The Becraft Landmark Case'
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl16f.htm>.

Safeguarding Yourself
---------------------

Good-Faith Reliance Defense -- You have Sovereign
Individual Rights when it comes to taxes.  What if
you honestly can conclude in good faith, based on
expert legal advice and U.S. Supreme Court decisions,
that you personally have no obligation to file returns
and pay income taxes?

Of course, everyone should obey the law.  Anyone who
is liable to file and pay income taxes should do so.
But what if you personally come to the good-faith
decision that such statutes do not apply to you?

What we mean, in part, by Freedom Technology is
practical methods by which to live free.  What if
there exists a proven, lawful method for you be free
from many taxes?

Many freedom groups through the years have offered
information on tax freedom.  Some of the methods
advocated, while interesting, probably are
not always effective.  I believe the Reliance
Defense Method, properly applied in good faith,
is one of the most effective tax freedom strategies
yet devised.  It is based on U.S. Supreme Court
decisions such as Cheek v U.S., 111 S.Ct. 604 (1991).

The Cheek decision says, in pertinent part: "If the
defendant had a subjective good faith belief, no
matter how unreasonable, that he was not required
to file a tax return, the government cannot establish
that the defendant acted willfully."  The Reliance
Defense Method is covered in detail in 'Report #TL16G'
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl16g.htm>.

Most people can probably save 1000's of dollars per
year with this method.  Some people can likely save
tens of thousands of dollars per year.  Now, it should
be noted that all actions you take must be in good faith.
This means you should never call yourself a "tax protester"
or say that you don't have to obey the law; these statements
would demonstrate bad faith.

You do not challenge the right of the Legislature to
pass tax statutes and regulations.  But, if after
(1) getting advice letters from licensed attorneys and
CPA's and (2) studying U.S. Supreme Court decisions
yourself, you come personally to the honest, good faith
subjective belief that you personally are not required
to file and pay, you're in a position of power.  This
method has proven itself -- when properly applied.

The most important element of the Reliance Defense Method
is that you must have at least one letter from an attorney,
licensed at the time of writing the letter, addressed to
you personally.  In general, appellate courts have held
that reliance on an attorney's professional advice (or
U.S. Supreme Court decisions) absolutely shows good faith
as a matter of law.  'Report TL16G' contains a listing of
attorneys and CPA's willing to write such opinion letters
for you, personally.

If you would like to know the bottom line of why this method
is so powerful even though the tax man hates it: If you truly
in good faith believe, based on expert legal advice that you
don't have to file, then it doesn't even matter whether it
was a reasonable belief or not!  You beat the IRS because ALL
YOU HAVE TO SHOW IS THAT YOU HONESTLY IN GOOD FAITH BELIEVED
THE EXPERT ADVICE.  This is quite effective -- all you need
to learn is HOW to study and obtain advice such that you
might be able to reach and hold such honest good-faith beliefs.

Note that, in his advertisement above, Irwin Schiff is offering
$50,000.00 to charity, if the "honorable gentlemen" addressed
are able to cite any "specific laws making Americans 'liable'
for and/or requiring them 'to pay' income taxes."

Such studying and obtaining advice is a brilliant application
of Individual Sovereignty that you can apply right now.  The
methodology meshes perfectly with my emphasis on Personal Power
-- 'Report #TL10' <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl10.htm> --
in which you exercise your own personal solutions, rather than
try to change the beliefs of others.  After all, all that
matters for you personally  to use this method is that you
develop a good-faith personal belief concerning the tax
man.  And the real bottom line is that the probability is
high that you can make it work for you!

There are a number of people like Irwin Schiff, who advocate
a range of different approaches to dealing with the IRS.
Any of these approaches can be considerably strengthened
by bolstering them with the Reliance Defense Method.

You simply cannot afford to miss out on this powerful
application of Freedom Technology!

Mr Randi is a fun guy, with his heart in the right place (and of course
I've read FLIM FLAM), but while he's an excellent prestidigitator he's
pretty awful at add-ups.  My book THE LOTTO EFFECT spends a page or two
pulling apart his feeble attempts to mock a standard parapsychology paper.
He got elementary probabilities wrong.  Some time back I found Mr Randi's
email @ and sent him a copy of this passage.  He kindly responded, but
ducked and evaded the matter of his errors.  In essence, he bitched and
moaned at my  boringly insisting on talking about *that* kind of minor
detail, since his great achievement had been to show that Geller (Geller?
who's talking about Geller here?!) was a scamster.  Wow!  Perhaps he also
proved that the earth is not flat.  I was not impressed.

Even if these technologies are invented, how does Brin propose to prevent
the following things from happening?

1. Privacy becomes more costly so only the rich and powerful will have
privacy. They will be able to afford private messenger services, houses in
the country, bug-proof offices, etc.

2. Those who control the surveillance technology/infrastructure will use
it for their own purposes instead of giving it away to everyone. Are we
supposed to expect the government to install all these cameras and then
allow everyone to use them? Who is going to pay for all of the
cryptanalysis and why would they then give away the plaintext?

It seems to me advocating a transparent society has the effect of making a
surveillance society much more likely while not greating affecting the
likelihood of a transparent society which is very small to begin with.

Not yet; you'd need a liver and bone marrow as well.  Further, although
the intestines and the spleen could be replaced, I don't think the 
replacements are yet of the caliber for indefinite lifespan.

Also, current heart-lung machines require a threefold dilution of blood
to operate and that would leave your hemoglobin too low to function
properly.  Finally, the current versions chew up red blood cells at a 
rate far exceeding the ability of the body to replace them.

I think cultured organs would be much more practical than body transplants.
 I think we'll be able to grow hearts and hook them
to the appropriate nerves long before we can build an interface
between two different spinal cords.

"Guns have three functions: defending your family, killing delicious
 animals, and keeping the King of England out of your face."

This week, Homer Simpson bought a pistol ... and folks who enjoy
watching _The Simpsons_ after a day at the target range are
debating in talk.politics.guns what, if anything, it all means.

Marge tells Homer that she heard on television that a gun in the
house is 58% more likely to be used against a family member than
against an intruder.  Homer is briefly shocked almost into giving
up the gun.  Is the point here that the statistic is accurate and
meaningful, or that Homer will believe anything TV says?

Lisa (traditionally the social conscience of The Simpsons) says the
Second Amendment is an outdated relic.  Does she favor repealing it
(or wishing it away), or is she merely telling dad that a right 
to do something doesn't necessarily mean it's a good idea?

Homer breaks every safety rule in the book, causing Marge to take
the kids to a motel.  Does that mean guns are bad, or is the point
merely that Homer's judgement here is as bad as Homer's judgement
everywhere else?

Local NRA members are shown as having a creepy obsession with
firepower.  Krusty says, "We need these new guns to hunt the modern,
more advanced animals, like the flying squirrel and the electric
eel."  Moe shows off a shotgun to which he has welded four pistols
(the triggers linked by strings) for a bigger bang.  But then when
Homer uses his pistol to open a beer can, they give him a chewing-out.
Is this a sop to the NRA's tradition of running safety courses, 
or an attempt to show shooters somehow as hypocrites or cowards?

Chastised, Homer goes to make amends with Marge, telling her he has
gotten rid of the gun.  But then Snake (a petty thug) appears, to rob
the motel's cashier, and Homer pulls the gun.  While Marge is chewing
him out, Snake grabs the gun.  Then three of the NRA members turn up
and chase Snake away (without ever firing), having heard the motel's
silent alarm on their police scanners.  Are they good neighbors, or
losers who have no life?

Finally, Homer confesses that the gun has a terrible grip on him,
and surrenders it to Marge to dump it.  But after Homer leaves the
room, Marge sees her reflection holding the gun, grins, and puts it
in her purse.  Has she recognized that a gun can be a good thing in
good hands (as the foiled robbery shows), or has she, like Homer,
fallen under its spell?

(In at least two previous episodes, Marge handled a pistol quite well--
but perhaps we're not meant to remember those.)

I have seen Randi in person.  He is very intelligent and a great showman.
His method of debunking, however, is not any more scientific than the psuedo-
scientists.  Most of Randi's debunking logic goes like this:

1.  Someone "demonstrates" something unusual.
2.  Randi fakes demonstration that looks like the same thing.
3.  Since Randi's demonstration is fake, he claims he debunked the original
    demonstration.

Faulty logic, even if I agree with all of his conclusions!

Before anyone undertakes to exercise any of the techniques advocated by Mr.
Mann to "exit the tax system," they would do well to review the several
dozen cases outlined at the following "tax protester" website. All of the
cases involve failed attempts by defendants to use one or more of the
"legal theories" which generally abound for "escaping the tax system."

http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/2278/

I should point out that I am deeply opposed to taxation in any form.
However, my opposition is on moral grounds--that being that taxation is
robbery. I think that using "legal theories" as a basis for not filing
returns and or not paying taxes serves only to affirm that authoritarian
law has a place in civilized society and that taxation is A-OK (they just
need an explicit law for it).

>Note that, in his advertisement above, Irwin Schiff is offering

One of the cases on the website concerns a lawsuit by an attorney against
Schiff for breach of contract (failing to pay the reward). Schiff won the
case and the appeal. However, strangely, Schiff's defense was not that the
attorney did not provide proof that taxation was lawful and that average
citizens are required to file and pay. Schiff's defense was that the
acceptance of the offer was not timely (the attorney contacted Schiff after
seeing a rebroadcast of the original program where the offer was made).

While it's true that you have a good chance of not getting caught if you
don't file, I think that has a lot more to do with the inefficiency of the
IRS that it has to do with any "legal theories."

That's the problem. To prove it you'd have to find a one to one correspondence 
between a set with 2^alepha-null members and the points on a line. You'd have 
little difficulty with the rational numbers, those that can be expressed as 
ratios of whole numbers, like 5/7, but then you'd also have to deal with 
numbers that are not fractions but are the solution to some polynomial 
equation, like the square root of 2, after that you'd also have to deal with 
numbers that are  not fractions or the solution to any polynomial equation 
but can be expressed as the sum of an infinite sequence, such as PI or e. 
After you've done all that your problems would have just begun because then 
you'd have to deal with Chaitin's numbers such as... well, actually only one 
of them has a name but there are an awful lot of them.
  
About 20 years ago Gregory Chaitin extended Turing's work on non computable 
numbers and proved that for ever number that can be found by a deterministic 
method, such as the ones I mentioned above, there are an infinite (class 
unknown) number that can not. Almost all the points in a line are Chaitin 
numbers, but none of us has ever seen one, or ever well. The only way to find
a Chaitin number is to let heads be one and tails be zero and then flip a 
coin an infinite number of times. Because they can not be generated by any 
deterministic process it's very hard to count them, that is, to put them in 
a one to one correspondence with a set on a known size in a mathematical 
proof, but a reliable method must be found to prove the Continuum Hypothesis.
Current number theory is not up to the challenge.

I think he meant that the object would have to be going "towards" the center
so as not to fly off its orbit, it doesnt mean that it gets any closer to the

That's not quite right: (A) Charlatan claims to have some ability, or
that some phenomenon exists.  (B) Charlatan performs a demonstration
that he claims proves this phenomenon.  (C) Randi arranges to perform
the same demonstration by trickery.

(C) does not prove, nor does Randi claim it proves, that (A) is false,
or that the Charlatan used trickery to perform (B).  It /does/ prove,
however, that demonstration (B) is not sufficient proof of claim (A).

Randi is also quite willing to show, in detail, a number of
demonstrations that he is completely incapable of faking.  Since
there are many such unfakable demonstrations, and every known
demonstration of psychic phenomena is in the fakable set, that
alone--while not proof--is strong statistical evidence that the
phenomena are in fact faked.

This seems to be the main point.  You can identify all of the points.
Every real number in [0,1] corresponds to an infinite binary fraction.
(The slight complication is that some numbers have two representations,
such as 1.0 and 0.1111..., the analog of 0.9999... in decimal.  But this
can be dealt with since there are only countably many such numbers.)

Again, all that is needed is to agree that there is a one to one
correspondence between the real numbers and the infinite binary fractions
(modulo the point above).  This applies to all the reals, even the
ones which are transcendental, random, or what have you.  Each of them
corresponds to an infinite binary fraction.

Once you agree on this, it immediately follows that C = 2^aleph-null.

I wish to thank everyone who responded to my request for assistance in
decoding the cite:

     1.1441-5 (26 CFR)

Especially helpful were those who pointed out that CFR refers to the Code
of Federal Regulations and not the US Code. For some reason, my brain
translated CFR into USC which is why I couldn't locate the reference.  :-(

I have read Schiff's books, and other arguments that the income tax is
"voluntary"; that your income tax form can be used in court against you
so therefore to prosecute someone for failure to file would violate the
5th amendment; that the 16th Amendment was not properly ratified, etc. 

There is competent scholarship to support the contention that the 16th
Amendment to the US Constitution was never properly ratified by the
required number of states, and the other arguments all have
merit...unfortunately, that is irrelevant.

As I understand it, there is a legal maxim that "specificities in
evidence supersede generalities in evidence."  We all are supposed to
have some general protections and rights under the constitution, such as
freedom of speech.  However, if I am hired by a client and sign an
agreement not to reveal his confidential information, I cannot later
publish it and claim my 1st Amendment right of freedom of speech.  My
general right to freedom of speech was superseded by my specific
contractual agreement not to publish this information.

When you open a bank account, you usually sign an agreement which
includes some seemingly innocuous clause that you will abide by the
rules of the bank.  If you read all the fine print you will find that
you agreed to abide by all of the administrative rulings of the
Secretary of the Treasury.

When new Federal Judges are confirmed they are told how to manage "Tax
Protester" trials -- violations of Title 26.  Federal Judges have been
instructed that the Supreme Court ruled in 1896  (Davis vs. Elmira
Savings, 161 U.S. 275), that banks are instrumentalities of the
Congress.  In other words, the interstate system of banks is the private
property of the state.  So as an operation of law, anyone who has a
depository relationship, or a credit relationship, with a bank, such as
checking, savings, charge cards, loans, mortgages, etc., are
experiencing profit and gain created by the state.

During Willful Failure to File trials the IRS surveys the local banks in
the vicinity of the tax protester, and obtains copies of his signature
card.  During the prosecution the Federal Judge is sitting up there on
the bench with that agreement with the state in front of him while the
tax protester cites his Constitutional rights. 

The judge will ignore all Constitutionally related arguments.  He is
operating on the penal clause to a civil contract.  And since there is
an agreement to be bound by Title 26, what difference does it make
whether or not Title 26 was ever enacted by the Congress?  A contract
does not have to be enacted by Congress in order to make it enforceable.

I recommend "Invisible Contracts" by George Mercier (I found it on a BBS
years ago), which goes into these adhesion contracts in detail.

In the words of Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter: "Equity is
brutal, but we are merely enforcing agreements."  Another legal maxim is
that "justice must satisfy the appearance of justice."  Until we have
separation of banking and state, we will not have the choice to avoid
this "invisible contract"; we will not have justice.

 There are always ways to get by problems.
How about transplanting the spine with the head.
How about growing a new tailored spinal cord for implantation?
How about cybernetics?
I'm not saying it won't take a huge amount of work.
I'm not saying it would be 100% effective.
Do these ideas make it seem even a *little* bit more likely?



 This is a topic I have been thinking about quite a bit lately 
and I have come to a conclusion 
that the less work my brain has to do the better.
The entire body below the neck 
will most certainly be able to be replaced/repaired 
before the brain will.
So that is what I care about 
and must go to extremes to protect.
Chop off my arms and legs,
in a couple of years I will rejoice because I will still be ALIVE!

 If I did have no limbs,
what would happen to the parts of the brain 
that used to control them?
Those areas would be taken over by other areas.
There was a man who lost his hand 
and the hand control area of his brain 
was used by his face control area.
Touch a part of his cheek 
and he feels it on his fingertip control area.
That man has a very sensitive cheek!

 Now think about my whole body control area 
being taken over by my head control area.
Imagine the processing power, 
a full brain used almost entirely for thinking!
I'm not saying it would be easy.
It would take decades of intense mental training
to learn how to use my brain to it's full potentional.
It would take alot of getting used to,
because I'd be the worlds shortest goddamned genius. :-)

Ok, ok...
I'm not so sure the theory is sound
but it's worth thinking about.

Well, not always, but generally.  Here there are ways, they're
just very hard and far beyond our current abilities.

No dice with this system; they leave the old brain stem in
place to run the body.  They have to leave the old spine too.

>How about growing a new tailored spinal cord for implantation?

You still need to interface the new spine to the transplanted
brain; the details of spinal neuron distribution is determined
primarily by development variation and not genes.  Plus you now
need to interface the new spinal cord to the body and the 
conserved brain stem.

>How about cybernetics?

Probably the best strategy for the interface but we can't yet
even restore the sensation to the tip of my brother's ring finger
(lost when somebody squashed his finger in a boat hatch).

I never said that it was impossible; just impossible now.  In the
future, it will become possible, but it will probably still be 
easier to replace individual organs with cultured clones as necessary.
Of course, resetting the Hayflick limit may turn out to be very hard
too, in which case I'd be wrong.

  (c) 1997 Ian Williams Goddard

  CNN has spread false information on television indicating 
  that I said my TWA 800 inquiry was a "sham" and a "plot."
  To counter these lies, the "Goddard Chronicles" has been
  reopened (http://www.copi.com/articles/Goddard). My work 
  was not a sham.  See for yourself that it was factual.
  For it, I've been repeatedly slandered by the media.

  To support the false claims, CNN culled statements of 
  mine out of context from an Internet post, reporting:

     ...Goddard...said he only pursued the charges 
     because he "wanted to give the government a 
     black eye by any means that looked opportune."

     Goddard says he wanted to promote libertarian 
     ideology by encouraging distrust of the government.

  I stated in my Internet post that encouraging distrust 
  of the government maybe good "if it's founded," but CNN 
  omitted that most critical statement, leaving the false
  impression that I tried to cook up anything however base-
  less it might actually be just to hurt the government.
  That's what the GovtMedia does to me, not me to them.

  "If it's founded" means if there's basis in FACT for dis-
  trust. So my statements explicitly EXCLUDED the possibility 
  of being defined as an admission of the promotion of fraud, 
  for I defined the proper spreading of distrust as that 
  which is founded in fact. I think there is basis in fact
  for questioning the government on TWA 800 and many other 
  areas: http://www.copi.com/articles/Goddard 

  Hoping to get the media to stop assaulting me with mis-
  information, I took down my webpage on September 11 and 
  had DEEP TIMES remove the Goddard Chronicles. But after 
  ending my war of "improper inquiry" I am hit harder than 
  ever by the media, perhaps in an effort to snuff me out 
  for good, which forces me to have the Goddard Chronicles 
  made available to allow people to judge for themselves.

  Below is from the Internet message from which CNN culled 
  my statements. My big error, ipso facto, was excessively 
  honest self-critique. My effort was to accurately define 
  the sociopolitical function of conspiracy theory, when
  it is proper, and what good it can do,  even as I was 
  discontinuing it as a means toward effecting social 
  change, for the media will "kill you" if you try:


Ian Goddard's Internet message (10/20/97)__________________

I think it was a big mistake to encourage people to 
believe the Navy did it. How could I know? I just 
wanted to give the govt a black eye by any means 
that looked opportune. TWA 800 was just a vehicle 
for my larger agenda. I think others, like Tom 
Shoemaker, may be in TWA 800 for TWA 800. It's 
not that I didn't care about the loss of life,
I did/I do. To do no harm is a primary axiom.

Why would I want to give govt a black eye? To pro-
mote by default libertarian ideology. One way to 
get people to stop voting for more govt is to 
encourage distrust and suspicion of the govt. Well,  <-------
if it's founded, maybe that's a good thing. Too      <-------
bad people didn't distrust govt more in Germany
just prior to Hitler. A healthy dose of anti-govt
paranoia then might have saved millions. I don't
think the idea that "anti-govt paranoia" is some
kind of disease that must be eradicated is such
a healthy concept.

But what if I was wrong about the Navy having done 
it? Then ipso facto I've done a bad thing. In short,
the business of finger pointing is a risky business,
since your always maybe doing the wrong thing. Unless
you saw the event by 100%, which if a missile flew out
of the water would mean seeing also underwater, you never 
can know for 100% sure what happened. I don't know what 
happened to TWA 800 and probably never will, so I'm 
not going to guess. I'll leave the finger pointing
to those who are more foolhardy than I.

But then you would need to reattach all the spinal roots to the
transplanted spinal cord; you have switched one very hard problem for
another (plus some extra surgical overhead).

You need to interface the old and new nervous system; this might
perhaps be done using artificial neural precursors and neural growth

With cybernetics, who would want a head transplant? :-)

Other areas take over the use of the cortex; this can be quite large
changes if they occur early or during periods of neural
plasticity. One fun paper is

@article{Cohen97,
   author = {L. G. Cohen and P. Celnik and A. Pascual-Leone and B. Corwell and L. Falz and J. Dambrosia and M. Honda and N. Sadato and C. Gerloff and M. D. Catala and M. Hallett},
   title = {Functional relevance of cross-modal plasticity in blind humans},
   journal = {Nature},
   volume = {389},
   number = {6647},
   pages = {180--3},
   month = {Sep 11},
   year = {1997}
}

where they found that the visual cortex of a group of blind people was
used when reading braille with their hands.

Unfortunately this doesn't work well for simply psychological
reasons. We are built to have a large sensory throughput, and by
removing most of the body you lose a lot of the feedback loops, some
of which are important for emotions and motivation. My guess is that
the way to go is to *extend* the mind and body, not the reverse. More
cortex to the people! :-)

Infinite? OK, but the big question is what order infinity, just how many 
decimal places do you need to represent all the points on that line? We know 
it can't be the smallest infinity, that of the integers (call it I) because 
we already know that I *I = I so the line would only have I points on it and 
Cantor proved that's not true.

The complication is not so slight BECAUSE there are only countably many such 
numbers. It's very easy to convert a decimal number of any base into a 
fraction and that means decimals can only deal with the rational numbers. 
Decimals can't even represent a simple irrational number like the square root 
of 2, much less PI, and don't even think about using them for Chaitin numbers.

Using decimals will never work because if you give me 2 rational numbers, 
I don't care how close together they are, I can find an aleph-one (and maybe 
more) number of irrational numbers between them.

In my last post I may have been unclear about that I *I = I bit. My point was 
that a decimal with a countable number numbers of numbers in it can be 
converted into a fraction, it's known that there is only a countable number 
of such fractions, so there is only a countable number of such decimals.

The following is from an article in Monday's WSJ by
LL Bryan called "Stocks Overvalued? Not in the New
Economy"
------------------------------------

Are stocks fundamentally overvalued? Is last week's
turmoil the beginning of a sustained bear market, as
stocks return to "normal" valuations? Almost
certainly not. The world's equity markets have been
driven to today's levels for good reasons: The cost
of equity capital has declined, and the value of
intangible capital assets has increased dramatically.

There's no question that the world's stocks are
priced differently than they were at the start of the
1990s. Market-to-book ratios of U.S. companies are
now about 2-to-1, roughly double the average between
1945 and 1990. Price/earnings ratios in the U.S. are
at 25, vs. a historic average of about 17. My
colleagues at McKinsey and I analyzed the performance
of the 100 largest companies world-wide and divided
them into groups based on their earnings growth and
returns on book equity since 1991. We then took the
20 of these companies with the least change in
absolute performance. These 20 companies had an
average increase in earnings of 3.8% compounded
(little more than inflation) while return on book
equity was flat (9.9% in 1991 and 1996). Yet their
market capitalization grew by 13.5% compounded.

Since the performance of these companies was
unchanged, what must have changed was the price at
which the market valued that performance. Many
attribute this change to "irrational exuberance." But
our research indicates that the underlying cause is
that the cost of equity capital is falling. Research
by McKinsey two years ago estimated that there will
be a $12 trillion increase in household financial
assets by 2002 due to the aging of the developed
world's population. The research also found that the
demographic forces driving this extraordinary demand
for financial assets will continue to increase
through at least 2010. Many of these household
savers, especially in the U.S., have begun to develop
a clear preference for equities over bank deposits or
bonds.

At the same time, corporate investment in tangible
capital stock is declining. The ratio of revenue to
the sum of property, plant, equipment and inventory
for U.S. companies has increased by some 20% over the
past 25 years. This means that U.S. companies are
using about $530 billion less financial capital than
they would have used otherwise. As companies
elsewhere follow the U.S. lead in improving
productivity, they too will release significant
capital.

Meanwhile, governments in the developed world have
dramatically slowed down the pace of new debt
issuance; their bonds thus will absorb less household
savings. In the past two years, we have reduced our
estimate of the amount of government debt that will
be outstanding in 2000 by $4 trillion. Our research
also indicates it will be a decade or more before
emerging markets will have a significant impact on
world-wide supply and demand for capital. It
therefore appears that there will be plenty of liquid
financial capital seeking equity returns at least
through the next decade. And whereas market breaks
quickly eliminate speculative demand, it would take
massive changes in investor demand, or massive new
debt issuance by governments, to increase the cost of
equity.

Also driving the market up is the strong performance
of companies pursuing global opportunities. To
understand this effect we took a different list of
100 global companies--those with the greatest
increase in market capitalization since 1992. These
companies grew their market cap by 24% compounded and
produced returns to shareholders of 30% compounded
over the past five years. Overall, their market
capitalizations increased from $1.6 trillion to $4.7
trillion, of which $2.7 trillion represents an
increase in market value over book. That is, their
market-to-book ratios doubled, to 4.2 from 2.1.

Outstanding stock market performance for this group
is not surprising given that their earnings increased
at 23% compounded and their return on book equity
increased from 9% to 17%. But is a market-to-book
ratio of 4.2 reasonable?

It could well be. Consider that historic accounting
conventions understate both earnings and book capital
when companies spend on "intangibles"--people,
patents, brands, software, customer bases and so
forth--which are increasingly the sources of value in
today's global economy. Money that companies spend to
create these intangible assets is considered an
"expense" rather than a capital investment. For
example, a rough estimate of the costs of the
installed base of software in the U.S. is over $1
trillion, but most of this investment has been
"expensed" even though as a by-product of this
spending, intangible assets are being created that
have value that will endure for years.

The inadequacy of our accounting conventions is not
new. What is new is that the forces driving us toward
a global economy--deregulation, lower transaction
costs, more liquid capital markets--have made the
potential value of intangible assets much higher.
What's also new is that companies are investing in
these intangible assets more strategically and
consciously. Commercial life insurers, for example,
are building cross-border expansion plans around
their ability to understand risk rather than
nondistinctive portfolio balancing and selling skills.

Investors know this--but we have no accounting
methodology for recognizing the value of investments
in intangible assets. As companies accelerate
spending on intangibles to capture global
opportunities, "earnings" are being understated while
returns on book equity and market-to-book and
price/earnings ratios are being overstated. In other
words, current stock market valuations are more
reasonable than they appear.

As companies are learning how to use their intangible
assets by moving them around the world--through
licensing agreements, alliances and other
strategies--they are also learning how to create and
hold options--making investments in brands,
technologies, local market knowledge and so forth in
order to stake claims on future global opportunities.
Increasingly, investors are placing value on these
options.

Thus, we believe that many companies with high market
capitalizations have real option value built into
their stock price. When a company is a standalone,
this option value is transparent. The Internet search
company Yahoo! has a market capitalization of $1.4
billion on annualized revenues of about $70 million
and a book value of $110 million--clearly a
reflection of its option value. Less obviously,
companies like General Electric, Smith Kline Beecham,
Intel and Citibank have real global option values
built into their market capitalizations.

These developments have outstripped the financial
accounting conventions, the capital budgeting
methodologies and even the mental models most firms
use to run themselves. Investors hoping for the
market to fall to levels that feel more "normal" are
likely to have a very long wait.

Well, not always, but generally.  Here there are ways, they're

No dice with this system; they leave the old brain stem in

You still need to interface the new spine to the transplanted
brain; the details of spinal neuron distribution is determined
primarily by development variation and not genes.  Plus you now
need to interface the new spinal cord to the body and the 
conserved brain stem.

Probably the best strategy for the interface but we can't yet

(lost when somebody squashed his finger in a boat hatch).

I never said that it was impossible; just impossible now.  In the
future, it will become possible, but it will probably still be 
easier to replace individual organs with cultured clones as necessary.
Of course, resetting the Hayflick limit may turn out to be very hard
too, in which case I'd be wrong.

The survey totally misses the point, though.

but be very careful..little more morphine, thank you.

The number of bits in an infinite binary fraction is a countable infinity.
There's a first bit, a second bit, a third bit, etc.  Clearly if you
count them like this you won't miss any.  So there is no question but
that an infinite binary (or decimal) fraction has a countably infinite
number of bits (digits).

The formula I * I (where I = aleph-null) does not come into play here.
The number of values that can be represented by an n bit fraction is 2^n.
If you are talking about infinite fractions, the number of values is 2^I.
That is the whole idea of the argument - that the number of infinite
binary fractions is 2^I, and that this is also the number of real numbers
in that range.

So, you need to disagree with one (or both?) of these two points:

 - The real numbers correspond to infinite binary (or decimal) fractions

 - The number of infinite binary fractions is 2^aleph-null.

I don't see how either of these can be wrong.  For the first to be
wrong you'd have to have a real number which did not correspond to any
infinite decimal.  In effect, it would have no value.  This does not seem
coherent.  (In fact aren't the real numbers sometimes *defined* as all
the values taken by infinite decimals?)

And the second is a simple counting argument.  Of course to go from the
fact that there are 2^n n-bit fractions to 2^aleph-null infinite ones
is a bit facile.  Probably a rigorous mathematical proof would have to
make sure that taking the limit like this made sense.  But certainly we
do this kind of substitution all the time when dealing with infinities.

Amazing.  I must be imagining the Freedom of Information Act, all those

I agree, the survey is dumb!!!! However, I did not know about the

I don't believe this is true.  Consider the following number, whose name
I forget:

.123456789101112131415161718192021222324...979899100101102103104105...

This is created by writing the series 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,...
and concatenating all the digits.  It is known to be an irrational number.
Clearly the number of digits in it is countably infinite, as with any
decimal.  Yet you will not be able to convert it into a fraction.

Wait a minute. I thought that Godel proved that any sufficiently
complex set of axioms (i.e., sufficient to use as a basis for
everyday mathematics) was provably incomplete or provably inconsistent.
A consistent system is one in which there is no statment which is
both provably true and provably false. A system that is complete
can prove that any statement in the system is either true or false.
It's trivial to prove that this implies that there are an infinite
number of undecidable statements in the system. Further, you can
choose to generate an infinite number of new consistent systems
by adding one of the undecidable statements as a new axiom. So,
if you like the Continuum Hypothesis, and it is provably undecidable
under the accepted axioms of set theory, you are free to create a
new consistent system by adding the CH as an axiom.

How am I supposed to go from this to Penrose's conclusion? Sounds
crazy to me.

It would be better for someone who is more familiar with Penrose's argument
to say whether I have accurately described it.  However I think the idea
here is that we aren't supposed to be just playing with formal systems
when we do math.  We are seeking after truth.

The mathematics we create is intended to accurately represent the
behavior of abstract mathematical objects which we are thinking of,
such as the points and lines of plane geometry, or the integers under
the rules of arithmetic.  We set up axioms which are intended to
caputre all the relevant properties of these objects.  "Truth" in this
context means that the axioms accurately describe the mathematical
objects we have in mind.

We have to go outside the axiomatic system to determine the truth of a
proposed axiom.  We have to fall back on our general reasoning power,
persuasive arguments, looking at the conclusions which flow from different
assumptions, and seeing if they seem plausible.  It's almost more like
political argument than the kind of logic we associate with mathematics.

I just skimmed Penrose's book, but my impression is that he claims that
mathematicians have an instinctive ability to recognize mathematical
truth.  Machines, which are deterministic computer programs and therefore
can be in principle be described as formal systems, are limited by Godel's
theorem and are unable to recognize certain truths.  Since people are
(according to Penrose) unlimited in their ability to recognize mathematical
proof, this would mean that they are not formal systems and therefore no
machine can do mathematics in the way a person does.  (And hence, among
other things, uploading and AI are impossible.)

In the case of the CH, as I quoted from Rucker's book there has not been
a killer argument made either way.  It could be that our understanding of
infinities is so poor that choosing the axiom one way or the other will
both produce mathematics which seems OK.  The properties of the infinite
objects will be different, but either one could fit into our sloppy
mental model of how an infinite object should behave.  If so this would
seem to contradict Penrose's premise.

A good web page on these topics is

http://www.ii.com/math/ch/

Section 3.1.1 there discusses 2^aleph-null and C.  Towards the end it
has some interesting quotes from mathematicians about the Continuum
Hypothesis, whether it is true or false, what it means for it to be
undecideable, etc.

Also interesting is

http://www.ii.com/math/ch/confusion/

which discusses some of the misinformation floating around about the
Continuum Hypothesis, which has led to some of the confusion in our
discussion here.

I've been remaining quiet with respect to the 'Big Bang' thread, for
reasons I explain more fully below.  However, the use of my name in vain by
Mr. Hollick has induced me to write this message.

There's two plausible referents for 'Feynman' in this sentence.  One of
them is me, Carl Feynman, and the other is my father, Richard Feynman.  I
can assure you that neither of us understands your cockamamie renunciation
of twenetieth-century physics.  Well, my father might understand it, but he
certainly doesn't agree with it.  Here's a quote from 'The Feynman Lectures
on Physics' (v3, ch1, p 10), discussing the notion that you might be able
to explain quantum phenomena by having classical particles with internal
state like your 'tiny rotating electric dipoles':

[Feynman has just described the oddities of quantum interference.]  We make
now a few remarks on a suggestion that has sometimes been made to try to
avoid the description we have given: "Perhaps the electron has some kind of
internal works-- some inner variables-- that we do not yet know about.
Perhaps that is why we cannot predict what would happen.  If we could look
more closely at the electron, we would be able to tell where it would end
up."  So far as we know, that is impossible.  We would still be in
difficulty.  [He goes on to describe why these models don't work.]

I'm not going to bother transcribing the rest of the paragraph.  That's
because I am assuming that (a) the vast majority of people on this list do
not agree with you, and (b) you will never change your mind, no matter how
hard anyone tries.  On what grounds do I assume (b)?  I don't know you
personally, but I've seen the work of lots of people who have, like you,
come up with a complete reconstruction of physics according to radical new
principles.  My father would get letters and phone calls from them
periodically, and occasional unwelcome visits.  Like you, they don't like
Einstein.  Like you, they don't know much mathematics, but they do erect
complex systems of important-sounding concepts.  Like you, they argue
indefatigably and according to rules unlike those used by ordinary
physicists, or, indeed, ordinary rational people.  Like you, they feel
oppressed, abused and neglected by the world at large.  And it is generally
impossible to change their mind, which certainly seems true of you so far.
My father was careful to distinguish such people from genuine seekers after
knowledge; to the latter, he would provide careful replies to their
letters, and would spend considerable time on the phone with them.  To the
former, he would not reply, having learned from experience  that any
attempt at correspondence generally results in an interminable series of
screeds of steadily increasing vituperation.  I have followed this
principle on this list, and hence have not replied to any of your posts
since you joined the list, no matter how obviously fallacious.    

You are free to accuse me of closed-mindedness, rudeness, stupidity, or
adherence to any number of unsound philosophical practices.  I doubt I will
comment further on this matter.

--CarlF

PS. And, while we're at it, my father thought Einstein was right about the
peculiar way velocities add, which would imply he would disagree with you
on that matter also.

This might be true of, say, `impossible objects' alleged to be created by
teleportation, or levitation, etc, but your remark evades the heart of
current anomalies research, which is the vast database of preferentially
skewed distributions in binary and ternary sequences randomly generated by
various firewalled methods, and Ganzfeld and RV experiments that have
impressed even critics of the calibre of Dr Susan Blackmore - conducted at
such places as the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research centre, tucked
into an inconspicuous little burrow under the university, and the Koestler
unit in Edinburgh.  As Dr Roger Nelson of PEAR has written to me, this
accumulated evidence is far more impressive, and baffling, than any number
of corrigible anecdotal items of `paranormal' wizardry, the kind Randi
makes his entertaining stock in trade.

> So Ian, what changed your mind?


IAN: I wish it didn't matter. When I got this 
new address (the last server hosting my domain 
was screwed),  I was hoping it marked a new
beginning, a place I could "disappear" from 
the furry of my conspiracy inquiry. Then 
the CIA, I mean CNN, called...

After they ran the story, every news agency on 
Earth was calling. I could not believe it. The
CNN reporter said it was determined that I was
the  causal locus of the  continuation of the 
Navy-missile theory.  I know my research was
persuading people at high levels of society.
But I did not invent the thing, nor did I 
discover any new piece of evidence, it's
all a matter of effective presentation,
of effective memetic propagation.

That's why they hit me so hard. I must be 
destroyed, even if I've backed off, reeling 
from all the blows. I'm a marked man. I want
to be unmarked and to stop my "wrong inquiry."

The military Intel-Op who monitors my Internet
posting had sent CNN the post that they quoted,
and he told them it was an admission of fraud.
CNN was going to run the excerpt from my post
to the TWA 800 list, and asked if I'd admitted 
to fraud in it. I said "not at all" and pointed 
out the portions where I indicate that spreading
fear is appropriate "if founded."  I also said 
that failing to note that portion would give 
the wrong impression. So guess what CNN did?
What does that tell you they wanted to do?

CNN wanted a video interview. They were going
to send a camera crew down from New York to
Maryland. I can't believe it. I said no. They
would not take no for an answer, but I stuck
to my guns. I know from the past how they cut
you up to say what they want. They also wanted
a voice interview, I also said no to that. 
I still can't believe any of this. 


Knowing that all my Internet communications are
monitored (I know it sounds paranoid, but when 
it's true, it's true; when they are out to get 
you, they are),  I want to say that I've made 
the effort to end my war on the Establishment.
I really want to stop and turn over a new leaf,
I shut down my webpage on September 11, 1997.
I even gracefully signed and handed over my 
"surrender papers." But the Establishment 
then "guns me down" anyway.  They are 
literally terrified of me. But I'll stop

if they'll stop

The false story implying I admitted fraud has 
reached virtually every media source in the 
Western world, TV, radio, and press. Rush 
Limbaugh (a close friend of James Kallstrom
heading the FBI's TWA 800 investigation) was
railing on against me, as if I was Satan in-
carnate. This was an unprecedented full-court
effort to destroy one man for the crime of 
questioning the FBI's TWA 800 investigation.

They could have just said, "He said he was 
sorry, and he made a mistake," and I would 
have never said another word. But no, they 
had to frame me up as a fraud, they had to 
try to kill me. You don't shot a man with a 
surrender flag. What kind of people are they?

But what I want them to know is that I still
want to move on. I don't want to or plan to 
write anything new against the Establishment,
ever again, if they will just leave me alone.

      Hello, Carl,
                                                   8 November 1997
      Thanks for responding.
      
      My reference was to Feynman pere, not to Feynman fils.  >:-} I had 
      wondered if you were related, but it seemed unfair to ask you "Are 
      you Richard Feynman's son?' -- I know that David Friedman just 
      _hates_ being referred to as 'Son-of-Milton' -- and I'd be more 
      interested in your own contributions to science etc.  However, I do 
      thank you for your interesting response, which allows me to explain 
      a few things, and to ask you a few questions.

      I have many of your father's books.  I revere his work, and would 
      have loved to meet him personally, not just through his work.  We 
      both met at at least one person he mentions -- Werner Erhard, of 
      Erhard Seminars Training ('est').


      Just like your father, I take nothing for granted, and I always 
      think things out for myself.  I also propound a refreshing and 
      elegantly simple way of looking at nature's ways, based precisely on 
      Werner Heisenberg's proposition that:  "Classical Mechanics is 
      everywhere exactly 'right', wherever its concepts can be applied."


      Feynman Sr. (as well as his colleague John Wheeler) is well-known as 
      having studied the work of Walter Ritz [1908] very intensively. Ritz 
      proposed a quantized particle theory of light, working within a 
      Galilean framework, with 'particles fictives' (functionally 
      _identical_ to 'virtual photons') acting as electromagnetic force 
      carriers.  Read Paul Forman of the Smithsonian, writing on Ritz and 
      his work in the Scribners volumes of Scientific Biography.

      Yet your father never seemed to _acknowledge Ritz's priority_ in his 
      writings.  To be sure, QED is less complete than Ritz's theory (no 
      treatment of gravity); and is at variance with it on a few points. 
      But the similarities between Ritz and QED are _overwhelming_.  In 
      one way, this delights me, since it neatly torpedoes most of the 
      'difficult' objections to the ballistic theory of light ('light 
      cannot be particles; light cannot travel at more and less than 'c').

      >>>QED "resolves" this wave/particle duality by saying that light is 
      made of particles (as Newton originally thought)... <<< -- Richard 
      Feynman, "Photons: Particles of Light", QED [1985], Ch. 2.

      To which I add: "we can calculate the actual positions of photons, 
      predictively and retrodictively, with increasing precision."

      I do this by proposing that photons _ARE_ matter -- they're composed 
      of positrinos (like positrons but many orders of magnitude smaller); 
      and electrinos (like electrons, but many orders of magnitude 
      smaller).  I sacrifice 'virtual photons' and 'particles fictives' in 
      favour of Faradayan aetherless electric, magnetic and gravitational 
      forces which are intrinsic properties of matter.  See William Koller 
      Berkson's incomparable work, "Fields of Force" (RKP [1974] ).

      Feynman Sr.'s inexplicable omission of Walter Ritz and R.A. Waldron 
      is regrettable.  In another way, it pisses me off, since [A] Ritz 
      had priority; and [B] the omission of his name and references means 
      that successive scientists working in this subject-area have to 
      re-create the ballistic theory all over again, and work through the 
      supposedly 'refuting' objections to it, all of which fall over, and 
      wave their weedy little legs pathetically in the air.

      Just read ace mathematician R.A. Waldron's brilliant study, "The

      I have easily proved you wrong on both counts regarding Feynman 
      Sr.'s position.  He concedes my key assertions explicitly!

      He clearly either hadn't _read_ Popper on propensities (a bit 
      unlikely, that, but still possible); or he didn't understand Popper 
      (inconceivable).  You'll have to speak for yopurself on both these 
      questions.

      He might well have _disagreed with Popper, of course -- that's his 
      right!  As Sir Karl would be the first to agree...   >:-}

    Anyway, since when did science decide questions by head-counting?  Or 
    bean-counting?  "Compare and evaluate the Research Programmes."  Or 
    are you into some kind of Kuhnian daftness, where science is a matter 
    of mob psychology rather than rational theoretical progress?  >:-}

     Except that [i] I actually _do_ change my mind quite readily, on a 
     'balance-sheet' evaluation of rival theories; although -- like your 
     father -- I value tenacity and original thinking;  and [ii] my 
     'restructuring' is in fact a continuation and extension of the 
     Euclid-Newton-Classical-Mechanics _mainline_, in the long tradition 
     of matter/forces/empty-space metaphysics.

     Only the building-blocks of matter -- positrinos and and electrinos 
     --are all that 'new' (and they're owed to R.A. Waldron, Professor of 
     Mathematics, Ulster Polytechnic, 'The Spinning Photon', Speculations 
     in Science and Technology, Elsevier [1981]).

> My father would get letters and phone calls from them periodically, and

      Has it ever occurred to you that physics heretics (among whom your 
      your father is most certainly numbered!) are often a bit odd?  Why 
      would any 'normal' person bother with developing new theories? So 
      much easier to conform, and to use the pre-existing smelly little 
      orthodoxies...

> Like you, they don't like Einstein.

      Wrong!!!  I _do_ like Einstein as a personality and as a writer 
      (although I do think he was a bit of a charlatan: still, paid 
      physics jobs were hard to come by, back then).  Sure, I think some 
      his work is wrong (so did he).

      And I do think that (along with Ernst Mach and many others) he 
      helped to attack the Kantian foundations of Western civilization 
      (probably quite deliberately, as he saw them as an obstacle to the 
      'scientific socialist' world order which many scientists 'bought 
      into' back then, with -- predictedly -- disastrous consequences).


> Like you, they don't know much mathematics

      Oh, c'mon!  You ever heard of Adam-Smithian division of labour?  If 
      I want a bean-counter, I _hire_ one.  Anyway, what the hell are 
      computers for?  >:-}

      A cheap attempted smear job, Carl.  Utterly unworthy of you...

      I don't want to be an 'ordinary physicist.'  Neither did your 
      father.  We're _trail-blazers_.

      You're probavbly motivated by my questioning your father's claims to 
      priority.  Right or wrong?  Answer, please.


> Like you, they feel oppressed, abused and neglected by the world at 
> large.

      Another cheap shot.  I experience Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, as 
      a direct result of combat in the Cold War and the fight for 
      individual rights. Nothing to do with my work in physics.  Don't 
      hand me your psychologistic crap, Carl.  Address the _critical 
      issues_.

> And it is generally impossible to change their mind, which certainly
> seems true of you so far.

      Your father 'followed his star' with great intelligence and 
      determination, just as I follow mine.  We couldn't do what we do 
      without that tenacity and individuality.  "Dare yo use your own 
      intelligence!  This is the maxim of the Enlightenment!" -- Immanuel 
      Kant, 'Was ist Aufklarung?'

      Let us all into the secret of the touchstone he used to distinguish 
      between the former and the latter.  I'm fairly sure I'd have gotten 
      on with your father famously well, going by his writings (he often 
      thinks a lot like me).

      Carl: feel free to be rude.  Or feel free to address the issues.  Or 
      not. That's what we're fighting for, in my business anyway.

      I don't have to accuse you of _anything_.  You're convicting 
      yourself, by your own words.  Your present attitude would have been 
      regarded with hilarity by your father -- I can almost hear his hoots 
      of derision right now!  >:-}   "Do some original work..."

      Oh, and he was wrong on Challenger, too.

      [ Read my -- true -- OMAC/Omega SpeedMaster ST-51 'Challenger' 
      story?  The astronauts often go out to the launch-pad early in the 
      morning, and _talk_ with the ships who sing.  Are we _all_ 'crazy', 
      perhaps? >:-} ].


      Carl, here's the deal:

      Go rent Richard C. Sarafian's inspired movie "Vanishing Point" [1971].

      Carefully watch the fate of another immortally beautiful white 
      Challenger, '... quick beyond all dreams of speed ...'

      If yop're not moved and illuminated, just say, and I'll refund the 
      video rental price.  In solid gold.  I can't bring Challenger and 
      her crew back.  John Denver, who was selected to fly on the final 
      mission, was 'bounced' in favour of Christa McAuliffe, for expressly 
      political reasons -- Reagan's White House intervened.  John Denver 
      said that the disaster would not have occurred if he'd been on board 
      that day. He was absolutely right, of course.

I gave myself a gift tonight. I saw _Starship Troopers_.

>From the trailers I had seen, I expected to hate it.

I liked it enough to see it again tonight, giving up a chance to attend
an invitational function.

I think Mr. Heinlein's shade is resting easy tonight. He may even be
smiling.

Finally a motion picture that bears some small resemblance to a Heinlein
book, all the way through, without running out of budget. Characters
were conflated, many details were elided or simplified.
No, it's not perfect. But it's as far above the movie version of _The
Puppet Masters_ as that was above _Destination Moon_.

What I especially liked was that the people who made the film added just
enough simple handles that if you hated the book, you'll hate the movie
too. If that's not art, it's at least craft I can respect.

Joe-Mike says check it out.

  CNN's IAN GODDARD TWA 800 "PLOT"


  (c) 1997 Ian Williams Goddard

  I've tried to decisively extricate myself from my TWA 800
  inquiry, but it seems that CNN and the gov't don't want me
  to go. CNN is spreading gross misinformation on television,
  indicating that I said my inquiry into TWA 800  was part of
  a "sham" and a "plot."  That is FALSE!! I've always promoted
  what I believe, and now I believe promoting the Navy-missile
  theory was a big mistake! I believe that the evidence is not
  sufficient to blame the Navy and I wish to move away from
  that and all areas of conspiracy inquiry forever. But I
  never said my inquiries were a "plot" or a "sham."

  Christine Negroni with CNN contacted me a few days ago to
  ask about my change of direction,  I did not contact her.
  CNN reports now suggest that I said my conspiracy inquiry
  was part of a "plot" (a secret scheme) to do damage to
  the government's reputation. That's 100% FALSE !!

  My only crime is honesty. I'm honest enough to admit,
  as I have for months, that my inquiry into TWA 800 was
  an effort to identify untruth in the government. I have
  a fact-based bias against government, I'm a libertarian.
  My webpage was entitled "Anti-Authoritarian Journal,"
  identifying my bias up front, unlike most sources.

  Such up-front honesty is NOT a "plot," as CNN attempts to
  portray it. The fact is that anything that is labeled what
  it is up front is by definition NOT a plot. I'd say CNN
  has a bias for the gov't line, however, does CNN label
  its journalism "Authoritarian Journalism?" No.


  WITNESSES NOT MY FAULT

  I did not invent nor am I to blame for the fact that 150+
  witnesses reported having seen something fly upwards and
  explode at the spot TWA 800 was. That there were such wit-
  nesses, up to 154, has been widely reported in the media.

  CNN just reported in reference to me:

      Joe Lychner of Houston, who lost his wife
      and two daughters in the crash, told CNN
      that Goddard and Salinger owe an explana-
      tion to the American public.

  The basis of the missile theory are the witnesses, and I
  did not invent the witnesses. If anyone owes America an
  explanation for the missile theory I think it's the wit-
  nesses, not me. All I did was report what they said and
  commit the error of theorizing that maybe that fiery
  thing shooting up was a Navy missile and the Navy is
  covering it up. I also did not invent the Navy-missile
  theory. My explanation for that theory is that the Navy
  is known to have many missiles and is known to be off-
  shore where the plane crashed. However, an inventory
  showed that all Navy missiles were accounted for...

  OK fine, I'm ready to move on, but it seems they aren't:

  National Transportation and Safety Board spokesman Peter
  Goelz told CNN that my re-reporting of witness accounts
  and theorizing that the Navy was at fault has done "real
  damage" and "caused innumerable people great agony." Wow!
  It seems I'm a human monster of immense proportions.

  I am sorry for that, yet it would seem that the fault
  lies in part and primarily with the major media for ever
  having reported the witness accounts in the first place.
  I then made the mistake of suggesting that the Navy may
  have been at fault and is covering it up, which I now see
  as a mistake, for I could be wrong and if I'm wrong I've
  impugned the reputations of America's finest, which is
  something I should not and do not now want to do, and
  for which having done in the past, I am very sorry.

  I don't know what happened to TWA 800, and at this
  point I don't care! I just want to be left alone and
  no longer harassed by the major media and others over
  the TWA 800 case. I'm sorry I thought the Navy did it.
  It was a mistaken thought. I'm sorry my thoughts have
  "caused innumerable people great agony." I'm a humani-
  tarian and have been a vegetarian for 19 years because
  I want NOT to cause suffering to any living being.


  CNN's "SECRET SCHEME" THEORY

  I've never published anything I thought was false. I
  even published errata notices when required. All claims
  I've made were meticulously referenced so that readers
  could check up on what I said for themselves. Providing
  not just referenced information and ideas but all the
  links necessary to access the larger body of information
  about the case is what made my reports so popular and
  what made this little guy the focus of world news.

  My plan has been to end my "war on the Establishment."
  Wanting to move on from conspiracy theory and set a new
  course, I asked Doctor David Stern, who hosts the DEEP
  TIMES webpage, to remove my conspiracy reports. However,
  due to CNN's misleading charges that I've admitted to
  having been engaged in a "plot" and thus that I will-
  fully attempted to mislead people to believe what I
  knew to be false, I have requested that David Stern
  temporarily replace all my reports so that people can
  judge for themselves if I was the liar CNN suggests.

  It will take David some time to get the reports back
  up, but when they are up you can access them directly
  at: http://www.copi.com/articles/Goddard or indirectly
  at: http://www.copi.com/articles/. Please check the
  first site within the next few days.

That reminds me.  Stephen King wrote somewhere (whether fact or fiction
I don't know) about an experiment done by sociologists in the 50s, in
which they got a bunch of stats together which demonstrated that there
had been a statistically significantly greater amount of people
cancelling their tickets on flights that subsequently crashed than on
normal, successful flights. That sounds like an interesting approach.

It's called Champernowne's number and you're right, it is irrational. When I 
said no decimal could be irrational I was suffering from brain lock and 
vastly oversold my case, which was very foolish of me because my argument is 
not dependent on it. 

By the way, Champernowne's number is the first irrational number to be proven 
"normal" in base 10. Normal means that in the limit each digit will occur 
exactly 10% of the time, each block of 2 digits will occur exactly 1% of the 
time, each block of 3 digits will occur exactly .1% of the time etc. It's not

You're right.

Agreed. I shouldn't have mentioned it.


    >The number of values that can be represented by an n bit fraction is 2^n.
    
True.

      >So, you need to disagree with one (or both?) of these two points:      
      >The real numbers correspond to infinite binary (or decimal) fractions

Your second statement is certainly true and it's not that I disagree with the 
first, it's just that nobody can prove it. 
    

        >For the first to be wrong you'd have to have a real number which did         
        >not correspond to any infinite decimal. 


That's right, and needless to say I can't give you such a number. Nobody has 
been able to produce a number on the line that can't be represented by a 
decimal and so prove the Continuum Hypothesis wrong, BUT nobody has been able  
to show that the existence of such a number leads to a logical contradiction 
and so prove the Continuum Hypothesis correct.


        >In effect, it would have no value.


It would have no decimal value, but maybe there is a number on the line that  
is a little bit bigger or a little bit smaller than any decimal number, maybe  
decimal notation is just too coarse a net to catch all the points in a line,  
maybe there are aleph-two or aleph- three points on the line. Or maybe not.


        >In fact aren't the real numbers sometimes *defined* as all the         
        >values taken by infinite decimals?)


If so then the question becomes, does every point on the line have its own 
unique real number?


        >The Continuum Hypothesis does say that C is equal to  aleph-one, but         
        >the issue in question is what is aleph-one.  There are no sets known         
        >to have the  cardinality of aleph-one, as I understand it. 


Not so, there is a set called the Power Set Of Omega (Pw) that has been 
proven to contain aleph-one members. Pw is a set of sets, it's made up of all 
the sets of positive integers such a {1} {1,2,3,...} {314159...} and every 
other sequence of integers you can think of. To prove the Continuum  
Hypothesis you'd need to find a one to one correspondence between the points  
on the line and the elements in set Pw. This would be possible if every point  
on the line can be represented by a decimal, but can it? As you say, a decimal 
has aleph -null digits, so you could represent 2^ aleph -null (aleph -one)  
points on the line with decimal notation. The trouble is, what if there are 
more that aleph-one points on the line?


        >Aleph-one is defined as the smallest cardinal greater than         
        >aleph-zero.


That's right, so if C is the number of points on the line then the Continuum 
Hypothesis can be phrased as "There is no cardinal number between aleph-zero 
and C". All we need now is a proof.

The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News Number 345 
November 7, 1997   by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben Stein

GRAVITATIONAL FRAME-DRAGGING IS OBSERVED.  Just as an electric charge emits 
an electric field and (if the charge is in motion) a magnetic field, 
so a massive body should, according to general relativity, emit a static 
gravitational field and (if the body is moving or rotating) an extra 
"gravitomagnetic" field (see Update 295 and the accompanying figure). 
Two groups of astronomers, one based in Rome (Luigi Stella, 
stella@coma.mporzio.astro.it) and one at MIT (Wei Cui, cui@space.mit.edu), 
now claim to have detected experimental evidence for this force in the form 
of subtle modulations in the x-ray signals coming from neutron stars and
monitored by the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) satellite.

The phenomenon is sometimes called "frame dragging" since its source is the 
distortions of space-time caused by the rotating mass. The results were 
reported yesterday at the High Energy Astrophysics Division meeting of the 
American Astronomical Society in Colorado.

Number 345 November 7, 1997   by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben

GRAVITATIONAL FRAME-DRAGGING IS OBSERVED.  Just
as an electric charge emits an electric field and (if the charge is in
motion) a magnetic field, so a massive body should, according to
general relativity, emit a static gravitational field and (if the body
is moving or rotating) an extra "gravitomagnetic" field (see Update

one based in Rome (Luigi Stella, stella@coma.mporzio.astro.it) and
one at MIT (Wei Cui, cui@space.mit.edu), now claim to have
detected experimental evidence for this force in the form of subtle
modulations in the x-ray signals coming from neutron stars and
monitored by the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) satellite.
The phenomenon is sometimes called "frame dragging" since its
source is the distortions of space-time caused by the rotating mass. 
The results were reported yesterday at the High Energy
Astrophysics Division meeting of the American Astronomical
Society in Colorado.

BOILING TOPOLOGY.  If Einstein hadn't introduced the so-called
cosmological constant (a fudge factor, denoted by the Greek letter
Lambda, meant to preserve the then-apparent static density of the
universe) into his gravitational equations, nature might have
invented one anyway.  For one thing, according  to modern field
theories, the vacuum is not empty but filled with virtual particles
which (through a process called quantum fluctuations) zip into and
out of existence, and Lambda has come to be seen as the energy
density of the vacuum.  Furthermore, the "inflationary" version of
the big bang model calls for something like a nonzero Lambda in
order to expand the early universe at a rate much higher than we
observe today.  The universe having evolved to its present state,
however, it would now be convenient if Lambda were very close to
zero. Although not presenting a complete theory of quantum
gravity,  Steven Carlip (UC Davis, 916-752-8786,carlip@dirac.
ucdavis.edu) has at least sought to explain the
Lambda mystery in a model which spans the distance scales from
near the Planck realm (10^-35 m), where space becomes granular
(and where the fluctuations arise), all the way up to the
cosmological scale (10 billion light years). Carlip compares the
universe to a pot of water being heated. The addition of energy
makes the water hotter, but only up to the boiling point. Thereafter,
more energy serves only to boil the water faster. Analogously,
larger Lambdas only make the universe "boil" more.  That is, the
topology of space-time is merely driven into an ever more
complicated tangle of subtle distortions and wormholes. Carlip's
framework, which calls upon recent developments in group theory
and non-Euclidean geometry,  makes it very unlikely that Lambda
would have a negative value, and may well explain why Lambda is
so close to zero.(Physical Review Letters, tent. 24 Nov.; as usual,

>
>It is commonly believed that sensory deprivation can lead to cross-modal
reorganization in an immature but not in a mature brain. The results of the
present study suggest, however, that plasticity between sensory modalities
is possible even in adults: activity indicating involvement of parietal or
occipital brain areas in pitch-change discrimination was found in
individuals blinded after childhood. Event-related brain potentials of
early blinded (before the age of 2 years), late-blinded (12-28 years of
age), and sighted adults were recorded to stimulus sequences consisting of
standard tones occasionally replaced by deviant tones. Even when
participants were not attending to auditory stimuli, the deviant tones
elicited the mismatch negativity (MMN) in each group. There were no
significant MMN front-back scalp distribution differences among the groups.
However, when participants were detecting deviant stimuli, these stimuli
elicited N2 and P3 waves that were posterior in distribution in both groups
of blind participants relative to those of the sighted participants. These
results suggest that cross-modal reorganization may occur even in the
mature human brain.

Does anyone on the list know anything about the Silva method? I have found
plenty of their own claims and advertisements (www.silvaintl.com, among
many others) but haven't been able to find any critiques.  URLs, magazine
articles, books?

I ask because a friend of mine, very close but unfortunately very
sentimental and insufficiently skeptical, is convinced of the method's
efficacy.  He claims that he has been able to learn a lot of useful,
non-supernatural abilities such as waking up without an alarm and going to
sleep on cue, enhanced concentration, etc.  This I am prepared to accept.
He also claims that he and other participants of the classes can perform a
diagnosis by looking at a picture.  Naturally he had an emotional account
of how one of the other Silva students focused on a picture of his
grandmother (or may just her name; I forget) and came up with pancreatic
cancer.  My god, that's what she has!  He further claims the diagnosis
was not arrived at by a "warm... warmer... hot..." line of guessing.  I
don't buy it, but it's hard to tell a friend "You're deluding yourself."
He's also seen ghosts...

IANAL, but there seems to be plenty enough "prior art" in the  
literature (the work of Dr. White among others) to break the patent 
if he tried to enforce it.

Trains, as I recall, not planes.  The results were provocative but, as
usual, ambiguous and iffy.  (As I recall, the comparison stats were for the
same trip in the weeks immediately before and after the event, or maybe for
the equivalent trip the year previously.  Weather variations and all manner
of other stochastic wiggles blur such cfs - and presumably the number of
passengers will drop off a bit in the week *after* a fatal crash.  I even
found such an effect in Lotto guesses - after a given number has won, it
becomes slightly more unpopular for the following couple of weeks.  It's
had its turn, after all.  Lightning never strikes...  If the odds were
fairer, this would be a useful item of information for rational people
wishing to place bets with higher-than-strictly-correct returns.)

These days with computerised booking it would be very easy for airlines to
do such comparisons.  They might even be doing so, but the results would
never be published - PR nightmare!  (Admitting that planes crash, I mean.
Not on *our* airline, sir!)

My experiences, memory, 'algorithms' and future are safe in the
original copy of me. I'm not going to lose anything expect some
material. I'm safe in the original copy. I'm going to just gain
experience of dying. Losing one material form doesn't matter. I'm kind
of independent of certain material expression. Etc...

I however would not go to hell or torment despite original being safe.
I wouldn't want to experience it.

It would be different if I have lived for year after copying. Then I
would differ from original by year worth of experience.

Possibly the most succinct definition I've seen...

My brother Dave, my cousin Drew, and I are members of PETA: People
Eating Tasty Animals.... he he he

Just got back from the camp. We just put up a 30' CB antenna, so EvMick,
if you're trucking through upstate NH on the weekend some time, get on
channel 14 and ask for the Steelgate Camp.

Just tried out the new .50 cal inline muzzle loader from Ruger (dad got
a couple signed out for "testing"), and we just got the 10/22 rifle with
a bull barrel and an 8x scope... that puppy is what is known as a
"one-holer". I had a 1/2" group at 50 yards in a free standing position.
Shot 250 rounds with no jams.

As some of you already know, on the weekend I turn into kindof a
redneck...

TO put this all to rest, I spoke with my cousin, Andrew Lorrey, who is a
graduate Geology student at U Maine, Orino. He said that the outer core
is molten, but the inner core is solid iron/nickel with a smidgen of
heavy elements. The inner core is NOT a single crystal, but as a solid
does have a crystalline structure, which is decidedly different than a
single crystal.

Damien, et al: I find it oddly coincidental that I keep seeing SAIC pop
up in the oddest places. Trying to find out the entire breadth of their
business is impossible due to the amount of classified work they do for
our and other governments.

Do you all know that SAIC owns INTERNIC????

They are also one of the main contractors for the Air Force Test
Facility known popularly as Area 51 (along with AG&G, a multinational
they have a cozy relationship with).

They do quite a bit of subcontract work for Lockheed, as well as with
the Air Force's Phillips Laboratory, main contractor for the new
classified facilities at Micheal Field in Utah and the WHite Sands Utah
Launch Facility (which is supposedly the launch facility for the
classified launcher/spyplane the Air Force has which uses the linear
aerospike technology now being used on the Lockheed Venturestar program.

These are just some of the "tip of the iceberg" projects I find SAIC
involved in. I recommend that everyone keep an eye out for SAIC projects
or other SAIC association when the spot them.

I find it rather uncharacteristic that SAIC would be involved in such a
program as remote viewing unless it really had something going for it.

I doubt it. You don't dig up the foundation to your building just

Oh, now your getting into my favorite subjects...To anyone interested in
terraforming Mars, I suggest you read Kim Stanley Robinson's _Red_Mars_
trilogy, which is possibly the most scientifically realistic view of
mars terraforming I've ever seen.

Essentially, it is thought that there is enough CO2 in the poles and un
the rocks that if the atmosphere could be heated up a bit, it would
automatically cause a process of outgassing that would raise Mars'
atmosphere up to a level of between 300-500 millibars, almost all CO2.
THis is equivalent to atmospheric pressure in Lhasa, Tibet. 

At this level, greenhouse effects would raise the average equatorial
temperatures to around 50 deg F. It is not known how much water there is
on Mars, but it is thought from current data that there is enough to
fill the northern hemisphere with a 1 million sq kilometer ocean with an
average depth of 100 feet or so, at the above cited atmospheric temps
and pressures. In order to make this atmosphere livable without oxygen
masks, we would need to seed the planet with engineered plantlife. This
oxygen conversion will of course reduce the greenhouse effects, thus
cooling the planet, unless we replace the lost CO2 with other greenhouse
gasses, like CFCs, methane, etc. It is doubtful that there was enough of
a period of lifebuilding on mars in the past (if the current evidence
supporting such life is confirmed), to provide adequate fossil fuel
resources, so all energy will come from solar or nuclear power

It has been proposed that if somewhere between 2-5 comets were dropped
on mars, this would provide the necessary heat, additional gasses for
accelerated pressurization, and additional greenhouse gasses to maintain
a stable atmosphere, with  a later need for production of CFCs  at a
level of between 5-10% of current terran production.

As for exploration of comets, its a needed mission. As the Huyakutake
and Hale-Bopp comets showed us, there are plenty of objects out there
that are undiscovered that could show up at any moment. if we are to
come up with concrete plans to divert earth intercepting objects we need
to know exactly how  such objects are built so we know whether to use
nuclear explosives or land nuclear thrusters, etc. We also need to do
the same with asteroids of the near earth variety. This precautionary
program would then be the harbinger of an asteroid mining industry.

As for NASA and JPL, well, they do good work, but, dammit, they are
substituting manned exploration with VIDEO GAMES!!! I think its entirely
BS of the highest magnitude that we are putting up with the current
"smaller, faster, cheaper, less imaginative, less risky" program. Then
again its about time people saw how incompetent big government programs
are at exploration. 

BUckyballs? I think that once we get buckytubes made in sufficient
lengths to weave with to make Fuller forms, we can then start thinking
about mega scale projects. Is anyone on the list working with the
tubes????

Well, they need to look at it this way: If they developed an autonomous
agent to watch cancellation rates on flights. If the rates went too
high, the flight is cancelled and a phased inspection of the plane is
conducted. THis way the airline could claim that they actively work to
prevent crashes before they happen.... This could be a positive PR
thing. Even if there was absolutely NO scientific basis for it, I could
guarrantee you that that airline would get more business if it claimed
some sort of psychic monitoring like this... morons will beleive
anything...

Sorry, its not debunkable, except that if you were able to get a country
to act EXACTLY as if it were mobilizing for full scale war, if
technoligical advancement were not a societal priority at the time, and
the country was in the bottom of a market cycle, then it would behave
EXACTLY as if  it were at war. Socio phsychologically this means you've
got to convince the populace that there is an enemy to fight, goal to
reach, etc. to get the desired effect. If you could do all of this and
avoid the maiming and killing then that would definitely be a good
thing. 

Do you want one example of just this sort of program? The Apollo
Program. End of story.

If I am not experiencing any interest gain in my account, how am I
experiencing profit and gain created by the state? If the state were not
here to make me deposit my pay, or make the bank not cash my checks
unless I have an account, then my employer would pay me in cash or
whatever other instrument works, so where does the state create any
profit or gain except by armed displacement?

So basically, since the government wont let a bank cash my paycheck
unless I have established an account that requires me to agree to abide
by Title 26, even though congress never enacted it, they are using the
threat of poverty and unemployment for anyone who doesn't agree to abide
by title 26. If this is the case, then the escape is to claim in court
that that agreeement was signed under duress and therefore is not
legally enforceable. Is that enough of a specificity in evidence for
you????

BCC, FCD and HCP ar basically different crystalline structures that iron
can assume, and which it assumes is dependent on the temperature and
pressure the iron is under at the point which it is cooled, and whether
it is rapidly quenched or allowed to cool slowly. Any basic book on
metallurgy can tell you more on this.

The presently accepted view of what causes the earth's electromagnetic
field is that since the inner core rotates faster than the outer layers
like the mantle and crust at a rate of about one extra "day" per year of
rotation, the inner core acts as a rotor, and the mantle and crust as
the stator, in an electromagnetic generator. THis differential also
induces electrical currents in the lower mantle and outer core that
interact with thermodynamically induced electrical currents. Since this
speed differential is caused by the Moon having greater tidal influence
on the outer layers than on the core, in that the moon induces a drag on
the rotation of the outer layers, if anything were to cause the
direction from which the moon exterts its tidal influence, like an
asteroid strike on the moon changing its orbit, this would change the
gyroscopic arrangement between the outer layers and the core, which
would cause the inner core to appear to "tumble", which would been seen
at the surface in the way of a flipping or occilating electromagnetic
field. This tumbling effect could also be caused by a change in the
flows of material in and out of the core and mantle areas. THey normally
are rather cyclic, like any ocean thermal current, but oddidites can
theoretically occur.

What effect will this have for us? well, since the electromagnetic field
is what protects us from most of the radiation the sun puts out, this
could cause periods of radiation bombardment that could be dangerous,
but most likely would not be any different than the levels found at the
poles, or at least not much higher.

Extro was a science fiction movie about a slimy, bloodthirsty alien that
abducted a British guy and sent him back years later, infested with slimey
alien spawn of course.  Extro 3 is prpbably the third sequal.

Is there a "general right to freedom of speech?" Does the First Amendment
say "The people shall enjoy at all times and in all circumstances a general
right to freedom of speech?"  If not, what does the First Amendment say
about freedom of speech?  To what specific body are the prohibitions in the
First Amendment directed? Given the new knowledge gained from your reading
of the clause about which you write, did the hypothetical contract you
signed actually supersede any provision of the First Amendment?

This is getting a little bit long, so I will just make one point.
The URL I posted yesterday should shed more light.

John K Clark, <johnkc@well.com>, writes:

No, Pw has been proven to have larger cardinality than aleph null, and
it has been proven to have the same cardinality as the real numbers.
But it is not known whether it is equal to aleph one.  As I posted the
other day, some people have suggested that it might be aleph two.

Think about this, too.  How could Pw be shown to be equal to aleph one?
You'd have to prove that there is NO transfinite cardinal between aleph
null and Pw, that the very next cardinal after aleph null was Pw.  Nothing
in between.  Show me such a proof!  You would revolutionize mathematics
if you could.

I can't answer that question because if the duplication process is really 
good then your scenario is impossible. If I wanted to jump into a volcano 
then the other fellow would too, so neither of us would continue living  
(I can't call him a "copy" because there is no way to know if I'm his copy or 
he's my copy and no reason to care). If you push just me in the volcano then
I'm very unhappy because the other fellow is no longer identical to me. 
Experience can change a man and I'm having a rather intense experience,  
being burned alive, the other fellow is not.

  [ Note from Tony Hollick: after this column  was published (under the -- 
  hopefully! -- last British Tory Government), the author Jane Affleck's 
  disability payments (which she has to have, so as to _survive_), were 
  summarily cut off, without any explanation.

  Several nerve-wracking months later -- which further damaged her health 
  quite badly -- an Appeal Tribunal took about ten minutes to restore 
  them. She hasn't written since, but may hopefully resume her invaluable 
  activities soon ].

  The head of the Social Security Office told me that it's more than her 
  job is worth, to discuss 'outside intervention' from MI5 in stopping 
  Jane's payments.   How many other writers and activists have been 
  subjected to this sort of thing in the 'United Kingdom'?  A Public 
  Inquiry is in order...

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

  'Coincidentally', six LOBSTER contributors and/or writers (including 
  yours truly, Tony Hollick), were all 'targeted' at around the same time.


  Yet another (occasionally somewhat OTT) writer who was critical of 
  SEARCHLIGHT Magazine, which is edited by the infamous Gerry Gable, and 
  which manages to combine communist loonies, fascist loonies, and MI5, 
  the -- inaptly-named -- 'British Security Service' -- aka 'The Tory 
  Party in Fancy Dress'), had his benefits summarily stopped.

  He complained rather too vigourously, and was promptly arrested, jailed 
  for 'threats to murder', had his computer seized, was held on remand for 
  months on end, and was eventually put on trial on trumped-up charges.

  The Court found him 'Not Nuilty.'  He's now collecting damages...


  At the time, MI5 was controlled (if at all) by the even more infamous 
  Michael Howard, an authoritarian Tory politician and lawyer.  If _any_ 
  British Conservative _ever_ has the sheer damned effrontery to prattle 
  on to you about how the Tory Party stands for 'freedom', tell them to 
  shove it _right where it hurts_...

  The Tory Party _actually_ stands for a 'Crony-Capitalist' hierarchical 
  authoritarian society where around ten thousand people want -- and 
  expect to get - nothing much,  except all the land, all the pwwer and 
  all the money.  Oh, and a grotesque and morally filthy past, which 
  happens _over and over agoain_.. -TH ]

There is no such proof on that page.  What I do find is:

"CH is the statement 2^aleph-null = aleph-one."

"...look first at a number of different sets that have the cardinality
2^aleph-null: the power set of omega,... the unit interval..."

Clearly he is not proving that Pw (the power set of omega) has the
cardinality of aleph-one.  He states that Pw has the same cardinality as
2^aleph-null, and he says that the CH says that 2^aleph-null = aleph-one.
So if he were proving what you say, he would be claiming to prove the CH,
which he says is impossible.

Note too that he clearly says that the cardinality of 2^aleph-null,
Pw, and the unit line are the same.

I'm sorry to be dragging this issue out so much, but I'm baffled that
you could be reading the same book that I am and reach such different
conclusions.

In addition to the other URLs I gave, you might check the sci.math FAQ,
which discusses CH.  One location is:

http://daisy.uwaterloo.ca/~alopez-o/math-faq/node38.html

This (which apparently was written by David Chalmers) leans towards the
view that CH is false, that the cardinality of Pw and C is much greater
than aleph-one or -two.  (Some people think you'd have to go through an
infinite number of alephs before you get to it, possibly an uncountably
infinite number of them!)  This FAQ also talks about the controversy
over whether CH can even be said to have a truth value at all.  There are
many schools of thought about this issue among mathematicians, which IMO
is another aspect of mathematical research which doesn't fit that well
into what I understand of Penrose's model.

There is also a Continuum Hypothesis FAQ at:

http://www.ii.com/math/ch/faq/

This opens:

> The continuum hypothesis was proposed by Georg Cantor in 1877

In a message dated 97-11-08 23:44:20 EST, you write:

<< The presently accepted view of what causes the earth's electromagnetic
 field is that since the inner core rotates faster than the outer layers
 like the mantle and crust at a rate of about one extra "day" per year of
 rotation, the inner core acts as a rotor, and the mantle and crust as
 the stator, in an electromagnetic generator. >>

Well...now another question arises...why.

It's always "why" isn't it?  In this case why does the iron crystal/iron
lattice core rotate at a different rate than the rest of the planet.  I can't
see the moon having any effect...gravity would affect the earth equaly
wouldn't it?


In an earlier Post I wrote.

I don't know...for sure...but evidently anders is familiar with it...  what I
think I  know has to do the the idea that oil is NOT the result of decayed
dinosuars...but rather a part of all asteroids and space junk which fell
together originally (primeval)..and coalesced to form the planet...The guy
who come up with this idea was named Gold...I think...

Vauge memory floating in the background so I thought I'd mention it...just
wondered if there might be any relationship.

Also you write.

<Any basic book on metallurgy can tell you more on this.

No doubt...cept I live in my truck...a nice truck to be sure...but rather
small living quarters...with limited library facilities.....and libraries and
bookstores with parking for 18-wheelers are rather rare...(sometimes I
cheat!!)...and try finding something like that in Barnes and Nobles or Books

Does anyone on the list know anything about the Silva method? I have found
plenty of their own claims and advertisements (www.silvaintl.com, among
many others) but haven't been able to find any critiques.  URLs, magazine
articles, books?

I ask because a friend of mine, very close but unfortunately very
sentimental and insufficiently skeptical, is convinced of the method's
efficacy.  He claims that he has been able to learn a lot of useful,
non-supernatural abilities such as waking up without an alarm

He also claims that he and other participants of the classes can perform a

cancer.

There are no limits in the first amendment. However, a contract may ask
implicitly or explicitly for you to waive its exercise under certain
circumstances. In this case, your agreement to waive your rights to
exercise speech freely are voluntarily contstrained, unless you find
some other way to nullify the contract.

No. As lunar tidal influence is a mechanism of the moons gravitational
field, there is an inverse square function at work here. Since the moon
orbits the earth slower than the earth rotates, the gravitational
attraction acts as a brake on this rotation. If you look at distance
from the center of the rotation of the earth as you would as an
increasingly long lever, you would see that the moons tidal influence
produces greater torque on the outer layers of the earth than on the
inner layers. As the core is at the center of rotation there is very
little influence on its rotation, while the molten layers between it and
the outer solids allows for enough lubrication to allow for the
rotational differential, like the slip in a clutch...

I consider this discussion to be very much on-topic. We are in effect
discussing the very core of intelligence and reality, and machine
versus non-machine intelligence, all as currently understood by
humans. This is essential to the feasibility of uploading and
computer-based intelligence.

Indeed, this is hardly the first time this has come up. The "parallel
postulate"
was in the same situation at one time that you describe for the CH
today.
Mathematicians tried to show that the parallel postulate could be proven
from Euclid's other postulates, and failed. The result was the discovery
of non-euclidian geometries in which the paralel postulate does not
hold.
We now commonly describe the "true geometry of the universe" as being
non-euclidean. IMO this constitutes a dramatic counterexample to
Penrose's
idea that humans have an instinct for mathematical truth, unless we wish
to believe the instinct is less than 500 years old.

Steve Witham quotes Bey:
                ...The extropian therefore lacks and needs a
    critique of technology, and of the incredibly complex relation 
    between the social and the technical. ...

I think that Bey needs to give us a little more credit for critical 
assessment of the implications of mismanaged technology.  Perhaps 
this statement reflects a need for Extropians to make more public 
statements or publish writings that reflect our understanding of this 
complexity.  Or perhaps I give him too much credit, and he just 
needed a straw man to batter with his own opinions.

Wouldn't adding random input to machine make Penrose's argument about
Godel's theorem irrelevant?

Maybe so - but it is conceding too much, from the point of view of a
believer in uploading and AI.  It should not be necessary to add a true
random number generator to a machine in order to make it capable of
consious thought.  To the extent that some randomness is needed, then
an algorithmic pseudo random number generator ought to be good enough.
Believing otherwise is tantamount to believing in Penrose's mysticism
regarding the non-algorithmic capabilities of minds.

There are pseudo random number generators which are believed to be
indistinguishable from true random number generators even with all the
computing power in the entire universe (by some definition).  Yet adding
such a PRNG to an AI or upload preserves the fact that it is a formal
system, and is still susceptable to Penrose's Godelian argument.  If only
true random number generators can escape Godel and become conscious, then
there must be some way of telling them apart from these simulations, which
would go beyond known algorithmic capabilities.  There would have to be
something magical going on.

Penrose's argument is weak enough IMO that it should be fought on its
own grounds.  We accept that machines have limitations; the absurdity is
the claim that humans have none.  (Keep in mind my repeated disclaimer
not to have a deep understanding of his argument.)

  IAN: I know your not being flip,

  IAN: It's been several months since the 
  death threat,  saying if I continued my
  inquiry into TWA 800 I might be killed.
  But I never know. With the heavy media 
  hits, backing off seems best, forever.

  One private TWA 800 investigator in 
  L.A. just disappeared into tin air, 
  never to be seen again:



THE PRESS-ENTERPRISE (10/28/1997)

Man's disappearance remains a mystery

By Mark Henry
PALM SPRINGS

The disappearance of civic watchdog Jeremy Crocker 
while researching the crash of TWA Flight 800 last 
year has left his two sons baffled and searching 
for any sign that their father is still alive.

Crocker, a longtime Palm Springs resident whose 
father built the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway, was 
last seen Dec. 9 at the downtown Los Angeles library 
where he did much of his research on the crash.

His preoccupation with the airline crash included 
countless hours of research in libraries and on 
the Internet. He did not trust the government's 
probes of the crash and believed a projectile 
knocked the airliner from the skies. He created 
mathematical models and studied the aerodynamics 
of the crash and similarities to other air 
disasters worldwide.

...Crocker's two grown sons...believe their father's 
disapperance may be connected to the July 17, 1996 
crash of TWA Flight 800 off the coast of Long Island.


   IAN: I suspect that he was so caught up
   in thinking about his research as he was
   walking, he fell into an open manhole and
   was washed away,  showing how researching
   this case can be a dangerous affair. Hell,
   every researcher has either been visited 
   by the FBI or pounded on by the media.

If Bey feels that we pay inadequate attention to the possible
negative effects of technology (and especially future technology),
then what must he think of the attention given this subject by
most of the rest of society? I strongly suspect that this group
pays a lot more attention to this subject than almost any other
group does, spcifically including the groups whose declared duty
is the guidance of society.

Thanks for taking the time to reply my mail.....Micheal Lorrey
I'm definitely like the idea of comets divertion and its usage
to terraform planets like Mars,...
Once there is sufficient CO2 in Mars' atmosphere, is that
the time to seed the martian soil with artificially engineered plants
and does that have consequence on the atmospheric pressure 
and temperature again....( I thought if CO2 is converted to O2 
the temperature would drop again,...the greenhouse fades.....
so drop a few more comets,...?! more water and CO2 and
the process continues until a saturation point where there
is the right mixture ( earth-proportion ) of gases....hey hey hey 
...or at least of fitter extropian-minded (post)-humans to live on
...i.e our future generations....
Is there anyone on the list working on artificial engineered plants
these range to also encompass very large trees that can be grow 
on comets to take us out of the solar system....ever heard of those
Dysonian proposals...?
Are there also other materials that are as rad as buckyballs
and hows the progress on buckyball manufacturing?
Anyone care to contribute

I think it is necessary to have redundant information for clock syncing and
error recovery.  But, if the things we believe about cryptography are
true--that there are "hard problems", for instance--then the overhead can
be small and the result can still be impossible to distinguish from noise--
even though there is redundancy, it's a hard problem to see it.

There is that funny comment in A Fire Upon The Deep where (as we the
readers are being treated to a boring slow-motion chase across the
galaxy) two characters pass the time by debating the feasibility of public
key cryptography (or any scheme except one-time pads generated with true
randomness)...

Quantum stuff throws wildcards into predictions about computability &
also provides quantum crypto possibilities, so things could look different,
even pretty soon.

But as far as I know you can make redundant information look like noise.

(later) Oh, PHIL started this thread!?

Also, like Phil says, you can make your signal have any spectrum you want
and probably be sloppy about things that people with only terahertz
technology can't detect--if they're who you're trying to hide from.

*The Diamond Age* had those nanites with light-wavelength communication
that appeared as colored sparkles.  You don't have to actually wiggle the
nuclei to control photons.  Light waves are pretty long in nanometers--
~600-1200nm?

I guess interstellar stealth will be
mainly developed to hide from *local* enemies--people from your own
planet with technology similar to or somewhat better than yours.
You could extend "Good fences make good neighbors" to "Interstellar
civilizations only spread as far & fast as their crypto technology
makes safe from internal corruption."  (Which is verbose but you
could probably pack it into <1024 bits.)

I hereby signify my recognition that this is science fiction based on
science fiction.

Not only are there plenty of limits to A1 protection, there are numerous
situations in which A1 doesn't even apply.  And I'm not talking about the
old "shouting 'theater' in a crowded fire" scenario. What you gotta do is,
you gotta read the actual First Amendment before you write about it.  Go
ahead.  You'll see what I mean.  Do an Alta Vista search on "U.S.
Constitution."  It's in there.  You will find out why no contract written
since memory of man runs not to the contrary contains the clause of which
you speak, yet confidentiality clauses are common and usually enforceable.

Hi guys, this is my 2 cent worth on this infinity
Thanks for all the contributions,....
I do feel rather heady now, so thanks for the hyperlinks
to CH pages,...that helps,....I did read Rudy Rucker's Infinity
and the Mind,... a another heady; giddy affair again for me...
I'd like to agree that there is no way for proving the CH
to be either true or false, a la Godel ; which states if we construct
a proof that is either incomplete or inconsistent...and dealing with
infinities, I have no expirence,...can anyone shoot me down?
to show that a proof construct to prove or disprove CH will
be either incomplete or inconsistent,thus a never-ending story
( just like this discussion on INFINITIES seems to heading towards
some infinite point....hey hey hey )

So I want to throw a spanner in, if I may,...about unnameable
infinities or numbers,...which also appears in RR's books,...
where a number can never be described given even the entire
universe as a coding system or extentions etc etc....and even for
a given inifinite amount of time to describe it in....

Can the 'reciprocals' of such numbers exist within the real number line?
If so, these numbers obviously 'infinite' in number,...( hopefully I'm
right
to say ; the number of such 'things' are larger than the transcendentals
; the number of transcendentals obviously 'infinitely' larger than the
irrationals....!!! ) I think I better stop here before I wander into
the firing squad line,...One can almost imagine the quantum mechanical
nature of space-time itself as a analogy to exploring ever-increasing
smaller intervals on the real line,....like the space-time continuum
it hits some kind of 'Planck's Limit' and become a fractal mess of
'uncertainity' ?!??!? ( Planckian-like limit is these unnameables )

Am I making any sense here,...Let me try to put it in another way...
a quasi-layman approach,... to say just like the Quantum Physics says
that we cannot determine exactly one property of a particle without
losing the accuracy of another property of the same measured partical
...can be said to be analogous to Godel's Incompleteness theorem
which says one can never generate a complete theory without
inconststencies and vici-versa.....!!!
So just like adding one to one equals two on paper
is actualize by puting one apple beside another making 2 apples....!

Does Godel put a limit to what we can actually say about CH and
other related matters,....I think it does ?! Pls help out
( if so put a limt to this discussion on Infinities or mine !? )

Not to lose sight of our extropian objectives, is how these
infinities or INFINITIES will even affect our extropian objectives
or put limits or no limits to our objectives,....

Still reeling

This might have already been covered in the infinities thread,  it seems
I came into this mailing list a bit late.  If this tidbit has already
been covered, please accept my apologies and ignore this message.

Awhile back I read an article in some magazine that I can't remember -
maybe it was a MENSA thing (eep, the M-word!), maybe Popular Science, I
don't know - but it was on this new concept called Surreal Numbers. 
Now,  at the time, I was just learning about _imaginary_ numbers,  so
the thought that numbers could be surreal was something I liked to think
about from time to time, but never got into - no one could teach me but
myself.  Anyway,  it seems that some mathematics theorist was coming up
with all these crazy notions about numbers such as infinity + 1, and was
calling them surreal numbers.  Has anyone else heard of such a thing or
is my memory playing tricks on me?

All the counterpoints are well taken. Plus, even if you could determine that
the "noise" exhibited some slight autocorrelation or other statistically
significant deviation from randomness of the kind you expect (e.g., gaussian),
it doesn't mean you could decode it. For all we know, pulsars are modulated,
too, and we've come up with the naturally-occurring starquake as an explanation
when the truth is that They are doing it.

Re: optical spread spectrum, I seem to remember either inventing or hearing
about a trick with quantum wells that ought to let you create something very
like a free-electron laser.

I nicknamed this a "caged-electron laser".

These ought to be insanely efficient and might even be structurable as phased
arrays, active countermeasures like the ones rumored to be in place on the B-2
and FB-117*, etc.

* I forget what that technology is called; it's the one where the material
itself is primed and constructed with wideband rectifiers, dipoles, and other

    (c) 1997 Ian Williams Goddard

    Keith Cornell, Senior Editor of the NBC program
    Unsolved Mysteries, in response to CNN's  charge 
    that Ian Goddard's promotion of the TWA 800 Navy-
    missile theory was a "sham," states that Goddard 
    "honestly believed" the theory and held a "fair-
    minded receptiveness to conflicting opinion." 
    With that in mind, Mr. Cornell observes:

       Regardless of political bent, this is
       not characteristic with the sort of
       intransigence one normally associates
       with "agenda"-driven conspiracy advocates.

    Therefore Goddard is neither fraud nor fanatic.
    Unsolved Mysteries  is  not  out to promote the 
    Navy-missile theory; in fact, they did a program 
    that was very critical of the Navy-missile theory. 
    In his defense of Goddard, Mr. Cornell concludes:

       In short, while I believe that the
       "Friendly Fire" theory is wrong, I
       have never thought that Ian Goddard
       was deliberately perpetuating a "sham".

    Here is Mr. Cornell's message to Ian Goddard, for 
    which permission to republish has been granted:


       FROM: Keith Cornell 
       TO: Ian Goddard
       DATE: Thu, 6 Nov 1997 20:46:41 -0500 (EST)

       Although Pierre Salinger was unavailable 
       to us during our brief production schedule, 
       I contacted you for a possible on-camera 
       interview. During our telephone conversation, 
       I challenged you on a few key conflicts 
       apparent in Salinger's public interpretation 
       of the alleged radar photos. It was at this 
       point that you began to express doubt in the 
       strength of this evidence, and concern that 
       Mr. Sallinger had not discussed the photo-
       graphs with you before giving his statement 
       to the press. 

       Subsequently, you and I came to a mutual 
       conclusion that you were not adequately pre-
       pared to represent the "friendly fire theory" 
       on camera, and we chose to proceed using news 
       coverage from Salinger's European press con-
       ferences. 

       It seemed to me at the time  that you hon-
       estly believed in your theory, while main-
       taining a fair-minded receptiveness to con-
       flicting opinion. Regardless of political 
       bent, this is  not characteristic with the 
       sort of intransigence one normally associ-
       ates with "agenda"-driven conspiracy 
       advocates.

       In short, while I believe that the "Friendly 
       Fire" theory is wrong, I have never thought 
       that Ian Goddard was deliberately perpetuat-
       ing a "sham".
       ____________________________________________


    Hay, not everyone in the major media is out to get 
    me. Let's hope that Mr.Cornell does not get fired.

    I had never seen the actual radar images until I saw
    them on the Paris Match webpage. The radar tapes were 
    in the possession of Richard Russell, which is why I 
    told Mr. Cornell I was neither ready nor qualified 
    to speak on them for his television program.

My point was that invisible (to us primitives) communication is an 
inevitable consequence of using the avalable bandwidth to anything like 
it's potential.  No need to hide, those puny humans can't even hear us 
when we're screaming in their direction!

Let's see what one semester of Spanish can do for me here:  
"If you have problems .<?>. Spanish people, imagine
what it means for a Uruguayan...  All help is welcome..."

Now if I can figure out the accent keys on this keyboard:
Hola, Eduardo!  Estudio solo un poco de espaol, y no tengo
tiempo por mucha correspondencia, pero deseo respondar a tu
mensaje.  Hay algunos extropianos quienes no hablan ingls 
por sus primeras lenguas.  Escriben los mejores mensajes 
quellos pueden, probablemente con dictionarios (en manera
similar como m).  

Si no encontras a otros extropianos espaoles (o uruguayos),
tentas de escribir en ingls, y tentamos de comprender.  La 
lengua comn de esta lista es ingls; possiblemente una otra
lista extropiana ser formada, pero hasta que ese tiempo, 
no habe otro sugestin.  Espero que tu tentars.

Bienvenido (Welcome),

(Yikes!  That took an hour!  There are no Spanish pen-pals

And he will detect encryption by...? What's the difference between an
encrypted message and a stream of random bytes? Will I now be taxed
for sending random numbers to my friends?

Bit taxes are ludicrous. Encryption taxes are doubly ludicrous.

And he will prevent people from running remailers by...? The problem
with all these great new society ideas he has is that they must be
enforced by a large number of men with guns. Creating his wonderful
transparent society will require a hideously oppressive intermediate
state.

Sorry, but this is nonsense; what difference would a dossier on BATF
gun ownership make when they're collecting dossiers on your gun 
ownership in order to justify raiding you? Or a dossier on DEA 
dope-smoking? The only effect will be to ensure that the government
are not hypocrites, or that they pass laws which allow them to behave 
in a manner which would be illegal for private citizens; already 
true in the case of the BATF, for example.

>Assassinations, untraceable kidnappings...

You'll have to be pretty damn clever to assassinate or kidnap
someone over the Net. As soon as your action moves into the real
world you can be traced by traditional police methods. This is
a non-issue.

And how much, exactly, will sending thugs around to every house cost
the government? Sure, they can still send thugs to beat me up, if
they can find me, but that's a far more expensive task than 
collecting taxes. And I can simply move to a tax-haven.

Actually, there are much better ones.  I am referring to cryptographically
strong random number generators.  See a good crypto text, such as
Schneier's "Applied Cryptography", chapters 16 and 17.  Section 17.9
describes some generators which are provably as difficult as solving hard
problems like factoring and discrete logarithms.  These are believed
(but not proven) to be computationally intractable for modestly sized
numbers of a few thousands or tens of thousands of bits.

Do you have a reference for this?  The best ones that I've heard of
that are purely algorithmic are the well-known linear congruential
ones.  They are hard to distinguish from truly random ones, but
definitely not if you have "all the computing power in the universe".
This is because if the random generator has N bits, then it will
*always* show correllations in an N-dimensional correllation plot.
Mind you, to get good correllations requires filling up the
N-dimensional space to some degree, which can take time exponential in
N, so perhaps it's just an LC algorithm with large N.

Anyway, a reference would be nice, if only because I'm really
interested in these generators, if they exist.

Penrose's argument is that if people are algorithmic like a Turing machine  
then we couldn't jump out of the system, look at ourselves and find the 
inadequacies in the system as Godel seemed to do it his proof. I think at the  
very lowest level we are the equivalent of Turing machines, however the 
axioms are numerous but ridiculously simple at that level, "If you're in
state A and see a 0, change it to a 1, go to state B, and move one square to 
the left". I don't think we can jump out of THAT system and change the basic 
operating principles that Turing found 60 years ago, but that very low level 
can't be the level the conscious mind operates. Something must be running on 
top of that machinery, something that has few if any axioms and so is not a 
formal system.

Minds are problem solvers and I don't think non-algorithmic problem solving 
is necessarily mystical. I doubt if we use axioms like "if A and B then C"   
very much,  more important are billions of heuristics like  "if A and B  then 
usually something close to C". 

Good advice is also important like "If something happened many times in the  
past it will probable happen again" or " If you have several possible 
solutions to a problem but not enough information to prove that any of them  
will work then try the simplest one first" or "if a rule of thumb seemed  
like a good idea but is not solving anything, then dump that rule and look
for a better one". We can jump out of THAT system.
  
If the mind is not a formal system, at least at the highest conscious level, 
then Godel does not apply to us or to a intelligent program running on a 
computer.

I agree, if a pseudo random number generator is not good enough then  
something very weird must be going on.

Do a web search on "surreal numbers" and you will find a lot of information.

I read Knuth's book about Conway's invention twenty years ago, but it was
frustrating.

He presents it as a story about a guy and a gal vacationing on an
abandoned island who find a mysterious rock with the rules for creation
of these numbers on it, and who spend their time working out the math.

It was one of those books where the breezy presentation makes you think
everything will be easy, but actually I found the math quite difficult.
Eventually I realized that although I had been following along happily,
I didn't understand it at all.

Also, there wasn't enough sex in it.

Training seems to be the usual way. It is possible that the
cholinergic signals from the basal forebrain are important too, which
means that chemicals influencing the ACh system could be
useful. Normal synaptic plasticity is a hot research area.

Do you mean a state of very high neural plasticity? In that case you
would likely learn fast but also forget fast, new memories would erase
old memories and stray thoughts would be remembered far too well. Used
in the right way it would be perfect for self programming, "mental
rejuvenation" and perhaps for intense training of new skills.

> >1:3:1- How does short term memory work?

Good question. Some of it is likely activity patterns in the cell
assemblies involved in a thought or a concept that remains over time,
and slowly fades. There are also some plastic processes in synapses
which may act here, but honestly we don't know yet.

I have heard some reports that people with certain forms of paralysis
get a state of flat affect. But I have not looked into the area much.

Change in what way? There are change on many timescales, ranging from
seconds to years. Most likely you would quickly adapt in a few hours,
and then there would be a gradual deterioration as the lack of sensory
input made you more sensitive to "neural noise" and internally
generated sensations. 

> >2:4- Why are throughput and feedback loops relevant?

Because we evolved to interact with the world, and to retain an
internal state. If this is prevented, normal activity tends to get
disrupted.

You also need the motivation you call your will. What motivates you?
What is your will? If you lack emotions you also lack will, and your
will depends on other emotions.

> >2:5-1 What parts of the brain CAN I retask?

Most of them. I think there are very few parts that cannot adapt or
modify themselves slightly. But very little is known yet (or rather,
it is all neurophysiological data with little order).

The brain does not work that way. It is likely that you are
overwriting and strengthening childhood memories all the time
depending on your thoughts.

We don't know where and how "Tasks" are stored, although we have
reasonably good maps of some functions (like the visual cortex,
primary motor system, speech etc). Try a good neuroscience textbook
like Kandel, Schwartz et al. Principles of Neuroscience.

> >2:6- What is the best machine for mapping brain functions, in terms of...

Specific and general in what sense? A PET or fMRI scan shows what
areas are activated during different tasks, but gives no hint of what
they actually do. Lesion studies help to find out this by disrupring
ordinary function, and sometimes electrical stimulation and/or
recording can give more information. But it is a very complex
undertaking to understand even a small region.

I strongly suggest that you get some neuroscience textbooks, they have
much of the information you want and can provide an useful stepping
stone.

Kind of hard to extract meaning with all the ellipses... not sure where

was unprovable... didn't have anything to do with that, except godel
the man was interested... proof was by models... find a way of modelling

Don't think these have anything to do with each other... any more than
any other situation which has two alternatives... qm lets you trade off
the accuracy of measurements of one property against accuracy of other...
it's continuous... godel's theorem is all or none... besides, nobody is
interested in inconsistent axiom sets... they don't really count... so
godel's theorem really just says that no sufficiently complex theory is
complete... it's not really a duality... also this is the old way of
looking at qm... lots of us like many worlds...

No, godel's theorem is not really practical... doesn't actually generate
any practical undecidable propositions... all are monstro massive...
main point is philosophical that such must exist... in practice have to
do it the old fashioned way... have to prove the proposition undecidable...
sometime i'll tell you how it was done for noneuclidean geometry... really
good story... unfortunately these ellipses are too small to contain it...

Some relation to quantum computing... theoretically a quantum state can have
infinite information... not just aleph null, but real numbers... some people
think this is much more than aleph null... in practice environmental noise
probably makes it finite... but maybe if the whole universe were your state...
there'd be no environment... then maybe you could go beyond aleph null in
your calculations... just a crazy thought... gotta watch these ellipses...
that means three dots btw... think i'm getting dizzy... better stop now...

Wow, what a trip.

I think that is roughly what Gold was suggesting. If this was true,
then oil could be found in completely unsuspected regions if the
conditions were right. Most geologists regard this hypothesis as
wrong, and even Gold has to admit he has so far not found much
evidence to support it.

Here in Sweden a mining consortium believed his idea enough to start
test drilling for oil and/or gas around lake Siljan, which is an
ancient impact crater and likely to hide oil according to Gold. They
didn't find anything, and I think the consortium has been
disbanded. However, they got some weird gunk during their drillings
which may have been old organics, crust bacteria or just polymerized
lubricants.

To break a good random number generator like "Blum Blum Shub", you'd need to 
factor the number that it uses as its seed and that would take a HUGE amount 
of cleverness or a COSMIC amount of patience. If as is usually  the case, the 
seed is one or two thousand bits long, then that's far beyond the capacity
of any existing computer, if you make it 4 or 5 thousand bits long then you 
will not be able to find enough silicon in the observable  universe to make 
enough chips for a computer to factor the it before the heat death of the 
cosmos. Unless a new factoring algorithm is found that's a LOT faster than 
anything we know about today, if it only speeded things up a trillion times 
it would be useless, and unless  somebody makes a Quantum Computer, Blum Blum 
Shub is safe.

Even if you knew the seed number I used in my generator, I could give you a  
sequence produced by it and you couldn't even say there is a 51%  chance that 
the next bit in the sequence will be a 1, nor could you know anything about 
the bit previous to the sequence I gave you.

There is a lot about random number generators in Bruce Schneier's book 
"Applied Cryptography".

It's not clear to me that minds and/or neurons can be expressed as formal
systems.  Equivalently, there can be no computer program which _exactly_
(exactly, exactly) simulates a brain.  This is because we do not have
a full understanding of the laws of physics.  It is possible, as Penrose
argues, that actually the laws of physics are nonlocal and/or have non
algorithmic properties.  Therefore his argument does not apply even at the
lowest level of our own brains.

However, dealing with an upload or an AI is a different matter.  Now we
have a full understanding of the substrate which is executing the program.
It is a completely deterministic, mechanical and logical machine, and is
even relatively simple at the lowest level - as little as a dozen or so
opcodes is probably enough to be a universal machine able to run an
upload, by our current understanding.

Given that the substrate is deterministic and mechanical, it follows
(I think) that any program loaded onto it shares these properties,
even if it is a complicated brain simulation.  What you need to do is
to produce some kind of concrete way of defining what it means for the
simulated mind to believe a certain mathematical proposition.  This would
require a complete understanding of how its consciousness worked, and
what the neural (or lower level) structure was which mapped to conscious
belief, but is possible in principle.  Given this, you can set up a formal
system which expresses all possible beliefs that the simulated mind can
have.

The key idea here is that this is only possible because we know the mind
is running on a deterministic, formally structured computer.  It follows
that the mind is also deterministic and has a formal structure of its
own.  A mind running on neurons and the laws of physics does not have
this property (unless it turns out that the laws of physics are in the
appropriate sense deterministic and algorithmic, which Penrose believes
is not the case).

The mind running on the computer, then, differs from the mind in the
brain, because we can theoretically set up a formal system which expresses
all the thoughts of the first, but we may not be able to do so (Penrose
would say cannot) for the second.  Present the mind on the computer with
a Godel statement based on the formal system which constrains it and
it will not be able to believe its truth, while the mind in the brain
supposedly has no such limitation.

True, but this is a very gross level of description.  To actually pin
down those heuristics will turn them into immensely complicated but
deterministic formulas.  (As discussed before, if the formula needs a
random component, it can be supplied by a deterministic random number
generator.)

Right, but Penrose would claim that a mind uploaded to a computer is a
formal system, even at the highest conscious level, as I understand it.

Position Specification
Perspecta
Linguistics Engineer


While the Internet has revolutionized the availability of information,
navigating these vast resources and finding relevant information
remains a major problem.  Perspecta's products will provide users with
a radical new way to turn increasingly overwhelming amounts of
information into a manageable , usable, and valuable resource.

The Founding of Perspecta Perspecta was founded in January 1996 by
Earl Rennison, Lisa Strausfeld, and Nicolas Saint-Arnaud, alumni of
the MIT Media Lab, and technology industry leaders Steve Holtzman and
Nicholas Negroponte.

Prior to founding Perspecta, the founders developed revolutionary new
ways of representing and navigating through large volumes of
information through their work in the Visible Language Workshop at the
Media Lab.  Through their work, Rennison and Strausfeld painted a
visionary picture of the future of information organization and
navigation with their Galaxy of News, Financial Viewpoints, and The
Millennium Project which received worldwide recognition, won
international awards, and provided the foundation for other research
projects, both in and out of the Media Lab.



>From Boston to Silicon Valley

In 1994, the MIT students met Steve Holtzman, a computer industry
veteran from Silicon Valley whose recently published book, Digital
Mantras, had received critical acclaim as a philosophy of creativity
for the digital age.  The book resonated with many people at the Media
Lab as it reinforced the notion that new methods and paradigms were
required to unleash the potential of digital expression.  Upon
completing their research at the Media Lab, Earl, Lisa, and Nicolas
approached Holtzman and Nicholas Negroponte, the founder and director
of the Media Lab, to explore how they might establish a company to
commercialize their ideas.  Together, they founded Perspecta in
January 1996, with initial seed funding provided by Holtzman and
Negroponte.  The company moved to San Francisco and began the process
of building a team to deliver its first products.

Now with eighteen employees and venture-funding from Applied
Technology, Sofinnova, and Informix Software, Perspecta is well on its
way to implementing commercial software products that will
dramatically enhance the way people navigate and experience
information on the Web and corporate intranets.

About Perspecta, Inc. will dramatically enhance the way people
navigate and experience information on the Web and corporate
intranets.  Founded in January 1996, Perspecta is based in San
Francisco with 18 employees.  Major investors in Perspecta include
venture partners Applied Technology and Sifinnova, and corporate
investor Informix Software, Inc. (IFMX).  More information on
Perspecta can be found on Perspecta's World Wide Web site at

Well, yes, but also, just publicly "understanding this complexity" isn't
the same as having a "critique," which means an organized and developing
*critical* position and approach, as I understand it.

I think a critique of tech is not something we extropians have a big
concensus on, even compared to other issues.  So extropians
in general may never be known for it.  It doesn't mean lots of us don't
think smart thoughts about it or have our own personal critiques.
(I know it's a main reason I'm an extropian.)
Bey himself, in the bit I quoted, credits us with knowing some of the
bad effects of tech.

On the one hand I wish extropians were more interested in critique of
tech; on the other, utlimately those who ain't, ain't.  In the same way I
wish libertarians made more of a point of being critical of big
corporations and mass-produced culture.  Many are, but it's not the image
people have of libertarians.

Also, I think critiquing tech is harder than most tech critics (including
Bey) make out.

So, I agree with Bey that we lack and need one (at least one), but it
ain't easy to come by and it may not be on the top of most extropians'
shopping lists.

Dan Clemmensen writes-

Here's a clue: he devotes an essay to us, not the rest of society.
This is is strange if you know his anti-tech, anti-"Capital" sentiments.
Bey's criticism seems (to me) based on respect, at least formal
respect, not just a dismissal.

Like I said, smart thinking isn't the same as having a critique.
He is specifically challenging us
to come up with a critique of tech.  What is the extropian critique
of tech?  The critical thinking implied in "Dynamic Optimism?"  It
would have to be more specific than that.

Surreal numbers are strings of zero or more up-arrows and down-arrows.
The empty string (I'll write {}) means zero.  Up-arrow (^) means loosely,
"the next obvious higher number," and down-arrow (v), "the next obvious
lower number."  So,
   {} = 0
   {^} = 1, {^^} = 2, {^^^} = 3...
   {v} = -1, {vv} = -2, {vvv} = -3...
   {^v} = .5, {^vv} = .25, {^^v} = 1.5, {^v^} = .75 (Smiley arithmetic?)...

So far so good.  But, when you allow strings whose lengths are up to aleph-0,
for instance, all real numbers are covered.  When the strings are allowed
to be longer than that?...ah.  Various infinities, numbers between the
real numbers, etc.  Pretty soon you're talking surreal numbers, to
paraphrase Everett Dirkson(*).

Lots of these numbers (including "transfinite" and "transifinitessimal"
numbers--sums of much too big and much too small numbers) were already
conceived of.  Surreal numbers are just a single notation that covers
a lot.

This is what I remember from an introductory web page whose address is
probably around here somewhere, on one of my computers, in one of my
copies of Netscape...  Darn, I need a bookmark file to locate my
bookmark files!

It also said people had worked out how to multiply the things but not
add them...!?

And what about octonions!?

Report: Scientists found way to stop onset of menopause

In experiments with mice, Harvard scientists have found a way to block
menopause by keeping ovaries alive. London's Sunday Times reported that
scientists at the Harvard Medical School discovered an application of two
chemical agents called fumonisim-B1, a fungal toxin, and
sphingosine-1-phosphate stops cells in the ovaries from dying. The 
research will be published next week in the scientific journal Nature 
Medicine, the newspaper said.

Thanks for clearing that up for me,  I was under the assumption that
surreal numbers had more than one notation for the various different
surreal numbers.  Suffice it to say, I missed the mark.  Thanks for the
correction.

Yep.  Surreal numbers are denoted by up and down arrows.  An up arrow with
a dot on top means go up omega times (omega being the set of all integers)
Surreal numbers are used to distinguish from different types of
infinities.  For example, the number of integers is obviously different
than the number of real numbers, yet we call them both infinity.

I think I'll find the article and read it again.

This is timely information.  I have been reading _Feminine Forever_ and also
discussing this issue with Chris Heward who contends that menopause is
unhealthy and that women should take action to prevent its onslaught.  This
is not mainstream thinking.  For eons, women have been feed information
claiming that our crysalis  - our menopause - is a welcomed event, ending
long years of monthly aches, pains and distress.  To the contrary, new
information purports that menopause is likened to a death-threat.  It brings
with it tendencies toward heart disease, osteoporosis and other problematic
illnesses, not to mention the side-effect of becoming sterile.

claiming that our crysalis  - our menopause - is a welcomed event, ending
long years of monthly aches, pains and distress.  To the contrary, new
information purports that menopause is likened to a death-threat.  It brings
with it tendencies toward heart disease, osteoporosis and other problematic
illnesses, not to mention the side-effect of becoming sterile.

I see an underlying question:
Should Extropians devise a critique on tech in response to Bey, or 
should we devise one for our own reasons?  I think that many 
Extropians would like to move beyond the reactionary style that 
characterizes current public debate.  Actually, after all the raves I 
hear about Bey, it somewhat disappoints he would appeal to this style.

So many areas of Extropian and transhumanist thought are wide open 
for development, and this area presents an excellent opportunity for 
someone who is interested in it (like, say, Steve!).  I've been 
tossing around an idea for writing about our relationship with the 
Luddites and how it could benefit us, but it keeps getting put on the 
back burner.

I have an incredibly simplistic view of the future: we either embrace
technology, or we die. The reason is simple: population. There is no
known non-technical way to stop the population from growing, so
any attempt to freeze technology at or below its
current level will result in the destruction of the earth's ecosystem
in short order: 200 years max, probably less. This is a simple
reducto-ad-absurdum argument for technological advancement, and
IMO anyone who argues against technological advancement must
first have a practial solution to the population problem.

OK, given that technological advancement is the only alternative to
the destruction of both humanity and the planetary ecosystem, we
are now left with arguments about the nature of the technological
change. Again, I feel that there is really not much we can do to
guide the advance. Technological change in this era is driven by
software, and software development is now very distributed and
uncontrollable. This means that arguments about the moral and
ethical aspects of technological change are interesting, but
have no practical point, since the change is uncontrollable.

Yes, there are a great many plausable scenarios in which technlogical
change has detremental effects, but it's the only game in town. Live
with it. IMO, the only way an individual can affect the change is
to try to introduce and advance useful, non-detremental changes
as fast as possible, while analyzing and warning against possible
detremental effects. Given the historically accelerating rate of
change, I feel that any atempt to make non-technical changes to
society (i.e., a new ethic, a new religion, a new educational system,
a new form of government) will take too long to have an important
effect on technological change: by the time such a slow-acting change
can have an impact (order 25 years) technology will have
changed society beyond all recognition.

Another argument against it is that human is not infallible in
deciding truth value. Another way to foil argument is to use program
that is inconsistent but still could decide right truth value for
'certain percentage' of theorems. Simplest (and useless) algorithm
would be to enumerate theorems and decide that even numbered theorems
are true ;-) Much more interesting algorithm would be such that it
could decide truth value for remarkable number of theorems without
using actual proof. Something like simulation of good human
mathematician... Does Penrose take into account inconsistent
algorithms? Is there study of fuzzy proofs and/or proofing process?
Something like humans probably use before finding actual proof.

Points well made. To Steve's point, this is a good over arching
statement. But it doesn't have any depth.

Tech like all lead based pipes are a rather bad idea (but good for
population control).

Not all ideas are so clearly bad.

And some ideas have some subtly. Large Nuke based reactors clustered
together are a bad idea. Small passive cooled nuke reactors based in
local towns and neighborhoods are a great idea.

We can accept tech  -- That's the first step!

The 2nd step is to find the best tech and the best approaches and to
find out the ideas that seem great (like lead pipes) but aren't once you
get additional knowledge (e.g., lead is a poison).

Whoa.  It's me who used the word "challenge."  What Bey said was that
we need one and we don't have one.  If you agree that we need one, then
that's your own reason.  I have my own reasons.  Reaction to Bey isn't
the reason--he just happens to be correct.

Dan Clemmensen:

So far, that is incredibly simplistic, I must admit.
The AA Prayer is my paradigm for any debate on tech:
   God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
   courage to change the things I can,
   and wisdom to know the difference.

You've summarized the first line of the prayer, which is something,
I'm not joking: these basics need to be said, and sorted out.

> The reason is simple: population. There is no
>known non-technical way to stop the population from growing,

Some recent (& controversial) survey said that around the world, when
*women* are reasonably educated, they decide how many kids to have based
on fairly rational estimates of the economic prospects for the kids.
Btw "we have the technology already", & it doesn't cost $6M.

>IMO anyone who argues against technological advancement...

None of those here, as far as I know.  A "critique of tech" would be
an approach to thinking about what kinds (aspects? applications?
directions? etc?) of tech are good, what are bad, and why.
>

Quite so.

I love how this argument zooms around in a loop a couple of times
and then ends up where it started, only with its motor hot and its arms
all twisted around pointing at itself.  By the way, the general idea
is called "technological inevitability," and is well known, if not
well respected, in arguments about tech.

My start on an answer is that tech change consists of people making
decisions based on ideas.  If you lump people's thinking into "tech
change," then of course we can't change the course because our thoughts
have already been accounted for in your idea of "tech change."  We will
think what we will think, do what we will do, and que sera, sera.
But if you unplug the short-circuited argument, tech doesn't change
by itself at all.  It *only* does what we want it to.  The question is
how wise we can be, and what would wisdom consist of.

>...IMO, the only way an individual can affect the change is

Sounds good!  Now you've got to the second line of the prayer.

Is it necessary to make massive changes or just introduce good ideas?
Remember, the same process that produces the change--people thinking--
is steering the change.  They are identical.  It's all just choices.
And people don't make the next change until they've absorbed the
previous one.  New things are only produced by people thinking new
thoughts.  So it can't be that tech change happens faster than
people's ability to change their thinking, since the latter is what
produces the former, one idea at a time.

And these are only preliminary, preliminary thoughts.

Please don't take my teasing style as unappreciative of the time and
thought you're putting into this.  More than I am at the moment--I'm
just regurgitating things I've thought before.  Scoping out the
situation--what we can and cannot affect about tech evolution--in a
cold-blooded way is exactly to the point.  It's the third line of the
prayer.

Harry S. Hawk said some wise things summarizing (and echoing the
prayer!) with:

It's good to bring this up, and it is indeed part of the 'critical
thinking' side of Extropianism.

Going right back to fundamentals: it seems clear that we must accept
that *any* technological creates new problems as it solves old ones
(this is what we would expect from a Popperian analysis of knowledge).
The question to focus on, as you suggest, is: does it create more, or
more difficult and dangerous problems, than it solved?  I think the knee
jerk response of the anti-technological is that it always must
necessarily do so, and that's the bushfire we've got to pour cold water
on.

Also, we must remember that part of the seductiveness of the neo-primitive
position is in the "better the devil you know" argument.  e.g., what's
the use of progress if we are increasingly stressing ourselves out by
having to juggle and balance more and more complexities against each
other? Why start that process? Is the increase of possibilities such a
great value when the price we have to pay is that we are unable to take
advantage of them because we're having to devote so much time and energy
to solving the problems that the mechanics of providing them create? What
sorts of answers can we give to those questions?

As an aside, my opinion on Bey is that he is merely clever and ridiculously
vain.  Everyone ought to read him, but no-one ought to take him too
seriously.  His one great meme is the TAZ, which I think has been
(deservedly) quite influential.

I agree with this. Some time ago somebody posted the claim to the
omega point theory list that *every* new technology had led to the
decrease in quality of life! The problem with this is that for every
positive technology we can mention (vaccines, the internet, reading
and writing) it is always possible for the anti-technologist to find a
downside, and it *sounds* convincing even if it is untrue (past
cultures doesn't seem significantly happier than ours). What we need
is to take a clear look at how to estimate the relative positive and
negative impacts of new technologies, and choose the positive
ones. This is of course impossible to do with certainty, but we can do
pretty well in many cases.

I would say we chose our path when our ancestors decided to become
farmers instead of hunter-gatherers. That set a chain of events in
motion that seems to lead us towards posthumanity/oblivion/whatever in
a fairly deterministic manner (farming -> more food -> more people ->
concentration of people -> cities -> organisation -> etc). Mankind as
a whole cannot go back to the hunter-gatherer stage, even if small
groups can if they choose so, since the earth cannot sustain that many
gatherers* even if all people wanted to live that way. 


* Decreasing the population quickly (in a few generations) without
radical and genocidal methods is practically impossible, both because
of the attitudes of people (they want to bring up children) and
because during the period of decrease a smaller number of young people
have to sustain a larger number of older people; this only works given
advanced automated manufacturing technology, which is anathema to the
neo-primitives.

CNN said that my TWA 800 research was a "sham" and a "plot." 

That is a lie. Here is one of my reports. All these referenced 

items are accurate. Can you find any "sham" or "plot"? If not, 

what does that tell us about CNN?  Spread this far and wide.

      T W A   8 0 0   M I S S I L E   T H E O R Y


        -  S T R O N G E R   T H A N   E V E R



        (c) (07/17/97) Ian Williams Goddard


        One year after the pulverized remains of 

        TWA Flight 800 plunged into the sea, it's 

        clearer than ever that the passengers on 

        board were victims of a missile strike. 


        While most of the 154 missile-witness

        accounts taken by the FBI remain covered 

        up, a few accounts are available to the 

        public, such as the accounts of 5 pilots

        who were flying in the area when TWA 800 

        was suddenly annihilated:



        FIVE PILOTS - FIVE MISSILE WITNESSES


        PILOT 1: Colonel William Stratemeier, Jr.


        AVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY reported 

        that Air National Guard C-130 pilot Colonel 

        Stratemeier "said he had seen what appeared 

        to be the trail of a shoulder-fired SAM ending 

        in a flash on the 747." [1] However, in the 

        next issue of AVIATION WEEK Stratemeier re-

        cants, saying: "We did not see smoke trails 

        [from a missile], any ignition source from 

        the tail end of a rocket nor anything..."[2] 


        Col. Stratemeier recanted and therefore was 

        not hit with an FBI gag order, but the next 

        two ANG pilots did not recant their accounts 

        and therefore were hit with FBI gag orders.



        PILOT 2: Captain Christian Baur


        AVIATION WEEK & SPACE TECHNOLOGY reports 

        that right after the TWA 800 accident, ANG 

        HH-60 helicopter co-pilot Captain Baur told 

        federal officials: "Almost due south, there 

        was a hard white light, like burning pyrotech-

        nics, in level flight. I was trying to figure 

        out what it was. It was the wrong color for 

        flares. It struck an object coming from the 

        right [TWA 800] and made it explode." [3] 



        PILOT 3: Major Frederick Meyer 


        At a press conference the day after the TWA 

        800 accident, ANG HH-60 helicopter pilot Major

        Meyer said: "I saw something that looked to me

        like a shooting star.  Now you normally don't 

        see a shooting star when the sun is up. It was 

        still bright... Almost immediately thereafter, 

        I saw, in rapid succession, a small explosion 

        then a large explosion." [4] Meyer said that 

        the initial explosion  "looked identical to 

        the detonation of an antiaircraft shell."[3]



        PILOT 4: Vasilis Bakounis 


        Private Pilot and Olympic Airlines engineer

        Vasilis Bakounis told the Greek publication 

        ELEFTHEROTYPIA [5] that as he was heading 

        toward Gabreski Airport on July 17, 1996, 

        "Suddenly I saw in the fog to my left toward 

        the ocean, a small flame rising quickly to-

        ward the sky. Before I realized it, I saw 

        this flame become huge. My first thought was

        that it was a flare that had been launched 

        from some boat... This flame then started 

        to quickly lose altitude and a few seconds 

        later there was... a second explosion."



        PILOT 5: Sven Faret 


        Flying at 8,500 feet moments before the

        cataclysmic explosion of TWA 800, private 

        pilot Sven Faret reported that a "short 

        pin-flash of light appeared on the ground, 

        perhaps water." [6] When asked if the flash 

        of light rose upwards vertically from the 

        earth, Sven confirmed that it did, stating

        that it was "like a rocket launch at a 

        fireworks display" with a point-of-origin 

        "near the shoreline or in the water." [7]


        All 5 pilots witnessed a rapidly moving 

        luminous and fiery object that was:


        1. like a surface-to-air missile

        2. like burning pyrotechnics

        3. like a meteor yet not like a meteor

        4. like a small flame rising quickly

        5. like a rocket at a fireworks display


        All 5 accounts indicate that this rapidly 

        moving fiery object hit TWA 800 initiating

        the explosions that killed all on board.

        At least 2 of the pilots saw the object 

        early enough in its trajectory to have 

        seen it rise upwards from the Earth.


        The accounts of the pilots in the air are 

        corroborated by over 100 witnesses on the

        ground who also saw a fiery object shoot 

        upwards and intercept TWA 800. Some of 

        them said that the fiery object was:


        * like a flare

        * like a thin white line

        * like Grucci fireworks

        * like a skyrocket


        Most witnesses, such as Naneen Levine

        on CNN [8], report that the fiery object

        followed a curving trajectory as it shot

        upwards toward TWA 800. There is simply

        no phenomena other than the firing of a

        missile that can explain all the details 

        reported by the witnesses who saw that 

        luminous object streak toward TWA 800.


        When we also consider that TWA 800 wreck-

        age shows the signs of missile damage,[9] 

        the real question is not was it a missile 

        that hit TWA 800, but whose missile was it.



        TERRORISTS OR THE U.S. NAVY?


        While the number of "terrorist-missile 

        theories" is greater than zero, the number 

        of terrorists known to be in the area during 

        the crash is zero. Military experts have 

        shown that the probability that terrorists 

        could even deploy the military hardware 

        necessary to destroy TWA 800 with a missile 

        is near zero. In sum, the terrorist-missile 

        theory offers us a whole lot of nothing.


        In contrast to the terrorist-missile theory, 

        the U.S. Navy (a) could deploy the military 

        hardware necessary to take out TWA 800, (b) 

        did deploy assets to the area that were both 

        below and above TWA 800 when it was hit, and 

        (c) did activate warning zones near TWA 800 

        for military exercises and live-firings. TWA

        800 even changed course to avoid an active

        naval-warning zone moments before it was hit. 

        Unlike the terrorist theory, the Navy-missile 

        theory is overflowing with evidence.



        THE NAVY SHUFFLE


        It is common for the guilty to try to deny the 

        facts that place them at the scene of the crime 

        or accident. The U.S. military tried to deny 

        the fact that it was at the scene of the TWA 

        800 accident. On July 23, 1996, Department of 

        Defense spokesman Kenneth Bacon told the press:


            I'm not aware [that] there were any 

            military exercises in the area. I've 

            been told by the Joint [Chiefs of] 

            Staff that there were not. [10]


        Yet after eight months of such denials, the 

        Navy finally admitted that naval exercises 

        were taking place off Long Island at the time 

        of the TWA 800 accident. [11] The Navy also 

        admitted that they had three submarines off 

        Long Island in the ocean below TWA 800. [11] 


        We know that there were at least 8 military

        assets in the area of the TWA 800 accident:


        1. NAVY: The ALBUQUERQUE, attack sub

        2. NAVY: The TREPANG, attack sub

        3. NAVY: The WYOMING, ICBM sub

        4. NAVY: P-3 Orion aircraft

        5. NAVY: The NORMANDY, missile cruiser

        6. USCG: The ADAK, CG patrol boat

        7. NYANG: HC-130 aircraft

        8. NYANG: HH-60 helicopter


        Every asset except the Adak has either 

        (a) been denied to exist or (b) had its 

        reported location at the time of the TWA

        800 accident changed by the military. For 

        example, while shuffling around crash-time

        locations for months, the military placed

        4 of its assets in 11 locations:

      

        The Navy-missile-cruiser Normandy was:

        1. 180 miles away [12]

        2. 185 miles away [13]

        3. over 200 miles away [11]


        The Navy P-3 Orion aircraft was:

        1. 15 miles to the south [14]

        2. about 1 mile southwest [15]

        3. 3,700 feet below TWA 800 [16]

        4. 7,000 feet above TWA 800 [15]


        The ANG C-130 aircraft was:

        1. 10 miles offshore [17]

        2. flying along the coast [18]


        The ANG HH-60 helicopter was:

        1. 10 miles offshore at 3,000 feet

           doing search and rescue practice.[1] 

        2. 3 miles inland at 100 feet

           doing practice landings. [19]


        Are we to believe that with as many as 

        nine military radar systems blanketing

        the area [20] it would take months for 

        the military to figure out where it was?

        The pattern of location shifting has 

        been to move military assets further 

        away from the accident than initially 

        reported or further than was eventually 

        discovered, as in the case of the P-3,

        which tapes proved was more than 10x

        closer to TWA 800 than once claimed.


        If the denial of evidenced proximity to 

        the crime scene is evidence of culpability, 

        then, since multiple instances of military 

        proximity to TWA 800 have been denied by 

        the military, the evidence that the mili-

        tary is culpable in the downing of TWA 

        800 is significant.  The fact that not 

        only assets but military exercises were 

        denied, makes this evidence compelling.



        CONNECTING THE DOTS


        TWA 800 researcher Tom Shoemaker recently

        discovered documents showing that both the 

        New York Air National Guard and the Navy 

        were engaged in a large-scale exercise 

        called "Global Yankee '96" taking place 

        off shore between July 16 and 26, 1996.[20] 


        Shoemaker's findings confirm the claim of 

        TWA 800 researcher James Sanders that the 

        Navy and the ANG were working together 

        at the time of the accident. [21] 


        While the fact that ANG pilots reported 

        what they saw would seem to contradict 

        the possibility of their culpability, it

        is clear that the ANG is not being forth-

        right about the locations of ANG assets 

        at crash time.[18,URL] It should also be

        noted that ANG co-pilot Baur never said 

        what he saw when he had the chance to at 

        a press conference after the crash; that 

        Major Meyer suggested first and foremost 

        that TWA 800 was hit by a meteorite; and 

        that Stratemeier suggested it was hit by 

        a terrorist-style missile, then suddenly 

        claimed he saw nothing. If the Navy and/

        or the ANG are guilty, then the ANG pilot 

        responses would be predictable misleads.


        One year after the fiery demise of TWA 

        800, the  Navy-missile theory not only 

        remains superior to all other TWA 800 

        theories, but is stronger than ever.

That's too general a term for me.
1- How do I train for an intensification of neural plasticity?
1 1- What thoughts,
1 2- how hard,
1 3- how long?
1 4- How does blood pressure effect it?
1 5- How does diet effect it?
How about calcium?

...sounds like short-term memory.
1- What would mid-term memory be if anything?

(ie. radio, EM biofields)?

1- What do neurons that get used often for a long time have?
Seems likely to me that short term memories lack that.
2- Do cells detach and reattach to others?
3- Is there an intermediate phase between approach and connection 
in which signals may be passed?
4- On average, what direction do axons point?

Flat?
So pathways become unused 
because all stimuli use other paths of less resistance?

Especially during meditation,
I feel my pulse in my brain and hear it in my ears.
I follow can the path of gas through my intestines for minutes.
It's made me so aware of my repiration 
that I am developing a new rythym and matras to match.
My spine creaks at the base of my skull.

My sunglasses do not do much harm as I stare at a moniter all day.
I do not wear earplugs ALL the time,
"Future Fantastic", The Learning Channel, and the Discovery Channel 
are good to listen to.
Another interesting related fact is I remember more dreams.

1- What is "neural noise"?
Is that why my ears squeal?

But then the two are no longer perfect copies of each other because they were 
told different things. Some, like me, think the distinction between a copy 
and an original is meaningless, so we wouldn't change much, so the received 
information is irrelevant to the thought experiment, so my original objection
holds.
  
For some reason others think there is a huge, if inexpressible, difference  
between a copy and an original, so if I told one of them that they were a 
copy and could somehow get them to believe it (it would not be easy) then 
they would become very upset. The copy would be undergoing a traumatic 
emotional experience but the original would not, so the state of mind the two 
would be in would not be even approximately the same, so my original 
objection holds.

I think it tells you something that the substance of this thought experiment  
is symmetrical, it in no way changes if you lie and tell the original he's  
the copy and the copy he's the original. Convincing the copy he's the 
original would as easy as convincing the original he's the original; and 
convincing the original he's the copy would be no more difficult than
convincing the copy he's the copy.

That's an interesting possibility, but it raises a confusing issue.

By making the formal system inconsistent, Godel's proof of incompleteness
no longer applies.

However, for Godel's theorem to even be applicable, we have to be dealing
with a formal system in the first place.  A formal system which can prove
theorems both true and false is inconsistent, but strictly speaking
it can then prove all theorems true.  This is not how your program is
intended to work.

I think the problem is that my claim yesterday that an AI program running
on a computer was "automatically" a formal system was not quite right.
Or more accurately, we could set up a formal system which characterized
all beliefs of the AI, but ironically it would not be powerful enough for
Godel's system to apply.  Specifically, it would not be a superset of
logic and arithmetic.

This may seem wrong, because surely our minds are capable of logical and
arithmetic reasoning.  However I believe in practice we are only capable
of an approximation to strict perfection in logic and arithmetic, which
is required by a formal system.  For one thing, we are limited in the size
of the propositions we can consider, understand, and prove.  For another,
we make mistakes.  When we find ourselves in a contradiction, we don't
melt down and find ourselves believing that every proposition is true,
as a formal system would.  Instead we abandon one of our beliefs (or else
segregate the inconsistencies in our minds somehow).

Now I think Penrose would deny these two points; he would say that even
very large proofs could in principle be verified if we took them step by
step, and secondly he says that even if individuals make mistakes, then
the community of mathematicians notices and corrects them.  So you have
to expand your formal system to include an uploaded community, and now it
is supposed to incorporate strict, perfect adherence to logic.

You can judge for yourself how persuasive this is.

It is not controversial, this has been known for a while among
demographers. Education may not be the solution to *everything*, but
it comes close :-)

I have been thinking of what basis we should evaluate technology
on. At least on this list it seems very logical to start with the
Extropian Principles and the basic concept of extropy.

In the section on Intelligent Technology Max writes:

	We will co-evolve with the products of our minds, integrating
	with them, finally merging with our intelligent technology in
	a posthuman synthesis, amplifying our abilities and extending
	our freedom.

This suggests strongly that the extropian view of technology is that
it is a tool to amplify extropy. Technology that amplifies extropy
well is good technology, technology that decreases extropy is bad
technology. Extropy is defined as:

	EXTROPY: A measure of intelligence, information, energy, life,
	experience, diversity, opportunity, and growth. The collection
	of forces which oppose entropy.

So the Internet is in general good technology, not just because it is
useful (what?! The net useful? :-) but also because it embodies
positive values to us. On the other hand television is in some
respects a non-extropian technology since it promotes a identical
broadcasts to a passive audience aimed the lowest common denominator
(while at the same time it gives experience and information). So an
extropian critique of the Internet would focus on how to make the net
more extropic and safeguard it against becoming a new television
medium. 

Note that the above definitions suggests that polluting technology
(beside being wasteful) is also strongly entropic; extropianism has an
environmental ethos at its core, it is just not expressed in the
conventional sense and may extend to all complex systems.

Another quote from the Principles:

	We favor careful and cautious development of powerful
	technologies, but will neither stifle evolutionary advancement
	nor cringe before the unfamiliar. Regarding timidity and
	stagnation as unworthy of us, we choose to stride valiantly
	into the future.

This clearly rejects arguments from unfamiliarity and "if we don't
know if it is dangerous, let's assume it is", while pointing out that
we want to rationally evaluate the technology. After all, we plan to
be living with it. Rational risk analysis, open technology and public
discussions are to be promoted, and technologies that attempt to avoid
this are inherently suspect (e.g. see the comments about secret
cryptosystems in the PGP manual).

Actually, I consider this "stuff of consciousness" to be information,
or more accurately instantiated information. So I have no problem
imagining a computer experiencing the color red if it has the right
software, and transferring my mind into the computer is just a problem
of replicating the pattern. But I cannot be sure until I try.

Dear extropians and other transhuman cryonicists:

This year the CryoFeast will be Co-Hosted by Alcor members in a number of
locations throughout the US and across the world! 

The Alcor CryoFeast is a yearly party held the first weekend of December  to
celebrate and toast our future and our indefinite lifespans. Others may be a
little behind the times in giving thanks for the harvest;  we cryonicsts are
giving thanks for the technologies that may help us to achieve indefinite
lifespans.  

During the 1980's and early 1990's the CryoFeast was held in Los Angeles.
Timothy Leary was the host for many of these parties.  Last year, Ailing
(Niki) Freemand and Tim Freeman graciously hosted the CryoFeast in the Bay area.

If you are an Alcor member and would like to Co-Host a CryoFeast in your
vicinity on December 6th (flexible), please contact me soonest.  We welcome
everyone to participate, and even if there are just a few members in your
area, or just yourself,  be a co-host anyway!

Thank you!

	Yes "instantiated information" is more accurate.  Instantiated
information is represented by something fundamentally real.  The state
of a transistor can be an instantiation or representation of the word
stop.  So can the color red.  A distinguishably different state of
that same transistor can be an instantiation of the word go.  And
green could similarly be taken to represent go.  But, there are some
important qualities that red/green has that the particular states of
the transistors do not have.  It doesn't matter what the fundamental
state of the transistor is as long as it is interpreted correctly.  If
you reverse the interpretation and the setting of the value the
abstract meaning stays the same even though the fundamental or
physical representation is now opposite.  If we swap the meaning of
red and green, the abstract meaning can be the same, but the
fundamental subjective or phenomenal experience is very different.
Such phenomenal qualities of experience must be taken into account in
order to reproduce consciousness.

	Would you really be happy if all you knew of "salty" was
whether or not some abstract salty bit was set or not and all you had
was a corresponding look up table containing all the strings people
had ever used to try to verbally describe what salty is like?  "It's
kind of a puckery non sweet taste" just contains no meaning at all
about what salty is really phenomenally like.  The difference is the
actual fundamental and phenomenal nature of the particular
"instantiation" and this difference is most definitely important to
consciousness.

	How many abstract bits of information would it take to store
the various possible responses to the question: "What is salty?"  in a
discussion kind of way?  Wouldn't an abstract machine producing such
responses really be a liar since it really had no idea what salty was
phenomenally like?

	How many bits do you think the brain uses to reproduce such
"information"?  Or does it simply know what salty is like?  And might
such phenomenal abilities to "instantiate information" be one reason
for such "common sense" intelligence that abstract machines still
lack?

	Wouldn't an honest and intelligent abstract machine be able to
recognize that it doesn't really know what salty is like, just as you
must admit that you don't know what salty is like for me, unless salty
is the same for me as it is for you?

	If you get a chance, you should ask Marvin Minsky what he
thinks about this kind of stuff.  I believe he once thought very
similar to the way you now think.

Not that I have anything to say about TWA 800, but...
Do you really believe this?  A single missle.  One of these
certainly wouldn't be beyond the  *financial* resources of
many terrorist groups.  Are you saying that they couldn't
learn how to use it (assuming they are all civilians)?

In early November, I posted to the list a set of predictions made by
artificial intelligence pioneers Herb Simon and Allen Newell in 1958.
Prediction number three was: 

  3. That within ten years a digital computer will write music that will
  be accepted by critics as possessing considerable aesthetic value. 

Anders Sandberg commented that composer David Cope had created a music
composition system called EMI 
(see http://arts.ucsc.edu/faculty/cope/home). 

Anders also stated, "It is probably best described as computer assisted
composition, but it is not unlikely that it could fool at least some
people at a "musical Turing test"." 

The prescience of his double-negated analysis is revealed in an article
that appeared in todays New York Times Cybertimes section.

Begin excerpt:  

In a low-key, musical version of the match between Garry Kasparov and the
chess-playing machine called Deep Blue, a musician at the University of
Oregon competed last month with a computer to compose music in the style
of Johann Sebastian Bach. Dr. Steve Larson, who teaches music theory at
the university, listened anxiously while his wife, the pianist Winifred
Kerner, performed three entries in the contest -- one by Bach, one by
Larson and one by a computer program called EMI, or Experiments in Musical
Intelligence.

Larson was hurt when the audience concluded that his piece -- a simple,
engaging form called a two-part invention -- was written by the computer.
But he felt somewhat mollified when the listeners went on to decide that
the invention composed by EMI (pronounced "Emmy") was genuine Bach. 

"Bach is absolutely one of my favorite composers," Larson said. "My
admiration for his music is deep and cosmic. That people could be duped by
a computer program was very disconcerting."

The cybernetic pretender, which was invented by David Cope, a composer at
the University of California at Santa Cruz, has been upsetting long-held
assumptions by people in the music world because of its ability to scan
pieces by famous composers, automatically distill some of their essence
and then churn out imitations of the work.

The cognitive scientist and author Dr. Douglas Hofstadter, who presided
over the contest at the University of Oregon in Eugene, calls EMI "the
most thought-provoking project in artificial intelligence that I have ever
come across."

"EMI forces us to look at great works of art and wonder where they came
from and how deep they really are," he said. "Nothing I've seen in
artificial intelligence has done this so well."

Whoa.  If we use "we do not have a full understanding of the laws of
physics" as a rationale, then the substrate of an AI is equally suspect
of being a non-formal system.

Penrose's argument strikes me as exceedingly disengenious.  It is the
interconnections between neurons (rather than the neurons themselves)
that result in the emergent information processing power of the brain.
Those interconnections operate via molecular-level signaling, not QM.
At some level quantum uncertainty affects everything, including a
"deterministic" AI substrate.  But for all practical purposes, a
computer is a formal system, even if quantum fluctuations will cause it
to flip a memory bit every few thousand years.  Does Penrose present any
compelling reason to think of the brain differently?

Brent, for a moment consider this proposition:

The subjective experience of "Red" is a consequence of the
neurophysiological state of seeing (or imagining) light of a certain
frequency.

If we traced this through your brain we would find that red light causes
a certain neural firing pattern in the V1 area of your occipital cortex
to fire, while blue light causes a different neural firing pattern.

We can verify analogous neurophysiological states for various sounds,
bodily sensations, smells, tastes, etc..

Given this, can we not reasonably suppose that the subjective experience
is a consequence of the neurophysiological state triggered by the
stimuli?

If this is the case, can we not learn to distinguish those "neuroqualia"
which are essentially the same among all humans from those neuroqualia
which vary among individuals?

If so, would not the first set represent a set of "experiences" which we
could then share with another individual by instantiating the same
neurophysiological state in that individual?

Indeed, among individuals of different species, or between (for example)
a human and an AI, could we not construct a mapping table that allowed
us to translate these experiences to the appropriate internal
representation?

I beg to differ on a number of grounds.  

1)  This thought experiment may in fact be impossible.  Much like me
imagining (If I could go 10x the speed of light..)

2)  Research has demonstrated a psychological effect of color on humans.
Different colors produce different levels of stress, relaxation,
attention, arousal, etc.. in fairly predictable and consistent ways.  So
I ask you, if I switch red and green, and all fires are now green,
haven't I actually made some difference in the meaning of fire to the
individual?  In the sense that the fire will now evoke a different
response than when it was red?

You assume a gulf between sensation and realization that I do not
believe exists.  Imagine that sensation is a consequence of the physical
system that instantiates the information that is represented in
consciousness.   Or, put another way, sensation /is/ the stuff of
consciousness.  A being that represents salty internally in a
sufficiently rich manner necessarily has an "experience" of salty.

Hmm.  You posit an incredibly simple machine and then grant it
intelligence, which immediately strikes me as contradictory.

Clearly humans do not represent "salty" with an on/off bit.  Instead we
have thousands of sensors which trigger the firing of at least tens of
thousands of neurons, with varying firing speeds of each neuron and
various spatial firing patterns throughout the region.  This is a great
deal of information.  To me it seems completely intuitive that we would
represent this via what our folk psychology calls a "sensation" rather
than some "abstract" knowledge as you suggest.  The closest thing we
have to "abstract" knowledge of salty is the association of the
word-label "salty" to the sensory state we experience upon tasting salt.


So, long and short: if you had a significantly different neural
structure from me, I would expect the experience of tasting something
salty to be quite different for you from me.

Given our species-born similarities (I'm just guessing here that you're
of my species. :) ) I presume that our experiences are quite similar.

Perhaps you are unaware the fertility rates are declining around the 
world and are well below replacement level in much of the world.(In 
developed countries the average woman is only having 1.5 children.) The 
population is still growing, but the rate of increase is decreasing and 
the population will likely peak around 2037 at 8 billion or so. 


I'm all for more advanced technology, but I don't think that it's needed 
to solve any population "problem." Humans, for various reasons, are 
already starting to severely limit their reproductive rates.

FREEZE YOUR HEAD AND LIVE TO PARTY AGAIN!!!
Cryonics is the technology for freezing a person after a terminal illness or
a fatal accident, in the hope that medical science can revive that person in
the future.

In honor of the Alcor Foundation, who have been pioneers in cryonics
research and technical development for more than twenty years, and are
currently the largest provider of cryonics services in the world, and
especially in thankful memory of the late Dr. Timothy Leary's effort to
publicize their cause, we are gleefully throwing open the doors of the
Exclave to all cryonicists, transhumans, extropians, and merely curious
partygoers,
for a gala CryoFeast, Saturday, December 6, 1997, beginning at 2 o'clock in
the afternoon.

We'll provide plates, cups, tableware, and wacky party decorations. To
entertain you all, your hostess will single-handedly roast a super-size
turkey (successfully defrosted and made into delicious food!) and a huge
batch of roast potatoes with garlic. Please bring a favorite dish or
beverages to share with others.

The Exclave - the home of Geoff Dale, Dave Krieger, and Romana Machado - is
located at 819 Pierino Ave, in Sunnyvale, California.
The phone number is (408)730-1990. You can now find directions from the web
at http://www.zip2.com, but just in case this is inconvenient - here they
are.

>From San Francisco:
Take 101 South to 85 South.
Take the 82 South/El Camino Real exit towards Sunnyvale.
Drive 2.7 miles on El Camino Real.
Left at Fair Oaks Ave.
Right at Iris Ave. Drive 3 blocks.
Right onto Pierino Ave.
Continue to the end of the street, we're tucked away to the right.

>From the East Bay:
Take I-880 South.
Take the 237 West.
Take the Lawrence Expressway exit North.
Right on Reed Ave.
Left on Wolfe Road.
Right on Iris Ave.

Not really.  The point is, we don't know how neurons work.  We don't know
what aspects of their function are important.  Conceivably even unknown
subatomic quantum details could affect their gross macroscopic behavior.
This is not true of computers.  They are designed to have known principles
of operation, to work in a strictly defined, algorithmic way.  Like any
machine, they may be imperfect, but their imperfections are not fundamental
to their operations, rather the designers do their best to avoid them.
An AI which runs on a computer has a well understood, formal, algorithmic
system at its base.  A mind running in a brain does not.

This is one theory, but it is not known what the truth is.  Neurons are
generally considered relatively simplistic nonlinear summation devices,
but there could be more going on than we are aware of.

"Compelling," no.  However he suggests some possibilities which can't
be ruled out.  You have to assume (I think) that neurons carry more
of the burden of computing than in conventional theories.  Within the
neurons there may be quantum systems which manage to stay coherent.
Some people point to the insides of microtubules as an area protected from
the environment; others suggest that water molecules near surfaces may
have a quasi-solid structure which could support quantum superpositions.

It's all quite speculative, especially combined with Penrose's theories
about quantum gravity solving the measurement problem.  Nobody would
pay it much attention except that Penrose's Godelian argument seems to
be surprisingly well accepted (as is Searle's Chinese Room argument).
If you accept either of these, you have to either believe in zombies
(beings which act conscious but aren't), or else you have to find some
unknown physics which allows brains to behave non-algorithmically (I
would say magically).

Actually, this study wasn't so controversial, as it was commissioned 
by a global development agency.  The applied results (e.g., the 
ability of the women to control the number of children they birth) do 
depend, however, upon reproductive technology, an area that even the 
pharmaceutical companies admit has fallen into neglect.  It can be 
pointed to as an example of technology that has been suppressed due to 
the imposed moral standards of non-users.  (it's also an area of 
technology that the neo-Luddites have long fought for in connection 
with human rights.)

I try to keep up with this stuff, and I am aware that rich countries
are currently not maintiaining their populations solely by reproduction.
The increase in rich countries is by illegal immigration. (This is not
a complaint, it's an obeservation.) However, the poorer countries,
especially in Latin America and in Asia, have rapidly increasing
populations. Even in Africa and even with the AIDS epidemic, the
populations are growing. The trend you mention actually depends on
increasing wealth, which in turn depends on increased technology.

If the population peaks in 2037 using existing techology with no
advances, it will do so because the average per-capita income reaches
roughly what rich countries consider the poverty level. At this level of
consumption and with no advances in technology, the population will
almost certainly destroy the Earth's ecosystems within 50 years.

The way out of this mess is to continue to deploy new technology,
which should allow us to reach the per-capita levels of wealth that
correlate with zero population growth a much lower demand on the
ecosystems. Of course, IMO we will actually end up with radical
changes to our civilization which render this entire discussion
irrelevant. For example, If I can use nanotech to establish myself
in space, I will make no further demands on the Earth's ecosystems.
If I can upload copies of myself, or if I joinb with one or more
others to create a composite copy, I have no biological constraint on
reporduction. Much more likely, we will spawn a new civilization based
on superintelligence(s), the results of which are incomprehensible.

I enjoyed your response, and I particularly liked the style. However,
my little tirade is hardly a reasoned argument. It was an instant
hip-shot response, typed as fast as I could type. I was hoping to
stimulate just the kind of message you wrote.

It appears that our biggest point of disagreement is really a matter
of time scales. I really don't think that ideas about ethics,
government,
etc. percolate as fast as technology changes. I understand your point
that birthrate goes down when women can get even a small amount of
education on birth control and family size economics, even in very
poor countries, but the people that control the money for such
educational efforts have a different agenda. You first have to change
their aganda, and that takes time. My argument is not really that I
think technical advance is good, but rather that IMO the the most
likely consequences of technical advance are less bad than the
most likely consequences of a failure to advance.

One more point:

This is from a U.S. Census press release.  So it is not even true that
the U.S. population would be declining if you didn't count immigration.
Growth due to births is about twice net immigration.

BTW I thought this ad at the bottom was funny:

"And remember - you can always count on the Census Bureau."

I didn't get beyond this point without a mental "huh?".  Immigration, sure,
but illegal?  A quick altavista search led to:

http://www.rahul.net/iti/kzpg/Archive/Broadcasts/News/US/Imm/96/msg00071.html

an article about the 1996 immigration bill:

The article appears to have no axe to grind, and from this it appears that
at least in the United States, legal immigration is much more important
than illegal immigration.  I would expect the imbalance in favor of legal
immigration to be even larger in European countries, which don't have
the U.S. situation of a long border with Mexico.

It is misleading to say that the rich countries are growing because
of illegal immigration, when legal immigration plays a significantly
larger role.

Yeah, the idea that the number of numbers between 0 and 1 was equal to
the total number of numbers was a bit incomprehenible to me back in
school. Glad to see that there is at least SOME differentiation.

However, unlike pure numbers, in terms of "real" photons, you can't have
a fraction of one from a source. You either have none or one or more
integers of photons. Fractional photons only exist in a virtual state,
as in the ZPF. Given this, you need to treat the light from each star
relative to distance like its on a halflife type scale. THis should
limit the total luminosity of a infinite universe, shouldn't it?
Additionally, consider the filtering effects of non-luminous matter. For
example, the actual core of our galaxy is, from our point of view, one
of the dimmest parts of the milky way, because that region also has the
most dust clouds, but it also has the highest density of stars, but it
isn't bright, is it? The existence of dark matter can also be used in a
steady infinite universe to explain the dark sky.

Federal Trade Commission, high and almighty protectors of the
mercantilist oligarchy from the threat of (gasp) a monopoly that only
controls less than 90% of the OS market, with a anti trust suite against
a company that only occupies the #2 position in the browser market.
Where is the antitrust investigation against Netscape for its 70% share
of the browser market? I guess payoffs to the DNC and Clinton for Prez
Cmmty will buy off anything...

No, only Andreesson and his buddy Ellison at Oracle want you to buy a
castrated PC, called an NC, so you can only run their applications on
THEIR servers, and you'll have to pay each time you use them. Now
there's a route to take for personal choice....Or you could buy a Mac,
pay twice as much for the same performance you get in your PC. There's
another choice.

Right now I'm developing HTML front ends for legacy cobol AIX
applications, that will be usable by anyone on the net with access to
the front pages. XWindows is fun, and Netscape works just fine on AIX
most current customer use is via dumb terminals which they will be using
ALPHABrowser with, but while my bosses look at my work as extending the
usability of the dumb terminals our customers use, I look at it as
bridging them toward greater graphical capability when they get bored
with the same old vanilla, they can go over to any graphical system and

Standard Oil had a monopoly on drilling technology and a capital
advantage in distribution. Once drilling technology advanced, and
distribution diversified, there was no need of antitrust action. THis
was already starting when the gov't brought its case against Standard.

DeBeers began as and remains a monopoly only by the laws of South
Africa. It once was, in its infancy, merely a competetive cooperative of
claimholders. GOvernment made it the giant it is today.

If a patent holder is that small minded to accept the bribe of current
monoliths, then they obviously aren't smart enough to have figured out
the be all and end all invention for that technology, and contrary to
the paranoid dreams of resentful dreamers everywhere, most companies
that buy up patents do indeed intend to use them. The problem comes when
they figure out that such and so invetion is only cost effective if the
cost of a given resource rises to a certain level. Usually by the time
prices reach that level, or the cost of the technology to build the
invention goes down (like Moore's law dictates for electronics), someone
has come along with an even better invention....

And they do and have used them when the cost of energy rises, or the
cost of the invention drops to the point where the new invention  is a
cost effective change in technology.

WHy is it that anti-MSers only perceive "innovation" to pertain to
software technology itself? That is the sort of narrow minded view of
the world that explains why these people and the systems they worship
never go anywhere commercially. They have no idea that there is such a
thing as commercial, marketing, or entrepreneurial innovation. How it is
sold, how it is made, and how it gets to market are just as important as
how it works to its commerical success.

Its alright to acknowledge that some things don't need the hand of big
brother to come and fix things for spoiled little brats who can't make
it on their own. Isn't that a bit dogmatic? Why do you have such an
unshakeable faith in the moral righteousnesss of government
bureaucracies to best determine who and what is competetive and who and
what is "cheating"?

I'll agree with that, but I'll also say that no other company's app will
have more than 10% of the same market, cause they still won't make them
as good. THough that could change. I got a rather lengthy and in depth
response to my list of bugs/fix demands, etc. from Corel the other day,
regarding my extreme dissatisfaction with their Ventura product. It was
the first time I'd sent a real life letter of dissatisfaction to a
company. SOme of the problems I've found they have just fixed in the
newest maint. upgrade, and other suggestions they liked and are
implementing, while a few that I thought obvious and important they wont
be doing, but I batted .800 with them so I guess I did pretty good. This
is known as "market signals"

There is no halflife of photons, they are eminently stable. But of the
photons outputed by a distant star, only a handfull will ever reach
your eye. My argument still holds if you have indivisible photons,
since we are speaking of photons/steradian, not individual photons. In
the infinite universe, there will be so many very distant stars that
even if they send just one photon each throughout their history to
your eye the light will be blinding.

This has been mentioned a lot of times in this thread, but the short
answer is: no, it doesn't work. Given an infinite time and an infinite
number of stars, the non-luminous matter would be heated until it
shone just as brightly as the rest of the sky.

Hello all,

Just a thought !

Yesterday I saw a gamma knife on the television.
With this they cut tissue in the brain, without opening the head.
This is done by 250 gamma beams, who are alone very harmless,
but all together in their "burning point" they burn tissue away.

Anyway (this is of course way out off my league) what if you
would use something similar for positioning atoms. So by 
keeping one Atom locked between beams from different (opposite)
directions and doing this also with the one you would like to push
against it, you could move and work in 3d, instead of flat, like an STM.

Well.............   :-)

Yes, atoms can be manipulated with laser beams. "Optical crystals" can
be created where atoms align in the nodes to three intersecting beams,
and matter can be moved around or cooled with lasers. Using them for
molecular manipulation is likely hard though, since the wavefronts are
much larger than the atoms, so that if you push atom A towards atom B,
both atoms will move.

A very interesting point was recently made to me by a friend who's doing
a Ph.D.  in Artificial Intelligence.  Recall the first formal example of
deduction that our species is alleged to have made: Socrates saying,
"All men are mortal.  Socrates is a man.  Therefore Socrates is mortal."
Putting it more visually,

    All men are mortal        (A)
    Socrates is a man         (B)
    ------------------
    Socrates is mortal        (C)

If we are given A and B, the process of concluding C is called
"deduction".  There's another form of logic we are taught, called
induction.  (Not mathematical induction; *logical* induction.)  In that
case, we are given many examples of B and C, and we hypothesize that A
must be true.  In other words, given many specific examples, we induce
a "universal law", in this case, we hypothesize that since Socrates is
mortal, Plato is mortal, both their parents were mortal, and in fact
nobody is ever observed to live forever, we hypothesize that *all* men
are mortal.  That is logical induction: synthesizing a universal rule
based on many similar observations.  It is interesting to note that
logical induction is what revolutionary scientists do when they create
a new theory.  They *create* what they hope are universal laws, that
are designed specifically to reproduce observations.

However, there is a third form of logic that apparently was never given
a name until recently.  What if we are given A and C?  Namely, "All men
are mortal.  Socrates is mortal."  In this case, we are given a universal
law, and a conclusion, and we are left to hypothesize a possible
explanation that can produce the observations, given the "universal
laws".  Can we conclude that Socrates is a man?  NO!  This is because
there are other universal laws.  Not only are all men mortal, but,
for example all horses are mortal:

    All horses are mortal.       (A')
    Socrates is a horse.         (B')
    ----------------------
    Socrates is mortal.          (C) (not C', just C)

Just because all men are mortal, and Socrates is mortal, does not imply
that Socrates is a man.  Socrates may be a horse!  The process of taking
a set of universal laws like A, A', etc, and a single observation like C,
and creating a hyothesis like B or B' has been dubbed "abduction", with
the root "abduce", by the AI people.  And the AI folks note that
almost ALL logic perfomed in the everyday living of humans is
abduction!  We have in our minds a picture of how the world works; we
see observations, and then we *abduce* a sequence of circumstances,
based on our model of the world, that could produce the observations.
The abduced sequence of events is rarely a unique solution, and we
spend our time finding the *best* sequence of events that fits the
observations.

For example, you walk outside, and the ground is wet.  What can you
conclude?  Well, it may have rained recently.  Or perhaps water main
broke and flooded the area.  Or a street sweeping machine went haywire
and sprayed too much water.  There are several possible explanations
you could abduce.  To find out which one is correct, you may have to
look around some more, and use your knowledge of how the world works
to create a "story" that fits the facts, and your knowledge of the
world.  It is interesting to note that this is the kind of logic that
Sherlock Holmes used; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle incorrectly labeled it
"deduction" in his stories.

I'll give one more example of abduction.  Last winter I was cross-
country skiing north or Toronto.  One of the ski trails had foot
prints in the middle of it.  Now, it is extremely bad ettiquette
to walk on a ski trails, because it ruins the smoothness of the trail
and makes it hard to ski properly, and I was seriously annoyed that
somebody would be walking on the ski trails.  "What kind of asshole
would go for a walk on the trails in February?", I fumed.  I had
hypothesized that some inconsiderate or clueless wag was going for
a pleasant walk on the trails, probably without realizing his
faus pas.  About 10 minutes later the footprints ended, and at that
place there was a person-shaped dent in the snow, many ski-prints and
footprints facing various directions, and a little ways away was half
a broken ski.  "Ahhhhhhhhh!", I thought.  Obviously, my previous
abduction was incorrect.  The footprints were from a skier who
had fallen down and broken a ski, and had to walk back.

I have found it very interesting to observe myself in my day-to-day
life and notice how often we use abduction without even realizing
it, and without even having a name for it until recently.  So, one
of the current challenges in AI is to build machines that can abduce
as well as we do.

	I described an "effing" process earlier in this thread in
which a sensing machine observes the neurophysiological firings of all
relevant "neural correlates" to a particular sensation.  Then this
information is communicated to another brain which is augmented with a
cortex that is able to produce generic sensations in the consciousness
of that person.  Upon receiving the information from the sensor
observing sensation process in the other brain, it would produce in
the consciousness of the augmented brain an identical sensation.  It
may be that the person doing the effing might say: "That isn't what
salt tastes like to me".

	I can imagine being able to "eff" sensation in other animals,
like say a bat.  We would then know what it is like to be a bat.  I
also imagine machines or computers being endowed with such generic
qualia experiencing devices so that they too could experience and know
what salty is.  I would imagine that computers with such phenomenal
representation abilities would be many times more intelligent and have
much more common sense than any computer that uses mere abstract
representations.

	The important thing is is that salty is salty.  Sure, you can
abstractly represent any and everything you might want to represent
about salty and instantiate this abstract information any way you
want, but salty is still salty.  Anything that is fundamentally
different than salty is not salty even though it may abstractly
represent salty.  Only salty is like salty everything else is a mere
and fundamentally different representation.

> 1) This thought experiment may in fact be impossible.  Much like me
> imagining (If I could go 10x the speed of light..)

	All you would have to do is something like create a city of
streets where red equals go and green equals stop.  The driving would
all be the same, but the subjective experience of the drivers would be
different.

	I would say yes to these questions.  The various levels of
"stress, relaxation, attention, arousal, etc.." is a very complex
process.  Sure it could be related to particular qualia or to various
neural responses prior to and/or beyond the particular ones that
produce particular colors because of memory associations and
everything else.

	Yes, any old abstract representation can be sufficiently rich
to represent or model salty.  But only my salty is precisely like my
salty.

	Sorry for the confusion.  I'm talking about the kinds of
abstract machines people produce these days which use abstract look up
tables and such to try to carry on conversations like humans do.  I'm
saying that a poor programmer of intelligence would try to make his AI
be a liar and try to have it spout verbiage a human might spout, via a
lookup table or whatever, when asked what salty is.  A truly
intelligent AI would logically recognize that it has no real
subjective experience of salty or whatever and would try to explain
this in any conversation on the topic, unless of course it was really
trying to deceive someone that it was not a computer and intentionally
being a liar.

	Yes, of course.  But until we discover what salty really is
and can do things like eff such sensations, produce the same in
artificial machines and so on, we just don't yet know for sure.  But
we do know what our sensations are like and that they are phenomenally
real.  Red is most definitely not anything like salty.  We know such
things more than we know anything else for indeed everything we
consciously know is represented by such.

It should be controversial, as it not terribly accurate.  It has long been
recognized that the major variable in family size is mortality -- if a
woman has to have a dozen kids to have a decent chance of two or three
surviving to reproduce, than she has to have a dozen kids, lest her genes
vanish from the pool.  Without changing her environment, the supremely
educated woman would be facing exactly the same situation -- and would have
to birth a dozen kids (or give up the race).

In an environment where all of her kids have a good chance of living long
enough to reproduce, even the least educated woman will have fewer kids, as
the reproductive advantage goes to those who give their kids a better
launch in life by not splitting their resources too many ways.

In a society where social improvements are being implemented rapidly
(sewers, education, public medicine, etc.), educating women about the
effect on mortality rate that these improvements are likely to have can
speed up the process of family size reduction (so it doesn't take a full
generation for people to realize that their kids are likely to live to
reproductive age), but it is not the cause of the reduction.

Education, while a good idea for all (and not just for *women*), cannot
stop population growth.  If education gets in the way of reproduction,
mother nature interprets it as damage, and routes around it.  ;-)

Not at all.  Alcor Foundation's annual CryoFeast is a welcoming event for
Alcor members, cryonicists and those interested in simply enjoying the
festivities.  In a traditional sense, this time of year has been to
celebrate Thanksgiving.  In that meaning, it is a festive time to bring and
share foods to eat, exchange ideas for thought, and swap ideas, and share in
the jubilee and rousing cheers of what Alcor Foundation represents in the
community of indefinite life spans (immortality).

There will be a number of locations for Co-Hosts of this year's CryoFeast --
a first time to spread the joy and invite other Alcor members to Co-Host
parties in their own vicinities.  The Host is Los Angeles, with Co-Hosts
Boston and the Bay Area, for a few.  Each CryoFeast party will be unique.
The Bay Area's party sounds like a lot of fun, especially for turkey eaters!
Boston should be a blast and a lot of really heady folks.

 Los Angele's will delight in a variety of delectable dishes with a  focus
on guest appearances from authors (for book signings), a virtual appearance
of Vinor Vinge!, and footage of "Future Fantastic," and our special hosts
Fred and Linda Chamberlain of Alcor Foundation.

Alcor is the largest cryonics organization, and responsible for innovative
work in the field of cryonic preservation and research.  Members such as
Ralph Merkle and Eric Drexler have made great contributions for our possible
revival to life.  Other creative cryonicists such as Fred and Linda
Chamberlain, Mike Perry and Tanya Jones have worked hard over the years
advancing and refining Alcor's development.

In keeping with the tradition of Thanksgiving but giving it a futuristic
spin, the CryoFeast makes for a good party.

different though possibly similar neurophysiological states and/or

	Once we understand what "neuroqualia" are yes.  I can't
imagine any reason that would prevent such.

	I described an "effing" process earlier in this thread in
which a sensing machine observes the neurophysiological firings of all
relevant "neural correlates" to a particular sensation.  Then this
information is communicated to another brain which is augmented with a
cortex that is able to produce generic sensations in the consciousness
of that person.  Upon receiving the information from the sensor
observing sensation process in the other brain, it would produce in
the consciousness of the augmented brain an identical sensation.  It
may be that the person doing the effing might say: "That isn't what
salt tastes like to me".

	I can imagine being able to "eff" sensation in other animals,
like say a bat.  We would then know what it is like to be a bat.  I
also imagine machines or computers being endowed with such generic
qualia experiencing devices so that they too could experience and know
what salty is.  I would imagine that computers with such phenomenal
representation abilities would be many times more intelligent and have
much more common sense than any computer that uses mere abstract
representations.

	The important thing is is that salty is salty.  Sure, you can
abstractly represent any and everything you might want to represent
about salty and instantiate this abstract information any way you
want, but salty is still salty.  Anything that is fundamentally
different than salty is not salty even though it may abstractly
represent salty.  Only salty is like salty everything else is a mere
and fundamentally different representation.

	All you would have to do is something like create a city of
streets where red equals go and green equals stop.  The driving would
all be the same, but the subjective experience of the drivers would be
different.

	I would say yes to these questions.  The various levels of
"stress, relaxation, attention, arousal, etc.." is a very complex
process.  Sure it could be related to particular qualia or to various
neural responses prior to and/or beyond the particular ones that
produce particular colors because of memory associations and
everything else.

	Yes, any old abstract representation can be sufficiently rich
to represent or model salty.  But only my salty is precisely like my
salty.

	Sorry for the confusion.  I'm talking about the kinds of
abstract machines people produce these days which use abstract look up
tables and such to try to carry on conversations like humans do.  I'm
saying that a poor programmer of intelligence would try to make his AI
be a liar and try to have it spout verbiage a human might spout, via a
lookup table or whatever, when asked what salty is.  A truly
intelligent AI would logically recognize that it has no real
subjective experience of salty or whatever and would try to explain
this in any conversation on the topic, unless of course it was really
trying to deceive someone that it was not a computer and intentionally
being a liar.

	Yes, of course.  But until we discover what salty really is
and can do things like eff such sensations, produce the same in
artificial machines and so on, we just don't yet know for sure.  But
we do know what our sensations are like and that they are phenomenally
real.  Red is most definitely not anything like salty.  We know such
things more than we know anything else for indeed everything we
consciously know is represented by such.

I believe that your approach to this issue results from your view of
perception, and communication.  You have taken a top down approach to
the problem of abstract sensations - "I know what salty is, even if I
can't explain it" - and seem to be implying that an A.I. should start
with this idea about what salty is, before it trys to experience.  It
would seem to me that this problem requires a bottom up approach -
surely humans new how to taste salt before they could express this in
words?

So let it be for A.I.s.  Using an electronic nose, or some other such
contrivance, they will have their own experience of the taste of salt -
based on the feedback they get from their input device.  This experience
of the taste of salt will be no less valid to them as our experiences
are to us.  You have made a good point though - that an A.I. would not
be able to compare it's experience to that of a non-A.I.

On the subject of the copy paradox in general, specifically the
difference between the original and the copy:

Surely at the point of creation - the instant of copying - and assuming
the copying is exact - the original and the copy are indistinguishable.
The copy "is" the original to all intents and purposes.  A copying
process which is not exact, or one in which the copy has a different
experience of the copying process to the original, is not valid for this
thought experiment.

For another view of this subject, I recommend the first part of the
short story "Dust" by Greg Egan.

I thought that my previous message might be clarified a bit if I formalized
it a bit.  The formal generalization of "All men are mortal; Socrates is
a man; therefore Socrates is mortal" is

  (A) for all x in the set S, property P(x) holds.
  (B) y is in the set S.
  (C) property P(y) holds.

The process of concluding (C) from (A) and (B) is called deduction.

The process of hypothesizing the existence of a universal law (A) from
many observations of (B) and (C) is called induction.

The process of hypothesizing (B) from the knowledge of (A) and the
observation (C) is called abduction.

Actually, price/performance ratios for Macs are the same or better than
Intel PCs.  Keep in mind that Macs come with built in ethernet, stereo
sound, video capability, music synthesizers, voice recognition, and
other items that aren't included in some PC prices.

It's also hard to compare prices on the fastest Motorola or Alpha chips
with Intel chips because Intel can't go that fast yet.  If you need the
fastest machines, the price of Intels become infinity (= not available).

This has been my experience with Microsoft products.  I am currently

the data format of my "Internet Config" control panel, which is used by

may not be compatible with the "newer" version.  Basically, they
reformatted another product's data files in such a way to make it
MS-compatible only, and broke it for other products.

Another example just occurred at IBM where I work, also involving
Microsoft and Web Pages.  The Microsoft servers wouldn't feed graphics
correctly to Netscape browsers.  They claimed that the Netscape browser
can't view the file, but that Internet Explorer can.  Upon
investigation, it turns out that the files are readable by Netscape, but
that the Microsoft Server refuses to serve to Netscape clients.  When
one of our engineers tried to retaliate by making his webserver refuse
to serve to Microsoft Internet Explorer, we discovered that the
Microsoft browser will misrepresent itself to gain access.  It first
claims to be Microsoft Internet Explorer.  If access is denied, it then
claims to be Netscape Mozilla to gain access.

There also are many examples of Microsoft products opening back doors on
machines to allow their servers to gain access, or for their anti-piracy
software to check for stolen products on your machine.  Some of these I
have discovered will open listening sockets on the network, even when
networking appears to be disabled and all access permissions are denied.
This latter example occurred with a wordprocessor program on a
"non-networked" machine that was causing network problems for other
machines.  There was no way to open a document file without the machine
turning on the network and communicating data about the local machine to
other Microsoft products on the network.

As a Network Security consultant, I recommend that my clients do not use
products that deliberately sabatage other products, lie to security
filters to gain access to other machines, or open back doors to the
network that are neither documented or part of the product's normal
function.

Commuting the Law of Probable Dispersal, that that which hits the fan
will not be evenly distributed, with William Gibson's quote that "The
future is here, its just not evenly distributed" we find that the Future
has Hit the Fan

Prison Ships would exist, they just would be indistinguishable from
monastary ships. A type of post industrial dude ranch... for busy
hypersuccessful people to go to to "get away from it all". To feel that
sense of anxiety at bending over to pick up the soap.... ;)

Many are confused by my last post under the heading,
"What TWA 800 HOAX,"  for by republishing one of my
reports it appeared I was recommitting the crime of
advocating the Navy-missile theory again. Not true:

   The confusion stems from CNN's misrepresentation.

   It's true that I said I was sorry and apologized 
   for my promotion of the Navy-missile theory. But 
   it's false that I said anything I did was a sham, 
   plot, or hoax, as the media reported. There's a 
   world of difference between saying my promotion 
   of a theory was a mistake and that it was a fraud. 

   THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FACTS AND THEORIES

   If they're going to say the case I assembled 
   was a sham, as they are, then I will present 
   the case and ask "So where's the sham?" All I 
   see are a list of factual items from which a 
   theory is extrapolated. A theory derived from 
   a set of facts may be true or false, even as 
   the facts are all true. I stand behind those 
   facts (http://www.copi.com/articles/Goddard) 
   even as I discontinue to advocate the theory. 
   There's absolutely no contradiction there.

   When I say I stand by my case,  I say that 
   it was a legitimate case, that it was built 
   upon facts that tend to support the theory.
   Nobody can refute the facts it rests upon,
   but we can disagree over what they mean.

   (a) Crisp facts and (b) fuzzy theories.
   I stand by (a) but no longer espouse
   any (b). I also never blurred the
   line between (a) and (b) as has
   been widely misreported.

   The Navy-missile case is a case of circumstantial 
   evidence, which some might call a compelling case.

   HOWEVER:

   Just because 154 people saw what is 
   best described as a missile, and just
   because  there was  Navy activity in 
   the area, which the Navy initially 
   denied but then admitted when the 
   radar tapes came out,  does not 
   necessarily mean the Navy shot
   down TWA 800 with a missile.
 
   I have always been aware of that fact, but, 
   wanting to end my TWA 800 analysis forever,
   I felt it proper to apologize to those in 
   the gov't I had caste suspicion upon, for
   they could be innocent... I don't know.?
   If I want to free myself from the case,
   I should free all those in the case.

   But they did not want to free me,
   forcing me to keep the case up to
   counter the false charge of fraud.

   It's regrettable that CNN felt it necessary
   to wrongfully frame me has having admitted
   fraud. For some reason they are desperate
   to sink the Navy-missile theory and me.

   Dr. Stern has made the case available once 
   again so that people can see there was no 
   sham: http:/www.copi.com/article/Goddard

What do you mean "another products data files"? DO you mean that it made
IE the default browser for .html files for that computer? Duh, thats
merely a matter of file format association. It happens with any
application installation, they'll try to hog as many compatible file
formats for themselves and screw existing apps on the system that might
be more useful with those file formats. Microsoft is not alone in this,
its a standard industry practice. Corel did it when I installed Ventura
to .rtf and .doc files, Graphics COnverter Gold did it to ALL graphic
formats (as does HiJaak Graphics Suite).

Here's an idea. Netscape could, GASP, do the same thing, impersonate an
Explorer browser to gain access to a MS webserver.... Gee why didn't I
think of that... I dunno, it must be because I don't work for
microsoft.....

I'd like to see more about this. Any system administrator would find
this a useful tool, and this data must be how many of the network
oversight applications operate. A good way to make sure your coders and
data entry weenies are working and not playing solitaire or sending each
other joke email....I'm sure my boss would like to have that capability

As a network consultant, I recommend that others in the field find out
more about how PCs work in background operations to expand their
horizons past their Mac blindered knowledge...

Unfortunately, that article is not up to date, and only  includes
illegals who are caught and deported. The INS just reported a record
360,000 deportations this year. It is estimated that there is an annual
influx of between 600k to 1.5 mill a year, but it is hard to track
because there is so much seasonal traffic.

Just to be fair, the logic of abduction (or `retroduction') is not a recent
development by AI theorists.  It was discussed extensively by Charles
Sanders Peirce (pron. `purse'), the great American pragmatist and
semiologist, at the end of the 19th and start of the 20th centuries.

Do you have a source for these estimates?  How credible are they?

My quotes were from figures used to justify a bill to crack down on
immigration.  They were not numbers of people caught and deported, they
were estimates of illegal immigration (presumably meaning the people who
were _not_ caught and deported).  Supporters of this legislation would
not have any incentive to minimize the figures.  And this was only a
year ago, so it can't be that far out of date.

The number of deportations in a year does not tell you the number of
illegal immigrants in that year.  Some people may be deported multiple
times.  Some deportees are people who entered in previous years.
There is no direct connection between the two figures.

This value of 360,000 deportations a year doesn't seem to match what I
am finding on the web:

INS statistical yearbook, 1994:

> Each year the Border Patrol is making more than a million apprehensions
> of persons who flagrantly violate our nation's laws by unlawfully crossing
> U.S. borders...

http://www.fairus.org/03203603.htm:

I found another reference to the number of illegals, from the Cato institute:

This seems consistent with the figures used by the Senate to justify their
bill.

Ah ha!  I *KNEW* we had a word for it somewhere!  My question:  do we
really need a new word that means hypothesis?

You described something like how person would experience salty if he
is only told about salty experience. 

You forgot corresponding 'look up table' containing how it relates
*internally* to other tastes, what emotions person experienced when
tasting, etc... 

Actually look up table is too simplistic expression. How would you
describe trained artificial neural net semantically?

Exactly: It doesn't matter, only thing that matters is that person that
is jumping to volcano know that original knows that he is jumping into
volcano. Essential thing is that he is convinced that original/copy of

	The same way abstract computer simulations describe or model
them.  There is no more phenomenal information in any abstract
computer model than there is in what we can abstractly say to each
other.  As I said, you can abstractly model everything with most
anything including speech and internal computer models, but any
abstract model like speech, still, is only abstractly like it.  It
isn't fundamentally like a real feeling or phenomenal sensation.

	Also, neurons in our eyes and optical nerve learn how to
abstractly represent and forward modeling information to the visual
cortex.  But, we are not phenomenally conscious of this information
until it arrives at the visual cortex where the phenomenal conscious
representations are produced.  There is something more going on in the
neurons of the primary visual cortex than the abstract stuff that is
going on in the subconsciousness like the retina neurons.  I would bet
that any neural net of today is still, like the neurons of the retina,
not yet producing phenomenal sensations.  We haven't yet discovered
precisely what this phenomenal process is and how it is formed into a
unified and emotional awareness and why it is like what it is like.

Yes, because hypothesis has at least two uses: inductive and
abductive.  The "laws of physics", for example, are inductive
hypotheses.  They have mounds of evidence behind them, but they can
never be proven.  Newton's Law of Gravitation is an example of a very
successful inductive hypothesis thas was proven false (although usually
an excellent approximation) with the advent of General Relativity.

Of course I have.  I wouldn't have made a statement about price

No, I mean the installer opened up private preferences files for other 
non-Microsoft products that were previously installed on the computer
and changed the data in those files such that the original applications
couldn't use their own files any more.  Internet Config is a seperate
product for configuring IP on the Mac.  No other product is supposed to
write to those files, although the product will feed information from
those files to other applications.  By changing the data formats in this
file, Microsoft caused competing products to start failing with
corrupted data while Microsoft products continue to work with the new
format.  Restoring the Internet Config file from backup reenables the
other products to their original functionality.

Sure they could do the same thing.  But as a Network Security
consultant, I take a dim view of software deliberately providing false
information to queries in an attempt to access server areas that the
server administrator is clearly trying to withhold from that software. 
Just as any hacker caught trying to get in under false pretenses could
be banned from the site, any software that lies to try to bypass
security under false pretenses could also be banned.

Of course my preferred solution is that my clients beef up their own
security the way they want, and then they don't have to worry about what
client do to try to break in.

Yes, it would be a wonderful tool if it were documented and if the
Network Administrators had access to this data.  Instead, it is
undocumented, and only Microsoft software uses this information to
gather data about someone else's network without their knowledge.

Any knowledgeable network engineer can analyze these interactions with a
sniffer and write their own code to access the same listening ports
(backdoors) to gather information about PCs.  For each PC, you could
tell what time an application started and what time it ended.  You could
even choose to deny any specific (Microsoft) application by telling it
that its copy is illegal.  The Microsoft product will override the local
user's desire with the directives received over the network.
 
> As a network consultant, I recommend that others in the field find out

I have discovered this stuff using packet sniffer tools to detect
anomolous behaviors occurring in the background of most software vendors
products.  Much of my research has been part of top secret DoD projects,
for which I was specifically brought in because of my investigations
into backdoors deliberately created by software vendors.  None of my
research is second-hand or unsubstantiated.  (Long-time readers of this
list will remember when I left the Government arena to found my own
company in 1994.)  Besides consulting for DoD security projects, I also
pull six figures per year from IBM for researching their PC networking
difficulties.  I assure you that my knowledge of PC networking is not
slight or biased.

But why argue with me?  Anybody can buy the products, and then reverse
engineer them to see what they are really doing in the background.  If
you are a network consultant, you should probably have the tools to do
this already.  Did you actually investigate any of these items before
you decided to disagreed with them, or do you merely have the "faith"
that Microsoft would never do anything underhanded with their software?

This is where my opinion diverges.  I already have a genetic copy.  He
is not a clone, but a twin.  If someone wanted to shoot me in the head,
I would violently oppose this plan.  The continued existance of my
"copy" does not make me feel comfortable with my death.

Even if my twin could be modified by a plastic surgeon to look exactly
like me, I still wouldn't want to die.  Even if you recorded my exact
brain state, and reset his brain to that exact configuration, I would
still not want to die.

Note that I am not saying that he is not me, or that he is not another
instantiation of "me".  These are semantic word games which don't really
matter.  I just still desire to continue experiencing life.  Knowledge
that another person very similar to me or exactly like me will continue
to experience life does not change my opinion.  My twin has not directly
affected my subjective experience of life up till now.  Even modifying
him to be exactly like me does not change my subjective experience of
life.  In fact, you could modify him without my knowledge. I still would
oppose my personal death.  I don't know how making my twin brother more
like me makes it any more acceptable for me to die.  If you told me that
you had modified my brother to be exactly like me, I still don't see why
I would change my mind and let you shoot me.  Even if I really believed
that you actually accomplished what you claimed, I still wouldn't change
my mind.

Does anyone know what is different between my understanding and that of
those who would be willing to die if there was a copy made of them?  I
am curious to find out why I am not thinking the way other people are. 
Maybe it is my own experience with my own copy (twin) that makes me
skeptical of this approach?

OK, that tears it.

I have a really bad name I've always wanted to use. I envision a corvette
assigned to seed-spreading under hostile conditions: Part warship, part
terraformer...

SEED CORVETTE:
_Penis of Willingdork_ (an obvious consort to the Fertility Goddess class
megaterraformer _Venus of Willendorf_, though under hostile conditions the
names are too similar. Operational names are _Dick_ and _Jane_.)

Although we do not yet know enough characteristics of biological 
neurons to create exact simulations of such a neurons,
I have seen simulations which were able to mimic the behavior 
of very simple life forms possessing very small neural networks 
(<100 neurons) using artificial neural networks.

Because of biological evolution it seems that if quantum systems 
should be present in the neurons of humans they should also be 
present in the neurons of simple organisms, because these 
neurons appear to be quite similar.

Based on this assumption quantum systems, even if present, do not 
seem to be involved in determining the behavior of biological 
neural networks. 

IMHO the known characteristics of neural networks are sufficient 
to account for the behavior of all biological neural networks, 
including the ones which seem to posses consciousness.

The presence of quantum systems in biological neurons seems 
very unlikely.

Isn't the amount of energy required for transmission of more concern 
than using the available bandwidth to it's limit. I.e. is using 
a directed and focused beam instead of using a unidirectional 
pulsating star for transmission, a lot more energy efficient. 
Also by directing a focused beam you can prevent your 
"enemies" from detecting anything. (No need for stealth.)

If you're using a pulsating star to transmit a unidirectional signal
then 
it seems that the purpose is to get attention instead of hiding 
yourself or your transmission.

Furthermore a signal totally indistinguishable from random noise, so 
without any redundancy, will not be able to correct any errors 
created by damage to the signal, and should therefore not be 
practical.

(Indistinguishable from noise, that means every single photon 
should carry an important bit of information. So the loss of a 
single photon should result in loss of information.)

Polluting technology is not strongly entropic by definition. You will 
have to weigh the pros and the contras. Of course, if there are 
alternatives which offer the same capabilities but are less polluting, 
than you should choose the least polluting one.

(For example, cars are polluting the environment but I wouldn't like

And IMO there is no good alternative for it (yet). )

The question is, what constitutes an "abstract" model versus a real one?
Is it a matter of whether the underlying substrate is silicon versus
protein?  Or is it a matter of the internal form and structure of the
model?

I believe Leevi was taking the latter position, and arguing that a
sufficiently complicated model, even if running on silicon, would no
longer be abstract.  Things would acquire meaning not because of arbitrary
assignments (this register holds saltiness, that register holds blueness)
but due to the immense complexity of the interactions among the various
representations.

Saltiness could only be described by a complex relationship among
millions or billions of simulated neurons with various activation
levels, and likewise for other qualia.

In such a system there is no possibility to change redness into blueness
without affecting anything else.  Redness and blueness are so complex,
so interrelated with other concepts, that it would be impossible to
disentangle them from each other.

It is indeed an interesting question at what point in the neural
processing our neurons begin to affect consciousness.  It's conceivable
that there is no boundary, that it is a gradual transition.

You think the retina is purely abstract, just pre-processing and
conditioning the data before it is presented to the _real_ conscious
neural network somewhere in the cortex.  But even there the cortext just
does more processing.  The initial layers are known to look for certain
features in the input, like lines and edges.  Certain neurons will fire
when they "see" lines with specific orientations.  Other neurons look
for simple patterns of movement, like vertically moving edges.

We can easily imagine that this kind of feature analysis would be useful
in beginning to understand the structure of an image.  But this is still
very mechanical and, as you would say, abstract.  Presumably it is just
a preliminary stage as well, to be passed to a still deeper level of
processing, and perhaps that is where consciousness will begin.

But the alternative is that we're peeling an onion, and when we get down
to the center, there's nothing there.  All those layers we discarded as
doing purely abstract calculations were collectively creating the very
consciousness that we were looking for.  By this point of view, even the
mechanical calculations of the retina can be said to be a part of our
conscious experience of vision.  It plays a structural and causal role in
the image processing which we call a sense of sight.

Certainly a physical copy would not be enough.  But things are different
if you are talking about an exact mental copy.  It can be argued that
identity is fundamentally a matter of patterns of processing.  Reproduce
the pattern, and you reproduce the identity.

It's possible that your twin is making you focus too closely on genetic
and physical similarity, which is really not the issue.  There is an
enormous difference between someone who looks something like you and
someone whose brain is running exactly the same program as yours.

Here are two arguments which make the pattern theory of identity more
plausible.

The first is to imagine that you are an upload, a computer program which
was originally a copy of some human mind.  You live within the computer,
your mind is a program.  Now what kinds of transformations will you
allow to occur to your program?

It seems plausible, based on our experience with programs, that it should
be OK to suspend your program for a while, and restart it.  You will
of course not experience any passage of time during the suspension.
If you object to this, consider for example that you may be running
on a timesharing system where this happens all the time anyway, or you
could imagine running on progressively slower computers until you were
in effect suspended.  Neither of these would seem to give you reason to
believe that you have died.

It is also plausible that you would be willing to run on a computer network
of some kind, with your processing spread over multiple computers.  (It may
well be that this is the only practical way to run such a complex program.)
In this situation, it could even be the case that the network is dynamic,
with different processors being available from time to time, and the various
parts of your program jumping from processor to processor over the course
of your run.  You would not be subjectively aware of any of this, and your
mental functioning would seem perfectly normal.

Putting these together, you could imagine stopping your run on one computer,
and later resuming it on a different computer.  You would not perceive any
break in your train of thought or have any reason to believe that you had
died.

Now, this is effectively the same as starting up a copy of your mind while
destroying the original.  It appears that this actually does preserve
identity, at least in the case of uploads, and there is no reason why it
should not do so for organic brains as well - it's just more difficult to
arrange in that case.

Another argument is to consider the case of a world where copying like
you describe is easy and commonly used as a means of transportation.
Someone has copies "on ice" on many different planets, and when they
want to travel elsewhere they transmit a copy of their brain state, get
that programmed into the brain of the copy, which then wakes up as them.
(This is similar to what is done in Linda Nagata's "The Bohr Maker".)

Imagine yourself someone who has participated in this form of
transportation many times over the course of his life.  He has memories
of having lived in each of these various bodies for a time, then
transferring his consciousness to a different one, while the original
body was destroyed (or at least its memory erased for future use).

>From his point of view, these transformations preserved his consciousness
and sense of self just as much as going to sleep at night and waking
up in the morning.  He felt just the same, behaved the same, remembered
everything he had done before the transfer.  There is no reason for him
to view it as death.

This would be the natural point of view of anyone who had tried it a
few times.  So it would seem that actually experiencing the kind of
transfer that you are afraid of leads to reassurance that it does preserve
your sense of self, and there is no reason to fear it as death.

I agree; neither would I.

Here is something to think about.  If this copying and killing of one 
copy could be done, I think that the copy slated for death would 
quickly see your point. :)  *Before* the copying was done, the person 
to be copied can anticipate being both copies, and so it seems 
pointless to worry about which one dies.  Since there is only one of 
said person now, and since after the copying, there will still be one 
left, it seems that (s)he has lost nothing.  

BTW, there is a good fictional representation of this atitude in 
_Permutation City_ by Greg Egan.  The main character keeps trying to 
perform experiments on uploads of himself, and can't understand why 
the uploads won't cooperate, even though HE has every intention of 
doing so.  

> Maybe it is my own experience with my own copy (twin) that makes me
> skeptical of this approach?

Actually, I don't think that it's genetic information that people 
really care about.  Nobody ('cept maybe in China) argues that it's 
okay to shoot every fifth or greater child by a given couple, even 
though little genetic info is lost.  What people care about is 
personal identity, and you and your twin abviously aren't the same 
person.

Anyone would oppose that plan because a genetic copy is not nearly good 
enough, even an exact copy made an hour ago would not do. It's a matter of  
taste but personally I wouldn't be happy unless the copy was made right now. 
How long is now? For human beings about a second or two.

Of course not, but the point is you wouldn't be dead, you wouldn't even know

How do you know that this did not already happen yesterday at 9:32am ? 
How do you know it doesn't happen a thousand times a second?

I don't want to die under any circumstances, but to me dying means having a

I don't care what happens to the carbon atoms in my body, nothing special

I beg to differ. The freedom one might experience from owning a car is
illusory what with the congestion, expense and worry that comes with owning
such an expensive item.

There are viable alternatives: Design a lifestyle that makes the auto
obsolete. I have not driven or owned a car for four years. Today is the 4th
anniversary of my carlessness. Carlessness is a major extropic factor in my
life.

IMHO the auto is one of the most vile contraptions ever designed. The
sooner we run out of petrol the better, however, I fear many people will
die in the ensuing oil wars before we do exhaust our supply.

	Silicon is fundamentally real silicon and protein is
fundamentally real protein.  The two can computationally or abstractly
model each other, producing identical computational output or
behavior, but at the fundamental layer they are not anything like each
other.  When one is formed in a way to model the behavior of the other
it is a mere "abstract" behavior model and not fundamentally like the
real thing.

	Sure you can model any behavior given sufficient computational
complexity but at what point would the fundamental nature suddenly
become the same as the model?  Fundamentally, silicone is still
silicone.  It can never magically suddenly cross a sufficiently
complex boundary and become fundamentally really like protein even
though the model can precisely model, abstractly, that quality.  At
the fundamental level they are different.

	You can't chase the fundamental problem away just by adding
enough complexity.  Sure the "meaning" or abstract behavior can be
anything you want.  A very simple and trivial silicone color detecting
machine has plenty of complexity to tell me what color something is
even better than I can tell what color something is.  But, the
representations of color in this simple machine, though far more
complex, are fundamentally very different than the phenomenal
representations I use to represent color.  The particular fundamental
nature of the color detecting machine representations aren't relevant.
They can be states of a transistor, voltages on a wire, or flux
orientation on magnetic media...  The fundamental nature is not
relevant to the computation in this simple yet more accurate and
complex than me machine.  But for me, the fundamental nature of green,
and how it is phenomenally different from red, is what enables me to
produce the different words green and red.  To me, the fundamental
nature of the representation and what it is like is all important.

> Redness and blueness are so complex, so interrelated with other

	I disagree.  Red is fundamentally and simply red and blue is
fundamentally and simply blue.  The two are not like each other and
nothing else is subjectively the same as them.  There is no tangling
at all.  Just because you can have complex relations between them and
many other things doesn't change their non varying simple and
fundamentally different nature.

	You described the relevance of neural processing in the retina
and argued that it all might gradually become conscious.  Again, I
disagree.

	True, all the subconscious preprocessing is very essential to
extracting the information so that the required 3D information can be
extracted from the stereo 2D images which enables our 3D awareness to
be built out of qualia in the conscious space of our visual cortex.
The green tree you are aware of and think is beyond your eyes, is
really in your visual cortex and only beyond your phenomenal conscious
model of your eyes which is also, merely a model of your eyes in your
brain.  Everything you are aware of is simply a conscious model of the
reality which is beyond your senses.  There is no gradual about it.
One is the source of the stimuli and the other is the final result of
much complex sensing and processing.  They are both at the opposite
ends of the very complex cause and effect process.  One is in your
brain and the other is beyond your senses.  One is conscious, the
other is not.

	There is no color, smell, sound, warmth... or pain beyond our
senses; only the electromagnetic radiation, chemical content,
acoustical vibrations, kinetic energy of molecules... and bodily
damage our brains merely arbitrarily represent with such phenomenon.
Each of these things can very successfully model the other, but they
are not really the other and are only abstract models.  Red really is
nothing like 700nm electromagnetic radiation, but it abstractly models
it well in the conscious world of our awareness inside our brain.

	When we peal away the layers or separate the parts we see a
complex machine composed of very fundamentally real and distinct parts
at the fundamental layer.  Some of these parts abstractly work at
extracting the 3D info contained in the abstract subconscious 2D
stereo images contained on the retina.  This causal process eventually
constructs a glorious 3D model of reality out of phenomenal qualia.
This model built out of qualia is our conscious visual awareness and
is in our brain not beyond our eye.  The 2 2d images on the retina are
clearly not conscious at all.  But the resulting 3d awareness clearly
is and is obviously built out of something.  What this something is
like is fundamentally the quality of consciousness.  Nothing abstract
can be quite fundamentally like it.

I still see a difference between stopping and starting the *same* 
program (which is held in memory until restart), and starting 
*another* program while stopping the first permanently.  We often 
think of two copies of a program as being 'the same' when in fact 
they have features that differ (location, frex).  But we only do this 
because we *don't care* if the program or data we are using is 
identical, as long as it is close enough that it works.  A self-aware 
program would probably care.

I would say that such a person has participated only once. :)  The

doesn't mean that he *is* those people.

Assuming that someone who may exist in the future will think that 
they are me doesn't really help me accept the idea that *I* should be 
killed after the copy is made.

Thanks for you feedback.  I find it facinating when intelligent people
seem to have actual differing opinions that are not based in differences
of belief in certain facts.  I have seen these arguments before, and I
believe in all the same technical capabilities that you seem to
describe, but my conslusion of personal choice would be different than
yours.

I have heard the idea of copying to avoid death many times, but it still
seems to be a semantic smoke-and-mirrors trick where the copies is
merely "labelled" the same as the original.  My experience is different
between me and my copy.  I still experience the universe from the
viewpoint of my original body.  The fact that a copy is made does not
change my experience that I am still within this body.  Danger still
scares this consciousness.  Pain still hurts this body.  And I continue
to try to avoid the death my physical container.  My experiencial
viewpoint does not magically transfer to the new copy like a mystical
soul.  I still continue existing and experiencing withing the original
body.  If you kill this original body, I will feel the pain, I will
experience the loss of consciousness, and then I will stop experiencing
anything at all.  Why would I allow that?  Just because a doppleganger
that looks just like me says, "Trust me, I'll carry on in your place."?

If I copy you perfectly, would you give up your freedom and become my
slave, happy in the knowledge that "you" (your copy) is still free? 
Would you not try to avoid physical pain because it had been explained
to you that "you" (your copy) still exists without pain?  Would you take
a cut in pay as long as "you" (your copy) still received a full salary? 
Would you become celibate and nonjealous, happy in the knowledge that
"you" (your copy) is now having a long-term sexual relationship with
your spouse?  Is not death merely the ultimate inconvenience, permanent
pain, or permanent lack of pleasure?  Would you really not mind being
killed, just because you are assured that "you" (your copy) will be
allowed to live?

I see these examples as similar questions on a continuum.  I'm not sure
why that last one would be any different than the former ones.  I still
see the original as trying to avoid pain, gain pleasure, and avoid
death.  Knowledge of what some other body is experiencing that I am not
experiencing does not influence my desires for the future.

Your other examples are all very good.  They all are different ways of
expressing the same copying example, and they all have the same problem
for me.  They require copying, the creation of a dupliate, and then the
destruction of the original afterwards or simultaneously.  As long as I
am still experiencing myself inside the original, about to suffer that
destruction, I don't see the advantage in having some distant copy that
I am merely told exists.

This is not quite what I mean by a copy.  I want my copy to have real-time
updates of my current mental state.  It's not good enough if a copy was
made a few minutes ago and now I am faced with some problem.  Likewise
there is no way that I can be a slave and my "copy" be free, because
obviously his mental state does not match mine.

Instead, let me go to sleep, render me unconscious, make a copy,
and destroy the original, letting the copy awaken.  Now there is no
experience which the original has that the copy does not share.

I would not do any of these things, except possibly the last one, and
only in the kind of situation described above.  Only in that case is there
the practical possibility of having the copy be an exact mental duplicate
of the original.  In all the others, the copy and original diverge, and
there is no longer a copy of the person who is having the bad situation.

Hopefully my explanation will have clarified this.  I agree with this part,
but the problem is not that copies don't share identity, it's that the
copies are not being kept identical and hence that identity is no longer
shared.

So how do you view the upload examples?  Imagine yourself an upload.
Do you consider yourself to have died if your program is:

	- Paused for a moment?
	- Saved to disk and reloaded?
	- Saved to disk and reloaded to a different computer?
	- Suspended, sent across a network, and restarted on a different set
	  of network nodes?

Whoa.  You want the program to be HELD IN MEMORY?  What happens if it
gets swapped to disk?  Do you think silicon transistors are better at
retaining identity than the magnetic disk surface?

Suppose you were running as a program, on a time sharing system, and
you're cool about it.  "No problem," you say, "since I'm being held
in memory between run slices."  "Hate to tell you this," I say, "but
actually this OS swaps you to disk between runs.  You've been swapped
in and out a dozen times during the last three seconds."  What do
you say?  How do you react?  Do you believe that you've been constantly
dying?

Now suppose you're running on a network.  "No problem," you say, "since
I'm 'the same' program each time because I have the same location."
"Hate to tell you this," I say, "but that network is shared with a few
hundred other programs, and the set of processors you're running on
is constantly changing.  Sometimes you're using these processors here,
sometimes those over there, sometimes it even pulls in some units from a
loaner system at the local data bank.  Your location has shifted 100
times since we've been talking."  What do you say?  How do you react?
Do you consider that you've been constantly dying with each shift in
location?

Yes, yes, one of the ground rules is that we're avoiding saying that
A *is* B.  All I meant was that he has memories of having gone through
this experience multiple times.

Suppose you knew someone who was afraid to fall asleep, because he was
convinced that every time he fell asleep he died, and a new version of
him awoke in the morning - someone who had all the same memories, but
a new person nonetheless.  How would you try to persuade him that he was
mistaken?

Why not program computer in a similar way? I think program that uses

formally. Conjectures would be zero order uncertain proofs.

Does there exist any material about this somewhere?

Another URL is:

http://psyche.cs.monash.edu.au/psyche-index-v2.html#som

(maybe the same thing; Psyche is an Australian on-line journal)

This has critiques of Penrose by such as Moravec, Chalmers, John McCarthy,
and other AI philosophers, including McDermott.  Penrose has a rebuttal as
well.  Quite technical, especially in terms of the discussions of Godel.

I believe there have been various AI programs which worked on heuristic
reasoning (smart guesses).  Doug Lenat's Eurisko was a well known example
from the early 1980's.

To say nothing of the land and resources wasted in suburbs built catering
to car culture, the isolation and cultural vacuum of suburban life, the
destruction of city communities, and the annual traffic deaths of millions
of humans and other animals.  Then there's the fact that, by owning and
relying on a car, you're giving tacit support to the lovely, highly
extropian oil and automobile industries (propped up by federal subsidies
in the US), and heaven forbid that the government shouldn't use military
force to keep oil cheap!

Sure, driving is a convenience; so is stealing money instead of working
for it.  Why does car culture always make me think of government?

Sure, driving is fun and hard to give up once you've made it a part of
your life; so's heroin.

Well, all the big car companies, from Volvo to GM, are working on hyrdogen
cell cars.  Petroleum may be a limited resource, but there's a great deal
of hydrogen out there.

Cars belong in the countryside, not in cities and towns.

I'd say I'm a verb.  Or maybe a preposition, which syntactically are
sometimes regarded as "crypto-verbs" because of the similar way they
govern objects.

"Converse"
"Create"
"Explore"
"Imagine"

"Between"

Of course not.  The problem (for me) is the question of whether the 
pattern which is me (we agree there) is changed significantly during 
the process, EVEN IF only temporarily.  An identical pattern will end 
up being started again in a few minutes, but THIS one will be copied 
onto disk and then destroyed.  The difference is that the one held in 
memory is EXACTLY the same when restarted, while one that's been 
copied to disk is an identical simulacrum.

Several people will have died, but none of them is me.  I may even 
fail to be very mournful of those people, but I will certainly take 
steps (if possible) to put a stop to MY impending death.

Same as above.  A person might be able to cope with this (certainly 
some of you would have no problem with it), but I think the only way 
that I could deal with it would be to give up caring about my 
personal survival altogether.  That is, by making the same shift in 
priorities that almost everyone eventually does, caring more about 
the continuing existance of their children, their works of art, or 
ideas, than about identity survival.

Let me make myself more clear. Assume for a moment that we become 
able to transfer memories from person to person, but not whole 
personalities (yet).  Say someone, is implanted with the memories of 
ten or twelve skydivers who were all killed when their chutes failed 
to open.  Should he assume, then, that he is immune to sudden high- 
speed contact with the ground?  It matters very much whether we 
assume he is or is not the same person as the ones who fell.

I do know someone (or used to) like that.  Me.  When I first was 
convinced that the pattern of my brain was me, this bothered me quite 
a bit.  How large a change is necessary to produce a new person?  I 
have never found an answer to that, and finally lack of sleep led me 
to put it out of my mind. :)

     Extropy = the extent of a systems intelligence, information,
vitality, diversity,
     opportunity, and capacity for growth.


E X T R O P Y  I N S T I T U T E

Extropy Institute (ExI) is a 501[c][3] tax-exempt educational corporation,
founded in 1992 as an outgrowth of the Extropy journal. ExI acts a catalyst
for a better future by helping individuals extend their lives, augment
their intelligence, optimize their psychology, and improve their
communities. The Institute pursues this catalytic role in two ways: through
a creative process of networking and an educational process of
disseminating ideas.

In its creative role, the Institute brings together the finest critical and
innovative minds in an intellectual and social network. This network of
thinkers challenges conventional ideas about human limits and develops new
ideas about the use of technologies of all kinds to improve the future.
Seeking to develop careful thinking about extending the human life span,
augmenting human intelligence, improving human psychology, and refining
economic and political organization, Extropy Institute provides several
forums for networking and creative thinking. The Exponent newsletter
gathers news of developments, members projects, and Institute activities.
The EXTRO conferences bring together thinkers from numerous fields of
study. Other seminars and local meetings, the Extropians email list, and
the web site provide additional forums for developing and refining ideas.

In its educational role, the Institute brings these (always open and
evolving) extropian ideas to the public in order to encourage more rational
practices and beliefs. The Institutes web site provides information on
extropian thinking and links to further resources. Extropy Online presents
extropian thinking gathered from the best minds in a manner accessible to
intelligent non-specialists. The EXTRO conferences, in addition to their
networking role, also act as a means of communicating current extropian
thinking to the public. The Institute disseminates ideas and educates the
public through appearances of its members on television and in newspapers,
magazines, and books, and by representing extropian perspectives at
conferences and in debates.

In essence, the Institute seeks to catalyze continual discoveries that
extend our lives and increase the power and depth of our minds. While
Institute members may hold diverse and sometimes conflicting ideas about
how to pursue these ends, we agree in affirming the values expressed in the
Extropian Principles: Boundless Improvement, Self-Transformation,
Self-Ownership, Dynamic Optimism, Intelligent Technology, and Spontaneous
Order. [see www.extropy.org/extprn26.htm]


E X T R O P I A N S  O N  T H E  N E T

Extropy Institute sponsors a number of forums for sharing limit-busting,
life-extensionist, pro-technology, and other extropian ideas with bright,
like-minded individuals around the globe.

You can also access the Frequently Asked Questions file, and other
Extropian writings, on the World Wide Web. The official ExI Web page:
     http://www.extropy.org

The most popular service is the Extropians e-mail list (founded in 1991),
which boils over with lively discussion and debate on numerous topics. You
can join the members-only list by sending a message to:
          extropians-request@extropy.org

In the body of your message put only the following: 
          subscribe extropians <your e-mail address>

You can also unsubscribe yourself at any time in the same way, by replacing
"subscribe" with "unsubscribe".  For other Majordomo commands, send to the
above address with "help" in the body of the message (and nothing else).

You can find a web-based interface to the lists at:
     http://www.lucifer.com/cgi-bin/exi-lists

There are several local lists for announcements and discussions around Los
Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, the East Coast, and Europe. To
subscribe, substitute for "extropians" in the first command above:
exi-la  or  exi-bay  or  exi-east  exi-can (Canada)  or  exi-euro

A Hypermail archive of postings to the Extropian list can be found at:

                               E X T R O P Y  O N L I N E

Moving to the web in its tenth year, Extropy is a magazine covering the
full range of advanced, emerging, and future technologies with an emphasis
on making you more informed and prepared. Some of the technologies and
issues covered in EXTROPY:

*    Life extension treatments, nutritional supplements, the latest
anti-aging drugs.
*    Advances in computers and human-computer interaction and integration.
*    How to augment your intelligence through nutrients, new smart drugs,
and cognitive techniques.
*    How to modify your mood and motivation with new drugs, and cognitive
management.
*    Where does traditional thinking about radical technologies go wrong?
*    How can we refine our political and social organization? How can
spontaneous order enable us to handle accelerating change?
*    Rethinking traditional moralities in the face of scientific and
technological breakthroughs.
*    Plus: Nanotechnology and molecular computers; artificial wombs and new
methods of parenting; transhumanist philosophy to make sense of rapid
change; prosexual drugs and nutrients; critical thinking about
environmental and resource issues; electronic money and competing
currencies; machine intelligence and artificial life; experimental
communities, the future of privacy.
*   The Advances section will help you stay ahead of the pack with
information on crucial technological developments.

If you're tired of shallow, trendy, or uncritical thinking on the
technological frontier, Extropy will satisfy, startle, and stimulate you.

E X T R O  C O N F E R E N C E S
Our successful third conference, EXTRO-3, took place in San Jose,
California in August 1997, with Dr. Eric Drexler of the Institute for
Molecular Manufacturing as keynote speaker. 165 attendees a range of
stimulating sessions and talked with some of the leading extropic thinkers
of today. Audio and videotapes of all the sessions are available (at a
discount for Institute members).

EXTRO-4, focusing on extension of the maximum human life span (both the
research being done, what measures can be taken today, and the economic and
psychological consequences), is being planned for August 1998, either in
California or Las Vegas. Members will receive updates, which will also
appear on the web site.

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 346 November 13, 1997   by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben
Stein

RECORD HIGH LEVELS OF FUSION POWER AND ENERGY
have been observed at the Joint European Torus (JET) device in
England.  A peak power of 13 MW was reached and  a power
output of 10 MW was sustained for at least a half second, pretty
impressive achievements for a fusion experiment.  The burning of
the deuterium-tritium fuel inside the chamber, and the production
of alpha particles (which, if they can be contained, aid the heating),
went according to schedule, bolstering expectations that the
proposed International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER)
would work as planned.  (Nature, 6 Nov.)

CHANNELING OF PARTICLE BEAMS USING NANOTUBES
may be possible.  Tests at Fermilab and elsewhere have shown that
high-energy beams can be deflected by the rows of atoms in suitably
bent crystals (see Update 261). Now scientists at the Erevan
Physical Institute in Armenia have proposed that crystals, or
"ropes," of  single-walled nanotubes (SWNT's) would be even
better as efficient beam channeling materials since the carbon
nanotubes' large bore (13.8 angstrom diameter) allows plenty of
room for the passage of  particle beams.  (L.A. Gevorgyan et al.,
10 Sept. 1997, JETP (Journal of Experimental and Theoretical
Physics) Letters, a Russian journal, with English translation
published by AIP.)

Hmmm.  This changes the hypothetical situation completely.  I missed the
part about having real-time updates.  I'm not sure this is the same copy
scenario I was considering, since the original and the copy must share
the same thoughts and cannot diverge or be disconnected.  Wouldn't
killing the original create a disconnection or a divergence in
experience that would raise the same objections?  The only complication
with killing the original is that the only witness who would object to
the procedure is silenced, and there is no longer an original reference
with which to validate the copy.  This merely makes it harder to prove
they are not the same, but does not make the procedure any more
functional than if the original were allowed to live.  If the original
is allowed to live, you agree that the copy and the original are not the
same.  If you kill the original, I still maintain the same position,
only now the copy is the closest thing to the original now remaining.

It seems that you would still exist in your original body.  You are just
experiencing a real-time simulation of what the copy is experiencing. 
When I disconnect the real-time update in preparation to kill the
original, wouldn't the original object that it has lost contact with its
second body and is now existing only in the original body?  Wouldn't the
original have the same desire and curiosity to want to go continue
experiencing life?  It almost seems that the copy argument for extending
lifespan focusses on continuing information and services to other
people.  If they do not perceive a change, the experiment is declared a
success.  It does not focus on information and services still be
provided to the original.  All such information and service is halted. 
The original ceases to function, but none of his external contacts care.

I used to consider different orders of infinities when I was younger.  I
never really got into the Aleph series of infinities.  Most people
thought my ideas were crazy, because infinity was "defined" as the
largest value.  How could some infinities be larger than others.

Here is what I considered.  Imagine for the sake of example that we are
in an infinite, non-closed universe.  Shooting a laserbeam into space
would go out forever and would be considered to have an infinite length
at the end of an infinite time.

Now imagine a beam projection that is one inch wide, one inch tall, and
of infinite length.  The volume of such a beam would be 1" x 1" x
infinity".  It has one infinity of cubic inches within its volume.

Now imagine a beam projection that is two inches wide, one inch tall,
and of infinite length.  The volume of such a beam would be 2" x 1" x
infinity".  It has two infinity of cubic inches within its volume.

It seems obvious to me from a physical standpoint, that the 2 x infinity
inches volume is twice as large as the 1 x infinity inches volume.  It
would take two of the former added together to equal the latter.  If you
superimposed the 1 x infinity inches volume inside the 2 x infinity
inches volume, you would have 1 x infinity inches volume left over.

Here is another thought.  The distance from our viewpoint to the
infinite edge of the universe is 1 x infinity.  The distance in the
opposite direction to the infinite edge of the universe is also 1 x
infinity.  Therefore, the widths of the unbounded universe would be 2 x
infinity.  We also can measure it in three dimensions, so the volume of
the unbounded universe would be (2 x infinity) cubed.

And here is a third thought.  We can conceptualize an infinite length,
but in reality we can only approach it at the speed of light.  Any
infinite length, therefore, might be considered to be a length
approaching infinity at the rate of the speed of light.  Maybe different
infinities can also be measured or contemplated in terms of their rate
of approaching infinity.  The theoretical maximum speed of light would
be the maximum approach toward infinity.  Something going half the speed
of light would be approaching infinity also, but at half the rate.  This
seems to consider time as the forth dimension, and describes a function
chart approaching infinity at a different slope on the graph, or a
different rate.

I have never met anyone who even considered these ideas.  My friends
always immediately rejected the ideas, claiming that all infinities are
infinite, and are all equal "by definition".  It sounds like other
people on this list are considering different orders of infinity.

You mean, like one's dead and the other is alive?  That does seem a bit
different, doesn't it? <g>

I am assuming there is no afterlife, and so there is no experience of being
dead.  Therefore there is no divergence, simply that one of them stops
while the other keeps going.

As long as the copy was in sync up until the moment the original lost
consciousness, that's good enough for me.

Yes, if they are having different experiences.  They are the same up until
the moment they become different.

We're slipping into saying what "you" are here.  Do "you" exist in (only)
your original body, or are "you" defined by a pattern of information
processing, irrespective of its time or place?

You must maintain the link until the original no longer has any conscious
thoughts not shared by the copy.  If you disconnect the link and the
original is still conscious, then he is now different from the copy.

Again, you shouldn't have disconnected the link.  Now if you kill him his
recent memories, experiences, etc. will be lost.

Here is an interesting thought experiment, proposed last year by list
member Lee Corbin, who was really into all these copying paradoxes.

Imagine that you can push a button and erase the last 5 minutes of
your memories.  You will instantly be transformed back into the mental
state that you were in five minutes ago.  Now, you can make a case that
this is effectivelly the same as the situation where you had a copy made
five minutes ago, it has been suspended, and you can push a button to
(instantly, painlessly) kill yourself and revive the copy.  In either
case the last 5 minutes of your life are lost.

How do you feel about this situation?  Would you be willing to push the
button, or would it feel like dying?  Pushing the button will terminate
your current stream of consciousness just like killing yourself.  The
difference is whether the five-minutes-ago state will resume in your
own brain or an identical duplicate.

It's really not that.  It's all analyzed from the p.o.v. of the person who
walks away from the experiment.  If he remembers everything that happened
to all versions of himself, then nothing has been lost.  The changes
were harmless; it's no worse than if he'd had all the atoms of his brain
replaced but the neural function was maintained (which happens anyway
over the course of years).

You are both making category mistakes here. The sort of things that 
are verbs or adjectives or nouns are words and perhaps concepts. But 
human beings are not words or concepts, although there are words that 
denote human beings and at least one concept of human being. To say 
that you are a verb is to imply that you are not alive, because 
neither words nor concepts are living things.

Also, note the interdefinability of nouns, adjectives and nouns, in 
a natural (at least in the eyes of philosophers) extension of 
English:

Dog=that which "dogs"=that which is "doggish".

IMHO, if one is afraid of  being mentally imprisoned by language 
patterns, one is better advised to read Carnap and W. V. Quine than 
to study this e-prime stuff.

I think the distinction he was trying to make is not that of 
"noun/verb" but of "medium/message" or "substrate/pattern", which
is a useful one.  Noun/verb/adjective is an artificial distinction
based on conventions of language (natural languages, that is;
Lojban has no such concept), but "hardware/software" is a real,
fundamental distinction.  Most of the talk here about identity is
just arguing definitions for the natural-language "I", and there
are two axes of argument: one, does it refer to hardware or to
software (to which I think most here will agree upon the latter),
and the second axis, does "I" refer to the particular instantiation
of the pattern (in Lojban "le sevzi") or to the abstraction of the
pattern independent of particular instances ("le ka sevzi").  The
answer to that is again just a matter of language convention, not
the subject of rational debate.

I haven't been ignoring the repeated requests to post a gender 
bibliography, it's just that my response has been severely delayed!  
I am in the process of formatting something that can be uploaded to a 
web page, and I will post the URL when it is completed.

Rather than attempt an exhaustive listing, I have chosen those 
resources of particular interest and usage within a transhumanist 
context.  I agree with the suggestions to include in the topic areas 
aquatic ape theory (pro and con), science fiction, specific 
terminology, and gender-free pronouns.  (Any contributions welcome now 
and in future--TIA.  Also, Marc Verhaegen, your AAT bibliography is 
still coming through completely scrambled!)

That is controversial claim (which I personally happen to be 
somewhat sympathetic towards). It is controversial because to many 
people it seems as if the concept "I" is not arbitrary; even though 
one may be hard put to define necessary and sufficient criteria for 
personal identity, it seems that the notion has important relations 
to values that are not shared by other notions we could form. That 
is to say: if we stipulate that the word "I#1" should mean this 
thing, and "I#2" should mean that, then there still seems to be some 
thinking to be done about whether one would be willing to upload in 
circumstances where identity is concerved in sense #1, but not in 
sense #2, etc.

[Derek Parfit's "Reasons and Persons" (1984) is an important
philosophy book about the problem of personal identity. Max's PhD 
dissertation (on his web page) is also on this topic. I haven't read 
it yet but plan to do so when I get time.]

Good point, in some situations one could imagine.  But not all.  Most 
signals would not even be intended for reception outside a particular 
solar system.  Power limited?  Who knows.  Noise may even be quintillions 
of simultanious transmissions from the same area, or just those that

Good point.  But if we are lucky enough to be in the way of such a 
signal, it's still likely to look like noise.
Spread spectrum is useful for several reasons besides stealth, including 
reducing transmitted power requirements in some situations (PCS phones).  
And the arguments re: data compression also tend to point to an advanced 
transmission looking mostly like noise.  Compression saves power.

Er, I don't buy this.  First: who said "totally indistinguishable from
noise"?  We are far from being able to looking at the radiation from a
single star and exahustively analyzing its signal possibilitys.  We
probably look at 1% of it at best, from a bandwidth standpoint alone.
Also, error correction and/or redundancy could be in a form not 
understandable unless you know the demodulation technique and/or codes.

Time for a good monkey wrench. Suppose the copy is provided with a
"transfer of consciousness" experience which has the effect of "moving"
from the original to the copy? After a few dozen of these where copy 1
serves as the master for copy 2, .... to copy N, I would expect that
said copy would have no problem with being destroyed after the copy
operation. Note the contradiction here. Each copy expects continuation
as the next copy in the series.

BTW, I recall reading Clarke's 2001 and only then did HAL's behaviour
make sense - HAL only saw the destruction of the spacemen, and not their
continuation, ergo by first law of robotics, HAL had to prevent this.
Point was NOT clear in the film...

This thread was just one that I had to share with fellow web developing
colleague and programmer Ryan Marsh.  He is definitely pro-MS and won't
let me upload pages to his server that aren't compatible <g>.  I, on the
otherhand, take the stance that Netscape is the better browser.  A heated
debate that's almost runs along the lines of 'is there a god?',  I try not
to get into it that much.

It's also relevant (and a very good idea) to watch which sources are more
reliable.  My friend Ryan, although well versed in ActiveX, ASP, CGI,
etc... is absolutely NOT as knowledgable on the subject as an expert in
the field such as Harvey.  Consider it the opinions of children vs those
in the know.

With that I leave you...

Subject: RE: Why Microsoft is a Threat to Freedom (fwd)

That's the biggest load of bullshit that I have ever heard. His mind is brainwashed by the Rebel Alliance.  As for MS products checking for piracy, I haven't been able to prove that any current products do what he said but it is possible to include that kind of functionality.  I am glad that MS would do such a thing.  Piracy is illegal is he supporting crime? 

As for serving graphics incorrectly to Navigator, let me say the Netscape Navigator is one of the most unreliable pieces of software that I have ever used.  Not only does Navigator crash often, but it processes Java applets at a snails pace, doesn't support progressive web design (i.e. the use of CSS [now in communicator I believe]or Dynamic Positioning with DHTML), it also lacks support for VBScript (something they said they'd do) to make web scripting more accessible to the programming novice (because it is a much simpler script to learn), and they should have added support for ActiveX (or tried to compete by providing tools and programming resources to developers to write plugins for its browser like MS did for ActiveX). As for MSIE posing as mozilla, I think it was a good idea on Microsoft's part so that IE wouldn't be left out in the cold by some websites. Something Netscape could take lessons on.  As for rejecting a particular browser from a site, that's the first things that I learned how to do when dealing with CGI and ASP.  It isn't hard for anyone to disallow a  particular browser type from his/her site.

Netscape has made a lot of stupid business and technology decisions but regardless of that, find me someone who says that they can design a better looking, more interactive website with Navigator (latest ver) as opposed to MSIE (latest ver) with out using Java or ActiveX or plugins.  

As for Wintel vs. Apple I must say that the Apple computer should have taken over the market.  We all know why it didn't.  The Mac is easier to use (though harder to code for, hopefully this will be resolved by Java) but there are a few problems with the Mac.

Number one, it is pricey, this is because Apple took a greedy stance on licensing its OS and hardware. No competition usually means less innovation and increase in price.  Don't try to tell me that a Mac for the same price as what I spent on my PC can get me Monster 3D like graphics, and AWE 32 gold sound. Macs also aren't as fast, I do not disagree that you can find RISC machines running upwards of 500Mhz but how many Macs do you see that take advantage of this for a slightly reasonable price.  No thanks, I'll stick to my SGI 02 or my Compaq with dual Pent 300Mhz processors. 

Secondly the Apple tried to get it self into the market by selling to schools, therefore, taking it out of the business market (except journalism and some niche markets).  The logic behind selling to schools was that they would get kids used to them and then when they got out of school that's what they'd buy.  They took too big a chance on an investment that would take too long to return on itself.  Meanwhile, all of the serious classes in school like business classes and computer science classes were using PC's.

I don't want to build up the Wintel machine either though. Something very apparent to me is how intuitive and easy to use a Mac is to the novice. Where as with PC's "will somebody tell me exactly what all that hex shit means on a Fatal exception error? Where can I sign up for the class action law suit cuz I BOUGHT A LEMON!!!"

Maybe when NT 5.0 becomes popular in businesses "zero administration" will be a help.  Hopefully it will solve the appearance of games on all those desktops we gave our employees. I think the Mac or Windows "network computer" will solve a lot of these problems for businesses.

And last but not least, MS is a great company, honest. I have worked with their guys on several projects and I enjoy it everytime I do. They are extremely professional, perfectionists, and they have THE BEST coders I have ever run across in my entire life.  Microsoft is aggressive and smart.  Do any of us remember the mistake that Bill made about denouncing the Internet?  Now look at their position on it, people are scared MS will take over.  Also, take a look at how MS used kiss Apple's ass. Apple had the potential to become what MS is today. It's all about make good business decisions.  

Does this make any sense to anyone.

What do you mean "another products data files"? DO you mean that it made
IE the default browser for .html files for that computer? Duh, thats
merely a matter of file format association. It happens with any
application installation, they'll try to hog as many compatible file
formats for themselves and screw existing apps on the system that might
be more useful with those file formats. Microsoft is not alone in this,
its a standard industry practice. Corel did it when I installed Ventura
to .rtf and .doc files, Graphics COnverter Gold did it to ALL graphic
formats (as does HiJaak Graphics Suite).

Here's an idea. Netscape could, GASP, do the same thing, impersonate an
Explorer browser to gain access to a MS webserver.... Gee why didn't I
think of that... I dunno, it must be because I don't work for
microsoft.....

I'd like to see more about this. Any system administrator would find
this a useful tool, and this data must be how many of the network

Someone said:
>> cars are polluting the environment but I wouldn't like
>> to do without the freedom my car is delivering ! 

As I understand it, a majority of the pollution (carbon monoxide,
anyway) comes from a small minority of gross-polluting cars. The
dirtiest 10% of cars emit 50% of the carbon monoxide, while the cleanest
50% of autos emit only 5%. 

And, apparently, maintenance is more important than age when it comes to
emission levels. About two-thirds of cars that fail exhaust tests have
emission-control systems out of conformance with the law, and a majority
of those had been deliberately tampered with. If tampering is widespread
and causes high emissions, then a scheduled emissions inspection every
year is a waste of time and money.

It would be like fighting drunk driving by having annual breathalyzer
tests-it won't be effective. Only random, spot testing will uncover
these polluters.

Technology can be used to target gross polluters. The technology is
cheap and portable, thus capable of random surveillance while
inconveniencing only those guilty. The Sun Company of Philadelphia used
a remote-sensing device to spot pollution from passing vehicles. By
beaming a ray of light across a city road, Sun was able to spot more
than 3,400 vehicles out of 75,000 screened that were spewing fumes in
excess of federal limits. Get those 5% of vehicles fixed and air quality
will be much improved. We could target the guilty without
inconveniencing the innocent.

Random roadside vehicle testing, instead of requiring every motorist to
spend time and money visiting another inspection station, seems like it
might be practical and effective.

I think this is a personal decision.  Road owners (and adjacent property
owners) should, however, be able to target gross polluters and hold them
responsible for trespass, nuisance, etc.

Also, our government should not subsidize the price of gasoline be
defending perceived oil interests in dangerous areas of the world.  If a
company decides to do business with a prince or dictator halfway around
the globe let them pay for the security and transportation safety, and
take the hit if it's nationalized, etc.  Also, the roads should be
privatized.  Then perhaps alternative financing will eliminate the gas
taxes that also distort the price.  The price of natural resources
should reflect their true cost, and scarcity.  Then our decision of
whether to own a car or not might be a more rational judgment, all
things considered.

        Putting aside the pollutive and expense-based qualities of cars, I
consider automobiles to be uploads of a sort.  Consider the steering wheel
and pedals to be extensions of one's own body; with these uploads, humans
can attain speeds far higher than we would without them...and still have
total control.  Progress is currently being made to make these uploads more
economical and inexpensive.  Mass transit...as inexpensive and
environmentally-friendly as it may be, still lacks the individual control
of a car: it runs on a schedule that doesn't encompass individual concerns.
 With a car, one has far more personal convenience while still retaining an
asset that can be bought, sold, or improved.

No, to say I'm a verb is a metaphor based on the important role verbs play
in syntax.  It's inaccurate to think of parts of speech as "being"
concepts; nouns and words of description "point" to sections, categories,
of our world-knowledge.  Verbs, however, are _not_ "names of actions."
How is "to be," "represent," "accept" an action?  A verb is best defined
as a unit which does verby things... show agreement with subjects, govern
objects, hold sentences together.  Verbs are, perhaps, the best indicator
of the _autonomy_ of language from the rest of thought; verbs are purely
structural.

Agreed; e-prime and general semantics are wastes of time which perpetuate 
the ludicrous (in its strong form) Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. If you're
interested in language, try linguistics.  Steven Pinker's _The Language
Instinct_ is a good start; it pretty much sums up everything I learned in
undergrade linguistics in a highly readable form.  Pinker, a
psycholinguist who is the world's leading child language acquisition
researcher, is also one of the loud proponents of evolutionary psychology.
He makes a number of points that readers of this list should find
interesting.

Adjectives are not universal, but nouns and verbs are not an artifical
distinction or categorization made by people with nothing better to do;
they refer to real units of organization in _all_ human languages.  It's
not just convenience that allows linguists to say a string of phonemes in
a given language is a noun or verb; verbs and nouns relate to each other
and to other parts of utterances in specific ways.

Speech is special; language is not a cultural creation or a product of
"general intelligence."  Language is a detailed system of pointers to
ideas, categories, concepts and memories shared by members of a speech
community which seems to have evolved for the purpose of social
integration and group interaction.  Language has a large number of subtle
structural details which are universal across all natural languages; these
include nouns and verbs; Case (how verbs relate to nouns, as opposed to
case with a small "c" which is a surface labeling of such relationships);
anaphor and deixis (difficult to explain... I guess they could be summed
up as how reflexives and pronouns relate to antecedants and "empty" units
like "this," "that" whose referrant changes from situation to situation)
and many more.  
The surface diversity of languages is illusory; as Chomsky has said,
Marian linguists would surely consider all humans to speak a common
language, albeit one with several mutually incomprehensible lexicons.

The problems associated with language and clarity of thinking are not,
IMHO, the product of language per se but rather demonstrate the
limitations of the human mind.  We didn't evolve to be logic machines
which explore and come to understand the universe for what it is; our
cognition developed to help us get killed less easily and to kill other
animals more easily.  In other words, our mental abilities are perfect for
hunting, gathering and foraging on the savannah but the fact that we can
theorize about the structure of nuclei and galaxies is accidental and it
should be no surprise that we have difficulty not jumping to conclusions,
neglecting to consider alternative hypotheses, etc.  

> based on conventions of language (natural languages, that is;
> Lojban has no such concept),

What are the qualifications of the creators of Lojban?  Computer
scientists, logicians?  If they they think that a human mind can process
"language" without nouns, etc., they are profoundly mistaken.  Natural
language does not refer to languages which are not concsiously created;
natural language means a language which conforms to Universal Grammar;
this includes created languages such as Esperanto, Ido, Volapuek and
Interlingua.  Nat.lang. is a category opposed to logical languages such as
predicate calculus or to computer languages.  Nouns, verbs, deixis,
anaphor and other such principles are the algorithms and heuristics by
which we make language.  Never confuse language with thinking.

I'm not sure I understand you.  Do you mean, is language a fundamental
part of human cognition? or a conventionalized way of thinking which can
be replaced?  Or do you mean, is language identical to thought versus a
creation of thoughts?  I'd say the neurological evidence (aphasia
studies, the way we process speech sounds vs. other sounds, etc.)
supports the hypothesis that language production and perception have
their origin in specific brain structures.

Again, I'm not sure I follow.  Do you mean is language "I" identical to
the mutually comprehensible utterances of a group of speakers or is "I"
the patterns displayed in such utterances?  Or...?

Oops, I see.  You mean personal identity; I thought we were still

I guess this is where our opinions diverge.  I don't want to consider the
point of view of the person who walks away from the experiment.  I want to
consider the point of view of the person who walks into the experiment.
That's the only "me" that exists right now.  That's the "me" that I want to
preserve.  I think that we are each contemplating different questions and
may not be disagreeing on the exact same points.

Question One, which I think is my concern:
- Is the original body still "me"?
- Does it stop being "me" for any reason?
- What is the criteria for it to stop being "me"?
- How does the copying operation meet these criteria?

Question Two, which I think is your concern:
- Is the new body "me"?
- Does it start being "me" for any reason?
- What is the criteria for it to start being "me"?
- How does the copying operation meet these criteria?

I am more concerned with the answer to the first question.  If the original
person is still "me", then I don't want "me" killed.  I see no mechanism
for its point-of-view of being "me" to be transferred to the new body.
Piping the new body's perception back to the original to make me
"experience" moving to the new body is backwards.  It takes independent
experience from the new body and then later plays it back in the original.
This implies that the new body is having experience independent from the
original, that the new body's experiences are not enjoyed by the original,
and that the original's experience must be suppressed and overridden.
Implanting my memories to the new body makes it "remember" being "me", but
it never really experienced the things that it "remembers."  We just as
well could program it to remember UFO abductions and Satanic Ritual Abuse
that never occurred.  If I could perceive my point-of-view through the new
body, and have that point-of-view continue after the two are disconnected,
then I would feel transferred.  If after the disconnection occurs, I
suddenly find myself still in my original body, I would think the transfer
had not occurred.  Until the original body stops perceiving itself as "me"
from its point-of-view, I would still consider it to be "me".  Killing it
to stop this perception is not an acceptable answer, because this death is
the exact thing that I am trying to avoid with the copy.

Has anyone heard anything about a piece of Mir landing near Vancouver, BC,
Canada?  Last night,(around 9pm PST) I say the most amazing light show
which involved two bright streams of material flying very low overhead.
One very bright orange piece appeared to hit ground, as it was followed
by low, thundering noises.  The rumour here is that it was a spent Russian
fuel cell.  Could something like this actually hit the earth?  If so, why
are they dropping these things on my head? ;)


Thanx,

Geoff.

I have reviewed the Lojban pages and stick to this statement.  Just
because you don't call a word a noun or verb doesn't mean that it really
is something other than a noun or a verb.  That phonetic string X is a
verb and Y is a noun is not just a categorization but a description of
structure.  It's interesting how flexibly Lojban handles transfering
meaning, but it still has verbs, nouns, and other parts of speech, just as
do other natural languages.

I have doubts about the whole project, though; just a cursory glance over
the description revealed a passle of mistakes no one with knowledge of
linguistics would make; for example, calling Lojban in its current state a
pidgin.  Just because it lacks a lot of vocabulary doesn't make it a
pidgin; no pidgin has the structural detail its creators have devoted.

The World Business Exchange (WBE) alternative
currency system is being developed and launched.

* Designed to become the perfect answer to the
Federal Reserve and national bank monopolies.

"Thanks very much for your submission to the Global Ideas Bank which seems
unusually well thought out. It will be considered for the Global Ideas Bank
editorially in due course and for the annual awards (deadline June 1st)."

ISI/Global Ideas Bank is at <http://www.newciv.org/GIB/>.

* Original proposal at: <http://buildfreedom.com/eco15.htm>.

* Places the money-issuing power in the hands
of the individual.

"The pinnacle of power today is the power to
issue money." -- Thomas H. Greco Jr., author
of 'New Money for Healthy Communities' --
see <http://www.gaia.org/ic/market/money/>.

* Inflation-proof private currency that cannot
be controlled by governments or international
banking cartels.

* Has the potential to help create a worldwide
real free-enterprise economic system.

* Has the potential to bring about an enormous
decentralization of economic power into the
hands of individuals.

* Local and global Buy/Sell Directories.

* Escrow transactions to reduce fraud and scams.

* Encrypted transactions for privacy and security.

* Encrypted communication module for members.

* Low transaction fees (probably 1/2%) -- compare
to 10% - 15% by many barter clubs.

* The new currency will be convertible into gold,
silver, platinum, and major national currencies.

* Of great potential benefit to:
(1) Anyone who has goods and/or services to trade;
(2) Anyone doing business via Internet;
(3) Any business wishing to expand its markets;
(4) International traders;
(5) Anyone involved with barter or countertrade;
(6) Businesses and individuals with "expiring
commodities" -- hotels, radio stations, airlines,
restaurants, professionals, etc. -- e.g., if the
hotel room isn't rented the revenue is lost and
can never be recovered;
(7) Freedom-lovers interested in economic freedom
and private alternative currencies;
(8) Promoters interested in earning commissions.

* A special mailing list has been set up for those
interested in learning more about the WBE system,
and those interested in helping to develop and
promote it.  You are invited to subscribe by sending
a message to wbe-request@maillist.dundee.net with
the word "subscribe" in the body of your message.

Hydrogen economy which generates the hydrogen by directly or indirectly burning
fossil fuels, either to generate electricity or to farm land for fuel crops, is a
huge net inefficiency. You're just moving the pollution and fossil fuel use
around, not reducing it. Solar and fusion are possibilities, but either one is
very capital-intensive and unlikely to pay for itself in a reasonable time. Guess
what that leaves? It leaves hypotech (my portmanteau word for hypothetical
technology} that reforms fossil fuels at the point of use, then feeds _that_ to a
fuel cell. Some people claim to have it. We'll see. "Pure" H2 technology as a
significant base for the economy just isn't in the cards--unless you palm a few.

Obviously I agree that people are not words, but I strongly disagree with 
your other statement. A concept is a mental state and I don't have mental 
states, I am a mental state, or a collection of them. To distinguish one 
state from another adjectives and adverbs (information) are what's important, 
objects (matter) are generic and interchangeable, lots of things can make me 
happy or be red or small or round or move swiftly or be intelligent or 
whatever.  Lots of things can be me too, it's just that right now only one 
thing behaves in my way. That need not always be true.

Or it implies that our ideas about the fundamental properties that 
distinguish life from non life need to be changed. Concepts (not things) 
like intelligence and consciousness are more important than digestion, 
at least that's my concept.

True, and it's almost enough to give circular reasoning a bad name. Actually  
I think all it proves is that definitions are not all that important and  
except when doing mathematics or formal logic we seldom use them or need to.

I'm aware that hemp has uses. :)

And I think as an economic crop, hemp qua crop makes sense. Trying to get it
accepted is another matter, a propaganda matter.

However, regarding hemp qua fuel: inasmuch as hemp still has to be cultivated,
there's an energy cost associated with that. Assuming hemp is as efficient as
soybeans at generating oil (that seems like a conservative estimate), and
assuming similar cultivation/processing costs (not sure this is true), a first
approximation of the energy credit (or debt) ought to be easily calculable. I
don't have the numbers at present. But we don't see a lot of soybean-powered
cars, do we? Now if hemp were incredibly better as a fuel, or incredibly cheaper
to cultivate, this use might still pan out. I'm curious to know if the book you
mention goes into this, or just handwaves about it.

I'll try to look up that book. Have you got an ISDN number handy? Thanks.

hi

hmmm, I found an ISBN number for the book, perhaps that what you were talking
about: 

ISBN: 1878125028  for the 1998 version not yet released (due out Jan 1), (he
updates it like every 2 years) 1996 version is sold out and out of print

amazon books sells v1998 discounted for $19.95 (list price $24.95)
www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/home/home.html/3901-4729388-849311

Im pretty sure the book has all the specifics and up-to-date scientific
reports etc...

I don't have the numbers either, but I know that from all 
appearances, hemp is pretty easy and cheap to grow if you don't have 
to hide it from the police.

But fundamentally, hemp -- or soybean -- oil as a substitute for 
gasoline, isn't going to happen for a while because they are 
solutions to a non-problem.  Solutions that have to compete against 
an existing infrastructure which has no apparent need to accommodate 
them, and without the ability to provide any apparent advantages.

Now, it is a given that eventually we will run out of fossil fuels.  
When the supply actually runs low enough to drive the cost of 
fossil-fuel-derived gasoline high enough, something will be done.  
Today, though, we are not at that point and we have no reason to 
believe we're anywhere particularly close to it.

And unless someone in the meantime finds it worthwhile to put a major 
effort into tuning external-combustion engines (what we should have 
done in the first place), the "something" that will most likely be 
done is finding a way to make gasoline from some other raw material.  
Perhaps hemp oil or soybean oil.

"Mental state" is a bit ambigous. I think the traditional line
of thinking goes like this: The thought "Mary loves John." involves 
the same concepts as "John loves Mary.", namely the concepts "John", 
"loves" and "Mary". Nevertheless the two thoughts are quite distinct. 
So let's assume I agree that you are a mental state or a collection 
of them. You would then be constituted by a thought or a collection 
of thoughts. This means, if you hade very different thoughts, you 
would be a different person. Hence you are not defined by the 
concepts you entertain, since there are many very different ways in 
which these concepts could be put together into thoughts; and 
different thoughts would constitute a different person. So rather 
than saying that you are a collection of concepts, you have to say 
that you are a collection of conceps cum a structure defined on that 
collection. And I don't think it makes literal sense to say that this 
collection cum structure is an adjective -- it would be more correct 
to say that it was a proposition.

At this point I may also ask you if you don't think that feelings and 
values and desires enters in what constitutes being you?

Moreover, in order to be a human being, it is not enough to be a 
person. One also has to belong to the human species, and whether one 
does so presumably depends on one's ancestry and one's biological 
constitution, not just on one's thoughts or concepts.

Yes, on some deeper level I think I agree with you there.

Infinite numbers do not obey the same laws of arithmetic that finite numbers  
do, however, you do count them, that is determine how big they are, in 
exactly the same way, by putting them in a one relationship with something 
else.  I know that if I can put each of the fingers on my right hand in a one
to one correspondence with some apples and have no apples or fingers left 
over, then there must be 5 apples. In the same way I can put the odd integers 
in a one to relationship with all the integers, both the odd AND the even, 
so there must be an equal number of both.

        1 -1        
        3- 2        
        5- 3        
        7- 4        
        9- 5    
         .
         .         
         
Or you can prove that all lines are composed of the same number of points   
regardless of length. Draw 2 parallel lines, a short one and a long one below 
it, pick a point midway along the short line but above it.
                           

                           /\
                         /    \
                       /________\
                     /            \
                   /________________\ 
                             

Draw a line from that point to any place on the short line, then continue it  
until you hit the long line. You've made a one to one correspondence between 
all the points in the short line and all the points in the long line, so they 
must have an equal number of points.
 
But not all infinities are equal. Let's try to put the integers in a one to  
one correspondence with all the points in the line from 0 to 1 expressed as a  
decimal.

        1 - 0.a1,a2,a3,a4,a5 ...        
        2 - 0.b1,b2,b3,b4,b5 ...
        3 - 0.c1,c2,c3,c4,c5 ...        
        4 - 0.d1,d2,d3,d4.d5 ... 
        .
        .      
        
The trouble is it doesn't work, there are decimals not included, for example,  
the point 0.A1,B2,C3,D4,E5 ... where A1 is any digit except a1, B2 is any 
digit except b2, C3 is any digit except c3 etc. This point differs in at 
least one decimal place with any point in our one to one scheme, we've used 
all the integers but there are still points remaining, so there must be more  
points on a line than integers.

There are an infinite number of points between 0 and 1. There are an infinite
number of points between 1 and 2. What about all the points between 0 and 2?
There is an infinite number, yes, but it is composed of the points from 0 to 1
and 1 to 2. Does this mean that the number of points between 0 and 2 is double
that of both?

No, it's just infinite. Does it really make sense to say that all infinities are
not equal? I mean, infinity is used in mathematics thanks to a symbol that
supposedly quantizes it, or at least allows us to represent the mathematical
concept of infinity. But is infinity ever a quantity? We can't really ever grasp
infinity anymore than we can grasp the size of [(10^100)^100]^100. The difference
is that such big numbers (positive) have a meaningful upper limit that we can use
to define its value. Infinity does not. So any number that does not have a
meaningful upper limit (or lower limit, if negative) is equal to every other
number that has no such limit. Infinity is infinity no matter in what context it
occurs.

If infinities are not equal (this infinity is greater than that infinity) then
that means that some infinities are even larger, and then some infinities are
even larger than that, ad infinitum. So then the ultimate infinity is the
infinity that is larger than all the rest -- the inifinitely infinite infinity.
But then what about an infinity even greater than that....

Blah, blah, blah....

There doesn't seem to be a worthwhile way to deal with this unless every infinity
is just plain old infinity, unbounded, and -- to try to keep it within our
semantic framework -- equal.

I disagree....  we must deal with this problem, if we are to perform any
calculations which include the concept of infinity.

Suppose there are the same number of decimals in [0, 1] and [0, 2].  We
should be able to subtract the number of decimals in [0, 1] from the number
of decimals in [0, 2].  If all infinities are equal, then these represent
the same number, and the answer should be zero.  However, they are not the
same number, and instead the result is ANOTHER infinite number, the number
of decimals in (1, 2].  This alone disproves the result that all infinities
are equal.

However, an objector might make a special case for infinity, suggesting
that no addition or subtraction from infinity changes its value...  it is
always infinity.  However, sometimes we CAN subtract infinite numbers from
one another and get zero, such as when we subtract the number of decimals
in [0, 2] from the number of decimals in [1, 3].

Since the number of decimals in [0, 1] when subtracted from the number in
[0, 2] gives me an infinite number, and since the number of decimals in [1,
3] when so subtracted gives me 0, and since infinity is much larger than 0,
we are forced to admit that the number of decimals in [0, 2] and [1, 3] are
both greater than the number of decimals in [0, 1].

Thus, we need some way of finding out when infinities are larger as well as
how much larger they get.

9. GENETICS OF AGING
There may be controversy over the importance of genetics versus
environment in the human aging process, but there is no
controversy about the dominant rule of genetics as the
determinant in aging differences between species. Man lives 72
years, the cat lives 15 years, the mouse lives 27 months, the
fruit fly lives 40 days, and the nematode worm lives 15 days --
the differences attributable to the differences in genomes.
Nevertheless, beyond the attribution to genetics, there is almost
nothing known about the particular genes involved, and even less
about any proteins expressed by these genes. Within the human
species, there are also many primary mysteries of the aging
process waiting to be solved. Why, for example, in Alzheimer's
disease, a neurodegenerative disease with a heavy genetic
component, is it common to have the onset of Alzheimer's disease
in identical twins differ by many years? The present consensus
among researchers is that within a species 35% of the variance in
the aging process is determined by genetic factors and 65% by
environmental factors. Caleb E. Finch and Rudolph E. Tanzi
(University of Southern California, US; Massachusetts General
Hospital, Boston US), in a review of current research in the
genetics of the aging process, suggest the role of genetics in
determining life-span is complex and paradoxical, and that life-
style and other environmental influences may profoundly modify
the effects of genetic factors. This is clearly a field searching
for its watershed. QY: C. E. Finch, Univ. Southern Calif., Biol.
Sci. (213) 740-2777 (Science 17 Oct 1997)

10. LIFE HISTORY OF NEURONS IN THE HUMAN BRAIN
There are a number of critical questions concerning the aging of
the human brain, among them: 1) How is the normal aging of nerve
cells different from the normal aging of other cells? 2) How are
the changes seen in normally aging nerve cells different from the
changes seen in nerve cells affected by neurodegenerative
disease? 3) How is the normal aging of nerve cells affected by
systemic factors such as hormone levels? These are 3 important
areas of research in the biology of the aging process, and it is
apparent that important data will be appearing in the next
decade. There is preliminary evidence, for example, that estrogen
plays a protective role against aging changes in nerve cells.
John H. Morrison and Patrick R. Hof (Mt. Sinai School of
Medicine, NY US) review the differences between pathogenic neuron
loss in the human brain and neuron loss due to the normal aging
process, and the authors suggest that primary neurobiological
substrates for functional impairment in aging differ in important
ways from those in neurodegenerative disorders such as
Alzheimer's disease. They emphasize that it is an error to
consider the normal aging of the brain and Alzheimer's disease as
part of the same continuum of senescence. QY: J. H. Morrison
<morrison@cortex.neuro.mssm.edu> (Science 17 Oct 1997)

11. THE ENDOCRINOLOGY OF AGING
Hormones are signaling molecules secreted into the blood stream
by endocrine cells and acting on target cells that possess
receptors for the hormone. They have long been a subject of
research, testosterone having first been discovered in 1848. At
present, there are dozens of different vertebrate hormones that
have been identified, ranging from relatively low molecular
weight hormones such as steroids to peptide hormones such as
prolactin with nearly 200 amino acids in the peptide chain. One
essential fact concerning the signaling with which hormones are
involved is that hormones do not act in isolation. Nerve cells
can trigger the release of hormones and local chemical mediators,
hormones can influence nerve cells and trigger the release of
local chemical mediators and other hormones, and local chemical
mediators can modify the response of target tissues to the
actions of hormones. All of which partly explains the complexity
of endocrinology as a research area. Steven W. J. Lamberts et al
(3 authors at Erasmus University, NL), in a review of the
endocrinology of aging, point out that physiological changes have
usually been the focus when considering the aging process, but
there is evidence these changes are due to important reductions
in certain blood hormones that occur during aging in both men and
women. Replacement therapy, however, has not yet proven to be
both safe and beneficial. QY: S. W. J.  Lamberts

Part of it is the rigor of set theory, and math in general.  Ergo,
transfinite arithmetic
is useful in this sense.  It also has some applications, in the sense that
we can
know the limits of the organon/tool/ideas.

Books to consult on this include:
Georg Cantor's _Contributions to the Founding of the Theory of Transfinite
 Numbers_ (OK, but his symbol set is a bit archaic/provincial)
Morris Kline's _Mathematics: The Loss of Certainty_ (just about anything by
 Kline is good:)
Rudy Rucker's _Infinity and the Mind_ (great lay intro plus some more technical
 matters in appendices; he outlines issues well)

Sender: postmaster@extropy.com

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

Since I am new to this list, I feel it might be better to start a thread, then
pickup with the current discussions.  I know many would be trans-
humanists are interested in uplifting -- i.e., making a nonsentient species
sentient.  I am too.  (I know there must be stuff/web pages out there on
this already, so forgive any redundancies.  And point them out to me!:)

Often when I tell people about this -- and not just anyone, but people I
think might share an interest in it or at least be able to talk about it in a
sensible way -- they see it as either pointless or insane.  Pointless,
because we already have humans.  No need to reinvent the mind...:)
Insane, because they think it might akin to putting a human in a non-
human body.  Imagine putting your mind in the body of a weasel.  Sure,
it might be nice for a romp in the park, has potential if you want to 
solve your rodent problem in an exciting way, but the limitations!

My arguments for uplifting -- and believe me, my interest is pedestrian:
I'm not losing sleep over this, come what may:) -- are threefold.  I see it
as a way to experiment on minds in general.  The pay off here is that
if we can uplift, say, a dog, then hopefully, the technology/technique
will carry over into intelligence enhancement in humans.

Next, uplifted dogs, to stick with my example, would also be good for
lots of things that might be done by humans but that a dog's abilities
are better at (e.g., guarding property), but which current robots are
not yet up to.

Third, the gains for the culture/memescape might be great.  We get
the bonus of an added perspective.  This is almost like using genetic
algorithmns to design bridges as opposed to human engineering. The
dog perspective on the world will help up to expand the limits of ours.

Those are my quickie reasons for uplifting.  I look forward to your
input/feedback.

I'm working on the new Extropy Institute members' newsletter Exponent. This
quarter's issue is a few weeks late, so I want to get it finished and in
the mail in the next few days. If you have had any work published, given
public lectures, received awards, or appeared in major media discussing
extropian ideas -- and you are an ExI member -- please let me know about it
asap for inclusion in this issue.

Thanks,

Max

By the time oil runs out - assuming conversion of coal, or methane

we'll be able to genetically engineer a crop that has a built-in fuel

After my book on the Singularity, THE SPIKE, was released in Australia
several months ago, a number of people on these lists mentioned that it
would be intriguing to see the public response to such ideas.  So far it's
had surprisingly few newspaper or magazine reviews, despite many terrific
radio interviews.  Two of them (one by a former chairman of the Commission
for the Future, a quango think-tank)  were venomous and patronising; my
published replies were somewhat sarcastic.  Now a more favorable response
has appeared in the Age newspaper, one of the three major metropolitan
papers in Australia, written by a former politician with a strong research
interest in the Basque anarchists.  His review can be found at

hotlinked from the bibiography page on my writing that Ozlit maintains.

No, I am not supporting crime.  In fact, I was speaking out against
programs that copy data from my computer without permission and transmits
it over the network.  I also was speaking out against programs that
misrepresent themselves as a different program to try to gain unauthorized
access to other computers over the network.  You mistakenly assume that if
I don't trust Microsoft to do anything it wants on my computer without my
knowledge or permission, that I must have something to hide from them.

I never mentioned Netscape Navigator.  You mistakenly assume that if I have
a single negative point about Microsoft Internet Explorer, that I must be
anti-Microsoft and pro-Netscape in the browser arena.

>As for Wintel vs. Apple[....]

I merely objected to your claim that Macintoshes are *twice* as costly as
the equivalent PC.  You mistakenly assumed that I was therefore anti-PC and
pro-Mac.  I tried to clear this up by pointing out that I have more PC's
and Unixes in my home lab than Macs, and that I provide major consulting
for IBM.

You are the one caught up in the propoganda.  Your entire post has been
responding to points I never made.  You are having a war with an imaginary
opponent.  I am not engaged in this argument, nor do I intend to be.

How did you get this?  It seems obvious that because we admitted that 
the longer line *was* longer, after you have used all of the 
(infinity of) points on the shorter line, there will be points on the 
longer line in between the lines you drew across.

But doesn't this apply to the odd number example above?  If we use 
what appears to be this same logic, since we have used all of the 
integers, by pairing them up with only half of the *same* integers, 
it follows that the infinity of the integers is equal to half of 
itself.  Therefore the whole argument must be wrong.

I understand that you maintain this claim after briefly examining
Lojban, so perhaps my original claim was not clear enough.  In Lojban,
there are no content-words that are /inherently/ nouns or verbs.  There
are certainly /roles/ analagous to verb and noun: the predicate,
which expresses some relationship among one or more things, and
arguments to the predicate, which are the things which stand in that
relationship.  Those arguments can be thought of playing the noun
role, and the predicate the verb role, but there are some distinctions
that are not merely cosmetic: first, any content-word in Lojban can
serve either role (and other roles), and there is are prototypical
noun-verb as actor-action assumptions built in to the grammar of the
language as there are with all natural languages. 

If I point to a dog in English and wish to express to you that this
particular existent stands in the relationship "dog" (to itself,
there being no other arguments to this particular predication), I
have to squeeze that predicate into actor-action form by making a
"verb" called "be", and having the thing take that pseudo-action
upon the "recipient" of the action, "dog": "This is a dog".  In
Lojban, the predicate-word "dog" asserts that its argument stands
in that relationship, period.  "ti gerku".  Whether one wishes to
interpret that as "this is-a-dog", or "this is dogging", or "this
is doggish", is a matter of taste; if you wish to actually assert
action, identification, or property, you must explicity use
predicate words for action, identification, or property; the
language itself makes no such assumptions.  Similarly for the
content-word for "blue"; it makes no specific assumption whether
the thing you say holds that predicate is actively bluing, or
has the property of blueness (unless you choose to specify /that/
predicate as well).

Words for predicates like "go", "blue", "chair", "longer", etc.,
are all identical in form as far as the language is concerned;
of course some uses of them are semantically incomprehensible,
but structurally they are all interchangeable:

  le blanu ca klama
     "The blue thing goes"
  le klama ca blanu
     "The goer is blue"
  le clanymau pu klama le stizu
     "The longer-thing went to the chair"
  le stizu cu clanymau le klama be le blanu 
     "The chair is longer than the [goer to the blue destination]
  mi klama le zarci sei stizu
     "I go to the store in a chair-like way"
  ti ckaji le ka blanu
     "This thing inherently has the property of blueness"
  ti zukte le gerku
     "This is a volitional being actively dogging (i.e. being a dog)"

The English glosses here are just convenient translations, not
necessarily exact equivalents (in fact, the exact equivalents of
each would take a page or two oto specify all the language's
defaults and quantifications and such).  Certainly the concepts of
actor/action are meaningful concepts; no one argues that.  But
those concepts are simply not central to Lojban in the way they
are to natural languages.  I likewise stand by my claim: Lojban
does not have nouns and verbs /in the way that natural languages
have them/.

JCB and the other Loglanists are mostly linguists, and mostly
pre-Chomsky (which is a plus in my book).  "Universal Grammar" is
the result of some very interesting empirical studies of human
language /as it is/ (the only way it can be empirical), but I do
not for a moment concede that it has anything to say about what /can
be/.  The entire history of human language is a mere pittance of
a few millennia, and the serious study of linguistics a tiny
fraction of that.  To draw any conclusions from such scant evidence
is the height of irresponsible scientific hubris. 

Though the primary motivation of Loglan was to test Sapir-Whorf
effects (for which it still may find some use, despite the
weakness of current forms of the hypothesis), there are many other
practical uses and scientific uses for which it can serve well.
My own advocacy of the language is based on my own study and use;
I claim no credentials in the field, nor do I care what credentials
anyone else may have.  I am not one who takes a such things as
degrees or books sales seriously; I judge the final product, and
for my money, the Lojban group has done about 10 times the valuable
work in linguistics than any modern Chomsky-worshipper I know.

Before embarking on this project, it might be wise to consider what 
species are the most likely candidates for sentience -- including the 
possibility that some already ARE sentient.

That I am aware of, the most likely candidates are:

Terrestrial:

Primates: the mountain chimpanzee, other chimpanzees, gorillas, other 
great apes (in approximate order of likelihood)

Elephants: the Indian species is the most likely, the two African 
species less likely

Aquatic:

Delphinae: all species I'm aware of, with the orca and the 
bottlenose being the most likely

Cetacea: most or all species, with the sperm whale being perhaps the 
most likely

Cephalopoda: the Pacific giant octopus is a quite likely possibility. 
 Other varieties of octopus may be candidates.  The giant squid is 
technically a possibility but presents certain practical challenges 
(e.g. that it's a deep sea creature, we have never encountered a 
healthy one except perhaps in brief meetings, and we know they are 
*extremely* large).

Avian: with our current understanding of how brains work, it seems 
unlikely that a flying creature on this planet could bear the weight 
of a brain capable of sentience.  The flightless avians also do not 
look at all promising.

I absolutely agree with most of what you say. In particular, I agree I
could be wrong. I would search my mind for the last time I've seen a
post where you admitted the same regarding yourself, but I seem to have
promised unilateral non-aggression. Bother.

I stand by my belief that hydrocarbon reformation at point of use
(including *inside* the fuel cell) is the only practical "hydrogen" use
for the foreseeable future* for most personal-use vehicles. See below:
such use does not contradict the notion that cars may have fuel cells in
them. *(Of course governments impose all sorts of impractical things on
people; and the foreseeable future is only about five years).

Re: pollution: Yes, and sort of, and no. Depends on what you mean by
pollution. Less airborne nitrox compounds, sure. But the carbon and
trace elements in the fuel have to go somewhere. And catalyst bed
contamination remains a serious problem. Further, as I mentioned before,
many "hydrogen economy" plans just move the pollution around, while
_increasing_ the sum. Examples: farmed-methanol, central-site
electrolysis with hydride storage, etc.

Now, hypothetical complex-organic fuel cell catalysts (verging on
enzymes in complexity) *might* solve these  problems. I devoutly wish
for them. But evidence of their actual commercial-quantity appearance
remains sketchy at the present time--even though I built a
bacteria-powered fuel cell twenty years ago. IMHO, bulk nano is the most
likely way to produce such--by which time _everything else changes too_.

AFAIK, all published fuel cell chemistries that use hydrocarbons
function in exactly the way I describe, by reforming the fuel at point
of use: the fuel cell. Methanol is expensive for reasons mentioned
previously. The issue isn't purely one of how efficent the _fuel cell_
is; it's a _systems_ concern.
And I am extremely interested in the carbon-fiber/carbon-tubule H2
storage systems. Nonetheless, I still think gas stations will pump gas
(or something very like it) for a while. The energy desnity (per gram
_or_ per cc) of 87-octane regular gasoline is hard to beat.

It is perfectly possible that that fuel will run a fuel cell. I never
said otherwise.

As for the international impact of any (even a *tiny*) shift in energy
use by the USA, G7, Pac Tigers, etc... well, that's a straw man if I
ever heard one. Clearly people are prepared to fight over this stuff.
People are prepared to fight over lots of things.

I absolutely agree; _and_ they have a huge capital cost and Weltpolitik
impact as long as the primary catalyst is platinum. {Platimum trades at
around $380 an ounce. The US is not a big world supplier. Connect the
dots.)

Of *course* the infinity of integers is equal to half itself.   What *else*
could possibly be the case?

There's a century of mathematics dealing with this topic.  I'm entranced to
find people starting again from scratch.  Next we could have a heated
debate about whether parallel lines meet.  :)

Infinity may not have a limit but it does have a precise meaning. Remove one 
element from set A and make a new set B, if you can find a one to one 
correspondence between A and B then set A has an infinite number of elements. 
In no place does this say that all numbers that poses this property must be  
equal, and in fact we know that they are not.                         


        >Does it really make sense to say that all infinities are not equal? 


Yes because it also has a precise definition, if 2 infinities can be put in 
a one to one correspondence with each other then they are equal, if they can 
not then one is larger than the other.  It's really not a matter of dispute,  
some infinities can be put in such a correspondence and some can not.

Things would certainly be simpler, and more boring, if we could do that, but  
we can't because it's not true.

If A is an infinite number then A -A = A not zero, A+A = A too, and A*A =A,  
but 2^A is not equal to A, it's a higher infinity.

Yes, any fool can see that the longer line must have more points in it than  
the shorter line, but if you can find a one to one correspondence between all 
the points in the short line and all the points in the long line, and in my 
last post I showed how to do it, then the fool must be wrong. The reason 
trans-finite mathematics is so important is that it teaches us that something
can be blindingly obvious and also completely untrue.

No. I showed how to match up every integer with an odd integer, you can't  
show me any integer that doesn't have a odd mate, so the number of all 
integers and the number of odd integers must be the same. In my other example 
even after using all the integers I could still find a point on the line that 
did not have an integer mate, so there must be more points than integers.

True, if A is the number of integers then A/2 = A

Doesn't the central-site plan's polution impact depend on how you get the
electricity to power the electrolysis?  Wouldn't certain solar (or even
nuclear fission) options net a lower total sum of polution?  Or are you
talking about the extra metals and chemicals that are needed to manufacture
photovoltaics and storage devices?  If so, is this a study or just a guess?
I am under the impression that hydrogen gas could be distributed on the same
kinds of pipelines in use for natural gas today.  I  also have read that
hydrogen has an energy density 3 times that of gasolene, by mass (not by
normal volume, of course).  Good enough that a strong liquid hydrogen tank
could give you gasolene-like range (even given internal combustion
efficiency) while venting less than 10% of its hydrogen storage per day to
keep the contents cool.

What is the differences/advantages between engineered bacteria and "bulk
nano?"  Also, could you tell us more about the bacteria-powered fuel cell?

If we are going to have fossil-fuels at the point-of-use, then we might as
well use internal combustion and pre-heated catalytic converters, like Honda
is going to put on some 1999 models.  These are actually better than
zero-emission because in most urban areas the air that goes in will be
"dirtier" than the air going out, even at start up... government definitions
of "zero emmisions" be damned.  Another doable option is to have small gas
turbines running at a constant efficient speed and fuel/air ratio.  This
on-board turbine would charge batteries for a practical electric car.

> People are prepared to fight over lots of things.

Yeah, I am prepared to fight, connive, tinker so I can keep driving a fast
car with good range.  I'm afraid of what alarmists/environmentalists are
doing in the name of dirty air that just isn't that bad.  The air has been a
thorny problem for libertarians like me.  I have to admit my '83 Rx-7  is
probably one of the dirty 10%.  But it really isn't a big deal.  Since we
live in a community that puts politics above property rights it is tough to
see who's air is who's, so I think people should live and let live on this
issue unless things are just absolutly intollerable.  The question will soon
be moot anyway; you can fart and roll down your window and do more damage
than the new car you are driving.

A very strange position, since uplifting very likely would involve
overcoming the physical limitations too (e.g. Brin's ideas for bionic
manipulators for dolphins) and the fact that the uplifted creature
would likely regard its body as perfectly natural.

Of course, an uplifted species would have rights too, so your
intelligent guard dogs would want pay and maybe form unions
(packs?). I think unintelligent animals might do plenty of jobs better
in many ways than intelligent animals; you other two arguments are
IMHO more compelling reasons for uplifting than getting certain forms
of labor.

I think this is a very good point. 

Then there is the technical aspect of uplifting: how do we do it? I
have been thinking about the cruicial role of language in
bootstrapping intelligence; maybe the addition of a more advanced
language system to an uplift species would be a good start?

Fission isn't exactly popular these days, at least in the US. Yes, I am counting
infrastructure costs, including the cost of disposing of the nasties that
refining solar cell raw materials produces. Cost out a solar panel, cost out
tracking gear, figure out what that 1kW/M^2 turns out to in real life, then talk
to people who have tried it. Solar keeps beckoning, and the stage-to-stage
efficiencies keep killing you. For specialty applications, or if you're
well-off, solar is useful, especially compared with 9-volt 2U6 transistor radio
batteries. But the ROI is slim slim slim. Today.

I made earlier comments in a post some time ago. It's hard to beat the energy
stored by all those plants collecting all that light long ago, then squooshed
and heated by the Earth since the Carboniferous. Neither a study nor a guess, I
priced the components and talked to experienced people (including Don
Lancaster). Maybe someday the costs will go down. As I said, I believe that's
unlikely in the short (predictable) term. Now, if you count hydro as solar
(something has to evaporate all that ocean water to make the precipitation that
fills the reservoirs)... we're already using solar.

Re: alternative energy: If you nose around www.tinaja.com, you might find some
relevant stuff.

Hydrogen is *cold* in liquid form. And have you ever heard of "hydrogen
embrittlement"? Many things are possible. Their being possible doesn't make them
cost-effective.

Well, they do blur together, rather, and I spoke loosely. I think it's possible
that something bacterial could be developed that might be able to crank out the
needed catalyst(s) in tank-car lots. Bulk nano, as I use the term, means
building dumb structures (say of not much more complexity than modern
composites; stupider than a living tree) at a very high rate. The difference as
I envision it is that bulk nano might be able to extrude entire fuel cell
elements in one step. I envision slightly more advanced bulk-like nano as being
able to provide mechanisms for recovering the stuff that usually contaminates
fuel cell electrodes (Sulfur, for one).

To a first approximation, "Bulk Nano"=="no information processing required".
This still makes bulk nano potentially more versatile than bacteria.

Re: bacterial battery: Nope, I purged that info out of my memory banks. I am
pretty sure it's still floating around as a science fair project. I'll see what
I can dig up.

Yup.

Heh. Care to guess what the amount of fuel vapor you (anyone, not picking on you
specifically) release when you vent your tank to fill up corresponds to in
"dirty" miles driven? It's remarkable.

That said, I drive an '85 beater. I think we're in violent agreement here.

The Seattle Times, Today's Top Stories:

Terry McDermott:


LeTourneau and Blilie -- similar cases but different outcomes 


Copyright 1997 The Seattle Times Company

Sunday, Nov. 16, 1997

mailto:tmcd-new@seatimes.com


     Mary LeTourneau, 35, a schoolteacher, has an affair with a 13-year-old 
     boy, a former student of hers.

     The affair produces a guilty plea to charges of second-degree child 
     rape. It also produces a baby and, last week, a suspended sentence.

     Mark Blilie, 42, a schoolteacher, has an affair with a 15-year-old girl, 
     a former student of his. 

     The affair produces a conviction for third-degree child rape and child 
     molestation and four years in the joint for Blilie.


     What's wrong with this? 


     I mean, other than the fact that both these people did horrible things, 
     that they abused children and the hopes and trust of entire communities.

     What's wrong, of course, is the similarity of the situations and the 
     vastly different outcomes. 

     How did this happen?

     The answers are as simple as human history, and as complicated as the 
     human heart. 

     But here's a clue.

     One newspaper account of LeTourneau's sentencing hearing contained this 
     passage:

     "During the sentencing, the mother of the boy forgave LeTourneau, who 
     appeared in an aquamarine sweater, black pleated skirt and her hair 
     pinned up with soft tendrils." She has frequently been described in 
     other news accounts as blond and attractive.

     In case you're wondering, the phrase "soft tendrils" did not appear in 
     any of the stories written about Mark Blilie. In fact, there was no 
     physical description of him whatsoever, although judging from a 
     photograph taken on the day of his sentencing, he is a tall, handsome, 
     dark-haired man. The eattle Times published that photograph with a 
     caption identifying him as "convicted child rapist Mark Blilie."

     The caption published with the photograph of Mary LeTourneau taken at 
     her sentencing identified her as a "former teacher."

     I'm not trying to suggest that Blilie should have evaded prison or that 
     LeTourneau should be sent there. I frankly don't know. But the 
     circumstances of the two cases are so strikingly similar that you would 
     think their sentences would be as well.

     Often, in cases like these, the histories of the accused individuals 
     play a crucial role in sentencing. Neither Blilie nor LeTourneau had 
     previous criminal histories. 

     The chief difference is Blilie is a man, LeTourneau a woman.

     A fast-developing area of biology is spooling out ingenious Darwinian 
     explanations of human sexual behavior: Men seek multiple sexual partners 
     to increase their chances of reproducing; women seek them to set up a 
     competition among sperm - may the best man win.

     Sexual desire, the theorists say, is physical. It is as weird and 
     wonderful and perverse as the world. In some sense, we can't control the 
     desires we have. As a species we're hard-wired for reproduction. It's 
     what we live to do, seeking a sort of serial immortality. Our desires 
     encourage us.

     I'd bet that 95 people out of a hundred would explain Mark Blilie's 
     actions as a result of nothing more than sexual desire, inadequately 
     constrained.

     LeTourneau has contended throughout her ordeal that her only defense is 
     one from the heart.

     The boy was old and wise beyond his years. His own mother calls him an 
     "old soul." LeTourneau says she fell in love with him, and although she 
     acknowledges what she did was wrong, she says she loves him still.

     She says this does not excuse her actions, but might help explain them. 
     Actually, no, it doesn't help explain them. In fact, in some ways it 
     makes them even more confusing and disconcerting. 

     Love, unlike desire, is a human invention. It is almost entirely a 
     creation of culture and is in large part a product of intention.

     In some sense, it would be easier to accept LeTourneau saying she got 
     carried away by rash and unfortunate desire. To say she loved the boy 
     is to say she wanted to happen what did. It further mystifies everyone 
     but her.

     We can accept the fact that some people are just plain bad. When they 
     commit crimes, we understand that bad people do bad things.

     But when good people do bad things and do them on purpose, we are left 
     without our normal, comforting rationalizations. It's very scary because 
     in the end we are left to wonder: 

     What about us?

Yes, I want a more advanced language to share with other species.
How should it work?
What can any animal use to communicate with?

Let all animals including humans be fed smart drugs 
and go to the same schools.
Let's treat all animals like persons, 
because they have personalities.

Teach more chimps sign language.

Have people learn more animal languages.
Humans already record and replay sounds 
to analyze their meanings by reactions they get.
If we simply interpret body language we can learn an amazing number of
phrases.
The easiest signals to identify are:
"Danger"
"Food"
"I'm happy"
"I'm going to hurt you"
"I'm hurt"
"I'm angry"
Limiting communication to audio frequncies is absurd.
Some cats, dogs, and cacatoos(sp? "Polly want a cracker" and "Pretty bird"s) 
can say a couple simple english words like food and out.
but in general they understand us more than we understand them.

Any animal can communicate.
The only reason very few do is because we do not try
We need to teach them when they are young.

      I entirely clear whether or not he's asserting the 'shootdown' was 
      deliberate or not.

      Still, I do recall the incident of the 16" gun turret that blew up 
      on one of the big battle-wagons, and the subsequent rather 
      discreditable furore.  No-one knows how to make the 16" barrels

      Military outfits are -- for better and for worse -- staffed by 
      fallible humans like ourselves, just as every other organization in 
      the world is.  Surprise!

      Conspiracy theorists -- and coincidence theorists -- likewise. These 
      folk are to be found as freelancers, and (in far greater numbers) in 
      the counterintelligence and counter-espionage community teams.

      OK: Here are some 'takes' on some controversies:

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[ TWA 800 ]  To the best of my understanding, the FBI has actively 
 investigated the 'missile shootdown' hypothesis, even going so far as 
 obtaining armed missiles of the appropriate type, and firing them at 747 
 panels, to compare the damage 'signatures.'  So clearly it was OK for 
 them to test the hypothesis.  

 So why shouldn't Ian Goddard discuss the hypothesis openly?

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[ 6 Million Revisionism]  Heinrich Mueller created the Gestapo, modelling 
it on Stalin's NKVD, which he much admired as a force for social control.

       Mueller participated in the Wannsee Conference with Heydrich and 
 Eichmann. After the Brits assassinated Heydrich at lidice, Mueller (who 
 had Hoover-like blackmail deadlocks on the Nazi hierarchy) moved up to 
 the top job (Obergruppenfuhrer) under Himmler.

       Mueller was recruited by General Viktor Abakumov of Soviet Military 
 Counter-Intelligence in 1943, and vastly accelerated the slave-labour 
 camp killings, so as to damage the Nazi war machine by depriving it of 
 the camps' production of war materiel.

       Also, Mueller 'cleansed' 'pre-occupation' Germany of exactly the 
 same kinds of malcontents who Stalin was busily killing off in the USSR 
 -- the so-called 'ally' of Britain and the US at that time (an alliance 
 which got us nowhere, since the war was won as of Summer, 1942 after the 
 Nazi codes were cracked.  The rest was endgame -- we often knew what the 
 German military would do before they did.  (This was quite aside from 
 Maxwell Knight -- 'C' -- recruiting every black and white magician he 
 could find into MI6...).

       Mueller fled to East Germany after the war, and ended up in Moscow. 
 The American War Crimes teams demanded his extradition, which was duly 
 refused.

      This, of course, _revolutionizes_ the history of the Holocaust, and 
  of WWII.  Yet I've discussed it extensively with the Board of Deputies 
  of British Jews, and with the Wiener Library, which helpfully sent 
  documentation; and with William Hood, for twenty years James Jesus 
  Angleton's Deputy at CIA Counterintelligence, from whom I lkearned of 
  Mueller.  I didn't want to give unnecessary offence to relatives and 
  survivors.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

[ KE 007 ]  The Soviet shootdown of 1 September 1983 of KE007 as it was 
  _leaving_ Soviet airspace was greeted by many people I knew (including 
  yours truly -- and, yes, I'm rather ashamed of that, in retrospect) with 
  _exhilaration_ -- wars are mostly competitions in incompetence, and the 
  Soviets blew it on a grand scale.  

  Larry McDonald's shade (he was John Birch Society Chairman, and on board 
  at the time) would have been glad to hear a top Soviet General say that 
  this incident _crippled_ the Soviet military for the rest of the Cold 
  War.  He was a great 'coincidence theorist.'


  In 1984, I wrote these words for Lawrence P. McDonald, In Memoriam:

  "So passed the sword of the Barrow-downs, work of Westernesse.  But glad 
  would he have been to know its fate who wrought it slowly long ago in 
  the North-kingdom when the Dunedain were young, and chief among their 
  foes was the dread realm of Angmar and its sorceror king.  No other 
  blade, not though mightier hands had wielded it, would have dealt that 
  foe a wound so bitter, cleaving the undead flesh, breaking the spell 
  that knit his unseen sinews to his will."  -- J.R.R. Tolkien, 'The Lord 
  of the Rings' Book III, 'the Return of the King.'


  The Soviet pilot who fired the missile that downed KE007 lives on a 
  Russian Air Force Base in isolation, shunned by his colleagues.  He 
  expected to be a hero -- his only comment now:

       "I was the arrow, not the archer."


  I was going to write a detailed rebuttal of David Ramsay Steele's and 
  Justin Raimondo's suggestions that the National Security Agency had 
  diverted the plane into Soviet airspace so as to 'light up' the Soviet 
  defense radars.  But NSA could have used a pilotless drone to do that, 
  so it seemed quite pointless.  And SR-71 Blackbirds made over 900 
  flights into Soviet airspace without a single loss.

  If KE007 had an IFF transponder, it would have returned a civil aircraft 
  identifier code when illuminated by attack radars.  Justin Raimondo 
  hinted that the Soviets thought the plane was an E4B Airborne Command 
  Post (how would he know?) -- but could even _he_ have believed the US 
  would have been so incomprehensible as to send one of these planes on a 
  leisurely and pointless cruise straight through Soviet airspace?

[ Andrew Robert Dennett ]  My young friend Andrew Robert Dennett, who I 
 loved, and gave a home to in 1969, when he was five years old, and whom I 
 used to take to church with his brothers, was found dying hideously, of 
 _cyanide poisoning_, fifteen years ago today (November 17, 1982). He left 
 a tape recording in which he stated his conviction that his life was 
 being deliberately destroyed, and that he was going to be murdered, and 
 naming those responsible.


 I and three other people heard this tape after Andrew's death.  (Mark 
 Brady asked: "How do you like the _tape_?"   three days after Andrew had 
 died -- only two days after Brady and his clique had rejected the 
 peaceful settlement of our LA/Alternative Bookshop disputes).  Had I 
 learned of Andrew's death at that time, it could possibly have broken my 
 will to fight.  

 Or -- alternatively -- it could have led to a horrifying outbreak of 
 carnage against Steele, Brady and their idiot associates, carried through 
 by the top-flight warfighting covert-action Special Forces of several 
 countries.  _Whoever_ was backing them...

 Let them now read Henry Kuttner's story "Two Handed Engine" aka "The Fury."

 Then, on February 7 1984, Andrew's oldest brother Terry was rammed by an 
 identical stolen BMW -- same make, same model, same colour -- after the 
 other driver pulled onto his side of the road and drove head-first into 
 him at an impact speed of 140 miles per hour, hospitalizing Terry with a

When you say 'appeared to hit ground', did you actually see it hit, or did
it go behind a hill?  

I haven't heard anything about this event, but from your description, what
you saw was an object weighing at least tens of kilograms falling from
space.  Such objects are usually satellites or other space junk, but
occaisionally natural meteorites.  It was unlikely to be a piece of Mir,
since Mir is in a high orbit and is fairly disciplined about sending its
junk back to Earth on spacecraft, rather than simply throwing it away.
Most satellites are of sufficiently flimsy construction that they burn up
before hitting the ground.  Re-entry would burn off at least an inch or two
of solid steel, and few spacecraft parts are so hefty.  When Skylab
re-entered, the only part that survived was a radiation-proof safe they
kept their film in.  In particular, fuel cells are not dense enough to
survive, AFAIK.  On the other hand, it probably was a Soviet or Russian
object.  They sent up a lot more stuff than the rest of the world put
together, and they weren't as fastidious as other countries about not
letting things fall out of orbit.

They're dropping things on your head because the odds of actually hitting
anyone are pretty slim, and even if they hit someone, the chance of being
held legally responsible is small, and even then, the cost of losing a
wrongful death suit are far less than the cost of launching the payload in
the first place.

Nouns and verbs _are_ roles, not absolutes. As I tried to make clear
before, such terms are not convenient categories for describing word
classes but functioning units of the language-machine.  English is pretty
good at making verbs out of nouns (to benchmark, to chair (be a chairman),
to contact, to progress, to host --some of these have been used as verbs
so long we forget they came from nouns and were once decried as debasing
the language); other languages have less fluidity between categories.  The
ease with which Lojban transfers meaning-words from one part of speech to
another is a great design feature which I'm sure can be used to great
literary effect. 

Dr Moore, the chair, chairs in his chair.

 Nevertheless, when I use "chair" to refer to the person
in charge of a department, that's a noun.  When I use "chair" to refer to
the _act_ of that person being in charge, that's a verb. Nothing inherent,
just the way our language module processes the message. English does this
occasionally; Lojban does it regularly; Lojban still has nouns and verbs.

How is recognizing actor-actor assumptions different from recognizing
nouns and verbs?

Copula verbs (to be, to seem, to resemble, etc.) are a poor choice, since
all the metaphorical action they show is a = a.  There are plenty of
languages, such as Spanish, Latin, or ancient Greek, where the copula is
strictly optional.  Speaking Greek, I could point to my girlfriend and say
 _      _       _      _
hede gyne      hede gyne estin
this a woman   this a woman is.

Both, in English, would be "This is a woman;" arbitrarily, English cannot
drop the copula.  It's a surface detail.  Lojban doesn't need an explicit
copula to show a = a relationships; so what?

That's the point of natural language's distinction between verbs and
nouns --it is semantically incomprehensible to transfer some meanings
to different functions.  We can do it in any natural language though;
consider "I sky the blueness while you ocean the door."  Structurally this
is fine, even though English does not (as far as I know) have any
verb-roles for sky or ocean;  using our ability to apply multiple  mental
modules at once, generally known as metaphor or analogy, we could come up
with such meanings. All Lojban does is make the metaphorical or logical
relationship less cumbersome.  As I have said, Lojban's syntax is
convenient; it is not a different way of processing.

Sure they are; the structure just doens't mark the verbing or nounness by
adding morphemes directly to the root, morphemes that say "hey, I'm a
verb" or "hey, I'm a noun."  We process the meaning the same way; surface
details are relevant to Universal Grammar only insofar as they demonstrate
the underlying relationships.

Does anyone on this list know Chinese?  A language more fully isolating
than English would be useful for demonstrations.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

Does anybody know some good references regarding coherent quantum 
systems in neurons?

I would like to read more about it before I make a definitive 
conclusion.

As far as I know there is no hard proof for the existence of such 
coherent quantum systems in neurons. OK, till they have been proven 
not to exist, they could be possible. But this is no reason to 
assume they do exist. This is hardly a reasoning in accordance with 
Occams Razor.

(( This is the same reasoning as people who "believe" in a GOD. 
They reason that because a GOD (outside our universe) cannot be 
proven impossible, a GOD does exist. ))


The real question is : 

Are the known characteristics of neural networks 
sufficient to account for the behavior of all biological 
neural networks. 
(Without any need for more complex computation systems 
like coherent quantum systems.)


I think it seems very plausible that coherent quantum systems 
are not actively involved in the thinking processes of our brain. 

Some questions :

1) Can somebody explain how these quantum systems stay coherent long 
enough to perform a useful computation?

(As far as I know the current proposals for artificial quantum computers 
are to be working at very low temperatures to keep the system coherent 
long enough. )

2) How are these quantum systems supposed to interact with the 
conventional information processes in the neuron?

I still think the assumptions about the presence of quantum 
systems in neurons are only wild speculation...

You're right, almost...

You have an intuition that the 2x1 beam is 'twice as big' as the 1x1 beam.
So far so good.  The you try to measure their volumes and get infinity in
both cases, and start elaborating a theory about different sizes of
infinity.  I'm fairly sure that if you continue in this direction you get
all balled up, and end up without a consistent theory that lets you think
about this kind of stuff.  Let me suggest that the right way to think about
this is to give up measuring by volume.  Instead, create a new kind of
measurement that you can call 'Newstrom volume'.  This is a measurement of
the cross-sectional area of the thickest bundle of infinitely long lines
you can fit into a given volume.  A 1x1x1 cube can't hold any infinite
lines, so it has a Newstrom volume of 0.  The 1x1 beam has a Newstrom
volume of one square inch (note that Newstrom volume has units of area!).
The 2x1 beam has a Newstrom volume of 2 square inches.  Then your intuition
is preserved, and there's no need to invoke different sizes of infinity.

There's a branch of geometry called 'measure theory' that gives us tools to
think about this kind of problem. It deals with various ways of measuring
how big sets are.  The basic concept is a 'measure'.  A measure is a
function mapping chunks of a space to numbers, having these properties:

1.  The measure of the union of a finite number of non-overlapping chunks
is the sum of their measures.
2.  The measure of the intersection of two chunks is less than or equal to
the larger of their measures.
3.  The measure of any chunk is zero or a positive number.

A measure gets to restrict what kind of chunks it applies to.  For example,
asking for the length of a 1x1x1 cube is not legal.  Neither is asking for
the volume of a 1x1xinfinity ray bundle.

Volume, area and Newstrom volume are all measures.  

Measure theory is useful for fractal geometry, and for probability and
statistics.

You are making the grave error of confusing Mathematics with common
sense and reality.  Both are irrelevant to Mathematics.  Math is
just the manipulation of symbols according to the rules and definitions
given.  Occasionally, we can 'map' some part of reality onto some
mathematical model, use it to produce a theorem, and then map that
theorem back onto reality to predict something; but such /applied/
mathematics is just guesswork.  We really have no way of knowing how
accurate our mappings are, and 'pure' mathematicians don't care
anyway; they just care whether or not the results properly follow
from the givens, nothing more.

In the case of transfinites, no mapping to reality is possible, so
all common-sense arguments like "something can't be equal to helf of
itself" are irrelevant.  Transfinites /are/ equal to half of themselves,
/by definition/.  Why have mathematicians chose such a bizarre
definition?  Because it makes other mathematics easier, simpler, more
consistent, and perhaps more practical.  Why is 0^0 equal to 1?
Because /defining/ it as such simplifies a lot of calculations that
would otherwise have ugly special cases (the graph of y = x^x is
made continuous at [0,1], for example).  Not because it 'seems right'
or 'makes sense' or something.

Bertrand Russel said it best: Mathematics is unconcerned with whether
a proposition is 'true', only whether certain propositions logically
follow from other (given) propositions.  And ideally, they are not
propositions about specific things, but must be generalized to hold
for anything we care to fill into the variables.  Mathematics, then,
is the science in which we never know what we are talking about, or
whether what we are saying is true.

Universal grammar is not the abstraction of the grammars of all known
human languages; it is the theorized "operating system" that is
_language_.  If the software (Lojban, Anasazi, Sumerian) doesn't conform
to the needs of the OS, it won't run.  Do the current UG theories, 
government-binding and optimality, fully explain all details of syntax?
No.  Are linguists all agreed in their use of the UG paradigm?  No.
Linguistics is a young science and not yet in a period of "normal
science."  This does not mean that the fundamental fact that Chomsky
recognized is invalid, namely, human minds are built for language, build
it in childhood using the terribly poor, incomplete examples around them,
and invariably build it along identical lines.  This has earned him the
eternal wrath of cultural relativists who want human nature to be
alterable; of course, we want our nature to be alterable, too, but
transhumanists recognize we need to change the hardware to do so.

The acid test for Lojban would be, can children learn it and not creolize
it?  If children are exposed to Lojban as a first language and what they
create based on the evidence available to them is basically the same, it
conforms to UG.  If they alter it radically or minutely, then the
Lojbanists have made some fundamental mistakes about how to create a
language usable by humans which makes logical relationships explicit.

A few millenia?  Most linguists and informed archaeologists reckon that
language in its current form has existed for 60,000 to 200,000 years and
language of less complicated structure (analogous to the stages children
go through while acquiring language --vague words, more focused words,
two-word sentences, telegraphic sentences) has existed since Homo erectus,
1.5 million years ago.

Age of a science is not a requisite for the accuracy of its theories.
Yes, linguistics is a young science.  Our universe has existed for more
than 15 billion years; is it irresponsible or hubristic to draw
conclusions about the way it behaves because physics has existed for a
tiny fraction of that?

That's certainly your right.  Such credentials are not given for towing
the party line or sucking up any more (or any less) than in any other
academic field.  Linguists as a population deserve to be listened to not
because they have impressive degrees but because they've spent millions of
hours paying attention to language in ways that others haven't; the same
goes for physicists, oceanographers and computer scientists.

 I am not one who takes a such things as

Why do you have such animosity for Chomsky or researchers working in his
wake?  What, exactly, have Lojbanists actually done?  Made a (possibly)
natural language that computers can parse better than English or Finnish?
That says more about the limitations of contemporary computers compared
to the parsing (and, more importantly, interpretation) ability of any
human being. Lojban aims to minimize ambiguity.  Check.  English contains
sentences like "Time flies like an arrow," which can be parsed any of a
number of ways by a computer.  Check.  

However if, in speech and not writing, I say to you "Hey, time flies like
an arrow," I sincerely doubt you'll take it as "'time-flies' enjoy a
particular arrow" or any other bizarre sense.  Why?  Because intonation
plays a very important role in communicating meaning --I will stress the
words differently depending on whether "time" and "flies" are a noun and a
verb, a compound noun, etc.  Intonation and other prosodic features have
generally been ignored in computational linguistics because such features
are not as easy to quantify as word-as-symbol or phoneme-as-component.

Phonology is a tricky area; we hear phonological distinctions that aren't
there in the accoustics.  Until we can get a computer to make the same
context-sensitive distinctions and interpretations that any neurologically
and anatomically normal 5-year-old can, we don't know enough about speech
perception and production to try and alter the basics of language.

I'm certainly not big on ducking reality; I have no doubt that our
minds are wired by evolution in specific ways, and that it is good
to study those ways.  I have little patience for those who believe
otherwise for whatever reasons.  But what better way to study them
than by deliberately attempting to flout them?  Indeed, how else
/can/ one study limits and capabilities except by trying to exceed
them (and learning from our failure)?

If those children do alter it, then /that fact/ will tell us more about
the nature of the fundamental capabilities of the human mind than any
amount of study on existing languages.  Far from being a failure of the
Loglan project, it would be a great success (though it would be a
failure of the language itself, perhaps).  It is precisely because Lojban
is so alien to the way things are done in evolved languages that makes
it a useful data point.  I also think it would be a useul language--
perhaps not as a primary, but as a secondary one.  Both of those
conjectures are subject to experiment.  I participate in the latter;
I'll have to wait until I have children to participate in the former.

Touche.  That was a rather stupid thing for me to say.  The idea I
was trying to get across is that for the sake of studying how the
human mind is wired for language, the set of all human languages is
a rather small sample.  I'd like to see more outliers in this set:
Lojban is a good one, but I can imagine even more strange ways to
construct a language that might tell us more.

I'll go even further than that: without intonation of any kind, any
normal English reader would read that sentence as I just did, and parse
it correctly.  The failure of a computer to do so does indeed say more
about the limits of the computer than of the language.  But there are
other cases where the needed specificity is actually /difficult/ to say
in English without great effort, where it is much simpler in Lojban.
Perhaps that is a small subset; but it is definitely non-empty.  And
what is the evidence that intonation /must/ play a part in communicating
meaning?  Are we not communicating now?  Wouldn't it be nice to use
a language in which we could express the things usually done by
intonation in text instead?

My only argument with Chomsky is that he is treated as a God by much
of the linguistics world.  Specifically, his dismissal of the Sapir-
Whorf hypothesis is taken as if it had been discredited, when it fact
nothing of the kind has taken place.  Many experiments have failed to
show strong effects, and many /have/ show weaker effects--clearly
showing, for example, that language can affect cognition even to the
point of perception.  These phenomena go largely unexplored today
because Chomsky followers don't think they'll amount to anything, and
that is a great loss.

Exactly my earlier point about the SWH: ask anyone here if they
actually /hear/ word breaks in spoken English.  Most people will
unquestioningly say "yes, of course".  You and I both know that
those breaks don't exist in the acoustics, so their perception is
being influenced by their learned language.  These effects deserve
more study.  For example, would a child who grew up with Lojban
phonetics "hear" word breaks where Lojban makes them optional
(which is almost everywhere)?  Would two children who grew up
speaking Lojban to each other over email, but with two different
native languages, end up using the same intonations, or might they
even use Lojban text in different ways?

The existence of a language like Lojban makes it possible to
study questions like this in a way that would really not be
possible any other way.  Even if the language /as a language/
is deeply flawed--and it may well be, though I haven't found
so yet--it is still a great contribution to the science.

No, I am not supporting crime.  In fact, I was speaking out against
programs that copy data from my computer without permission and transmits
it over the network.  I also was speaking out against programs that
misrepresent themselves as a different program to try to gain unauthorized
access to other computers over the network.  You mistakenly assume that if
I don't trust Microsoft to do anything it wants on my computer without my
knowledge or permission, that I must have something to hide from them.

I never mentioned Netscape Navigator.  You mistakenly assume that if I have
a single negative point about Microsoft Internet Explorer, that I must be
anti-Microsoft and pro-Netscape in the browser arena.

>As for Wintel vs. Apple[....]

I merely objected to your claim that Macintoshes are *twice* as costly as
the equivalent PC.  You mistakenly assumed that I was therefore anti-PC and
pro-Mac.  I tried to clear this up by pointing out that I have more PC's
and Unixes in my home lab than Macs, and that I provide major consulting
for IBM.

You are the one caught up in the propoganda.  Your entire post has been
responding to points I never made.  You are having a war with an imaginary

Of course, if a program ever did that, it would need to be in the
Licence agreement you read (make sure you look those over) You never
acutally buy software. You buy the right to use it.

no it is not a given. All of those projections people put out of "30
years" or "50 years" of oil left are projections based on consumption of
reserves retreivable at current market prices. Obviously, as prices
rise, more difficult to retreive reserves become cost effective
resources. Eventually, even oil shales will truly become cost effective
reserves, as they are not now. Oddly enough, as market prices rise, the
number of decades of reserves available INCREASES.

The only real excuse to not use fossil fuels is because of global
warming, if it really exists. There is still debate on what the actual
effect is, and how much has to do with solar variances rather than
actual human pollution. THere are many indications that our present
pollutive state is protecting us from another ice age the we should be
knee deep in by now.

A secondary excuse to not use fossil fuels is from a libertarian
standpoint, to liberate oneself from the oil oligarchy. Solar, wind, and
microhydro power are excellent methods to liberate oneself from the
energy sugar daddy. If cold fusion in a bottle were actually to come to
frution, it would be a major destabilizing influence on the oil and
fissile nuke powers that have a big degree of control over our
mercantilist institutions. This is one reason not to buy the
conventional wisdom about cold fusion. The powers that be fear anything
that might loosen their control, and are not totally above tech
supression in areas that fit this bill.

It never ceases to amaze me how many seemingly intelligent
people can fall for such an obviously absurd urban legend
like this.  (1) Microsoft gets investigated by the FTC for
doing such terrible things as freely negotiating a contract
with Compaq for its use of Windows, or for the audacity to
give away their browser.  They get castigated in the press
for making a Java that's a little bit different from Sun's.
If they were caught doing something as truly underhanded as
this, it would be front page headline news, and people would
be screaming for jail terms (I mean people one would normally
take seriously, not the kind of people already screaming for
Bill's head).  (2) If they did have code that did this, all
that would be necessary to prove it is a filename and byte
offset, and anyone could go disassemble the code and see for
themselves.  This is such a trivial thing to prove, the 
complete lack of such proof in any of these stories makes it
obvious that they are just fabrication.

No doubt we'll see stories next week that Bill is running
a black-market stolen kidney syndicate, or has purchased the
Dewar holding Walt Disney, or maybe that he was the one who
shot down TWA 800.

I don't know who "you" is, but according to the Russians and NORAD, it
was a reentering Proton booster, reentering as previously predicted. The
main body landed out to sea, while denser material, like the engines,
had slightly longer trajectories that took them into eastern Washington
State. Actual impacts have not been reported, but that is to be expected
given the sparseness of that part of the state. Art Bell and other
ignorant sensationalist ufo hounds are making all sorts fo outlandish
claims that do nothing but make them look like fools to anyone who has
seen the video footage shown on KING channel 5 in Seattle.

Actually, it is not true that A-A=A for infinite cardinals A. 
Sums involving positive and negative Cantorian infinities are not 
defined. Robinsonian infinimal hyperreals do have addition defined 
on them, but there I+(-I)=0. (It's because John's posts are usually 
so accurate and correct that it is worth picking on small things like 
this.)

I agree, though the tests for sentience is a whole topic in itself.  And a
very important 
one I admit.:)

But I've heard owls represent as close as we can get to an intelligent
bird.  It might be that connections are more important.  If we can
redesign their brains to be more efficient... faster, more compact, less
conserved wetware, more to-the-point (i.e., info processing) stuff...
then it might be possible.

I would much rather experiment initially with organisms that have a
short development cycle, which makes, out of Warrl kyree
Tale'sedrin's list avians and invertabrates very likely candidates.
We can take a page from the MIT robot lab: start simple, then add
more stuff.

I agree.  I tried to argue the point but failed to persuade.

BTW, an uplifting classic long predating David Brin is Olaf Stapeldon's
_Sirius_.
It is not good writing, but he takes the ideas very far.

One needn't uplift to the point of giving rights.  That is another issue
altogether.
However, my point was I think an intelligent guard dog might be able to carry
out many other functions too.  It might be able to operate cameras and other
surveillance equipment and summon (bark, set off alarms, talk?) humans, etc.
through use of judgment rather than merely out of habit.

It mgiht be, though my first step would be anything to increase brain power in
a meaningful way -- whether than be increasing speed or firing, changes in
connections or adding more neurons/connections.  Of course, this is just a
guess.  Intelligence might have little to do with these things -- which I
seriously
doubt; I think brain structure/operation has almost everything to do with it:)
-- but if we start experimenting, we'll soon find out.  How can this be done?
Surgery is one route, though I'd be more into breeding and controlling
development hormonally and genetically.  Increasing the amount of effort
and time to growing a larger brain in, say, octopi, might be a good start.
Cheap too?

I also believe intelligence to be best measured by problem solving abilities.
Language would be a good way but not the only way to implement this
measurement.  (There are nonlinguistic tests we can do to test uplifted
organisms, such as some which are already done with mice.:)

Play God!

Exactly.  Paul Davies has pointed out that the ambient heat noise in a
brain would instantly decohere such putative effects.  Danah Zohar and Ian
Marshall and other fans of Bose condensates in neural structures seem to me
to be engaging in hand-waving of the most noxious kind.

On the other hand, moderate-temperature superconductors were once thought
impossible in principle.

Sure, why not.  I hear that Marilyn Vos Savant says the recent proof
of Fermat's Last Theorem is unsound because it relies on nonEuclidean
geometry.

Now, which had less of an excuse to distrust hyperbolic geometry:
Ms Vos Savant, or C.L.Dodgson?

(Dodgson rejected it because of ideal triangles - figures with infinite
perimeter, zero angles, and finite area - which he called absurd.)

What's your point, danny?  Is the electron accelerating, or not?
If it is accelerating, then it ought to release energy, or Maxwell's
theory is wrong (and radios don't work...).  But if it releases energy, 
the energy must come from somewhere.  Where?  From the electron itself?  
But that would mean the electron's mass decreases, and it's well known 
that all electrons have the same mass.  From the electron's orbit?  But 
electrons don't fall into the nucleus.  From elsewhere?

A charged particle circling in a cyclotron does release energy
(called synchrotron radiation), and its orbit does change.

Wolfkin asks:

Do it the other way.  Draw a line through the apex and any point on the
longer segment.  If the shorter segment contains only half as many points
as the longer segment, then half of the time your new line will intersect
*no* point on the shorter segment.  I think Euclid would disagree.

Au contraire!  It's wonderful writing, one of the most sublime and moving
sf novels ever written.

A recent *literary* rather than sf sensation using this trope is LIVES OF
THE MONSTER DOGS, by NY writer Kirsten Bakis.  I've just started reading
it, so don't know how good it is.  (Given its mainstream success, I expect
it to be on the banal side.)

Most law enforcement *is* at the individual level.

Practical examples: Bruce Benson, _The Enterprise of Law_.
Fictional hints: Neil Smith, _Converse and Conflict_;

: How do you go from the present situation to such a system?

That's the hard part!  The important thing is to prepare the culture,
to teach people that obedience to the State is not the same thing as
justice; that the State is not something divine and eternal, but a
creation of imperfect men, which ought to be discarded - not merely
reformed - when it proves destructive to the purposes for which it is
generally held to exist.  When enough people understand that, we can
build parallel institutions, to be ready when the State is weakest.

Most "revolutions" simply take the apparatus of the pre-existing State
and give it new commands - not only because the apparatus is convenient
to the conquerors, but also because most people can't imagine living
without their favorite state office (and there's already a supply of
bureaucrats who know how to run that office!).

My dream is to build free institutions *beside* the State, in no way
dependent on it, so that if the State should crumble we'll be no more
disturbed than if some big corporation - AT&T, let's say - goes out
of business.  (I don't mean to imply *no* disturbance.  If AT&T crashes
millions of people will be inconvenienced for a few weeks, but there
are other wires.)

Is there any reason to think that some real numbers can *not* be expressed

close to the value of such numbers - what, if anything, does it mean to
say they have a value?

In the same book, she also confuses philosophical induction with
what is called "mathematical induction" (even though it is, of
course, completely deductive and rigorous).  Just goes to show that
a high IQ isn't enough to prevent saying stupid things now and then.
And don't get me started on her politics...

A mule is the offspring of a donkey and a horse.  I've read some where
that a chimpanzee and a human are genetically closer than a donkey and a
horse.  Wouldn't cross breeding humans with other primates qualify as a
form of uplifting?  I think this would be technically possible right
now.  Although it may be politically difficult.

Probably. :)  Ok, then, if we do it the other way...  
Why would it "intersect *no* point"?  This just seems to mean that
two different lines *can* be drawn through two points. ;)

Bill would never steal somebody's kidneys. He's not that kind of guy.
Buying the water company, and them selling everyone who wants to drink the
water a mandatory kidney 'Upgrades' is more his style ;-)

Since I started this I'll finish it (not that I expect to reach agreement
but just to clarify why I feel the way I do). If you don't believe me, well
that's too bad but not a complete disaster, maybe these people have some
credibility?

But maybe these people are all incredebly naive and don't understand IT at
all ;-). Sort of like us poor IBM-ers. Why is it that every time M$ outfits
a company with NT they come to IBM (or another IT consultant company) for
help with their suddenly HUGE security and systems-management problems? Why
is it that it takes three times as long to get Systems Management software
working in an NT Client-Server (if_you_insist_on_calling_it_that)
environment?.

Isn't the fact that there are lot's of anti-MS sites around saying something?
I've never come accross an anti-IBM site (Or HP, Apple, SGI, SUN, Corel....).
But if anyone can locate one I'll be most interested in it's content.

The New York Times editorial "Conspiracies, Real 
and Imagined"  (11/14/97)  falsely states that: 
"Mr. Goddard now says he INVENTED the tale [the 
Navy-Missile theory] to give the Government a 
'black eye.'"  (emphasis added)

I was contacted by Matthew Wald with the New York 
Times the day the CNN story hit, over a week before 
that NY Times editorial. I explained to Mr. Wald 
that I never admitted to perpetrating a sham or a 
hoax, that I have only presented eyewitness accounts 
and press reports pertaining to military activity 
on July 17, 1996. I "invented" NOTHING. I was even 
a relative late comer to the USN-TWA theory.

I also sent him all the messages I have sent here. 
But nevertheless, the New York Times ignores what 
I actually say and instead they say that I said I 
invented the whole thing. Clearly, they chose to 
publish the false over the true. Why???!!

This is a naked farce, a deliberate attempt to 
destroy the truth, the Navy-missile theory, and 
me to boot. Why would they do this? Other reports 
claim I wrote the so-called "anonymous Internet 
document," which was written by former 747 pilot 
Richard Russell. The unrelenting year-long sweep 
of disinformation throughout the media points to 
only one logical answer to that question: there 
is a massive media-wide cover-up underway. 

I have spoken with reporters who tell me they can-
not cover witnesses accounts. When I ask why, no 
answer is given. All the major network programs, 
even fringe programs like HARD COPY, refuse to show 
the radar tapes, except a 2 second flash by Prime 
Time Live that prevented any meaningful perception 
of their content. Richard Russell, who had extra 
copies he forgot to give the FBI when they took 
the masters, has tried and tried to get media to 
show the tape, with no luck. It's authenticity is 
not in question. The FBI has conceded authenticity. 
It's a fact that Russell has inside contacts. The
FBI has been interrogating his friends in an 
effort to track down that contact.

The evidence is clear that there is a clamp down 
on all evidence pointing to Navy culpability and 
there is an agenda to destroy those pushing the 
case, particularly yours truly. It's all right 
there for anyone to see. It seems clear that it's 
a national security issue, and that under such, 
it's Marshall Law regarding the issue of TWA 800. 

Pointing in this direction is the fact that on 
the very same day (03/11/97) the FBI learned that 
Russell had the radar tapes, showing a possible 
Navy missile, and went to get the tapes, President 
Clinton signed Executive Order 13039, which excludes 
the Naval Special Warfare Development Group from 
federal whistle-blower protections for reasons of 
"national security." The SpecWarDevGru is involved 
in the littoral (coastal) Cruise Missile Defense 
program which seems to be what was happening off 
Long Island during the "Global Yankee '96" military 
exercises taking place off L.I. on July 17, 1996.

You can see this eye-opening Executive Order here:

http://www.pub.whitehouse.gov/white-house-publications/1997/03/1997-03-11-ex
ec-order-on-naval-special-warfare-development-group.text 

http://www.accessone.com/~rivero/CRASH/TWA/twa_labor.html

E.O. 13039 went into effect one day before the Paris 
Match article came out showing photos of the radar 
tapes. I believe they fear any favorable media 
coverage such as the Match article, because this 
creates an atmosphere that could encourage "loose 
lips." It could make the suppressed feel it was safe 
to come out, that someone will listen. It seems that 
the master planners panicked when they realized the 
radar data was out and rushed to exempt the key Navy 
R&D group from whistle-blower protections.

Allowing a fair degree of obvious media oppression 
may be determined as necessary to signal those that
might speak up, that your dead meat if you do...
look how we cooked Goddard's ass. If a Navy person
came forward, they'd say he was perpetrating a hoax
for money, for fame, to get back at his superiors...

This is one of the most massive cover-ups in history. 
Anyone who takes the time to read a few of my short 
reports will see the utter transparency of it:

  http://www.erols.com/igoddard/journal.htm 

I have PROVEN that there is a cover-up:

  http://www.erols.com/igoddard/cover-up.htm 

I believe that my having shown its transparency is 
the reason I've been taken out to the woodshed by 
the GovtMedia for spankings over and over this last 
year. My butt got so sore I said I was sorry, but 
then they whipped my ass harder anyway, so why 
apologize? Hell... maybe I'm a masochist.

And all this does is move "eventually" farther out.

If we continue (into the indefinite future) to use fossil fuels -- 
even if we eliminate all fuel uses and simply continue to use them at 
the current rate as a raw material for synthetics -- we WILL 
eventually run out of fossil fuels.  Including the oil shales you 
refer to.

That's probably several hundred years of "eventually".  But it will 
still happen.

I am pretty well convinced that it's very real -- and I'm very glad.

Eliminate the likely effects of human pollution (and don't be 
short-sighted, we aren't NEARLY as polluting today as we were a 
hundred years ago, and possibly not even two hundred years ago, at 
least not in the ways that matter most), and you're talking ice age.

If we can boost the temperature another three to five degrees, the 
climactic change might restore the Sahara Prairie -- which would make 
life a lot easier for a lot of poor people.

Shorelines?  TWO degrees warmer, we're back to the temperature of 
about a thousand years ago.  Do we have lots of evidence of sea 
levels dropping since then?  We should have good records from China, 
and maybe Japan, and Arabia... the Maldives were a major cultural 
center a thousand years ago, and they are a bunch of pretty low 
islands, so their records should be really informative... and who 
knows, even Europe might have something, in spite of the Dark Ages.

No.  Think steam engines.  Given the same level of technology and 
development, an external combustion engine has *vast* advantages over 
internal combustion.  It's easier to switch fuels.  Since it burns 
steady (rather than in bursts) it burns the same fuel more cleanly 
and efficiently.

Unfortunately there HAS NOT BEEN the same level of development.  
We've put many times more effort into internal combustion engines.  
Today we do not know how to make an external-combustion engine 
suitable for use in an automobile, that is nearly as good as the 
Rankine-cycle internal combustion engines that the automakers use by 
the millions.

I've read about some interesting schemes.  For example, a hybrid 
vehicle using some sort of energy storage device; the charging 
mechanism is a standard IC engine (about the size of a 
riding-lawnmower engine) which runs intermittently but at a set, 
constant speed when running.  This addresses some, but not all, of 
the inherent relative disadvantages of the internal-combustion 
engine.  Since it's properly tuned for its actual operating speed, it 
runs cleaner than a normal IC engine and with less wear -- but still 
inferior to what should be expected of a similarly-developed steam 
engine, if such an engine existed.

Yes, but we should realize we are taking on a big responsibility by
even partial uplifting. There are plenty of people who think even
normal animals can have certain rights, and an uplifted animal would
likely have more rights.

There are no significant differences in firing speed, neural
arborization and connectivity as far as I know between different
mammals. However, a colleauge pointed out to me that primiates seems
to have some very high-frequency cells that others lack that may be
important. But in general relative cortical size and structure seems
to be more important than the other properties.

Genetics is probably the way to go, if only to add control genes so
that we can make adult brains grow more or "debug" them, since we want
the species to have a heritable intelligence. Hormones and surgery can
only help individuals.

It may be hard to work with octopi, since their brains are so
different from ours and we have more experience with mammal brains.

Yes, but language is important in order to make the uplifted animals
able to communicate with each other, and hence spread their own
experiences and memes. It would likely accelerate development just as
it appears to have done in humans.

It strikes me that we really need to learn more about how we became
intelligent in order to be good at uplifting. But uplifting also gives
us valuable information on how we may have evolved.

	Twink <neptune@mars.superlink.net> brought up the great topic
of "uplifting"!

	Did you coin this usage of this term or has it been used
before in this way?

	I look forward to introducing my Dog to what it is like to
have richer color vision and the joys of greater intelligence...  And
I also look forward to knowing what it is like to hear, smell and be
like a Dog...

> I agree, though the tests for sentience is a whole topic in itself.
> And a very important one I admit.:)

	Yes.  It also surely isn't a hard line which on one side
animals are sentient and on the other they are not.  It's a very
broad, gradual and complex continuum.  I'm sure echo-locating animals
such as bats and other animals, especially the higher ones mentioned
here like whales..., have sensations humans have never felt.  In these
particular areas they would be "more sentient" than we are.  "What is
it like to be a bat?" is the famous question by Nagal.  What is it
like to be a fish with a hook in it's mouth?  Does a fish feel pain
the same way we do or does its body just twitch and flex the way an
unfeeling machine might?  It's probably neather of these but something
phenomenally different and we just don't yet know just what it IS
like.

	Until we can truly understand what and why phenomenal
sensations are, and can do things like objectively observe and eff
such feelings, we can't really accurately judge what is sentient and
what is not.  Do single celled animals have any such phenomenal
feelings or conscious knowledge?  I doubt it and would guess that
these are mostly simply mechanical.  What about insects?  Are they
purely abstractly mechanical or do they, too, experience some kind of
phenomenal feeling representations?  Where is the line drawn between
what can feel and what can't?  Until we know just what sensations are
and how they are employed by the various intelligent animals to
represent different kinds of knowledge and awareness, we can't yet
really know where to draw the line between what is and what isn't
sentient.

> Play God!

	Yes definitely!  But shouldn't we be sure we are a good and
benevolent God?  I don't think we should ever only "uplift" to a
limited degree so that lower life forms can be left as such to only be
our slaves or servants or whatever.  There will be plenty of ways for
us all to do things mechanically without having to employ lessor
sentient life forms to do slave labor.  If we have the right to be
uplifted via the help of other humans, I would think most lower
animals would deserve the same right.  The difference between a dog
and us is nothing compared to the difference between us and a God
right?

	I look forward to being more sentient, and knowing what it is
like to be a bat, a dolphin playing in wakes, eagles soaring through
the Mountains... and to be God creating worlds and uplifting others
and experiencing things no animal has yet experienced...  and I look
forward to equally sharing these sensations, feelings, and phenomenal
conscious knowledge and abilities with everyone and everything...

	It doesn't matter what you are.  What you can become is all
that matters to me.

Bit yes ambiguous no. Unless the holly rollers turn out to be right the human

what a Turing machine does. What a Turing machine does is determined by the 
state it's in, and that depends on whether it sees a 0 or a 1 on a paper tape.

You're using the word "concept" in a somewhat more restrictive manner than I

Certainly, but I don't think it's " mental state" that's ambiguous, I think 
it's the dividing line between, concepts, thoughts, feelings, values and  
desires.  These are just fuzzy categories we sometimes find convenient to put 
our various mental states into.

True but unimportant. The important part is the person, a human being is just 
a bag of protoplasm.

What's so great about belonging to the human species? A human being is an  
animal so of course it must be biological, but the same is not true of a 
person.
  
In my opinion at the present time the most valuable thing in the universe is 
3 pounds of gray goo inside the head of a particular bipedal ape descendant,

And octopi.  Take an octopus who has never seen a glass jar.  Put a 
lobster in a glass jar with a screw-on lid -- an ordinary mayonnaise 
jar will work if it's a small enough lobster.  Toss the jar in with 
the octopus.  Within about five minutes, the jar is open (not 
broken, open) and so is the lobster.

How nice, I'm just doing some reading on that right now.  

Modern human intelligence may result from combining different modules,
each with a different function and different learning mechanisms.  For
example, we and other primates seem to have, to a greater or lesser degree
depending upon individual and species, innate knowledge of (1) social
interactions within the species, (2) an understanding of biology (folk
taxonomy, paying attention to life cycles, etc), and (3) a technical
intelligence (talent for building tools).  All these focused modules exist
alongside the less powerful learning mechanisms of "general intelligence."

Chimps make tools, but do not act as though they have as good a grasp of
what they're doing as humans --they are using general learning techniques,
not skills specific to the medium.  Perhaps consequentally, chimps must
struggle just to maintain what tool-making knowledge they have.

When analyses from different modules can be applied at the same time, we
make analogies based on similarities in pattern.  If we apply social
knowledge to animals or landscape (or mythical entities), that's
anthropomorphism.  If we apply natural history knowledge to humans, that's
totemism.  Thus, early religion is a product of cognitive fluidity.

A literary theorist who has followed the progress of cognitive science
(and whose name and books I forget) proposes that our memory operates in
terms of literature -we remember a story, the detail of which are
'hyperlinked' to other skills and knowledges.  For example, when I think
about living in Austria, I remember practicing German, traveling, learning
Habsburg history, and so forth, as I remember specific events --the
weekend Sasha, Oliver and I went to Budapest, what we saw, what we said.
Thus, we have narative memory with oral history and pedagogy, and
considering how long humanity spent as foragers and huter-gatherers, it
should be no surprise what a hold mythology has on us.  The practice of
critical thinking, OTOH, is very much younger.

When we combine knowledge of dream lives with the practice of building
tools to alter our living condition, that's the beginning of art and
artisanry.  Hunting weapons are designed with specific animals involved,
clothing is made in response to weather conditions, designs are added
according to correspondences with mythology.

Consciousness, under this perview, is paying attention to what you're
doing --each tool, each story, each social exchange is important as it is
used or as it occurs.  Meaning has selective advantage.

Where _exactly_ does language fall into all this?  We're not sure.
Certainly humans have language, and other primates don't.  All chimp
language studies, though in the past interpreted differently, are now
taken as evidence that, while apes can use words, they do not have a
capacity for syntax.  Using words is great, but without syntax language
remains at the level of a 2-year-old human.  And certainly humans make
great use of technology while chimps do not.  Can we safely adduce
language as the primary memetic vector?   I certainly think so, but more
tool-using species would be great for comparison.

I think we can say that a species or genre of entities (AIs, Powers) needs
language or a functional equivilent in order to have memetic evolution.
Certainly a species that relied more on the individual's use of, say,
spatial or emotional understanding over inter-individual communication
would use very different approaches to memetic evolution.

These are the main sources I've using.

I think it was David Brin who invented this use in his Uplift Trilogy
of novels (Sundiver, Startide Rising, The Uplift War), which also
deals with some of its long-term consequences in an amusing way
("clans" of species, very old galactic civilizations, indentured
species etc).

An important moral point. Brin has several alien species in his books
who definitely are less than ideal patrons for their uplifted species,
and a very old system of indenture for uplifted species ("We made you
intelligent, so now you will serve us for a measly 10,000 years, and
then you are free.").

Ask me when I have uplifted myself :-)

[Causality Error 437: Message from future. Userid: Anders v45.53]:
You're right, the difference between an unaugmented human and a dog is
trivial compared to the difference between them and a God. However,
the difference between a cat and a God is trivially small. Could
somebody pass me the catnip? :-)

Well (little private theorising here) in the last century, when railroad
infrastruture was being contstructed, Europe was already a densly populated
area with a complex society. And most country's weren't truly democratic.
States were the only ones capable of undertaking such projects and so they
did. Also in Europe good infrastructure was vital for military reasons. In
the US there was no Royalty in the classic sense and lotsa more room for
anybody with a daring idea. All of this is just an 'educated guess' - maybe
there are historians on the list who can shed a light on this. They
question why states came into existance in the various form they did and
what caused the *differences* is relevant to anyone wishing to obsolete
them, know your enemy and all that ;-)

Possibly, but the number of citizens killed in that war might very well
have been larger, also you run the risk that one of 'em (say Stalin) wins
and takes over all of Europe. Had the allies been 3 weeks later, Stalin
would have rolled his tanks all the way to the Dutch-German border, or
maybe the Northsea.

Wiil a lock be enough? The only way to prevent criminals to enter my house
and loot the place (Yes, certain things I own are important to me) would be
to live in a fortress or to have some kind of weapon to discourage them. I
don't much like the first option and the alternative would lead to a
personal arms race between me and anybody that I think might want to hurt
me. I gues you know the argument... I see no way out of this.

I'm not even going to make a long case about such a society being quickly
conquered by a society that didn't abolish the cetralised state (and thus
has a large, heavily equipped army).

As I remember it, groups of people long ago tried to fix this problem by
forming clans and agreeing to not fight among themselves and spare there
energies for any external threat. Soon thereafter they made wall around
their encampments and called it a city. Then someone thought that they
would be even safer if they worked together with another city (of course if
the other city didn't agree battering rams became the tools of the argument
- I agree with you infofar that this is a far cry from perfect, political
solutions seldom are).

I think you'd want to abolish these groups and take your chances whereas
people like Joao Pedro and me what to extend the group to every human on
the planet and take our chances won't turn on us. We're both taking risks
(jump in here Joao, if you feel I'm misinterpreting your posts).

I guess we agree up to here.

I just don't see that states in general (altough most of them are rotten to
various extends) are so destructive compared to the expected performance of
alternatives. But maybe we speak from different perspectives and experiences.

This is correct, also: most revolutions aren not 'Spontanious Uprisings' by
'The People' but a planned coup d'etat organised by a small group of
individuals (Example: the takeover by Lenin in 1917, heavily sponsored by
the German war office who wanted to de-stabilize their Russian enemies on
Germany's Eastern front).

Problem remains how you can garuantee in any way that these institutions
don't become the instruments of dictators or some such (without any form of
democratic control). One of the oldest political problems, who will guard
us from our guardians? But I agree that it's always good to have a backups. 

This was educational, thank Anton,

Dear Alex,
 You are your list may be interested to learn that my attack on Clinton's
proposed ban on human cloning, WHO'S AFRAID OF HUMAN CLONING? is about to
come out. It may be found on Amazon.com  or ordered at a 20% prepublication
discount (off the $11 ppbk price) at 1-800-462-6420 from Rowman &
Littlefield publishers.

The front matter for the book (Preface, Contents, etc) is below:


Preface


	At the end of June 1997, I had the opportunity to meet the man who
cloned Dolly, Ian Wilmut, and to discuss with him some of the issues
discussed in this book. Although he does not agree with my position on
human cloning, I have been enriched by meeting Ian Wilmut.
	The opportunity to meet Dr. Wilmut came at the first major
conference on human cloning after the announcement of Dolly, and it was
organized in Washington, D.C.,--by French Anderson, Art Caplan, Alex
Capron, and Craig Venter-- to come just after the Report "Cloning Human
Beings" was issued by the National Advisory Bioethics Commission (NBAC).
Although I had already written over half of this book, this conference
provided a great chance to improve it by meeting the leading people in the
world in mammalian cloning, health law, genetic research, and bioethics. In
addition, there were trademark attorneys and venture capitalists, experts
in primate twinning, philosophy professors, and representatives of various
religions. In short, it promised to be one of those extraordinarily
exciting conferences in bioethics when the best people are pulled together
to discuss a new development.
	What was disappointing to me about the conference was that none of
the speakers was willing to defend human cloning in any way. It seems that
a consensus had developed among bioethicists, theologians, and scientists
that this was a side not to be defended. In one of my only comments at this
conference, I criticized the one-sidedness of the presentations and
suggested that professionalism in bioethics meant that each side had to be
defended with logic and passion, and that this had not been done. In reply,
I was told that "perhaps a consensus has developed that human cloning
should never be done and that is why only one side is represented."
	But how can a "consensus" develop when the arguments are never
made? When there is no discussion? No debate? I left disappointed.
	There will be other books that discuss the events that led up to
the cloning of Dolly and the reaction to that event.  Journalists will rush
to get books out, and there will be a lot of quotations in them from
various people about what human cloning means.
	In contrast, this book is unabashedly philosophical and one-sided.
I am making the case for human cloning first because there is a terrible
one-sidedness to the "discussion" so far and second, because I believe that
my position is true.

Acknowledgments

I owe many people for helping me to write this book and I wish to thank
them here: Bob Blaylock, an editor at the Birmingham News, for getting me
to write an Op-Ed on human cloning after the announcement of Dolly's birth;
Rosemarie Tong and Lance Stell, for inviting me to Davidson College, where
they and their students made several nice suggestions; microbiologist Susan
Self, for inviting me to discuss human cloning in her honors seminar at
UAB; the inaugural class of the executive masters' program in Health
Administration, especially John Comstock, MD; the classes of 1999 and 2000
of the UAB Medical School. Sarah Moyers at McGraw-Hill, for allowing me to
delay the 3rd edition of Classic Cases in Medical Ethics; James Pittman,
the former Dean of the UAB Medical School, for advice, encouragement, and a
constant stream of sources; Stephen Jay Gould, whose visit to UAB in May
and whose brief discussion of human cloning with me at dinner helped me to
understand the importance of conjoined twins in this debate; Harold
Kincaid, G. Lynn Stephens, Florence Siegal, and the perceptive students in
my senior seminar and bioethics classes in the first half of 1997.
Philosopher Richard Mohr made helpful suggestions about gay issues and
cloning.
	I also wish to thank the librarians at the Lister Hill Library for
Medical Sciences and at the Sterne Library, especially Diann Weatherly. The
financial support of the UAB Medical School allowed me to attend the first
conference on the ethics of mammalian cloning, for which I am grateful.
	Biologist Thanne Whibbels, Ona Marie Faye-Petersen of the
Anatomical Pathology department and Jerry Thompson of Medical Genetics, all
at UAB, reviewed various parts of the manuscript and answered my questions.
UAB biologist Ann Cusick delayed packing for her trip to Alaska to make
sure I understood embryology before she left. Mike Miller, while writing an
honors thesis with me on human cloning, helped proofread this manuscript
and gather sources for it.
	 I owe a huge debt to my next-door neighbor, James Rachels, who
read the manuscript and made many valuable suggestions about organization,
arguments, ethical theory, and strategy. I am deeply in debt for his help
and encouragement. Another colleague, Mary Whall, carefully read the entire
manuscript shortly before it went to press, performing in a superogatory
fashion and greatly improving the book. I am really in her debt,too. Robert
Angus, who teaches various genetics courses at UAB, read key parts of the
manuscript and corrected some of my mistakes (of course, what mistakes
remain are mine alone). Sociologist Jay Hughes and an anonymous reviewer
for Rowman & Littlefield were ideal, constructive, informative reviewers.
My wife Pat has also supported this book from the get-go, read and
commented on parts of it, and I also thank her for tolerating my absences
during the first three months when I was so immersed in the details of
cloning.
	Christa Davis Acampora, in her time as Philosophy Editor at Rowman
& Littlefield, and later her assistant, Robin Adler, were exceptionally
helpful and enthusiastic about this project.



Mary Had a Little Lamb

Mary had a little lamb, its fleece was slightly gray
It didn't' have a father, just some borrowed DNA

It sort of had a mother, though the ovum was on loan,
It was not so much a lambkin as a little lamby clone

And soon it had a fellow clone, and soon it had some more,
They followed her to school one day, all cramming through the door.

It made the children laugh and sing, the teachers found it droll,
There were too many lamby clones, for Mary to control.

No other could control the sheep, since the programs didn't vary
So the scientists resolved it all, by simply cloning Mary.

But now they feel quite sheepish, those scientists unwary,
One problem solved but what to do, with Mary, Mary, Mary.

	Even if what "the holly rollers" believe could some how turn
out to be right this is still true isn't it?  If "the spirit" or
whatever it is they believe in, knows something it must be in a
different "mental state" than if it didn't know that thing right?  It
may not be some material state to them, but this "mental" thing of
ours still must be able to be in various distinguishable states to
which we might refer non the less whatever it is right?  Wouldn't a
holy roler or whoever agree that they can be in a "state" of feeling

	Ah yes.  I would consider it very immoral for such a species
that uplifted me to not allow myself to adequately pay them back.  If
they didn't let me pay them back it would of corse condemn me to
eternal feelings of inadequacy, indebtedness, guilt... (i.e. hell).

	How many more years than 10,000 do you think it will take me
to pay back the debt I owe to each and every one of my ancestors which
are directly responsible for my very existence and all the others that
are responsible for getting us as close as we are to when uplifting
will be possible?  Of course including plenty of interest to make up
for the compounded time value of each of their contributions.

If the fundamental laws of physics turn out to be computable, then in 
some sense *everything* must be equivalent to a Turing machine; this 
would not mean, however, that there were no ambiguous terms. In 
particular, there may be multiple correct ways of modelling the human 
psyche on Turing machines, depending, e.g., on what level of 
abstraction we assume.

Now, the point is that only according to this sense of "concept" 
could they be said to be verbs, nouns, adjectives etc., as required 
by your previous assertion that you are an adjective. If by "concept" 
you meant "propositional thought", then if you were a collection of 
such "concepts" you could obviously not be (a collection) of 
adjectives!

The point that it is not a noun is no more important than the point 
that it is not an adjective or verb.

I was just noting that if we want to define what a human is it is 
not enough to define what a person is.

You misunderstand me. My point was the same as the one you are 
making, namely that it is possible to be a person without being 
human. I wasn't saying anything about what's great and what isn't.

> How is recognizing actor-action assumptions different
> from recognizing nouns and verbs?

Not at all; that's rather my point.  All languages I know
about (admittedly few) have such assumptions, and contrary
to your assertion, Lojban does not, though I have been
unsuccessful so far in showing that.

Ironically, you make a very good argument for UG, but not
by the content of your text; by the very fact that such
an intelligent mind still maps the Lojban concepts of
sumti and bridi onto the traditional actor/action form
of most languages--when no such mapping is necessary or
implied by the language in any way--demonstrates how
wired-in that structure is.  It may well be that I and
other Lojban speakers also internally make that mapping
when we produce sentences; but that is a function of how
our brains are wired, not something that actually exists
in the language itself.  In my more lucid moments, I can
see the difference, and I can construct bridi without
consciously mapping them to actions.  Maybe I'm just
fooling myself and my mind is doing it subconsciously.

Lojban sumti are pretty damned noun-like, and if pressed I
would have to admit that I really don't see a difference.
But bridi (predicates) /are not/ verbs; they do not have
anything at all in their nature that implies action, actors,
location in time, or any of the other trappings of verbness
from other languages.  If it were only the case that Lojban
was simpler at using words in multiple roles but still had
the same roles, you're right that that would be a minor
tweak, hardly worthy of study.  But that's not the case.
Lojban bridi really are different.

Your examples of languages without an explicitly spoken
copula are interesting, but in those languages the copula
is exceptional in that regard.  Many other verbs--even
those that express very non-verb-like things like spatial
relationships, properties, associations, etc., are still
expressed in a verb-like way (or else escape doing so by
using the copula): "I belong to this group" (as if that
were an action I'm taking, not a state of existence),
"This document supercedes that one" (as if the documents
were actor and acted upon), "I married Jane" (not referring
to the ceremony but the state), "Stones surround the fire"
(as if it were their choice). 

The verbness of some of these constructs is more apparent in
some languages than others (for example, in German or Russian
the nouns would be declined to label which thing the "actor"
in these sentences), but the languages involved have
structures designed for prototypical actor/action type verbs,
and that accommodate other ideas into that form.  Even when a
pseudo-verb like the copula is omitted, the language still
identifies who's doing the is-ing and who is is-ed (though
they may "mark" this with nothing more than word order.
Lojban regrettably has to put sumti [predicate-arguments]
into some order simply to serialize them, so there will be
some hidden implications of word order.  Theoretically, a
non-serial representation of Lojban without the problem
would be possible).

So while I agree that verbness may very well be built into
the way our brains work, I'm not ready to give up on a better
idea just yet, because I /can/ see the difference, and I
think humans (if not me, then maybe my children or a later
enhanced me) will be able to use this structure as easily as
I use verbs.  I'm not yet convinced that this isn't possible,
and I think it's important because language is by far the
single most important technology we have, and optimizing it
is likely to produce great benefit.

How?  Artsem a few chimps using some sperm.  It would seem extremely
simple and could be done without leaving much evidence behind.  It
could be done in the wild, which creates monitoring problems, but would
probably be much easier than incurring the wrath of preservationists.

However, just because there is genetic relatedness does not guarantee
the production of offspring.  And remember mules are sterile.  This
creates a problem if you want -- and I do! -- the uplift to be a fire and
forget sort of affair.  (No pun intended.:)

Hi peoples, 
I was just wondering if uplifting is the same as uploading
uploading to me seems to imply from human to human
What you guys are saying here is putting human intelligence into
more powerful albeit lower life forms ( get the best of both
worlds? )
Also how far have we gotten in this uplifting thing?
Seems pretty scary thinking about it,...if God decides that we
have gone to far and calls it quits on us .... : " Closing time ,
gentlemen ...  !!! " heh heh
Thanks for these interactions...

The secret of success is sincerity.  Once you can fake that
you've got it made.
--Jean Giraudoux

Of course, an uplifted species would have rights too, so your
intelligent guard dogs would want pay and maybe form unions
(packs?)..... One needn't uplift to the point of giving rights. 
That is another issue altogether.
Yes, but we should realize we are taking on a big responsibility by
even partial uplifting. There are plenty of people who think even
normal animals can have certain rights, and an uplifted animal
would likely have more rights.
It mgiht be, though my first step would be anything to increase
brain power in a meaningful way -- whether than be increasing
speed or firing, changes in connections or adding more neurons /
connections.
There are no significant differences in firing speed, neural
arborization and connectivity as far as I know between different
mammals. However, a colleauge pointed out to me that primiates
seems to have some very high-frequency cells that others lack
that may be important. But in general relative cortical size and
structure seems to be more important than the other properties.
Surgery is one route, though I'd be more into breeding and
controlling development hormonally and genetically.
Genetics is probably the way to go, if only to add control genes so
that we can make adult brains grow more or "debug" them, since we
want the species to have a heritable intelligence. Hormones and
surgery can only help individuals.
Increasing the amount of effort and time to growing a larger brain
in, say, octopi, might be a good start.  
it may be hard to work with octopi, since their brains are so
different from ours and we have more experience with mammal brains.
I also believe intelligence to be best measured by problem
solving abilities. Language would be a good way but not the only
way to implement this measurement.  (There are nonlinguistic
tests we can do to test uplifted organisms, such as some which
are already done with mice.
 Yes, but language is important in order to make the uplifted
animals able to communicate with each other, and hence spread
their own experiences and memes. It would likely accelerate
development just as it appears to have done in humans.
It strikes me that we really need to learn more about how we
became intelligent in order to be good at uplifting. But
uplifting also gives us valuable information on how we may have
evolved.

I hear from people who want to do business with mocrosoft, develop apps
for windows, etc. but are too cheap to get the full microsoft training
in developing apps for windows (so what if they charge a lot, its their
proprietary info, and they can charge whatever they want). Yet they have
the gall to complain that there are "undocumented" features that they
didn't know about. DUH. SOunds like a candidate for welfare...

maybe because IBM's systems management software was optimized for OS/2,

I agree this would be a haphazard approach and may not guarantee
uplifting characteristics, if successful at all.  But would it have any
scientific merit?  Perhaps some insight could be learned that would
prove beneficial for efforts to directly alter chimp DNA with specific
human genes.  It seems to me that chimpanzees would be the easiest
candidate for uplifting because of our genetic relatedness.  If the
ultimate goal of such research is to find ways for improving human
intelligence, then I think chimps are the best place to start.

Apparently this was a study lasting 12 years. Does that mean that
the basic idea here was known that long ago? We could do with an
information center that listed proposed therapies, along with
rankings from "Certainly wouldn't work" through "Speculative"
to "Repeatedly demonstrated to work".

It would also be interesting to know *which* neurons can
be replaced by the introduced cells. How do they pick their
targets? etc.

WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS NEWS?
*** Scientists in breakthrough to replace brain cells
British scientists have discovered a method of replacing damaged
brain cells which could offer hope to millions of sufferers of
neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
Scientists in London found that rats which suffered brain damage from
simulated heart attacks recovered completely if they were injected
with embryonic brain cells from mice. The implanted brain cells,
called neuroepithelial stem cells or NESCs, found their way to the
damaged brain cells and took over their functions. For the full text

Not that I see anyone really advocating this, but what exactly would this
procedure accomplish for us? And is it ethical?

My personal ethics can accomodate an uplift by way of cortical augmentation
or other such biological procedure, but only insofar as it provides empirical
data for use in similar procedures on humans. It seems unlikely that
crossbreeding a chimpanzee with a human will give us any information along
these lines and I have difficulty viewing this as uplifting a chimp, rather,
it seems more like retarding a human being on purpose, and for no valid
reason.

I think any serious proponents of this idea need to answer at least two
questions:

1. Will crossbreeding chimps and humans help us augment human beings?

and

2. Is there any other reason to do it?

Well, there's Oliver ...

Oliver was found in West Africa about thirty years ago and brought
to America.  His face is like a chimpanzee, but he walks erect.
I first heard of him in a segment on television about a year ago;
somebody is doing genetic tests to decide what his parents were.
I think it not unlikely that Oliver's mother was a chimpanzee
and his father a man.

(Anybody remember _Firstborn_, a miniseries about the child of a Mad
Scientist and a gorilla?  Who played the M.S., was it Charles Dance?)

E X T R O P Y   O N L I N E : BOOK REVIEWS

We're getting close to being ready to open Extropy Online to take over from
the print edition. While we're getting articles ready, I'd like to invite
subscribers to the Extropians email list to review books of interest to
Extropians. Below is a list of books I'd especially like to see reviewed.
But don't hesitate to suggest others.

Reviews may be anything from a brief notice of a couple of hundred words,
to a detailed analytical review of 2,000-3,000 words.

If you want to review one of these books but don't have a copy, we can
either lend you a copy or buy one for you.

REVIEWS OF THESE BOOKS WANTED:

Bart Kosko: Nanotime (a first novel from this extropian writer and
researcher known for his work in fuzzy control systems and neural networks.
Involves nanotechnology and uploading.)

Bart Kosko: Heaven in a Chip. (Collection of essays.)

Philip Kitcher: The Lives to Come: The Genetic Revolution and Human
Possibilities. (Prof.of Philosophy at UC San Diego.)

I don't know anything about Oliver, but it is very unlikely a
chimpanzee - human crossbreed would be viable. Just because they are
closely related to us doesn't mean they are compatible. 

Ah, while looking through the net for the correct karyotypes of chimps
and humans I found this:

http://texnews.com/news/chimp012697.html

Genetic testing show he's a chimp, not a human hybrid

	By JOHN MacCORMACK / San Antonio Express-News 

	SAN ANTONIO - Ending decades of speculation that he represents
	some kind of missing link, genetic testing has shown that
	Oliver the chimp is just that - a chimp.

	Oliver, now a resident of the Primarily Primates sanctuary in
	Boerne, walks upright like a human.  He was put on display
	throughout the world in the 1970s, touted as a mysterious
	man-ape perhaps the missing link.

	But it turns out the freak-show attraction is no freak, at
	least genetically.

	"He's not a human-chimp hybrid. His chromosome number is 48,
	which is a normal chimp karyotype," said Dr. David Ledbetter, a
	geneticist at the University of Chicago who analyzed Oliver's
	chromosomes.
	...

So much for that interbreeding.

Hi Anders, Thanks for the Definitions....

:->UPLIFT: To increase the intelligence and help develop a
culture of a previously non- or near-intelligent species. [From
the Uplift novels by David Brin]

Though one might ask, why one wants to change the species in the
first place, is there any practical benefits from that ?
Also if one uplifts human intelligence into dangerous animals ,...
WOW.., Won't that be something like Aliens Resurrection.....
I'd serious consider the re-percussions of such a move , or
hold a referrendum on this issue....?!

:->UPLOAD: (a) To transfer the consciousness and mental structure
of a person from a biological matrix to an electronic or
informationalmatrix ( this assumes that the strong AI postulate
holds). The term "Downloading" is also sometimes used, mainly to
denote transferring the mind to a slower or less spacious matrix.
(b) The resulting infomorph person. [The origin of the term is
uncertain, but obviously based on the computer technology term
'uploading' (loading data into a mainframe computer].

This makes more extropian sense, if you are to gather more
information about our universe ; explore it and colonize
it,....with self-replicating machines with Uploaded Human
Intelligence in them or many-times; manifold mega-human
intelligence onboard

I'd always thought of the current space probes like Cassini etc..
they are robots which have extended human senses ,...which
is like a piece of you and me out there in harsh environment,...
doing measurement and collecting data in our place,....

Uploaded Machines can do much much much more,....
That's great,... providing you have eliminated the destructive
tendencies / low-reptitian etc etc aspect of our Human makeup
Agreed? Or else we'll end up with a situation far worst than a
runaway Uplifting scenario...Any suggestions ? ....headways ?

:->In that case we'll start our own shop next door with
competitive prices.

In that case .... we weren't be around to open one though I wish
to be there at the open ceremony, any plans how to start one ?
I hope this is the humor section.....

Thanks for your feedback

  IAN: (1) There is proof that the military 
  lied about their activities on July 17,'96. 
  (2) There is proof the govt continues to lie
  about such. (3) There is proof that the FBI 
  has acted to cover up facts. (4) There is 
  photographic evidence of a military drone-
  type aerial device a few miles and moments 
  from the crash. (5) There are over 100 wit-
  nesses of a missile-like streak rising from 
  the ocean to impact TWA 800. (6) There is
  massive penetration deformation to the 
  exterior fuselage panels exceeding the 
  psi strength of a CFT explosion.

  Proof of deception, physical evidence of 
  external-projectile penetration, photo-
  graphic evidence of military activity, 
  over 100 harmonious eyewitness accounts 
  of projectile penetration... sorry to
  foil your ad hominem, but that's not 
  a "paranoid delusion." 

  Now you may be more impressed by claims
  of government officials that "We didn't
  do it," than you are with proofs and 
  overwhelming evidence, but I am not.

  The propensity for so many to be duped 
  by incredulous government claims... for 
  so many to fail to question the dictates 
  of authorities and define all that does 
  as "paranoid" is a sorry sight. Such is 
  what it takes to loose all freedoms.

  IAN: It seems that every media outlet 
  in the Western world can tell a lie, 
  and ostensibly any number of lies, 
  yet Abraham Moses Genen would only 
  see wrong in he who questioned the 
  authorities and thus was the target
  of such apparently justifed lies.

  The authorities and media are
  free to lie at will, but woe
  unto he who dares to 
  question the divine rights
  of authority. Except the edict
  of authority without question,
  or suffer the slings of ad hominem,
  ridicule and threats of violence. 
  Except their proclamations  without
  resistance or face the retribution
  of universal slander. Such is what
  it takes to ensure unswerving 
  obedience to authority.
  
  Abraham Moses Genen does not 
  need to question the FBI & CIA,
  for he has faith in them, I do not.

  Abraham Moses Genen needs to 
  ridicule as mentally deranged 
  he who questiond the FBI & CIA, 
  yet I do not need to impugn 
  the sanity of those who 
  do not question.

  If we shoot arrows at that which 
  we fear, then Abraham Moses Genen
  fears the questioning of authority.
  I believe that Extropians should not
  and do not fear but  P R O M O T E 
  the questioning of authority.

  My questioning of the investigation
  of TWA 800 by the authorities has 
  been careful and responsible, 
  reckless only to the degree 
  I failed to realize the 
  attacks and threats 
  I would suffer.

  Where has my contribution to the 
  process of questioning authority
  failed to meet high standards:
 
  http://www.erols.com/igoddard/journal.htm

  None can show an error, falsehood,
  or fabrication even as they sling
  mud and charges of fraud. These
  people assault not just myself,
  but the process of free inquiry.

I recently posted to sci.nanotech that I expect the first
assemblers within five years. I would now add to that, that
I think most of the foreseeable uses of nanotech (that don't 
require astronomical quantities of matter) will be possible 
within two years of the fabrication of assemblers. My reasons:

i) Once we have assemblers, we can build new designs very quickly -
thus accelerating the construction stage in the design-and-test 
cycle.  Furthermore, those who are trying to design, say, a 
new type of nanosystem will be able to use the Internet of five 
years' time as a collaborative medium. I doubt that we can imagine
very clearly just what possibilities will exist, but we have
every reason to believe they will be awesome. Think of shared
3D virtual design-spaces, and realtime webcrawling agents making
spontaneous comments.

ii) Once we have assemblers, new sorts of intracellular probes
should be possible; our knowledge of cellular workings should
quickly become just about complete. In particular, this will
be true of neurons.

One consequence: our ability to model biological systems will
be improved, and therefore our ability to extrapolate the
consequences of proposed interventions (e.g. therapies and
augmentations). Even something with the complexity of the
fabled "cell-repair machine" might become feasible very quickly.


2) The noetics revolution.

"Noetics" is my term for whatever is going to emerge from the
current interest in "consciousness studies". I am skeptical
that current cognitive models of consciousness are adequate,
and that a description of the brain in which the finest grain
is "neuron firing" or "neuron not firing" will *ever* do
justice to the phenomenon. If the current interest in "quantum
mind" theories fares any better, it would not surprise me if
it does so in conjunction with new interpretations of quantum 
theory which impute more structure to the world than the local
spatial relations which glue together the space-time manifold 
of pre-quantum physics. I imagine a mature theory of noetics
to resemble a combination of the most abstract mathematics
and philosophical phenomenology (with its odd analyses of
the structure of conscious experience), grounded in a postquantum
physics equipped with concepts like David Finkelstein's "qets"
("quantum sets").

If there is anything to these ideas, one should expect them
to bear fruit very soon after the arrival of assemblers, if
not before, since (as argued above) newly detailed knowledge
of the brain and its neurons should definitely tell us
whether there's quantum coherence happening in there, and
equally, the burgeoning development of quantum technology
(quantum computation, quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation)
should help us sort through the various interpretations
and postquantum theories.

If the truth turns out to be not so far removed from what
we already understand - i.e. information processing by
locally deterministic physical systems - we can still expect
that our theories of mind will have a new robustness and
conviction, thanks to the new biological data.


3) Mind acceleration.

Fast minds whose subjective time passes at a thousand or a
million times human speed are generally anticipated to be
a consequence of mind uploading. As a skeptic regarding
the completeness of functionalist theories of mind, I'm a
skeptic regarding our current ideas of mind uploading.
But this doesn't mean that such schemes can't work at all.
Suppose (for example) that the "mind" - the "thing that
is conscious" - consists of a set of quantum-entangled
electrons, spread across millions of neurons which belong 
to a particular phenotype optimized for quantum coherence,
and implementing some sort of quantum computer through
their superposed spin-flips. I see no reason why you
couldn't replace all the other neurons with nanocomputers,
in traditional Moravecian fashion, and then accelerate
the spin-flipping processes to the same degree, through
more fine-grained interventions at the quantum-chemical
level. This would be an incredible achievement by
contemporary standards, but it's not inconceivable.

So even if mind uploading doesn't work, mind acceleration
will still be a thinkable goal. I therefore predict that
that a "mind-acceleration underground" will emerge after
the assembler revolution, availing itself of the new
technology - and in all likelihood it *will* be an 
underground. If governments ban psychedelics and human
cloning, what will they think of a technology meant to 
accelerate mental processes by orders of magnitude?

I do have to mention what seems to me the main competition
in the race towards fast minds, and that is the "de novo"
fast mind - nonhuman, and produced by design and/or 
evolutionary engineering. Again, even if I'm right that
consciousness is not just neural information-processing,
there's no reason why artificial consciousness can't be
created in artificial systems with the right characteristics.
It may well be easier to start from scratch, than to
transform the human brain piecemeal into a faster medium.

One more comment. For those who always use as their mental
medium the fastest available, there may never be any
Singularity. Superintelligences - "Powers" - will be extremely
complex entities. Even if we had "wish machines" which could
grant any wish that was formulated with sufficient exactness,
I think we'd have trouble getting them to produce a
superintelligence, since our notions are not developed
enough to frame the wish precisely. If this is true, then
genuine intelligence increase (as opposed to simple
increase of basic speed) will be a slow affair, in the
subjective time of the entities at work on the problem.
The Singularity, according to this conception, will only
ever happen to those entities which miss out on mind
acceleration, and who consequently experience the changes
in subjectively brief time.


4) Picotechnology and space-time engineering

The possibility of "picotechnology" (technology on nuclear
and smaller scales) is sometimes rejected on the grounds
that, at least outside a neutron star, all you can do with
nucleons is to make the existing spectrum of nuclei. But I
don't think we can safely assume that if anything else
is possible, we'll have to go to space to obtain the
necessary conditions. Look at recent speculations on
"Q-balls", the hypothesized supersymmetric counterparts
to nucleons. Unlike quarks, "superquarks" are spin-zero
bosons and can form arbitrarily large aggregates. The Q-ball
theorists suggest that "the laws of physics" would be
different in their interior; more specifically, that
particle masses, lifetimes and interactions would be
different there. Or consider Bose-Einstein condensation.
Here is a way to get atoms to pile up on top of each other.
Could one use this to obtain densities approaching those
of exotic states of matter like neutronium? Finally,
consider that theorists of the inflationary universe
(Alan Guth and Andrei Linde) have said that in principle
one would need only a few kilograms of mass-energy to
create a "basement universe". (No doubt they would argue
that one would need a lot more, in order to concentrate
those kilograms of mass-energy appropriately. I can't
help but wonder whether the necessary apparatus really
could fit in a basement.)

There are any number of reasons for a fast-mind society
to explore such possibilities. One might hope to gain
space, energy, or computation from endlessly propagating
chains or networks of space-time bubbles, modelled
on the cosmology of self-reproducing universes that
has obtained attention recently. One might hope to
accelerate oneself to even greater speeds, perhaps as
far as one unit of "Planck time" per tick of the 
subjective clock (that would be a clock speed of about 
10^43 Hz). One might hope to make wormholes, link up
"known space" with them, and send them out into the
universe (or into newly fashioned universes) as
probes.

A notion that intrigues me: as subjective time speeds up,
subjective space expands. For a mind that is faster by
a factor of a thousand, Earth is a thousand times bigger,
in that it takes a thousand times longer to circumnavigate.
There might well be a practical argument for the creation
of wormholes here - to prevent the disintegration of
the network of accelerated minds from "subjective expansion".

Another option which may be significant in an era of
space-time engineering is out-and-out Separation:
migration into a designer universe, followed by the
severing of all ties with the parent universe.


5. "Post-spatial" existence

What are the limits? String theory and its successor
M theory already describe conditions under which the effective
dimensionality of spacetime changes, along with the inventory 
of fields and their interactions. Can we go further and
imagine "realms" which are not spaces at all? Think of the
variety of form possible amongst sets, or data structures.
What sort of structure could we choose to give to the world
we inhabit - or to the "phenomenal world" which we perceive?

Let me make more concrete the thinking behind this idea.
What if it were the case that spatial adjacency and
quantum entanglement were two instances of the same sort
of thing, namely an ultimate elementary relation of
"connectedness"? One might fashion something resembling a
wormhole by engineering an appropriate entanglement of
two physical systems; I gather that such a setup is a 
necessary precursor of quantum teleportation.

Once one starts thinking of the physical world as a sort 
of web of connected space-time points, it's a short step
to imagining webs without the gridlike structure of
space. But I don't know how to take this idea further
at present.

So I've heard.:)  Anyway, from what I've read/seen, their brains are divided up
a bit.  Prima facie, it would seem there are multiple lobes which are somewhat
independent -- which is akin to neural ganglia in insects.  (Still, the octupus'
brain is much larger and more complex and centralized than the insect one.
IF an insect's brain can really be compared here.  They are so decentralized
that their brains are more like merely the biggest ganglia -- not at all
like our
brains.)  So, in this case, the thing to do might be to increase the
connections 
between lobes.

Of course,  I am assuming here that more connections = smarts.

I've seen this on TV.  It does show that they have a lot of potential.  (I
wonder
how many humans would pass?:)  It would also be exciting to uplift them since
they are so different from us.  I imagine the ideas/experiences they/we could
share would be fantastic/near-mind-shattering to us/them.
 
Now the thing to do would be to find out how easy they are to breed, raise,
and handle.  I'm sure out of all the species mentioned thusfar, they will be
the cheapest/easiest to procure/maintain/uplift.

Also, we probably won't have to worry about meddling preservationist or
retro-thinker types.  In other words, we can meddle in peace.:)

Imagine: we can have a real transhuman project completed in less than a
decade -- not an armchair fantasy/mutual mental masturbation but the real
thing.

I too.  Imagine how many people wonder the same thing.  But such a shift of
perspective will require more than uplifting.  It will require the ability
to shift
one's mode of perception -- even conception, to a different set of parameters.

Current evidence does not seem to suggest this.  I think much of the ape
and dolphin language studies seem to show no unambiguous evidence of
intelligence.  In fact, the ambiguities in the data make me doubt whether
any of these supposedly intelligent organisms is anywhere near the level
of human awareness.

I too would like to know, though it is not the most important thing for me
vis a vis uplifting.  Instead, I hope the a nonhuman mind would be able
to help human ones jump to posthumanity.

I think the difference lies not in sensations or perceptions, but in higher
level stuff -- i.e., the ability to form concepts, introspect, and all that
stems from these.  I hate to sound like a hardcore Randian, but this
does seem to make sense.  It would seem apes, dogs, etc. can perceive
in much the same way we do -- albeit with a slightly different flavors of
sensing the world.  Still, they have percepts.  What is needed is to
decide if they can form concepts.  Linguistically, this amounts to more
than an ability to associate words (whether as sounds, pictures, finger
movement, odors, or what have you) and things or actions.  It would
be indicated by the so far only known to be human capacity to form
meaningful constructs from these and to combine them in new ways
as well as to understand them when they are so combined.

For now.:)  Anyway, I was merely trying to be cute.  I would not want to
make intelligent slaves anyway.  I would be pleased merely to see humans
uplift various other organisms just for the fun of it.

Onward and upliftwards!

Perhaps, but it would hard to convince a human to carry a half-chimp AND
perhaps the chimp canal would not be so small.  We need more data!

I think it might be better to stick with octopi for now.  Much cheaper to do,
and less likely, for most, to bring up moral/political qualms

Dear Tom, Max, fellow Extropians & Transhumanists of the World, Consious
Entities in all Dimensions,

Recently there has been some discussion about the name of the (still
unofficial - non-registered) Dutch Transhumanist Society "Excedo". Henri
Kluytmans, founding member, came up with this name several months ago and
we all agreed that it was right for us. Strickly speaking it's Latin but
Dutch people (most of whom have a reasonable command of English) would
associate it with words like 'Exceed' and 'Excel'. It also sound like
something fast and dynamic. We felt (and feel) this name would nicely
represent our >H idea's about the great possibilities we see in the (near)
future.

I want to be complete and try to show the entire discussion, my apologies
for the length of this post. This post should in no way be seen as an
attack on Tom personally, he has gone trough a lot of trouble for us and we
do appreciate all the attention he has given this issue, even if we do not
fully agree with him.  I am posting this because we want everybody involved
to know what is happening, possibly there's someone out there with a
brilliant idea that will solve this.

A few weeks ago Berrie, who has been working very hard on laying the
groundwork for a well-organized Dutch >H Ssociety, started an E-mail
correspondance with Tom about our name. Tom was worried that there might be
confusion between the Extropy Institute and Excedo because of the name.

So a discussion started between Excedo members and Tom about alternatives.
Various Latin/Greek combinations were considered (see matrix at bottom) but
in the end "Excedo" seemed to be just right for us. Berrie wrote to Tom and
Max:

Now we're scratching our heads:
Homo Excelsior is a European Transhumanist organisation/magazine that has
been around for quite some time, Our own Anders Sandberg is Vice-Chief
Editor. Why is their name no threat to the Extropy Institute we wonder? And
why has Tom only voiced his doubts about it now? "Excedo" was mentioned
several times over the last several months on the list?

We all thought this was a bit strange, especially when you comparing the
first mail by Tom with this later one. In the first mail he seems to be
worried that we won't get credit for our activities and later he 'accuses'
us (well, that's how it reads to us anyway) of trying to 'take a free ride'
on the good name of ExI.

Point is: ExI is not (yet) a 'household' name in Europe, certainly not in
Holland. We've been talking to al *lot* of people and no-one had ever heard
of the 'Extropy Institute'. Therefore (and no offence intended here)
there's not much 'free ride' to take at this moment. Transhumanism is just
awakening on this side of the Atlantic and we'd like to help make it
happen, knowing that it will be an uphill struggle.

Berrie, who has been working with heart and soul on this project and who
was the one most in favour of changing Excedo's name to something else if
this was good for transatlantic relations, took this quite personal:

 >-----------------------------------------------

The last paragraph may be the solution to all this, we're thinking and and
all ideas are welcome.

It is important at this point to state clearly that we did not, repeat
_not_, choose Excedo in relation to Extropy. We chose it in relation to
Transhumanism. That's why no one of us came up with the possible
missunderstanding between Extropy and Excedo. Again: there's no good name
to 'take a free ride on' or to damage because, save a few, no-one has ever
heard of ExI in the Netherlands and most of Europe (Americans should
appreciate that Europe is lagging several years when it comes to the
widespread use of E-mail and the WWW).

Becoming a part of of ExI is not a practical option for us at this time
because some of the Libertarian views expressed on the ExI-site would lead
to great PR-problems for us given the Dutch social-political arena. To make
a difference we have to be a part of society, not a fringe group. This
aside from the fact that they may conflict with some of our personal opinions.

This entire discussion could, of course, be very bad for the longterm
relationship between our embryonic organisation and ExI and we don't want
that. We want to be partners with ExI, work together, learn and make our
contributions to the prolifiration of >H memes. We realize that we're just
starting and would be honoured to be a 'younger brother' to ExI, but not a
little child that needs to be told how to behave. Mutual respect must be
the basis of any relationship.

It would be a great loss of opportunity not to connect the globally
dispersed drops of awakening Tranhumanism and create an ocean of ideas
(From Tom's mails I understand you already have a small lake ;-). We truly
want to work together with *all* transhumanist organisations around the
world, emphasizing the many values and goals we share. No-one will benefit
from dispersed splintergroups who squibble over what they should call
themselves and each other. We share so much, let's make that the basis of
our relationship.

  IAN: The FACT is that the major media
  will not present any of the evidence
  suggestive of Navy-culpability, but
  instead will only spread disinforma-
  tion about that evidence and those 
  presenting it. The FACT is the media
  will only favorably and even unquest-
  ioningly present the government's line.

  For a libertarian or Extropian to fail
  to see this and fail to be concerned
  is a tragedy. The de facto nationaliza-
  tion of the major media should be a 
  a topic of great concern. The means 
  by which it occurs, I believe, is 
  government contracting and economic
  benefits between the entities that 
  own major media establishments and
  the government, resulting in an eager-
  to-please-the-govt attitude on the 
  part of media establishments. The 
  solution to this massive problem is 
  to abolish govt monetary intake by 95%.

  While you and others have had your 
  heads in the sand, FLIR (Forward Look-
  ing Infrared) video has been leaked 
  via former CIA head Bill Colby (found 
  dead shortly thereafter), about which 
  multiple FLIR experts agree shows 
  automatic machine-gun fire going into
  the Branch Davidian community prior
  to and as the fire breaks out. This
  FLIR is filed in court, in the case
  against the govt for wrongful death.
  There is no question of authenticity.
  While the Washington Post did a very
  good report on the Waco FLIR, how many
  of the major media on TV have covered 
  this compelling evidence of FBI mass 
  murder? Zero. Is this not a problem?

  Is a media that refuses to disclose
  evidence that the FBI committed mass
  murder, but instead continues to pump
  out the FBI line serving the public
  interest? I'd say definitely NOT! The
  media serves only the govt's interest.
  This is a BIG problem! This is a sign
  post on the road to serfdom.

  The media and you may be able to heap 
  lie and ad hominem on those that have
  promoted the Navy-missile theory, but
  lies and ad hominem are not logical
  arguments, they are illogical and are
  prima facie evidence of an effort to 
  squash freedom of inquiry.

Dear Friends,

Just for your info: For more simplicity, I'll use the following name in my

Prof. Gomes   instead of    Prof. Jose Gomes Filho

So... we're the same person.

Yes, I have a picture here before me of an octopus brain. The general
layout looks a bit like two kidneys linked with a long and not very
thick cord, with a tangle of ganglia in the middle. Very different
from our brain, yet still with some similarities. According to the
book (Introduction to Neurobiology by Heinrich Reichert) they have
10^8 neurons (this is likely the genus octopus).

Not certain, but it might be useful to try. I would also add some
extra lobes for high level integration, maybe even a computer-brain
interface (why not start by giving them net access? talk.soc.octopi,
anyone?)

They have an excellent visual system and a beautiful texture-shifting
capability. I think they would develop some very interesting art.

I understand Tom's concern.

Extropians like to put "ex" infront of many words.

No one owns the letters "ex".

No one owns meaning of the letters "ex".

There are many people named John Smith 
who are not being sued for identity theft.

"Extropy" and "Excedo"
are even less similar than elements and elevators 
but not many people can stand on any pile of atoms 
and say, "Second floor please." without looking like a fool.

This argument is an 
Exceedingly 
Excellent 
Example of an
Excrutiatingly 
Excessive and 
Exaggerated 
Exchange of
Examinated 
Excrement without

I have time only to make one point before I have to leave today to teach
all day and evening. I'm puzzled that Arjen has posted several private
mails without, so far as I can tell, having asked the writers' permission.
I'll say no more about that, since it may be that Arjen did in fact ask
permissions to publically post private mail.

Okay: You're off by several orders of magnitude. I have made numerous
appearances on television, in magazines and newspapers, and on radio
explaining transhumanism and the role of Extropy Institute in Europe. I've
appeared on TV in your own country, the Netherlands, and have spoken before
a couple of hundred people in Amsterdam. Aside from the growing number we
are hearing of in Europe via the Net, just this year I have appeared in
major newspapers and magazines in Germany (see a recent issue of c't for
example), as well as the German book Cyberland by Gundolf Freyermuth which
devotes a long chapter based on extropians. While at Ars Electronica in
Austria, I did several interviews for television and newspapers. While in
Madrid, I did interviews for several TV shows, as well as for publications
including El Pais -- the major newspaper based in Madrid. I have explained
extropian ideas in the media in Italy, Switzerland, France, Spain, Austria,
Holland, England, and other countries.

Extropy Institute has been receiving a growing amount of interest from
Europe. That's why we recently set up a European email list. There is also
a feature on European extropians in the Exponent newsletter that's going in
the mail in a few days.

More later...

Hello, Sofia.

No. My first name is Jose.
Nevertheless I am know as Prof. Gomes: I teach since was 19.
Anyway, I am candidate to State Deputy here in Brazil, and I am using the

If MS has /actually/ done so many things you dislike already,
then why must you tolerate such obvious lies?  It reduces your
credibility on the real issues to zero, as does quoting
opinion pieces from news reporters without any facts in them.

According to a science film I saw in high school, such an experiment
was performed back in the eugenics days.  The embryos were nonviable
and died in the second month.

 I've seen this on TV.  It does show that they have a lot of potential.  (I
 wonder
 how many humans would pass?:)  It would also be exciting to uplift them

Octopi also have a very advanced/evolved communication system, lighting up

An update on my little book review project:

I've skimmed through most of the recent longivity books, and it seems 
that the two of most interest to Extropians are the _Brain Longivity_ 
book I mentioned, and the updated version of the online Longivity 
Manual.  But I don't know if I can make the deadline for this issue, 
because I'm running around doing job interviews all this week.  What 
is the frequency of the issues?  I could probably do an extended 
review for the next one.  Please let me know!

Sounds odd. Chimpanzees have the wrong number of chromosomes and
likely enough translocated genes to mess up recombination, so I would
expect the embryonal cells to be non-viable and division to stop much
earlier (although I might be wrong, developmental genetics isn't my
forte). It does sound a bit like anti-eugenics propaganda (although I
would be surprised if nobody has ever tried it).

In the Sunday June 8, 1991 issue of the Chicago Tribune on page A16
(continued from A1) an
article called "New Hope for the Paralyzed" by Ronald Kotulak he states:

    "The first evidence that spinal chord nerves can regenerate across a
big gap was reported last
year by scientists at Sweden's Karolinska Institute.
    "After severing spinal chords in rats, creating a gap about
one-fifth of an inch long, scientists glued
a bridge across the gap using nerves from the animals' chests
    "A year later the rats regained some function of their rear limbs
and made walking  motions
Microscopic examination  revealed that some of the severed spinal chord
neurons had grown over
the bridge and reconnected to the nerves controlling the hind limbs.
    " 'I think this paper shows not only that regeneration is possible
but it also shows that the task will
be easier than we ever anticipated'  [Dr.Wise] Young concluded in an
editorial in the journal
Science. [Dr. Wise Young  is a neuroscientist at New York University
Medical Center]

Can you locate the citation of the published scientific journal article
that describes this
experiment and its results/conclusions?  Any help would be greatly
appreciated.  I already tried
the CD-ROM version of Medline, an IBIS database search and a MetaCrawler
search.  No luck.

As I explained Tom, I would like to stay out the discussion for a
while to see what others think. However I feel to make sure that 
this statement above doesn't add more confusion, then there already
is. I would like to say this: I told Tom several times I copied people
on this. By doing this I made it public ! I feel on this particular
issue It was the right thing to do. However, for future conversation, 
I can asure you, that all mail will be kept private. If Tom feels
I did something "low" by sharing this information. I will apologize
for this........ We copied so many people on
this, that I think a lot of you were allready aware of this "problem"
If I totaly miss judged this particular situation, please let me know.
There was Honestly no intention to do any harm to the
reputation of Tom. Our personal dispute was based on my emotions
and should be in no way hold against Tom or Extropy.

One thing I would like to say: I hope we can get this "history"
factfile out very soon, so that we "or me personal as, let's say
relative newbie" can prevent further miss comunication.

Best regards,

Berrie

Maybe I should never have posted the MS-thing in the first place, but at
the time I thought it was not total bull and a lot of fun besides (but
taste in humor differ).

In forming my opinions I must rely on others in some way for most subjects,
because of limited knowledge and presence in space/time. So I must evaluate
who to believe, who has the best story? What sounds logical/real? I've
leared the hard way (also on this list as Lee so eloquently reminded me)
that info, on the web espescially, should be regarded with suspicion.

Nonetheless: I want to have an opinion about many things, more things than
I have time reading-up about. The overwhelmingly large majority of
IT-proffesionals I've talked too (and I talking to a lot both in- and
outside IBM) is of the opinion that MS-products are primarily good for the
Stock-value of MS. Add to that my own negative expriences with the 85
different flavours of Windows. Add to that the fact that on the web one can
find score's of 'I hate windows' 'MS-sucks' and 'Resistance is Futile, you
will pay your upgrade' pages and this person is becoming convinced that his
own feelings about Bill-ware are more or less correct.

It's a bit like an other thread. Who go you believe? The FBI or Ian Goddard?
The PR-department of a large company that stands to lose a lot of cash or
my collegues-around-the-world and friends whom I respect and who's
knowledge I admire? Not a difficult choice really.

I'm reading-up on the TWA-800 thing, my picture is still very incomplete
but so far I'm not inclined to believe the FBI-story. Which leaves me... 
This list will make a libertarian out of me yet ;-)

Good questions. You may have noted that it took me a while to answer
(I have piles of work), but it was worth it since I actually have some
real facts now. As a neuroscientist it is easy for me to give vague
answers about plasticity, but when I began to think about it things
became much harder.

Anyway, I listened to Michael Merzenich yesterday when he received an
award from the Stockholm Physiology Society. He talked about his
famous experiments on monkey sensory cortex, where he managed to
change the somatotopic map (the map between the skin of the hand and
the cerebral cortex) through training, and even blur the areas through
overtraining. By training something very hard, you can really expand a
sub-area at the expense of neighboring areas. Based on this research
he then began to study how to train children with language problems
and dyslexia, with some impressive results (his group was able to
bring even quite autistic children into the normal statistical
range). Furthermore, he appeared to be able to change some of the time
constants of their hearing, which in itself is an amazing fact. 

What really makes the cortex plastic seems to be highly stereotyped
movements combined with attention - acetylcholine is likely
involved. Tension, high blood pressure and emotion can increase the
acetylcholine release. The problem here is that overtraining is in
general not something you want, it makes the brain *less* flexible and
more stereotyped, even if you become brilliant at certain
things. Still, it can be useful to "reformat" some cortex.

Some learning factors which are likely useful:

* Strong attention, high motivation
* Repetition
* Progressive training (it constantly becomes more challenging,
	without becoming too challenging).
* Adaptive and customized training (it adapts to your performance)
* For each training session at each difficulty level, continue to
	train until the results are satisfactory.

I don't know about calcium, but I guess it is not a good idea to have
too much or too little during training.

What I'm researching :-) You are right, short-term memory is likely so
quick and plastic that it cannot hold much, while mid-term memory is
the parts of the brain that can keep an impression for a longer time
(say a few hours) until it can be encoded in permanent long term
memory. It seems that the medial temporal lobe (the hippocampus and
surrounding cortex) have this function.

I don't think it can get more sensitive unless you start adding
antennas (not likely a good idea) or instruments (like a radio).

Another very good question. We don't know yet, but it seems to involve
restructuring of the cell, the branching of new synapses and
production of new proteins.

It is likely in the brain, and definitely occurs in some other tissues
(fibroblasts are the most notable).

Maybe. There are neurotrophic factors that drift around, the diffuse
volume conduction of some chemicals which may or may not be useful,
and the retogerade messengers like nitrogen oxide which I don't really
understand. I think there is a complex chemical dialogue going on
around every neuron.

> 4- On average, what direction do axons point?

Depends on where you are. In the brain, most seem to project either up
or down to the thalamus, and locally perpendicular to the cerebral
folds and ridges, or connect remote cortical areas with long, c-shaped
bundles. But this is different in different parts of the brain. Some
form diffuse networks, others move straight to their destinations.

> What happens during adaptation?

A lot, I simply cannot give you a short answer. Try looking at Kandel
et al, the memory chapter has IMHO an excellent overview.

Sometimes. Usually it is the death cry of a single auditory
neuron. Some neurons just fire spikes at random or due to random
excitations in their environment.

Discuss it with Max.  Discuss it in a reasonable manner.  Do not go into the
discussion with preconceived notions.  Do go into the discussion with
flexibility.

Why?  Because Max is extremely fair-minded.  He has an innate psychological
quality of honesty and cooperation. He has the keen intellectual ability to
carefully look at a full picture and long range direction.

He is someone you would want on your team.

I understand.  It was merely a suggestion.  Recall my initial post.
Some people outside this list agree with you -- viz., that uplifting
is akin to trapping a human mind in a nonhuman (less than
human?) body.  However, would you judge it the same if, say,
we found a genetic sequence which would increase intelligence
in chimps, would it be wrong to insert it in them?  If not, imagine
that this sequence is from a human.  Is it still not wrong to inset
it?  If not, imagine (I know this is getting repetitive:) it is a
substantial amount of human genes and the method of
insertion is artsem.  Is it still not wrong?  At what point did the
experiment become wrong and why?  What standard do we
use to judge?

>>I think any serious proponents of this idea need to answer at least two
>>questions:

I believe my initial post answers this question.  The data from it will
also give us more parameters on just how far intelligence can be
stretched inside the biotic realm.

>>2. Is there any other reason to do it?

I believe my initial post answers this one too.  However, I think it
better to try uplifting with other species and not use crossbreeding.

Later!

Hey, I was only kidding.  Let's say we uplifted dogs and they generally
went into the home and business security field as workers.  So?  Let
them unionize.  If they can do the job better -- more economically
efficiently: the right level of service for cost -- than other available
alternatives, why would this be so bad?

I'm not sure on the animal rights issue.  I think an uplifted organism,
if
it has a near human level of intelligence should enjoy the same rights
-- individual natural rights in the Lockean-Randian sense, not
collective
or welfare rights a la Rawls or Rousseau -- as humans.  I find nothing
unappealing about that.  It might also serve as a living lesson for
those
ethnocentrists who seek to elevate irrelevant differences, such as
appearance, language or national heritage, to the status of moral and
political trump cards.

And I would be the first to heartily greet an upliftee to this
discussion 
list.:)

I'm not sure.  I've heard there are measurable difference between firing

But their development cycles are shorter than many other candidates.
This would mean more wetware experiments can be done in the same
amount of time.  (Of course, if we come to a better understanding of
the genetics involved, computer simulations might be the way to go...)

I agree, but do not want to get bogged down in a we-must-have-them-
talking-English-with-a-Brooklyn-accent-or-we've-failed attitude.  Also,
it might be easier to increase intelligence overall and worry about
language later.  Or the two might be related in such a way that
upgrading one ability feeds into the other.

It would nice to learn how we evolved, but I don't think it is necessary
to achieve uplifting or augmentation.  Surely, it would help, but one
need not know how the solar system was formed to land on the moon.

Extra lobes or integrating lobes?  Why not try both?

As for computer interface, I say let's keep it simple at first.

So far, no one on this list has suggested any dangerous animals.  I

I'm no historian, though I doubt this tale.  My guess is the rails,
roads,
etc. could have been privately built, but that it was easier to steal
money (i.e., tax) from other people than to raise it privately and the
relevant industries were politically connected.  Also, nationalism was
beginning to rear its head at the time, and the idea of protecting
industries had never really been dislodged.

Let's not get too caught up in this.  If the West, including the US
govern-
ment, had not given aid -- food and money -- to the Soviets during the
1920s or loans to the German government during the same period, the
chances of WW2 would have been lessened.  The chances of the
Soviets staying in power, or of extending that power to Central Asia --
after the Russian Civil War, they reconsolidated the Central Asian
provinces -- would have been slim.

If this arms race scenario is valid, why don't countries do it all the time?  
And when they do, why do they usually fail?  The Soviets, e.g., armed
themselves to the teeth, and by doing so, set off a balancing reaction
which basically isolated them.  They were surrounded by enemies
until the end -- from Western Europe to Turkey to China.  Relevant
reading here is _The Origins of Alliances_ by Steven M. Walt.

Actually, I think the centralized state, and not local law enforcement,
is the biggest problem for an anarcho-capitalist society.  Of course, my
solution is space colonization.  If we can expand away from states at
the speed of technology, then they might become irrelevant.

I don't recall this happening to form any modern nation state.  The
history of states seems to reduce to the history of states fighting
or conquering each other.

If there are enough groups, then the chances of a planet-wide coalition
forming to destroy you and me are even less than, say, Saddam
Hussein sending troops to conquer California.

Was it two anarchocapitalist protection agencies which invaded Poland
in 1939?  Was it a group of libertarians who oppressed Ireland for
centuries?  And which private group tried to exterminate the Armenians
less than a hundred years ago?  (These are just a few examples, and
they aren't even the worst.  Even the best of states is pretty bad.
just do't pay your taxes, flaunt it, and find out.)

Democracy is dictatorship of the majority.

Anders? Any other neurologist in the house? How realistic is this?
My mother is suffering from Parkinsons disease (diagnosed in '84) and 8
weeks ago she had a pallidotomy, a surgical procedure were a number of
disfunctional braincells are killed to keep some of the wordt symptoms at
bay (trembling, swaying with arms and legs, variations in body
temperature). Thing are a *lot* better now but it's no cure, we're just
fighting symptoms.

I've heard of this treatement before but as I understood it didn't look too
good then, long term project. What's the chance that this leads to
practical application within 7-10 years?

Any info greatly appreciated (by the whole family).
greetings,
Arjen The Humble

I guess I could ask you how how one guides wilderniss? Because, then (by
defenition) it ain't wild anymore ;-).
One (or two) lead(s) 6-10 people onto a mountian and, with some luck, the
same number off again with zero change in the number of live extremities
and bones-in-body. So far so good.

As  I recall, Oliver was a bonobo chimp. Bonobo's can walk erect much
better than any other non-human, and oliver might simply have been a
rather odd but talented bonobo, possibly a mutant. Since chimps share
98% of our DNA, its logical that a few human-like mutations to the
remaining percentage would produce noticable results.

Assuming that all other aspects of the system meet the requirements of the
prize, including
placement of the payload in space within 3 years, then Dr. Wenger's system
would indeed
be eligible to compete in the $250K prize. Of course, it would cost him
about a gazillion dollars
to build his system in the next 3 years, and government money can't be used
to fund the development
of competing systems for the prize, so good luck.

Let us know when you are ready to integrate our payload into your system!

What makes this dubious is that in England the canals and railroads

by Nonconformists (non-Anglicans), who suffered certain legal
disabilities (they couldn't have government jobs, for instance)
until sometime in the 19C.

You seem to assume that your opponents are willing to spend unlimited
effort and resources to get at you.  In fact, your computer and your
goldfish are worth only a finite amount, and probably far less to
anyone else than to you.

I remember a meal in a restaurant somewhere, when a policeman in the
next booth told his friends (loudly and repeatedly), "Locks are not
meant to stop thieves: locks are to keep honest people honest," i.e.
to remove temptation.  I wouldn't go that far (how would I know, I'm
not in the crime business!); it seems to me if you do *anything* to
make the burglar's job more difficult, you reduce the number of attempts.
If the burglar needs costly high-tech equipment to get into your
house, where's his profit?

As for the arms race, experience seems to suggest otherwise.  About
a million times a year, an American shows a gun to a potential attacker,
and the attacker flees.  Doesn't have to be a big fancy gun, any gun
will do.

One answer is to have three or more sets of guardians, none of whom has

division of powers (legislative, executive, judicial) was intended to
accomplish that, but in practice they all depend so much on each other
that they cannot be called independent - they're not parallel guardians,
they're elements of the same guardian.  I don't know just how to beat
that problem.

        Seconded.  When an organization such as this is first started, the
thing it needs more than anything else is connections.  Open doors are far
more inviting than closed ones, and both Max and Tom obviously want the
door open.  However, as Tom iterated in his private posts to Berrie, the
name "Excedo" is too easily associated with Extropy Institute...a
flourishing organization that has been active for a decade.  Even if
~Excedo's intentions for the name have been misunderstood, few can argue
against the similarities in both name and intended ideals.  
        The problem with these similarities have potential drawbacks for
both sides.  For ~Excedo, one of the problems that could be encountered is
one of having to explain to all interested parties that there is truly *no*
association between Extropy and ~Excedo; additionally, if people assume
(without actually knowing) that there is some association, they could have
overly high expectations for ~Excedo.  Perhaps more importantly is the
potential drawback for ExI.  If ~Excedo generates *any* non-extropic ideas
whatsoever (and no-one knows as of yet how extropic ~Excedo's views are),
it could mislead people (through assumptional association) into thinking
that ~Excedo ideals are the same as Extropian ideals.  Overall, the
potential confusion isn't necessary.

I'm curious as to the actual link betwen speed of thought and perception
of time.  Is there any reason to believe that the two are inexorably
linked as you seem to suggest above?  Does thinking more quickly
actually cause one's perception of time to slow down?  If anything, I've
found the opposite to be true: having little to think about/do causes my
experience of time to slow, while when my mind is particularly engaged,
time seems to fly by.  I understand that my mental processes are not
physically accelerated/decelerated in these varying states of mind.
However it's clear that we can experience altered perceptions of time
based on our thought processes, mental activity, drug use and
anticipation.  Comments?

I just saw a show on the Discovery channel on octopi. They showed that
wild octopi are freindly and even gregarious with divers. Squid, however
are rather predatory and only see a diver as another meal to drag down
to the depths. Octopi apparently need to keep their brains segmented so
they can squeeze through tight spots. I think that this is probably the
major stumbling block to their natural evolution toward greater
intelligence. While their coral habitat enabled them to develop
excellent spatial problem solving skills, their need to squeeze through
spaces is an environmental limitation on further brain integration.
Anyone developing greater intelligence in octopi would need to teach
them tool using strategies for fishing to overcome the expected mobility
reduction a larger more integrated brain would entail. Possibly weaving
nets with seaweed. squeezing a big brain through a small space would
probably cause as much brain damage as a heavy weight boxing match.

The jury is still out on whether chimps can actually use sign in more
than a Pavlovian-Skinnerian associative way.  However, I've no
problem with people doing this.  How many chimps have already
been experimented with?  I doubt the sample is very large due to
the labor and time involved.

I agree, but no one has argued for confining communication to audio.
And we are definitely not communicating that way now!:)

This brings us to the sticky issue of what language is.  I don't
want to start a thread on that, but I believe Karl Popper
postulated three levels of language, the lower ones being
subsumed under the higher ones.  The lowest is mere
expression of internal emotional states, like growling when
angry (or, for humans, cursing:).  The next is descriptive, i.e.,
relaying information, such as saying "I am seated in front of
my computer."  The highest is argumentative, which 
involves the ability to reason, doubt, and the like, e.g.,
debating the merits of Popper's view of language.  (Can
there be other levels?  Are the levels themselves more
internally differentiable?)

As a working theory, it seems to show how nonhuman animals
are so different from humans.  They generally are all on level one.
It might be that chimps and dolphins have made it to level two.
So far, only humans are on level three.  (Where do bees fit in?)

Speaking for myself,

Daniel Ust

I don't know exactly how, but restoring the global temperature

Hey, what about make the Rift Valley a little wider where it meets the Red Sea?
This would be relavitely easy -- say, a few small conventional explosions -- and
would create an inland swamp where there is no desert.  It merits looking into.

Of course, the main reason for much hardship in the region in not the desert
conditions, but the forms of government -- ususally very anti-freedom -- there.

Yours,

Daniel Ust

We do not agree with it but we do _respect_ his concern, otherwise we would

I hope not, there's only 24 other letters.

Unless it is an internationally registered trademark (I think).
Tom suggested AltaVita for us, nice name (really!) but we could be mistaken
for a famous search-engine (would be good to get the hit-rate up though, al
those people making a mistake typing...)

If somebody owns 'Ex', you just went broke.

I can only hope that Exxon has nore inadvertend oilspills, that would ve
very bad for all of us wouldn't it? ;-)

Mike, thanks for putting the importance of this (or lack thereof) in
perspective, maybe we got carried away a little... you know youthful
enthousiasm and all that ;-). I won't say 'they started it' because if
'they' did, we allowed it to continue which is just as bad.

That's a big risk we'd be taking with the only planet we have. The global
climate system is, at this point, complexety beyond our comprehension (many
factors, some not understood, relating in non-linear ways) and should
consequently be treated with greatest possible care.

 >> : -- which would make

And if the prairie does not some back, the new weather patterns are even
more arid and the surface temperature goes up by 2 degrees in the sahara
those people will be in eeven greater trouble. I guess we need big AI's to
help us understand the cause-effect relations in the global climate system,
untill then: tread carefully.

Arjen

Extropy Institute (ExI) has for years used such names as "ExI", "Extropy,"
"Extropians," "Extro," and "Exponent."  We have invested a lot of hard work
and hard cash into developing labels that the public will recognize and
associate with high quality transhumanist thinking and networking.  Our good
names represent just about the only assets that we have and serve as
absolutely vital tools for our mission.

Naturally, we want to prevent people from confusing other transhumanist
projects with our own, just as other people do not want ExI to mistakenly get
credit for their work.  Clear labels benefit all of us.  I don't think that
anyone would dispute that ExI would have every right to object to another
transhumanist group using "Extropy" or closely related names such as
"Ekstropy" or "Expro."

My (until now, private) discussions with Berrie, Arjen, and others of the
Dutch group have focused on whether or not "Excedo" is likely to confuse
newbies about the affiliation of that group with ExI, and how to avoid such
confusion.  I have worked hard with Berrie to come up with alternative
labels; there is, after all, no shortage of good words out there that do
*not* risk creating confusion!  And any new group that claims to offer
innovative thinking should, I think, want a very distinctive and original
name.

Berrie and I have had cordial, but thus far inconclusive, discussions.  He
and his friends evince good intentions, so I remain optimistic that we can
work out a suitable compromise.  Those of you new to this issue should keep
in mind that you may lack essential details; this is a complicated issue (and
should have remained, at least for now, a private one).  I do not have the
time or inclination to educate everyone about what constitutes the law,
custom, and just plain old common courtesy in matters of labelling, but I do
hope that this email has clarified things a bit.

Perhaps some of you could help Berrie and his colleagues come up with
alternative names!  I've had fun cooking up words like "Acceleratism,"
"Altalibre," and "Ultravita," but, alas, have yet to offer him a winning
label.

Excellent explication of the exposition to date.

Don't get me wrong: as hard as I fight so-called "intellectual

I didn't get this Carl Feynman's e-mail for some reason, so I'll answer
your question here: No.  I did not see it hit.  What I say was two streams
of brightly glowing material (looked like very large roman candles
slowly moving across the sky)  Once the lights disappeared behind the
trees, there were numerous sounds of intense, low-frequency thunder (note,
there were no clouds in the sky)  I'm thinking this was either impact, or
maybe a sonic boom??? (is this possible?)

This would make sense, what I saw was definitely heading east.

It was a truly amazing sight first-person.  At first, I thought I had just
experience of the greatest meteor showers ever.  It was a great spectacle
no matter what the lights were composed of.

CNN (11/20/97):

   In the year 2014[?], Social 
   Security will start paying 
   out more than it takes in. 

Rather than saying SSI will be on a endless 
slide into bankruptcy, CNN's wording serves 
not to signal SSI doom but serves as a sol-
icitation for more funding. Then they inter-
viewed half-a-dozen people singing praises 
of SSI... an institution of human dignity.
I guess bankruptcy is the path to glory.

There is a universal one-to-one correlation 
with what the federal gov't wants and what 
CNN et al dish out to the American people. 
Why bother nationalizing the mass media?

Serfs were in debt slavery. As the cost of
gov't "benefits" begin to exceed the ability
of The People to pay for them, the people 
will become serfs... by definition. This
is the path that's being prepared.

Our only hope is that technological advance 
and access can outpace the growth of gov't
with its ever-growing "collective debt."

To show cross-breeding of chimps and humans can be done? If so, you're right, it

No, no. I'm not talking about uplifting, which I find to be pretty fascinating.
I'm talking about a mere cross-breed of chimp and human. What would be the purpose
other than to show that a cross-breed is possible?

(I'll refrain from using "wrong.")

Inserting a genetic sequence to increase chimp intelligence is not unethical in my
view.

It's still not unethical.

Now it is unethical.

You're not inserting anything, except in a ribald, figurative sense.

Inserting a sequence of human genes to improve an animal is much different than
the wholesale blending of human genes with chimpanzee genes to make some new,
still not human-equivalent, species of animal. It's not human, and it's not a
chimp. Sure it's still a primate, but if the only goal is merely a smarter primate
-- well, just look in the mirror. With uplifting, our goal is not merely a smarter
primate, but specifically, a smarter chimp. Artifical insemination (I'm assuming
this is what "artsem" means) does not meet this goal, and we learn nothing about
how to augment human beings. In short, uplifting a chimp to human intelligence is
okay by me because it's still a chimp -- and it's a better chimp by my standard
(smarter = better) -- and we gain valuable empirical data for use in augmenting
ourselves. Mere cross-breeding is not the same as uplifting.

>  At what point did the
> experiment become wrong

The experiment became unethical at the exact moment when your goal went from
"let's make a chimp smarter" to "let's see if this can be done."

> and why?

The belief that "anything that can be done should be done" is the exact reason why
ethical systems develop in the first place. We are not intelligent enough to know
what is objectively good or objectively bad in every situation. Given this, we
also take prima facie that "not everything that can be done, should be done." In
addition, we don't even necessarily need to so somethings to know they can be
done. At first, I was asking what other purpose this experiment could have, given
that I wasn't entirely certain if it was ethical or not. Since the only other
purpose you offered was "can be done, should be done," I regard this as without
ethic, which means for me, unethical.

>  What standard do we
> use to judge?

The question is better put, what standard do *you* use to judge? Moral relativism
is serving me well these days...

But scientists do have ethical guidelines for themselves. Unfortunately, they
don't help much when you're stuck in the middle of a gray area.

If your above suggestion is true (not just hand-waving), then it may be a valid
reason. I don't want to argue the merits, but suffice it to say, if I were
deciding funding, I'd need some pretty good evidence.

The problem is that a short development cycle also may limit
intelligence. Humans have the longest childhood of all animals
(measured as the fraction of normal adult lifespan in the wild),
likely because we need a lot of time to leanr and absorb our culture's
memes. Neotony may be the way to go for uplift, but that would slow it
down a lot.

I never said we needed *human* language. If we could make the octopi
communicate better with skin color, it would be a great step. The idea
is that if different individuals can communicate, then they can also
learn more from each other and we get more help in the uplift process
by the uplifted species itself, since it will begin to expand its
memetic niche.

OK, now the neutral Swede is in this debate too.  I have great
sympathy with all sides. :-)

I think Excedo is a good name, no doubt about it. The initial Ex- fits
in well with the transhuman memes, and the ending do at least gives me
associations to action.

Is it too close to Extropy? That is very subjective. I think the core
morphem of extropianism is of course extro-; not just the outwards
'ex', but the movement of 'tro'. Extropy without the trope is
something very different.

I think Shaun is too worried about the similarity, but in principle he
is correct: the name suggests a similarity (but that might be
*positive*, since both groups are on the same side and share many
ideas, it would be silly for humanists to avoid having "humanist" in
their organisational names), and there is a real risk/chance of being
linked with ExI (in Europe this can have tricky political connotations;
here in Sweden being a classic *liberal* is considered extreme,
libertarianism is beyond the pale). 

This is not likely to be a large or permanent problem, so I think we
should not invest too much emotional capital in this. The main problem
right now seems to be that a lot of us onlookers are cheering on the
two sides, almost forcing them into a silly confrontation.  I'm not
sure I have any good solution, other than hope Max and Arjen can
discuss this and come up with a good solution. As transhumanists, we
all realize that names are merely (useful) labels, what really counts
is the contents.

Sounds a lot like a meteor; compare this to the videos made of the big
meteor that moved across the US a few years back, they show a golden
glob breaking up, slowly moving across the sky (I think there were
some reports of sound too). My guess is that you saw a meteor breaking
up in the atmosphere, space junk isn't that common.

I disagree with that it is beyond our comprehension, but caution is
certainly adviced when doing climatic engineering - always have a
backup ecosphere. Raising global temperature to the last warm age
sounds nice, but has to be done with geological speed, otherwise the
ecosystems won't have the time to migrate as they should (OK, I'm
biased: I live in Sweden and it is November - I really would like to
get back to the bronze age climate here!).

I think you overestimate the climate. It is complex, chaotic and we
know far too little yet, but it is not something we need big AI for,
rather very good simulators (taking ecology, astronomy and geology
into account). Sometimes we transhumanists are a bit too reverent
about superintelligence - it cannot solve every problem, and is not
the solution to every problem either.

As you said, keep it simple first. Organizing the uplifting process
will be a very hard project.

I think adding a neural interface from the start will pay off. That
way we both get access to the octopus brain for testing, documenting
and enhancement, and we can add software help as needed (why just
settle for a 100% organic lifeform? Aesthetics perhaps).

Integrating lobes are probably more useful than extra lobes with no
clear function.

Well, it's beyond our current comprehension, anyway.  Ie, we don't
know all that much in any great scientific sense.  Climatic
experiments are few, far between, and generally not scientifically
controlled.

Climate-ecosystem interactions are even more iffy.

For instance, I've read in several locations that the reason the
Sahara is a desert, now, rather than a prairie, is because of
centuries of sheep grazing.

Whether that is right or wrong, I can't say.

I also can't say if the overall climate changes were a factor in that,
caused by that, or completely independent of that.  But I think it
behooves the literal terraformer to study these questions very, very
carefully.

Then ask where you're going to put all the displaced people you've
created by flooding coastlines.

Dear fellow listmembers,

Before I begin my composite reply to various listmembers I feel I have to
apologoze to Tom for posting his correspondence with Berrie to the list.

Tom, I you feel I have betrayed your trust by posting off-list
correspondence I most humbly ask your pardon. I felt it was important to
give a complete overview of the discussion to date. Being involved in the
whole discussion myself I could not have been as objective had I refrained
from quoting your mail. I can only hope you appreciate my attempt to
objectively present the discussion to the best of my abilities. You have
gone trough a lot of trouble in working on this problem with us and for
that we owe you much respect and grattitude. Please let this not stand in
the way of future cooperation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

And now for our regular program, some responses:

I have no hard statistics about meme-speading in Europe, just my own
Ex-perience (dangerous word?) of the last months. I travel a fair amount
for work (I'm in switserland at the moment) and in all these months I've
talked (in person and on the web) to a lot of people, none of them had ever
heard of ExI or Transhumanism. It could be that I talk to the wrong people
but I can't get over the feeling that the spreading of our memes still has
a long way to go. Only the cryonics-meme is somewhat known, although is it
generally not taken very seriously at this moment.

I'll try to get hold of a recording of you Dutch TV appearance (looking
forward!).

Just so everybody is clear on this: Max was CC'd on the first mail so we

openly and contructively and hope you do to.

AS I said before, many ideals are indeed shared. Naming remains a point of
discussion:

Damien Broderick seems to have a more general problems with the letter X ;-)

I've also received several off-list mails from listmembers telling me to
stick with 'Excedo'. So it seems there is no consensus on this right now.
I'll not reveal their more specific content, I've learned my lesson on that.

You are all invited to visit our website (still under construction) at:
    http://www.dse.nl/~excedo          (warning: it's mostly in Dutch ;-)
And see for yourself. Both Max and Natascha are mentioned as is Anders

Sorry to make a big thing out of it but if is 'Excedo' is such a big

Again: I am most sorry if you feel that Berrie or me betrayed your trust in
us and we will make sure this never happens again. I am however curious why
you feel this discussion should have remained private. 

If we all continue to work on this problem with your kind of attitude we

We won't let it go that far I think ;-)
I don't know if Tom is 'completely' out of line, but I'm glad you feel (as
we do) that the chance of confusion is very small.

I'm certain that we'll work this out, we have every intention of doing so
and I believe this goes for most everybody.

LS!

We need your help in finding a good name. 
Something in Latin (or Ancient Greek perhaps).
Something that will be clear to the public.
Something that will be easy to remember.
Something great like Extropy or Excedo (but different).
Something that will stand the test of time!
     (at least until the Singularity)

Think of something wonderful and:
                                W I N ! 
    a $100 gift certificate for Amazon, the world's greates bookstore!

We'd love to hear your suggestion. During the next 14 days all are free to
post suggestions to the list. We will choose a name after consulting with
Tom, Max and anybody who wants to get involved.
The person that comes up with the brillaint idea that will rid us of this
problem will be awarded with a $100 electronic giftcertificate that can be
used to purchase books at www.amazon.com, the worlds greatest bookstore.

We are looking forward to your ideas!

On behalf of Excedo, the Dutch Transhumanist Society,
Warm Regards,
Arjen

The book and its theory look very interesting, and have applications
outside of uplifting.  One more comment, even though I fear starting
another thread:  It looks to me, from reading the preface, that his
theory can be subsumed under the notion that our minds function
by trying to put things into causal chains.  In a sense, this subsumes 
and explains the parable/story metaphor -- and can be true even if
Turner's theory turns out not to be.  At the very least, the wider
notion of causality underlies much of our understanding.  (Some
would argue, and I would agree, that it is axiomatic, and that our
knowing of it is merely a identification not of a fact about mind but
about reality as such.)

Truly,

Daniel Ust

Aesthetics is not a concern or a major one here for me.  My reason for
a simple program is based on two more important things: the desire to
suceed and to finish the project in a short time.  Adding lots of features
on increases the chances of failure of any one.  It also adds to the
amount of time it will take.  I bet uplifting itself will be hard, but to
uplift and add a brain-machine interface would be much harder still.

I also think that if we begin and finish the project, we can always add
such interfaces later.  I'd rather attack the problems in a piecemeal
fashion.

I'm not sure.  I imagine we could try to find out the function of various
lobes, then expand the ones we believe will have the greatest impact
on intelligence.

This was our exact feeling, it should be noted that Henri came up with
Excedo _before_ he started subscribing to extropians@extropy.com, call it

For precisely this reason we feel we cannot become a part of ExI, but it is

I think the discussion has been very civilized so far, and have the feeling
that everybody want it to stay that way. I don't think anyone is 'out for

I hope it's not just me and Max going 'head-2-head', My idea of a contest
was to let everybody in on this (but maybe I'm and old-fashioned democrat).
Names are labels but they do have 'marketing value'. New memes have to be
promoted and a name that breaths expansion (whoops ;-) and speed will help.

And now I _got_ to get some sleep ;-)

I was reading _Invertabrates_ by Brusca and Brusca, a very large and
good book which has a small but informative section on cephalopods,
last night.  It seems all cephalopods are carnivores.  This should not
be viewed as a problem, since so are many human pets (dogs, cats)
and one variant of humanity (Eskimoes).

The octopus has the largest brain of all the cephalopods and from the
diagrams and text (they did not give any numbers), its brain appears
much larger than a squid's.  The squid's brain does not even come
close -- more like comparing a human's brain to that of a mouse.  This
is probably because of the phylogenetic relationship being very distant.
 
(Brusca and Brusca are big on phylogenetic classifications -- one
reason I bought the book.)

I don't know.  The octupus brain is really not segmented in any insect
like sense.  It is pretty concentrated, though split into a few lobes.

I'm not sure.  I think that the separation between lobes is not the
result of this, but is merely an historical artifact.  The octopus brain
is basically the mollusc brain that has become more centralized.
There is no reason, for now, to think that this process of
centralization is NOT ongoing -- i.e., that given enough time, the
octopus' descendants will have a more integrated brain.

At least, this fits well with my understanding of evolution, viz. as 
basically a process which is very dependent on initial conditions
and, ergo, very conservative in this respect.  If this is so, it may 
only be necessary for us to tweak the parameters a bit to
cascade the octopus brain into something much more powerful.

I would expect sentient octopi to switch behaviors to more efficient
ones.  However, I am not sure if a larger brain or merely a more 
integrated one would adversely affect their mobility.  In other words, 
I question Lorrey's hypothesis that a larger or more connected
brain would suffer damage in the usual contortions current octopi
do.

Even so, if he is correct, I would expect that whoever does the
uplifting should try to be certain that the results (sentient octopi)
can survive outside the lab.

A more daunting problem is that octopi do not seem to care for
their young in the way that other proposed candidates  -- e.g.,
chimps or dolphins -- for uplifting do.  The problem of each new
octopi, if this seemingly nonsocial lifestyle is maintained after
uplifting, having to learn everything on its own would make for
some limits on their potential.

However, perhaps some form of  socialization is possible, even if
only in adult life.  How might this come about?  Is it really
necessary?  If the goal here is only to do experiments so that
humans can be better augmented, this is not a pressing concern.
If the goal is to create sentient octopi who can grow even further
and mingle with human and posthuman culture, then it might be
viewed as very pressing.

I say we just start doing it, and tackle each problem as it
becomes a limit to further advances.  Thus, the first order of
the day is to learn more about octopi and start enlarging or
intergrating their brains.  Worry about the rest later.

Again: cheap, quick way to uplift.  It's kind of like the poor man's uplift

Understood.  I actually think crossbreeding would not help much.  It would
be too
random/chaotic.  I doubt it would produce viable much less fertile
offspring.  The
only reason I went on with this was to clear up matters in my own head.  I do
think, though, that uplifting chimps by other methods might prove helpful in
augmenting humans.  Also, I suspect, a lot of the developmental patterns are
similar between apes and humans, such that insertion of genetic sequences
might have similar effects in both.

Fox TV just had a promo for their News at 10pm (Maryland),
saying, "Will those who promoted the missile theory take 
a hit from the Grand Jury?"

A grand jury was formed to investigate missile theorists 
last March. Two theorists have been threatened with being
hauled before it, Russell and Marshall Houston, but were
not.  Houston had a contact at Lockheed who knew about a 
live-footage video showing TWA 800 being hit by a missile. 
There was in fact a film crew on the beach that evening. 

The FBI sent agents out to Oregon the same day they got wind 
of this after squeezing Mike Sommer. Houston was threatened 
with being taken to grand jury in New York. Little else is 
known about this grand jury. About it CNN said (03/12/97):

        The FBI this week launched a criminal
        investigation, hoping to stop missile
        theorists.

Thugs vs theories, intimidation vs inquiry, fear 
vs freedom, might vs right, the sword vs the pen.

Precisely.  

There have been and there will be transhuman groups that start up over the
years. Some of them phase out, others remain or change.  Extropy Institute
is so well known as a spearheading transhumanist organization and confident
of its future in the universe that I wouldn't think this issue is a problem. 

Actions often speak louder than words.

      Hello!

      My friend jrt@cix wrote to me, after reading my comments to Carl 
      Feynman, sayiong that he thought my dismissal of overly mathematical 
      treatments of physics was a bit cavalier, and might make it more 
      difficult for people to understand what I aim to get across.


       It may assist understanding to think about RM like this:

[A] Take Classical Mechanics: (Start with T.W.B. Kibble's fine text):
[B] Add relational electric and magnetic and gravitational forces:
[C] Add a velocity of force propagation ('c'), which delays far-action:
[D] Add a full ballistic ('particle' or 'photon') theory of EM radiation.


      The _basic_ maths is straightforward, although some of the force 
      interactions are fiendishly complex to calculate.  That's why we use 
      (say) statistically-based approximation methods like Quantum 
      Mechanics.

      There _is_ a long-standing rivalry between the 'world-picture' 
      approach to physics (i.e. my preference); and the instrumentalist 
      reified' mathematical approach.

      However, my basic thesis is identical to Heisenberg's statement:

     "Classical Mechanics is everywhere exatly 'right' wherever its 
      concepts can be applied." -- Werner Heisenberg.


     I propose that that means _everywhere_.   Classical Mechanics is the 
     most consistent, conceptually clearest, strongest, most coherent, 
     most extendable and most adaptable Scientific Research Programme the 
     world has ever seen.  Why use anything else, is all.  "Simplify!  
     Simplify!"

     I think it's actually _true_. 

     It is certainly exactly accurate to the present limits of 
     measurement, AFAICS.  What more can anyone ask for?

                      ----------- * * * * * -----------

     Max:

     On 'Frame Dragging.'  Insofar as gravitational force is propagated 
     radially as an intrinsic property of mass, and with a finite 
     velocity, we would expect something like 'frame dragging' to occur.  
     Different ways of interpreting the same data, is all.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

     Anton:

     Electrons held in orbit by a balance of electric force against 
     inertia are in a condition which is analogous to 'free fall.' They're 
     not accelerating in a way which causes emission of photons. The 
     radial distance between the positive and negative charges is 
     _constant_, except for the periodic frequency fluctuation as they 
     wiggle round in circular sinewave paths at self-equilibrating integer 
     frequencies (See Beckmann).

     If they absorb or emit a photon, they increase or decrease in mass, 
     and the orbit adjusts.  If they change theior angular velocity, they 
     take up different orbits. The model works perfectly.  Bohr's basic 
     [1913] model works by ad hoc postulates, whereby I offer physical 
     mechanisms and hence physical explanations.  That makes RM a superior 
     theory!  More content!  What's the problem supposed to be?

     All this 'electrons spiralling into the nucleus' stuff -- this is a 
     hangover from aether-drag theory.  There's no point in quoting 
     Maxwell at us -- Maxwell's theory has a (non-existent) aether to 
     transmit forces, whereas RM has relational -- Faradayan -- aetherless 
     forces.  See Berkson's 'Fields of Force' on this crucial point (he 
     was a postgrad student of Popper's at LSE, BTW).

Congratulations to Berrie, Arjen, et al., for a very professional-looking web
page. I think the work you guys have put into your organization speaks volumes
about any attempt at "free-riding" on ExI's name.

Are you still looking for new names? Why not "The Excedo Institute"? Oh, wait...

 Has anyone suggested the name "Daedalus"?

I've always thought it was an intriguing name to begin with, but in terms of
transhumanism, it has some significance. As most schoolkids are familar with,
Daedalus was the mythic Greek scientist who, while imprisoned by King Minos on
Crete, fashioned wings of wood and wax for himself and his young son to escape
to freedom. The parallels with transhuman technology are pretty clear, but the
story also reminds us that it is possible to become intoxicated by our
technological freedom, and behave irresponsibly (the story of Icarus).  This
seems to blend nicely the desire to free ourselves from normal existence and
the need to keep ourselves accountable to ourselves.

Plus it's Greek.
Plus it's clear to the public.
Plus it's easy to remember.
It has no "ex-" anywhere in it.
And it's stood the test of time thus far.

Only problem is, it's so recognizable, that I bet somebody's used it already.
But hey, better an enemy outside the fold than within....

Good luck,

Hagbard

Of course not. It's not objectively wrong to me because I make no claims about
knowing exactly what objective right and wrong are. I only have my ethical system to
guide me. And that's pretty damn subjective.

But then again, I'm always objective. ;-)

Right. Nor are ethical systems. The best ethical system is one that evolves when it
hits the hard cases. All models are in a continual state of being perfected. And
this holds true for my system of ethics as well -- which is why I brought the
ethical question up in the first place.

Makes sense to me.

I'm enjoying this uplift thread immensely,

 IAN: Below I confirm each evidentiary claim I made, 
 which Abraham Moses Genen has requested that I do:


CLAIM 1: There is PROOF that the military 
lied about their activities on July 17,'96. 


     PROOF: At a Department of Defense press conference 
     on July 23, 1996, DoD spokesman Kenneth Bacon said:

             Im not aware [that] there were any 
             military exercises in the area. Ive 
             been told by the Joint [Chiefs of] 
             Staff that there were not. [DOC 1]

     However, after eight months of such denials, on March 
     22, 1997, Newsday [DOC 2] reported that the Navy finally 
     admitted that there were (a) military exercises and (b) 
     three Navy submarines in the area at the time of the 
     TWA 800 accident. (Now the story has changed again,
     and the number of subs in the area is down to 2.
     Interesting: recently a woman contacted Richard
     Russell saying her husband was the captain of
     a sub off LI that shot down TWA 800.?? I'll
     have to see if the sub she named is the 
     sub that just vanished into thin air.)

DOCUMENT 1: http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jul96/t072396_t0723asd.html
DOCUMENT 2: http://www.newsday.com/jet/cras0322.htm

  Rather than repost it, here you will find many more, well, 
  lies pertaining to military asset locations and activities 
  on July 17, 1996: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/1year.htm 
  and a few here: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-fact.htm


CLAIM 2: There is proof the govt continues to lie about such. 

  This proof is derived from many facts cited here: 
  http://www.erols.com/igoddard/1year.htm and the fact 
  that just yesterday, James Kallstrom said at the FBI's
  closing press conference that there were no military 
  exercises in the area on the night of the crash, which 
  contradicts Navy admissions after the radar tapes were
  leaked: http://www.newsday.com/jet/cras0322.htm 


CLAIM 3: There is proof that the FBI has acted to cover up facts. 

  Don't you have web access? I don't feel it 
  appropriate to post such a large document: 
  http://www.erols.com/igoddard/cover-up.htm
  read that document, the proof's in there.


CLAIM 4: There is photographic evidence of a military drone-
type aerial device a few miles and moments from the crash. 

  Here it is: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/kab-dir.htm

  The FBI says that their experts say it is 
  a plane. Can you find a plane that is shaped
  like a rod with a luminous end? I can't. But
  I can find many target drones that fit the 
  bill better than any manned plane. Atomist
  logic dictates that if Y is like X, but 
  Y is not like Z, Y is more likely to
  be X than Z. Ergo: the object is 
  most likely a target drone.


CLAIM 5: There are over 100 witnesses of a missile-like 
streak rising from the ocean to impact TWA 800. 

  Again, I cannot post here all I have at my 
  website. I have amassed an extensive collection
  of witness accounts, including a triangulation
  of their sightings. Study them if you want to
  see how clear and consistent they are: 
  http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-core.htm

  In reply to your comments pertaining to eyewitnesses:

>I'm not really interested in so-called "eye witnesses" whose 
>imaginations can easily play tricks on them. Any first year 
>law student knows that "eye witnesses" are rarely consistant 
>or reliable. 

  IAN: But in this case they are consistent. Witness 
  accounts are admissible evidence in all courts of law. 
  Uniformity of accounts in over 150 witnesses increases 
  the reliability to virtually 100%. Here is a mathematical 
  analysis of the probability of eyewitness accuracy using 
  the case of only 50 witness (as an early report cited):

http://www.webexpert.net/rosedale/twacasefile/probabilities.html
 

CLAIM 6: There is massive penetration deformation to 
the exterior fuselage panels exceeding the psi strength 
of a CFT explosion.

   Again, I can't post a photo here. You'll have to visit 
   the webpage: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/twa-core.htm
   go to the bottom graphic and click on the lower photos
   therein. The area of massive fuselage-panel-penetration 
   deformation would have experienced a 8 psi shockwave
   from a CFT explosion. The radical pig-tailed deformation 
   there would require forces over 1000 psi.  This area 
   of analysis is what I was getting into before dropping
   the case, but I'm happy to say that others, with exten-
   sive aviation and engineering expertise are working on
   such a mathematical analysis of damage to the airframe.


   RECONSTRUCTION STILL OFF-LIMITS

   I spoke with a free-lance journalist who attended the 
   FBI press conference, and a press visit to the hangar
   yesterday to see the reconstruction of the part of the 
   plans that is allowed to be seen. The nose section remains
   hidden. All of the visitors were prohibited from viewing
   the left side of the plane. I thought with the FBI off 
   the case, and it being no longer a criminal investigation,
   that the evidence was supposed to be open... NOT. Guess
   how many major media reports will tell you that access
   to the left side was prohibited? None. Mark my word.


>On the other hand, in the absence of such legitimately meaningful 
>evidence and continued specious and uncorroborated claims, psychotherapy 
>from a competent licensed clinician might be in order. 


  IAN: I think it's appalling, not only the abusive
  treatment those who REALLY question authority are 
  subjected to, but the utter lack of knowledge of
  the case on the part of those that will so quickly 
  launch into vicious smears on those who question.

  It seems your quite certain of the truth a priori 
  to inquiry. I do not profess such surety as you.
  I present what I see as relevant evidence in the 
  case, and let you take it from there. Maybe the
  Navy didn't shoot it down, but why should ques-
  tioning official claims and making a case against 
  be grounds for medical treatment. That's just 
  an outrageous attempt to stifle free inquiry!

I agree, those attachments are irritating, so exasperating in fact that 
lately I've been erasing Mr. Genen's posts before reading them. Equally 
obtuse, and this is not aimed only at Mr. Genen, are those in the habit of 
including 3 pages of unattributed quotes and quotes of quotes and quotes of 
quotes of quotes, and then adding only one small original line of their own 
at the end.  This sets off my delete finger real quick. The recursive hell of 
it all is that then some fellow decides to comment on that one rare line but 
for some mysterious reason doesn't include just that part but insists on 
quoting the entire chaotic mishmash of a post and the iteration continues and 
grows like a cancer. Sometimes technology can make things too easy, if all 
quotations had to be typed in manually I have a hunch their  use would drop 
rather dramatically.

                                         John K Clark       johnkc@well.com

PS: My complaints are probably pointless because I doubt I'll change     
    anybody's behavior, so feel free to rebut by calling this post as    
    big a waste of bandwidth as those I grumble about, but please, don't 
    include every line of it when you do.

It is the other way around, I said earlier that we have to
eliminate
the 'self-destructiveness' or other detrimental elements of our 
Human Kind before uploading it to these machines.....

Or having software bulit on board to contract these detrimental
elements ,.... Now, RE : earlier post on Why Uplift ?

Definition of what 'dangerous' is what's detrimental to
end-result of these uplifted / uploaded entities ....  
Don't want these machines blowing each other up ,... rather
peaceful; harmonious; fact-gathering; sentient etc ...
History from our own Human Race ,.. shows up these detrimental
elements in our race that we must learn to have mastery over .....
:0
Again I emphasize that we must be careful to upload / uplift what
is beneficial to the advancement of human kind,... agreed ....?
We're talking about self-replicating machines and uplifted
species that reproduce themselves ,... that means we're going to
end up with an exponentiating problem or solution for our
extropian causes
agreed ? :-)

and Super-tigers do get to vote, provided we don't put spray them
down with Uzis for terrorizing people at the polling booths ,...
and if they can behave themselves ,... there's no need to spray
them down,.... :-)
Wonder whether SPCA will be around at that time ?

Subject: Some thoughts on multi-agent systems and "hyper-economy".
Mime-Version: 1.0

I have been interested in multi-agent complex systems lately, and though
I still have to do a lot more reading and thinking, I would like to share a
few ideas; maybe you'll help me figure things out. As always, I am
looking for all kinds of remarks and references. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Multi-agent systems and action spaces
--------------------------------------------

People distinguish various types of systems consisting of relatively
autonomous functional parts. They call them: ecology, economy,
society, organism, software, etc. The rules for identifying these systems
are quite simple. For example, any system consisting of biological
objects would be called an ecology, one made up of humans is a
society, and a part of the latter that has to do with exchanging things is
an economy. However, if one wants to understand the behavior of such
systems (otherwise, why study them?) it seems more productive to
subdivide them into functional types. This also allows to draw analogies
between similar systems of different nature (e.g., a communist economy
may be similar to an integrated organism, as its parts work directly on
the central order, and the role of financial flows are reduced to assist
the economic balancing mechanism. A contract economy looks much
like a forest ecology, except that agents get locked into relationships by
contracts, not niches, and some other manifestations of subsystems'
intelligence. So multi-agent systems can be classified by overall
complexity, internal control methods, structure and viscosity (transport
capacities) of the space, methods of connecting agents into stable
working groups (mutual specialization, physical coupling, force,
emotional affection, ownership, contracts), diversity and intelligence of
agents, etc. 

A general theory may also help to predict where new systems may have
features qualitatively different from everything previously observed. For
instance, space within modern communication and computing
environments is effectively non-metric (it takes approximately the same
time and effort to phone anybody in a country, or address any memory
unit within a computer). This means that most space-related laws of all
previous functional spaces would not apply to "digital" systems: there is
no concept of premium location here, or differential rent, no
"reproductive isolation" or other influence of space-induced separation
on agents' communication and diversity. Also digital systems often have
lower replication costs of agents than execution costs, which makes
them dramatically different from all systems more essentially embedded
in their physical substrates. - For humans, it's much easier to translate
an article or to fix an appliance than to transfer their skills to another
human capable. For a computer it is just copying a program. 

Together, the above features create a foundation for system design that
is dramatically different from all natural and human agglomerations, in
terms of agent specialization, diversity, and deployment. I would
envision the future intelligence as a collection of highly specialized tools,
with high-bandwidth interconnections, with "personalities", or complex
problem solvers ("achievers", "goal engines", "research tools",
"development threads") consisting of limited contractual relations
between multiple problem-solving, planning, perceiving, and acting
entities, that can at the same time be employed in many other similar
relations. So the entities may use the same "body parts" on a
cooperative or time-sharing basis. 

Economy and beyond
------------------------------

Economies are an interesting class of systems. By using quantitative
symbols to represent typical value relations between various resources,
economy allows efficient distribution of signals in the system, and
provides short-sighted selfish agents with incentives to adjust their
consumption and production efforts in accordance with the collective
requirements of all other agents in the system. 

Unfortunately, while the economy provides its agents with accurate
estimates of generic values, it has little to offer to each individual agent
in their attempts to figure the value of a certain product to their
particular needs, or offer any other personalized or situational advice.
This kind of knowledge is usually obtained by the economic agents in
about the same way they discovered average social values of common
products and services in pre-economic times: personal experience with
the environment and direct communication with others. There are no
quantitative instruments available for automated processing for this
purpose. 

This is understandable: comprehensive detailed data about each agent's
behavior so far has not been available in a usable form, communication
and computational instruments necessary for processing this data have
not been adequate, transaction costs have been too high, etc. All these
obstacles are now being removed in many systems. 

With these tools in place, there appears a foundation for "a second
signalling mechanism" in an economic system: together with conventional
aggregate indicators of average costs of resources and services and
their expectations, the new crop of signalling instruments may deliver
suggestions of expected value that particular agents may derive in their
individual situations from such resources or services. Then agents can
be better equipped to optimize their behavior by using all available
knowledge for comparing personal and global costs, risks, and utilities. 

Such systems (I would call them "hyper-economies", or
"super-economies") may be implemented in both completely automated
environments and those involving humans (e.g., they could assist people
in selection of things most appropriate for their tastes and situations,
from recommending movies they want to see, to tools that would satisfy
their needs at the best price to choosing diets and insurance plans for
their own goals and conditions). 

There is some analogy here with the notion of "psychohistory"
suggested by Isaac Asimov in his Foundation series, except that instead
of using detailed representations of social processes for long-term
prediction of future events (which is hardly possible with a still very
imperfect model of a huge chaotic system), I suggest a more modest
goal of using them for richer local modelling and adaptive control. The
only advantage here is that this modest goal seems actually achievable. 

>From research to development
--------------------------------------------

I know of a very few people working in similar directions. In the current
situation, good theorists work on conceptualizing existing systems, and
are usually not aware of new developments in software that may create
foundation for new systems and theories. On the other hand, people
working on the first versions of new signalling systems usually do not
have much expertise or interest in complex systems analysis, and spend
their efforts debugging and distributing software. As a result, the new
system structures are arising, once again, unconsciously. 

I am trying to approach this topic from two sides, with some progress in
both, though I feel it is too premature to write about the details yet. 

One, is theoretical considerations of how the new signaling systems may
change our familiar economic notions, such as capital, interest,
efficiency, liquidity, inflation, emission rights, secondary and derivative
instruments. Some of these features will remain relatively unchanged but
become more liquid (faster distribution and lower transaction costs) and
more efficient. Other parameters may turn from scalar to vector or a
more complex structure (e.g., replacement of the numerical
representation of value with a matrix of "value of this object for a
purpose P as estimated by an agent A"). Some features, such as
"situational/detail derivatives" for assessing values and risks of, and
balancing among, particular utilities will be entirely new. 

Similar changes will happen with the concepts from social and
ecological fields. Communities do not have to be local anymore, they
may have variable/adaptable geometries, relations between managing
and performing agencies will be redefined, new control structures and
dynamic patterns arise, etc. 

At the same time, I am working on simple versions of such systems in
Internet environments, where the data is already available, and the
results seem of direct practical use. I am looking for people who would
be interested in helping me develop architectures and algorithms for
such systems. At this point, I can't pay anybody to work on it, but this
is a very promising field, and it may offer very fine student and research
projects. 

Among the first applications of this approach I envision large automated
collaborative filtering projects, link exchange programs and targeted
advertising, balancing flows of information in accordance with diverse
and dynamic interests of creators, consumers, providers, and sponsors
of the Web content. 

My hope is that eventually such hyper-economic schemes will develop
to store and process increasingly complex representations of agent
interests and utilities, and have a great variety of competing intelligent
algorithms for optimizing system processes, thus turning into a hybrid of
an economic self-regulatory mechanism, complex multi-faceted
community, and distributed artificial intelligence, with secondary data
representation and signalling mechanisms forming emerging
self-awareness of the new systems.

OK. I've had enough. To all members of this list:

Is the endless ranting about TWA Flight 800 an appropriate topic
for this list? I don't think so....

Since the topic of similar names was raised. I agree with T. O. Morrow
that it is easy to confuse names. The most closely matching names I know
of are the Extro conference series name and the Xtro series of movies.

Xtro: (release 1982) A horror movie about an evil alien parasite that
comes to Earth and causes havoc.  The advertising tag line was a comical
contrasting reference to E.T.  "Not all extra-terrestrials are friendly." 

Two more films in the series were made.

Xtro II: The Second Encounter: (release 1991)

Xtro 3: Watch the Skies: (release 1995)

I have not seen any of the movies.  Admittedly the topics covered in the

Seriously, it would be desirable for distinct transhumanist organizations

I've seen the RM theory.  That's all good and well, but like Bohr, your
model suffers some serious defects when faced with all but the simplest
electronic structures.  Probabilistic wave functions work much better at
describing observable electronic phenomena than can be accomodated by
deterministic/discrete wave functions, especially as the electronic
structures get more complicated.  I don't see any means by which you can
package your electron orbitals to make them look like the electron orbitals
that actually happen.  The Schrodinger wave functions are fundamental to
modern chemistry and work very well; *much* better than non-probabilistic
functions.

So here's the problem, in short:

You would like us to discard a vast quantity of experimentally verifiable
computational chemistry in exchange for an "improved" theory that generates
a huge body of evidence to the contrary.

Reading this, I have to ask: did they include the giant squid?  

The Pacific giant octopus is basically on a human scale; the giant 
squid is HUGE, with tentacles known to exceed fifty feet in some 
cases.

However, the giant squid is a deep-water creature, that has trouble 
tolerating the low pressures to be found near the surface of the 
ocean.  To the best of my knowledge, scientists have never managed to 
do any meaningful observation of one in its natural habitat or in 
good health.  What we know of them is from dead or near-dead ones, 
and fragments (which are usually sections of tentacle), that have 
floated to the surface and washed ashore or otherwise been spotted.

(I personally think the giant squid is a bad choice for an uplift 
experiment.  But NOT because of small brains.  For one good reason, 
read the previous paragraph.  For another, what we DO know 
about them indicates that they are rather less than sociable.)

      Hello, all!

      My friend jrt@cix wrote to me, after reading my comments to Carl 
      Feynman, sayiong that he thought my dismissal of overly mathematical 
      treatments of physics was a bit cavalier, and might make it more 
      difficult for people to understand what I aim to get across.

      It is my contention that Classical Physics was misled by Huygens' 
      'wave theory of light' diversion, and Maxwell's beautiful 
      electromagnetism (as distinct from the particle theory of light; and 
      the Continental and faradayan electromagnetic programmes of Weber, 
      Helmholtz etc.). Alfred O'Rahilly's "Electromagnetics: A Discussion 
      of Fundamentals' is excellent on this issue -- the book is described 
      by Popper in his 'Postscript' as excelling in the literature 
      critical of 'relativistic' theories.

      We now know that a particle theory of light can do all the 'wave' 
      stuff anyway; amd that we can get Maxwell's handy equations as a 
      first approximation from relational forces propagated at 'c' 
      relative to their source.  So we're back on track now (anyway, at 
      least some of us are... >:-} ).


  It may assist understanding to think about Relational mechanics thusly:

[A] Take Classical Mechanics: (Start with T.W.B. Kibble's fine text):
[B] Add relational electric and magnetic and gravitational forces:
[C] Add a velocity of force propagation ('c'), which delays far-action:
[D] Add a full ballistic ('particle' or 'photon') theory of EM radiation.


      The _basic_ maths is straightforward, although some of the force 
      interactions are fiendishly complex to calculate.  That's why we use 
      (say) statistically-based approximation methods like Quantum 
      Mechanics.  "The computer is your fiend!"

      There _is_ a long-standing rivalry between the 'world-picture' 
      approach to physics and cosmology (i.e. my preference, and 
      Popper's); and the instrumentalist 'reified' mathematical approach.

      However, my basic thesis is identical to Heisenberg's statement:

     "Classical Mechanics is everywhere exatly 'right' wherever its 
      concepts can be applied." -- Werner Heisenberg.


     I propose that this means _everywhere_.   Classical Mechanics is the 
     most self-consistent, the conceptually clearest, the strongest, the 
     most coherent, the most extendable and the most adaptable Scientific 
     Research Programme the world has ever seen.  And one theory does it 
     all.  Why use anything else, is all.  "Simplify! Simplify!"

     As a matter of fact, I think it's actually _true_.  I've never read a 
     convincing refutation of Classical Mechanics.  Someone would have to 
     disprove one or more of the axioms; or break the deductive chains.  I 
     don't think that's actually possible.  Does anyonwe here think that 
     geometry is _empirically decideable_?  I.e. Euclid vs. Minkowski or 
     Euclid vs. Riemann ?  Do tell!!!  >:-}

     Classical Mechanics is certainly exactly accurate to the present 
     limits of measurement, AFAICS.  It shows every prospect of extension 
     without limit - it scales cleanly from cosmic down to the microworld.

     What more can anyone possibly ask for?

                      ----------- * * * * * -----------

     Max:

     On 'Frame Dragging.'  Insofar as gravitational force is propagated 
     radially as an intrinsic property of mass, and with a finite velocity 
     of propagation, we would expect something like 'frame dragging' to 
     occur. Different ways of interpreting the same data, is all.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

     Anton:

     Electrons held in orbit by a balance of radial electric force against 
     inertial mass are in a condition analogous to 'free fall' or 'curved 
     space.'  They're not accelerating in a way which causes emission of 
     photons. The radial distance between the positive and negative 
     charges is _constant_, except for the periodic frequency fluctuation 
     as they wiggle round in closed sinewave paths at self-equilibrating 
     integer frequencies (See Beckmann [1987] for a complete explanation).

     If they absorb or emit a photon, they increase or decrease in mass, 
     and the orbit adjusts.  If they change theior angular velocity, they 
     take up different orbits. The model works perfectly.  Bohr's basic 
     [1913] model works by ad hoc postulates, whereby I offer physical 
     mechanisms and hence physical explanations.  That makes RM a superior 
     theory!  More content!  What's the problem supposed to be?

     All this 'electrons spiralling into the nucleus' stuff -- that is a 
     hangover from aether-drag theory.  There's no point in quoting 
     Maxwell at us -- Maxwell's theory has a (non-existent) aether to 
     transmit forces, whereas RM has relational -- Faradayan -- aetherless 
     forces.  See Berkson's 'Fields of Force' on this crucial point (he 
     was a postgrad student of Popper's at LSE, BTW).

        Yes, this is mostly true.  Since sheep farming is one of the few
profitable agricultural practices in that part of Africa, farmers have to
let their sheep graze.  Since grass and other vegetation is what keeps the
soil moist and full of nutrients, its removal (combined with the hot
climate) quickly leaches the soil of nutrients and moisture, causing it to
become brittle and dusty.  Whenever a gust of wind comes along, it
virtually pushes the dry topsoil into nearby areas, usually causing them to
be buried. The process of desertification is a constant one...one that is
not so much affected by the climate as by poor farming habits.
Unfortunately, due to the poverty of the area, such subsistance farming is
necessary; the result is a catch-22.  The ideal solution to desertification
would be for the farmers to find a new way to support themselves; however,
given the climate and potential industries of the area, few alternatives
come to mind.

I think it is a slight bit more complex than that. During the ice age
the convection cells were somewhat different, and instead of just
moving the humid air of the tropics above the Sahara they dropped the
moisture there, creating a thriving ecosystem. When the climate
shifted, the area dried up. Here is the part I'm uncertain of: did the
Sahara immediately become a desert or did it do so due to grazing? It
is not inconceivable that a large prarie could remain stable,
especially since it affects the climate in turn, but sooner or later
it may tunnel to the even more stable desert state. Whether this push
was through grazing or a natural fluctuation I don't know (I lean
towards the natural side, since there are plenty of deserts at that
latitude around the world that seems to have appeared independently).

It should be noted that the main reason for desert spreading today are
grazing and mismanaged agriculture, but this means spreading the
desert outside its "natural" borders.

Exactly. Personally I think we ought to terraform Mars first so that
we learn the ropes before tackling the Earth (although I consider
planets a waste of matter, but that is just personal opinion).

Maybe young octopi could grow up with humans instead of other octopi?
I have been thinking about one assumption we seem to be making in this
discussion, that the uplifted species should be essentially "animal X
+ intelligence + with its own culture". That is nice, but even the
least invasive forms of uplifting would add a lot of human stuff to
the animal, and likely result in a mixed culture. So why not accept
that and try to create uplifted species intended right from the start
to be integrated in "human" culture (which by the time they are smart
enough will likely be barely recognizable to us mehums); the
sophoctopi would not be entirely octopodian, but neither would they be
purely human - they would be a mixture.

And why stop there? Surely all those other galaxies which have no direct
importance for human existence are a waste of matter also. Something must be
done about this imbalance between useful and non-useful matter. I propose the
prime purpose of the human race to be the systematic removal of all matter
known to not influence our society in any way. As the moon has some
importance as an illumination device, perhaps our first target should be
that irrelevant red planet.

Entirely off topic, this is my first posting to this mailing list, as you
are probably aware. I will not waste too much of your time with personal
psychobabble other than to say I work as a computer scientist in Australia
and hope to someday work in Artificial Intelligence.

So G'day!

So it seems that crossbreeding would not be an appropriate form of
uplifting, and possibly not a form of uplifting at all.  

Thanks for an interesting debate on this topic.  This was the kind of
discussion that I was hoping for when I posted the crossbreeding
question.  

I think it's important for researchers to hash out sensitive questions
before they become issues in the media and general public.  I expect a
strong public backlash against genetic research once we begin altering
existing species in a significant way.  Advocates of such research need
to be prepared for this.  If we cannot quell negative public opinion
with reasonable arguments as to what is ethical and unethical then I
fear that public pressure will lead to over restrictive government
regulation of reaserch.

An ideal candidate therefore - if socialisation be the criteria - is the
humble sea slug. The sea slug is perhaps the most copulent of all the animal
kingdom, for when not eating and sleeping, the sea slug is more often than
not found to be fucking. And let it not be said that sea slugs are
traditionalists - they have shown a wide range of sexual appetites, even
having been discovered going at with as many as six concurrent partners. 

Seriously though, surely by the time uplifting of octopi is possible
suitably advanced methods for training them in the ways of the world will
also be available? Assuming some kind of intelligence of the order of
humans, basic literacy in the prevalent form of human communication would be
easily administered, and who will say what would then limit our
eight-tentacled friends?

I saw the second half of the first movie; from what I remember it was
very strange and very bad. I suppose it might have made more sense if 
I'd seen the first half as well ;-).

I think you misunderstood me :-) What I would like is to convert all
the inert matter lying around into habitats for life and
complexity. What use is the iron at the Earth's core right now? It
provides gravity and a protective magnetic field all right, but the
mass of the Earth could probably be used to create a much larger, much
more diverse ecosphere based on (say) thousands or millions of O'Neill
colonies. The same for most of the solar system. I admit I enjoy the
unexpected beauty of most planetary surfaces; it is really all the
matter that just lies there I want to turn into complexity. Maybe we
should really take the Hitchiker's Guide to heart and rebuild planets
into nanocomputer spheres with standard molecular life on the surface.

The problem is that you cannot just eliminate the reptilian brain - it
is essential to our functioning on a very deep level (motivation,
attention, basic awareness, body control, wakefulness etc). We should
instead strive to refine it into something more survivable.

The common view of the brain/mind as advanced systems built on top of
more primitive systems, overriding their functions with "civilization"
is largely wrong. What we neuroscientists are arriving at is almost
the reverse: the "primitive" systems are really the core of our being,
our basic and most important functions, and the other systems just add
new capabilities. So what we should do is to add more
layers/capabilities of course (like a broad computer/brain interface,
making it possible to "plug in" software), and to find ways of
refining the core structures so that they no longer hinder us from our
goals. This is extremely hard and dangerous, but somebody has to do
it.

In an uploaded form this would be significantly easier than in a
biological form, since we can always undo changes, make backups and
run parallel copies of ourselves.

I haven't been able to access the article, but I think there is reason
for optimism. We are learning a lot about how neurons differentiate
into their functions, and how different substances make them seek out
the right places to connect. Implanting neurons to restore function is
becoming more and more feasible. The problem is to get back to
normal function, and what kinds of implanted neurons work best. But
at least the second is likely solvable in the near future.

I'm happy to hear that your mother is better. Parkinsons disease is
basically an imbalance between the movement-activating basal ganglia
and the movement-inhibiting basal ganglia. Pallidotomy restores some
of the balance, but to be honest I think it is slightly
inelegant. That is why I would really like if we could develop the
capability to implant cells that replace the lost substantia nigra
cells.

I probably made a few people a bit upset with all my Ex-words
so I appologize and offer a suggestion to try and help.
How about putting ExI next to names when refering top them?

For example:
 
ExI Exponent
    or
Extro^3 ExI

Then everyone keeps the names they like
and ExI's activities are OBVIOUSLY ExI's.
Heck, not doing that would be like not getting free publicity,
like Microsoft*TM not putting it's name on every piece of it's software.

You already do this on Exponent.
I can not read a single page of that 
without knowing where it came from.

I just do not see what the fuss is about.

On Thu, 20 Nov 1997 19:28:50 -0500 Twink wrote about
Mark Turner's THE LITERARY MIND:
< It looks to me, from reading the preface, that his
theory can be subsumed under the notion that our
minds function by trying to put things into causal
chains.  In a sense, this subsumes  and explains the
parable/story metaphor -- and can be true even if
Turner's theory turns out not to be.  At the very
least, the wider notion of causality underlies much
of our understanding.  (Some would argue, and I would
agree, that it is axiomatic, and that our knowing of
it is merely a identification not of a fact about
mind but about reality as such.) >

Our minds may TRY "to put things into causal chains"
but I'm not sure that implies that "causality
underlies much of our understanding".

The following is from a Discover article that was
available around the time that Damien Broderick first
mentioned this book to the Extropians list:

"Knowledge, in other words, comes from the sparks
stories display as they strike up against each other.
And since that's an inherently dynamic process,
knowledge is also consequently unstable. 'Meaning,'
Turner says, 'is a complex operation of projecting,
blending, and integrating over multiple spaces.
Meaning never settles down into a single residence.
Meaning is parabolic and literary.'"
http://www.enews.com/magazines/discover/magtxt/9703-7.html

Now, this "sparks [of concepts] striking up against
each other" may sound causal, but projecting,
blending, and integrating at the level above this
where we interpret and apply the allegories,
metaphors and parables doesn't sound all that causal
to me.

It seems to me to be saying that human thought is
based principally on pattern matching, an on-going
variation and selection, feedback between many
levels, where it is effectively impossible to
untangle all the causal threads.  We may frequently
jump to causal conclusions about events happening in
our environment that work for practical purposes even
though the causality really isn't there.

Anyway, I haven't actually had a chance to read
Turner's book, though I'd like to. It's interesting,
however, to quote something about causality that was
JUST posted to another list (psyche-D) where
neuroscientist Walter Freeman wrote:

< I wish to challenge the assumption that the world
is causal.  There are interrelations of objects and
events in varying degrees of invariance, scope, and
temporal order.  We humanize them by assigning
'cause'.   I think I know how it is that we do this,
through the neural processes of corollary discharge
and reafference.  If this is valid, then causation
holds in human actions, but it is misassigned to
phenomena in the world, leading to the quandary
described above. >

and Chris Malcolm, Department of Aritificial
Intelligence, Edinburgh University, responded in
agreement and went on to describe how:

< Cause is relative to the capabilities and purposes
of the observer. Cause is an observer-related
abstraction from the matrix of conditions which
underlie the existence of something. [CUT] Consider
for example an instruction in a computer program to
"beep" (make a beeping noise). [CUT] It is immaterial
in the same way as a melody, the rules of chess, a
plan, or an idea. Yet we all agree that what just
caused the computer to beep was the beep command in
the program it was running. Wait a minute! It
*wasn't* the instruction in the program that caused
it, it *was* the configuration of voltages across
transistor junctions. But they are the same thing! No
they're not!

That's the sort of trap you fall into when you
stretch "cause" too far. We know exactly what is
meant by an immaterial computer program causing a
physical action. There is no magic, no need for some
special ontologically distinct realm where
information and ideas reside which has some
specialised kind of causal connection to the normally
causally closed world of physics. The Cartesian
mind-matter duality is an artefact of mistaking the
nature of causality, a misdiagnosis of what the
problem is when causality falls to bits when you try
to use it to explain how software affects hardware
and how ideas affect men. >

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------

         
      From "The Dictionary of Symbols: by J.E. Cirlot; RKP [1971]:

ALCHEMIC: ... Sublimation, the sixth stage, symbolized the suffering 
resulting from the mystic detachment from the world, and the dedication to 
spiritual striving.  In emblematic designs, this stage is depicted by a 
wingless creature borne away by a winged being; or sometimes by the  
Prometheus myth.


FIRE:  Paracelsus demonstrated the parallel between fire and life, pointing 
out that both must feed upon other lives to keep alive.  To steal fire 
like Prometheus, or to give oneself up to fire, like Empedocles, are two 
concepts which point to the basic dualism of the human predicament.  The 
middle way lies in the comforthable solution of simply making material use 
of the benefits of fire.  But fire is  ultra-life.  It embraces both good 
(vital heat) and bad (destruction and conflagration).  It implies the 
desire to annihilate time and to bring all things to their end.  Fire is 
the archetypical image of phenomena in themselves.  To pass through fire 
is symbolic of transcending the human condition, in 'Myths, Dreams and 
Mysteries' (London, 1960).


ZODIACAL: Piobb has linked the Trials of Hercules with the Zodiac ... The 
eagle is linked with Prometheus to Aquarius.


RING: Like every closed circle, the Ring is a symbol of continuity and 
wholeness.  Thus, it is told that when Jupiter allowed Hercules to rescue 
Prometheus, it was on condition that the latter should wear an iron ring, 
set with a piece of rock from the Caucasus, as a symbol of submission to 
his punishment ... T the same time, the light radiated by the ring of 
flames symbolizes eternal wisdom and transendental illumination.


VULCAN: Vulcan, as a symbol, is related to the smith who has his forge in 
the mountain-cave, and hence to the demiurge.  Indeed, the Ancients 
explained volvanoes by reference to underground forges and spernatural 
smiths...  Diel siggests that Vulcan, Icarus and Prometheus are symbolic 
of the intellect -- understood almost in its techical and 'merely human' 
sense -- in open rebellion against the spirit.


MYTHOLOGY: "In the person of Prometheus in the 'Works and Days', if 
anywhere in Greek mythology, appears a figure beloved by anthropologists 
and others, the 'culture hero' wo, at the dawn of time won for man certain 
essential advantages of his civilized existence.  The Tiatan Prometheus 
angered Zeus with men by cheating him of his portion of animal-meat when 
sacrifice was instituted.  This provides the validating charter for the 
Greek sacrificial ritual, in which the bones and fat were offered to the 
Gods and the meat was kept for human consumption.  In retaliation, Zeus 
took fire from men.  Prometheus stole it back again.  


      Zeus took his revenge by instructing Hephaistos, Craftsman of the 
Olympians, to fashion woman from clay.  Athena [Tony bows respectfully...] 
decked her out with fine clothes and flowers, but she was given a 
deceitful nature ...  These stories account for fire, sacrifice, human 
toil and sickness by providing an imaginatively and emotionally satisfying 
explanation for them, based upon the known world-order.  Explanation 
alleviates the hardship by making it comprehensible.  The story of woman 
as both a delight and a curse even hints at the kind of 'mediation of 
opposites' which, it it has been argued, is the universal function of 
mythopoeic activity.  Again, the stories are old -- much older than 
Hesiod."  -- J.P. Kane.

             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------


PRACTICAL GREEK MAGIC: "The Titan Iapetus had four sons: Menoetius; Atlas; 
Prometheus; and Epimentheus...  Prometheus, whose main weapon seems to 
have been cunning, had a different fate, and played an important role in 
the legendary history an origins of humanity.; during the revolt of the 
Titans he kept a prudent neutrality and was actually admitted into the 
circle of the Immortals, but he entertained a silent grudge against the 
destryers of his race and constantly favoured men against the Gods.


      Robert Graves postulates that tht Talmudic archangel Michael was the 
counterpart of Prometheus, no doubt on account of the similarity between 
the story of Prometheus' involvent in clay and water being used to fashion 
the first men in the likeness of gods into whome Athene breathed life; and 
the story of Jehovah acting in a similar fashion to create Adam and Eve.


      The occult significance of the Promethean story is obvious;  it 
concerns the ever recurring theme of a group of people who possessed 
advanced knowledge of both science and magic which they gave to a race who 
were not spiritually or somatically evolved enough to make good use of it. 
 The Tree of Knowledge inevitably carries its sacrificed saviour, 
Prometheus joining the ranks of those wisdom gods who suffered for the 
redemption of mankind but also gained knowledge and furthered their own 
spiritual evolution as a result." -- Murry Hope [1985].

  IAN: While I think there a deeper issues

  I agree that this is getting too much. I felt
  the need to post some explanations for the

  the "energy" of it I posted too much. 

  But I did not initiate debate on the topic.

  For those who want to challenge my claims,

  All I can say is if you base your opinion
  on what you now hear in the news, your
  selling yourself short. I believe it wise
  to always second guess the authorities,
  and speak out when their words don't 
  match the facts. That's what I've done.
  Unfortunately, considering the extent
  of attacks on me, I wish I had not.

  It would be nice if people would examine
  the facts,  the message and not always
  examine and attack the messenger, but 
  alas, that seems to be the rule.

First of all, let me be clear that the opinions I present in this post are
those of myself only. I am not presenting the view of the Extropy Institute
Board, and I am sure that I am not representing Tom's view. Tom and I tend
to approach these issues somewhat differently. Tom's training being in law,
he sees matters like this primarily from a legal mindset and takes very
seriously his role in protecting ExI's interest in issues involving
trademark and related matters.

In my view, the question of Excedo's name is *not* an issue of trademark
infringement. I'm not entirely sure whether Tom thinks it is a trademark
issue in a legal sense, or only in some moral sense. However, I *do* agree
with Tom's concern, in that I have no doubt that the name "Excedo" *would*
cause some confusion. Those who disagree are overestimating the
intelligence of the media and much of the public. If we were all already
transhuman with intellectual augmentations, no problem! However, another
transhumanist organization with a name begining with "Ex" *will* lead to
some confusion. Having looked at the web site today, I am also concerned
with the prominent arrow that goes from faint to bold in a style very
reminiscent of the fuzzy to sharp images Extropy Institute uses to convey
the idea of growing extropy.

I don't find this issue a big deal. While I definitely do think some
confusion will arise from "Excedo", *most* people will either not be
confused in the first place, or will very soon be enlightened on finding
out more. If we were talking about a Europe-wide organization, or an
America-based organization, it might be a bigger issue for me. It would
also certainly be more of an issue if the name were closer, beginning with
"Ext..." rather than merely the first two letters.

I do find it puzzling and frustrating that a group that explicitly (a) does
not want to be part of Extropy Institute, and (b) does not consider itself
Extropian, nevertheless would choose a name (and an arrow emblem) that will
suggest Extropianism to many people. It seems clear to me that a more
distinctive name would serve both organizations better.

I've happy to see the constructive approach being taken by Berrie and
Arjen. I'm impressed by the offer of a reward for coming up with an
acceptable alternative name. (I do like Daedalus. Or: The Prometheus
Transhuman Society...) That's the spirit. That's such a capitalistic
approach that maybe you guys should reconsider whether or not you are
Extropian. :-) 

Certainly Arjen and Berrie's attitude in regard to this issue strikes me as
more enlightened and constructive than that of some others who have posted
here. Some people just love to snipe. Ah well, that's only human.

Again, I cannot speak for how Tom or other Board members will respond if
the Excedo name is used. All I can say is that I would certainly be happier
with a more distinctive name, and would feel more like putting effort into
cooperation and support with the new organization in that case.

The name issue aside, I'm thrilled to see organizational activity starting
up in Europe. Anders and others in Aleph in Sweden have already done quite
a bit, starting with Ander's single-handed Herculean web site, then the
Aleph handbook and meetings. Other previously isolated individuals such as
Eugene Leitl, Sarah Marr, and Nick Bostrom will no doubt become
increasingly connected. The level of transhumanist interest in Europe
clearly is growing at an accelerating pace. In recognition of that, the
forthcoming issue of the ExI members' newsletter, Exponent, carries a
feature on European Extropians.

Finally, Arjen, I was not claiming that Extropianism is well known in
Europe. Of course it is not. However, saying that probably not even a
hundred have heard of it was so far off the mark, largely due to work I've
done, that I had to correct that idea. I wouldn't even say that it's well
known in the States, despite nine years of work and numerous media
appearances. Even cryonics, after 25 years, is only just beginning to
penetrate the awareness of a significant fraction of the population. The
more of us there are spreading the ideas, the better. Let's just be careful
to help put a spring in each others' step, not step on each others' toes!

Onward!

Max

There is two problems:

If there are other intelligent creatures, where are they?

Maybe these two questions are related...

Is there any 'mathematical' theory?  How about using uncertain methods
to uncover possible new 'things' in mathematics?

I consider myself an Extropian, however !

I feel in the Netherlands one get's further if he/we now and
then add some water to our political-opinions-wine.

Personaly, I feel there will always be one group in
society that just has to be taken care off one way or the 
other, regardless of being in favor of free market..............
I'll learn more about Extropy along the way, and maybe one
day I can precisely say, why we should be called
transhumanist and not Extropist. However for the time
being, it just "feels" right to do it this way.

Best regards,

Berrie

In my "Wed, 19 Nov 1997 22:12:19 -0500 (EST)" email, I mentioned
a theory with three levels of language and attributed this to Karl
Popper.  I've found that Popper's theory actually has four levels of
language, and that he added only the fourth level.  The other three
came from Buehler.  I bring this up not so much to get the citations
right as because the Buehler-Popper four level system seems much
better than the three level one I outlined.

The four levels are:

1. expressive-symptomatic -- expression inner states of emotion/
 feeling (e.g., cries, laughter);
2. releasing-signalling -- trying to elicit a response in the receiver
 (e.g., growling);
3. descriptive -- communicating impressions/ideas which can be
 true or false (e.g., news reports);
4. argumentative -- reasoning which can be valid or invalid (e.g.,
 generalizations like "the free market is the best economic
 system").

My reference is John C. Eccles' _Evolution of the Brain: Creation
of the Self_ (1989).

Applied to the case of octopi, I guess they are on level two.
Getting them to level four, if this is at valid, is the goal of
uplifting put into linguistic terms.

Verily,

I know, BUT octopi are already very smart without neotony AND initially,
short development cycles might be better.  We can make changes and
get results quickly in the early phases of the project.  This would speed
up progress for later phases.  (I am assuming technology in this area will
remain roughly as is.  I make this conservative assessment because I
want the experiment to happen -- not remain an armchair speculation.)

Which sounds like the route to take, since Octopi alread appear to use
color displays for expressive purposes -- in mating and territoriality.

An obvious point, but nonetheless one that should be kept in mind.
And, of course, this means, hopefully, interspecies communication.

We should collect data on octopus development and genetics.  We
should also design tests to measure intelligence so that we can
monitor progress.  There should not only be many tests, but they
should progressively get more elaborate..  It would be ineffecient
to spend years developing octopi which were not sentient but
merely good at passing some simple test.  We would learn
something, but at high cost -- part of the cost being what we
could have learned.

I would like to set up some scenarios and preliminaries for the
above.  Any takers?  We will need minds and money.  Hopefully
enough of the former will mean less of the later is needed.

Also, because I am not a moral relativist, I would also like to
hear anyone who believes this is wrong or isn't sure speak
up.

I agree about caution BUT let's not go overboard with it.  If we had to
investigate all the potential problems with using fire before actually
using, humans would probably still be an important source of food for
leopards.:)

I do agree that amongst people who are into transhumanism and
related ideas, there is a tendency to answer problems with "as
soon as we have [insert your favorite technologic fantasy here]
all problems will be solved.  This is much like the people in the
UFO crowd who believe that once the saucers land all will be
saved.  They have no need to really try to solve problems.
Everything can be left on hold until the Great Day.  I'm not
pointing this out as an ad hominem to anyone on this list, but as
a word of warning.  Technoprogress is not guaranteed and new
tech will bring new problems -- most likely, more exciting and
better ones -- as well as benefits.

In this context, macro-engineering is bound to have large scale
effects.  I believe that is the point behind doing it.  Most projects
we want -- uplifting, uploading, augmenting, space colonization,
AI, etc. -- to see happen will have large scale effects.  The first
fires humans used probably seemed tame, but look at where
that went.  I would hope we don't burn down a forest just to
light a campfire, but there is no risk free existence.  There are
merely different paths we can take and their associated risks.
To hope AI will be invented and suddenly all the risks will
dissappear is a nice pipe dream.

Let's also add the reason the Tines gave in Vinge's _A Fire Upon the Deep_
-- well ,not for uplifting, but for contact with many different sentient
species:
to be prepared for when we do meet ETs.  (Surely, it's a long shot reason,

An outstanding idea!  However, first we have to start the uplift.  The first
few generations, I bet, will not be smart enoguh to be called sentient.  It
will require much effort.

I don't really care about public outcry.  A lot of this uplifting work can be
done underground.  I am more worried about the moral issues because
I do think there is an objective right and wrong.  I'd also hate to be
involved in creating hopeless monsters.

I fear no matter how many scruples we have, the technophobes will
protest and have the numbers.  I was thinking of presenting them with
a fait accompli.  If we can uplift octopuses -- create "sophoctopoda"
as Sandberg dubbed them -- then they, and everyone, would just have
to accept it.

But their brains are very small, comparatively speaking, and even their
smaller cousins -- other squids -- are not too smart.
 
As for sociality, http://is.dal.ca/~ceph/redocto.html calims Octopus

Wow.

Went home today after two weeks working abroad (fun but long hours),
running all day, no time for E-mail. No Sat-phone on the plane, how
primitive...
More waiting... Patience is not my strong point I guess ;-)

But o joy of joys!, I got home and downloaded my mail.
Fantastic, that's the only word I have for it.

I've been sorting out all the posts from the list and E-mails sent to me
privately (_lot's_ of those!) containing ideas for a new name. Everybody
who sent something is eligeble for the $100 Amazon certificate (digital,
untraceble and tax-free).

There is no doubt in my mind that a suitable solution will be found.
Already I've seen some real beauties!

Maybe we should clearly state the nature and extent of the relationship
between ExI and the Dutch Transhumanist Society( whatever it will be
called) on our websites and update it as we progress. Just say were it's
at, it can only add to our respectability if we show that we're grown-up
enough to teamwork very well in spite of some differences.

So if we choose a non-Ex name, will the arrow be OK? Mabe it can become the
universal symbol of all Transhumanists? I mean, Extropians are
Transhumanists aren't they? It should be noted that Henri came up with the
Logo (like the name) before he was on this list and knew much of ExI. I
guess this just show it's a universally good idea.

Yes, problably it was in retrospect, we meant no offence. Since we agree

If the galactic halo was a bunch of Dyson spheres generating antimatter

apparently every other galaxy would have the same structure.  Seems odd,

I've wondered about the intergalatic bubbles: if you had a soup of
galaxies, and randomly seeded it with rare expanding intelligence, would
you get the bubbles we observe, with visible galaxies in the areas
between colonized volumes?  I have trouble checking the idea against the
fact that we're seeing everything in the past, though, and against the

I recall having this discussion on the Transhumanist list.  Not 
everyone agrees with the arrow as a general metaphor for 
transhumanist progress, considering that (i) evolution does not 
 progress in linear fashion and (ii) original thinkers tend to graph in 
circles or spirals.

OK... Let me say that I have doubts about uplifting something as alien as
octopi.They're mostly-solitary carnivores from a part of the ecosystem we know
very little about (the cold parts of the Pacific), and they're
startlingly-advanced cases of parallel evolution. But they're molluscs. They
could turn into an enemy a little too easily for my liking. I'd prefer trying
to uplift something a little closer to us--something mammalian. Call me a
chauvinist if you want to. I used to joke about what I thought would
constitute a _real_ "crime against humanity"--giving house cats (F.
domesticus) hands. I think uplifting octopi might be almost as bad.

After Tony Hollick, our resident crackpot, showed he was ignorant enough to 
publicly malign Richard Feynman, one of the greatest men of the 20'th century, 
and offensive enough to do it in front of his son, I resolved to take Carl's 
advice about people who refuse to learn and just ignore his babbling, but
Hollick's last post was so stupid my resolve weakened.
                   

      >There _is_ a long-standing rivalry between the 'world-picture'      
      >approach to physics (i.e. my preference);and the instrumentalist

There _is_ a long-standing rivalry between the comic book approach to physics 
(i.e. your preference); and the intelligent mathematical approach 
(i.e. Feynman's preference).
              

        >Electrons held in orbit by a balance of electric force against         
        >inertia 
              

That's idiotic. The electron has very little inertia, the smallest mass of 
any non zero particle. Because the proton in an atom is so  near, the 
electron feels a huge force tugging it into the nucleus. Even the tiny force 
exerted by a feather could move an iceberg the size of a mountain if you give 
it enough time, yet we know that matter has been stable for billions of years. 
Not that you'd need billions of years, the electron's mass is so small and 
the force of attraction toward the proton is so strong that if classical 
physics were correct the electron would crash into the nucleus in much less 
than a nanosecond.

And that's far from your only problem. All the protons in the nucleus have 
the same charge and are even closer together, the repellent force they  
experience is truly astronomical, yet the nucleus does not fly apart and the 
thing that stops it sure as hell isn't inertia, it's the strong nuclear  force.


          >are in a condition which is analogous to 'free fall.' They're not     
          >accelerating in a way which causes emission of photons.      


If something is falling it is by definition accelerating and if charges 
moving in a circle are not accelerating in " a way which causes emission of 
photons" then when electrons move in a large circle in one of our high energy  
laboratories they shouldn't radiate photons but they do, and the effect is 
not subtle, the radiation is massive. The classical laws that work so well 
when the electrons move in a circle many meters in diameter are useless when 
you talk about the atom.
                 

        >Does anyonwe here think that geometry is _empirically decideable_?
                  

Is this a debatable point, does anyone here really think that the geometry of 
the universe in which we live is not empirically  decideable_?
                  

     >There's no point in quoting Maxwell at us -- Maxwell's theory has a     
     >(non-existent) aether to  transmit forces


Let's see, Maxwell was  wrong, Huygens misled, Einstein was an idiot, Bohr 
was a little slow, Hawking is ignorant, Copernicus was a plagiarist as was 
Feynman, the second law of thermodynamics is an evil plot, relativity is 
foolishness and quantum mechanics a con game. Sounds like you'd be happy with
physics as it was around 1840, unless that's not going far enough and you 
think that punk Newton shouldn't have tried to improve on Aristotle.

Your theory is that all the great physicists in at least the last 150 years 
didn't know what they were talking about, but there is an alternate theory, 
Tony Hollick doesn't know what he's talking about.

My big doubt about uplifting octopi is just how much uplifting some 
of them need.

Not all octopi are mostly-solitary, it turns out.

They live all over the oceans of the world (coastal areas only), not 
just the cold parts of the Pacific.  One of the largest and most 
intelligent species is also the dominant species of octopus in Puget 
Sound, which means that the uplifters working with this species have 
access to a large habitat area for them with complete cell-phone 
coverage, plus all the amenities of a major US metropolitan area 
about minutes (by boat) away.

As for your preference for something mammalian, might I suggest 
wolverines?  :-)

They might have implied that (not inferred it -- the LISTENER infers 
from what the SPEAKER implies), but the best evidence says that the 
current growth of the Sahara is essentially 100% caused by local 
agricultural practices.  The local increase in temperature is a side 
effect of the local agricultural practices.

The major media in the US have for years been on this big hype about 
global warming.  It's the latest upcoming disaster demanding major 
imposition of government control on everything except the major 
media.  When I was in high school (I'm gonna date myself now) there 
was a big flap over the desperate need for immediate 
government-compelled action to stave off an upcoming ICE AGE.  Now, 
it's warming.  And people -- relatively well informed, college 
educated people -- have agreed in large numbers that local increases 
in average temperature over the last few decades  were a result of 
human-caused global warming, when the fact was that over the last few 
decades the average temperature in their area had DECREASED.

I don't know if the old ice-age scare is real (I kind of doubt it -- 
and I see *no* reason to believe that we need any 
government-mandated action of any kind), but to me it looks a lot 
more plausible and better supported by the evidence than human-caused 
global warming is.

      NoNoNo....   'RTFM'!!!  >:-}  Relational Mechanics _subsumes Quantum 
      Mechanics_ as a -- statistically-based -- approximation method.  We 
      often use approximation methods in physics, as auxilliary hypotheses 
      to the 'core programme' of RM.  So you don't have to give up a handy 
      computational 'short-cut' -- RM provides deeper, more secure and 
      content-laden foundations for even greater computational advances.

      Schwartzchild has priority for the basic 'QM' idea anyway:  As I say 
      quite clearly in my RM paper:


     "In a little-remarked paper, Schwarzschild [1903] had shown that
      Maxwell's equations can also be expressed in the form of a set of 
      equations of motion of a system of particles, thus anticipating the 
      'wave-mechanics' of de Broglie and Schrodinger by several decades. 
      All that is needed, in addition to this, for the development of 
      modern 'wave mechanics', is a form of the statistically-based 
      Heisenberg 'indeterminacy relation.'

      Schwartzchild showed that the equations of a beam of electromagnetic 
      waves, as deduced from Maxwell's theory, can be recast in the form 
      of the Lagrangian equations for a stream of particles.  A moment's 
      thought should show that all wave theories in fact derive from the 
      study of particles of various kinds - elementary particles, atoms, 
      molecules - interacting either by means of forces acting over a 
      distance, or by direct contact."


      I would ask you to distinguish between the 'world-picture' of RM, 
      which is founded upon its underlying core programme, and the handy 
      short-cuts used by -- auxilliary -- approximation methods. (Ritz's 
      Approximation Method is another famous illustration).  Also read how 
      Walter Ritz calculating Chladni figures, through 39 iterations 
      ISTR...


      Your interest is appreciated, James.

Well......this will be a point for our next meeting.

Serious: points taken (I think they are very good) and we should
discuss it in our group.

Keep you all posted.
Thanks all for visiting our site, we will add more in
English asap.

A friend of mine mentioned something about proving a version of
Gdel's theorem in fuzzy logic; it essentially said something like
"certain theorems cannot be proved to more than 50%". So I think fuzzy
and other "alternative" logics can be useful in this respect.

I think that is a good idea. We have done something similar in our
Aleph FAQ. One of the things we boast of is that the views of our
members range from social democracy to libertarianism, and we tend to
get along fine.

Thanks for the idea, we have put you on the list (getting longer and longer)
We shall 'accept' nothing ;-), but you should not take that as personal

No, I didn't misunderstand you, I said the above tongue in cheek. I also
wanted to test out something I read on the ExI home page. It said something
like "and no, we do not have a sense of humour." I assume this is sarcastic?

Dear John,                                        22 November 1997

      Thank you for your -- amusing! -- response.

      Next time, just make sure that your mind is engaged before putting 
      your keyboard into gear.  OK?  >:-}


      As Popper says, the 'wrong' approach to science betrays itself in 
      its craving to be 'right.'  You can have certainty, or you can have 
      depth, but you cannot have both.  My state of mind has little or 
      nothing to do with physics, except to a reductionist monist.  A 
      moment's thought should show this, but thinking is _so_ hard, isn't 
      it?  And a moment is _such_ a long time...  >:-}
      
      Clearly, you -- and Carl -- are unreasoningly pissed off by my 
      pointing out the origins of Quantum ElectroDynamics in Walter Ritz's 
      [1908] work.  Yet others before me have pointed this fact out, and 
      Feynman and Wheeler's interested in Ritz's work is well-known among 
      historians of science.

      As Paul Forman (Smithsonian) writes, Ritz's work deserves critical 
      extension.  I'm glad that Richard Feynman did just that; and sorry 
      he didn't acknowledge Ritz's priority.  We all want to be original, 
      of course, but the nature of the creation of World Three, the world 
      of Objective knowledge, makes that kinda difficult...

      There you go...  I also think Richard Feynman is one of the greatest 
      men of the Twentieth Century.  He's a great writer, especially.  
      Matter/forces/empty space metaphysics is hardly new...  The Ancient 
      Greeks gave us the basic idea thousands of years ago...


      Still and all, good criticism is hard to find, and is often more 
      valuable than praise or friendship.  I just wish yours was better...

      Popper describes your view as vicious; now you're proving him right.

      "Inertial mass: n. the mass of a body as determined by its momentum, 
      as opposed to gravitational mass.  The acceleration of a falling 
      body is inversely proportional to its gravitational mass: as all 
      falling bodies have the same constant acceleration the two types of 
      mass must be equal."

      
      So follow the logic: at a sufficient orbital velocity, the inertial 
      mass _must_ balance the electric force attraction of the electron to 
      the nucleus.  The logic is _unbreakable_.  You're 'Arsgefichte'...
      
      The electron orbits are 'locked' into quantized fixed series 
      ('shells') by the necessity for the wiggly electron paths to form 
      exact integer frequencies (so the ends of the orbital paths 'join 
      up', right?).  This is all in Petr Beckmann's 'Einstein Plus Two' 
      [1997].  R.A. Waldron deals with Beckmann and Mandics, BTW.  They 
      were friends (and rivals).
      
      Petr Beckmann received his M.Sc. and Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering 
      from the University of Prague.  He received his Dr. Sc. degree from 
      the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences in 1962.  He defected to the 
      US in 1963, and taught at the University of Colorado until his 
      retirement in 19681.  ISTR he was Professor Emeritus there.  I've 
      chatted with him on a number of occasions.  He gave me my copy of 
      'Einstein Plus Two.'  I think he's competent.
      
      He has published more than sixty scientific papers, mostly devoted 
      to electromagnetics and probability theory.  His best-selling books 
      include 'A History of Pi' [1981];  and 'The Health Hazards of NOT 
      Going Nuclear.' [1985]  He edited and published 'Access To Energy', 
      the pro-science, pro-technology, pro-free enterprise monthly 
      newsletter, now in its 25th year, with 15 000 subscribers.

      <Sigh>.  I explicity point out that the extension of Relational 
      Mechanics to the nucleus is the task of the Third Revision, 
      whereupon it will become Relational Dynamics.  Quantum 
      Chromodynamics is a hopeless mess, so demolishing it and 
      reconstructing particle physics along classical lines (the original 
      project of Bohr and Einstein, by the way) will be great fun.  You 
      seriously expect me to do all this _on my own_ on the back of an 
      envelope, when my 'competition' has thousands of people, and 
      billions of Statist dollars and vast Statist laboratories staffed by 
      conformists with obsolete State-certified 'credential' (all of which 
      we will take over in due course, natch!  >:-} ).

      You're being tedious.  Bohr's hydrogen atom is essentially 
      'classical.'  I explain why the electron doesn't (ordinarily) 
      radiate in orbit.  No angular acceleration.  If it constantly 
      radiated, it would be violating the conservation laws. It can't.
      
      Then you shiftily start to give us this stuff about ring 
      accelerators.  Since I actually worked at Bristol University with a 
      CERN project (hunting muons) which involved visiting NIMROD at 
      Harwell (England) when it was under construction, and since a friend 
      of mine is Director, the Neutron Spallation facility at the 
      Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, and designs the darned things, I 
      should know a little bit about all this.  And I can even read.

      You're on dangerous ground now.  As Lakatos points out, Classical 
      Mechanics can be derived _inductively_.  Since Classical Mechanics 
      is based on Euclid's geometry, with the addition of mass-points and 
      vector forces, you've just played Russian Ruolette with all six 
      chambers loaded.  And you lost...   >:-}

      Wrong.  I'm quite happy with 'physics' as it is now (i.e. including 
      Relational Mechanics), with the exception of the problems of 
      particle physics.  Abraham Pais' book "Inward Bound" is a 
      clearly-delineated descent into madness.  I don't have to follow 
      him, do I?.  Neither do you.  Neither does anyone else.

      I 'walk back the cat', as the counterspies say.  I evaluate past 
      problem-situations and data in the light of present knowledge.  
      20/20 hindsight!  Easy-peasy!

      Following Alfred Tarski's Correspondence Theory of Truth utilizing a 
      metalanguage (and it doesn't get any better than this):
      
      "The statement 'Tony Hollick ne sait pas quest'ce que'il parle' is 
      true if -- AND ONLY IF -- Tony Hollick doesn't know what he's 
      talking about."  
      
      You're now demolished on two counts:
      
      [A] I plainly do know that of which I speak: and
      
      [B] What I say corresponds with the facts.


      Thanks for an interesting exchange!

I've found a few octopodes (allegedly, the correct plural of "octopus")
pages that might get all of us up to speed on this issue.  These are:

http://www.marinelab.sarasota.fl.us/OCTOPI.HTM (layperson level
 knowledge)

http://is.dal.ca/~ceph/faq.html (a FAQ which covers many issues,
 though it seems more oriented toward those who want a neat
 addition to their fishtank)

http://is.dal.ca/~ceph/rearing.html (this is an essay on rearing
 octopodes, which should prove helpful to any would be uplifters)

http://www.ffexpress.com/setverts.htm (is a pet store which sells
 brown octopodes (O. vulgaris) for $22 per organism

http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~palaeont/FOSSCOL.HTM (devoted
 to evolution of Octopodes and related phyla)

http://www.siris.si.edu/ (the Smithsonian Institution's bibliography
 page which has loads of listings for cephalapods, though the
 texts themselves are not accessible there)

P.S.:  I'm using UPL in all my posts on uplifting from here on, to make
archiving/reference easier.

I question the question.  Perhaps the universe is open, hyperbolic and
infinite in extent.  If so, then the search for the missing mass is like
trying to find caloric or measure the Earth's movement against the
aether.

Good question.  Let's go find out!:)

In an effort to move forward to a concrete plan to uplift a nonhuman
to sentience, I've made the following list.

0.  Explicate Goal
	0.1 explicate main goal
	0.2 differentiate subgoals
1.  Get data on extant types.
	1.1 genetics
	1.2 behavior
	1.3 reproduction
	1.4 development/life cycle
	1.5 handling
2.  Create Selection Criteria.
	2.1 genetics
	2.2 beahvior
	2.3 reproduction
	2.4 development/life cycle
	2.5 handling
	2.6 projected costs
3.  Get/Create Modification Methods
	3.1 genetic
	3.2 hormonal
	3.3 surgery	
	3.4 machine interface
4.  Get/Create Tests
	4.1 research and modify existing intelligence tests
	4.2 get and modify tests from ethology studies in 1.2
	4.3 develop new tests
5.  Implement Modifications
6.  Test Modifications
7.  Iterate Steps 3 through 6 until 0 is met or funding runs out:)

This is a preliminary and I offer it in hopes it will be improved.
Obviously, the steps listed need to be explicated.

Right now, though we've discussed many different steps
above, the main focus has been on step 0.  The main
goal is "achieving sentience in a nonhuman species."
(Any debate here?)  One subgoal is "making the non-
human species capable of language in the human
sense -- though not necessarily human in at its details."

We have discussed other steps, such as 2,3, and 4,
though not in detail.  I suggest we move the discussion
along to step 1 and after.  (Step 1 and 2 kind of feed
back into each other.  One might list out potential
candidates -- as Warrl kyree Tale'sedrin <warrl@blarg.net>
did on 19971116 post, but this pressupposed some
criteria.  I tend to think that we should, for now, settle
on Octopoda and use step 2 to decide on which
species.)

Note: I am proposing we actually do this, not discuss
it in hopes that the tecnogenie will carry out our
bidding.  (Progress is what we make happen!)  Is
anyone truly interested in participating at this time
in an actual uplift?

My question to this would be:  Why, then, would our
minds work to this -- i.e., to put things into causal
stories?  (I'm using "causal stories" here to show
the link more directly between stories and causality.
Are there acausal stories?)

I admit they are not causal in the strict linear form most
would associate with causality.  I would hasten to add
that, though I don't want to make the idea of causality
so broad as to defy any attempt at criticism, I generally
accept the neoAristotelean/Objectivist view of causality
-- which is of it as identity applied to change.  In other
words, things act according to their nature.  This view
need not rule out emergent behavior and the like.

However, I see what you mean and admit causality
and the sort of thing Mark Turner's THE LITERARY
MIND seems to be about overlap to a large extent,
but are not identical.  I still believe a lot of his view
-- from the scraps quoted here and elsewhere -- can
be subsumed under causality.  Saying that, of course,
should not be taken to mean one to close all inquiry
and merely mummble "Ah, causality!"  Just as
biological processes are fundamentally physico-
chemical ones, this does not mean they shouldn't
be seen as a special type of process, almost in a
class by themselves.

>It seems to me to be saying that human thought is
>based principally on pattern matching,

I would say that consciousness is basically pattern
matching.  Human thought is only one type of
consciousness.  This seems to happen on all levels
of consciousness.  Even automatic things, such as
my eyes imaging my bathrobe, are examples of
pattern matching.

>an on-going

The statement here implies that there are causal
threads -- i.e., that causality is operative!:)

>We may frequently

>though the causality really isn't there.

This is only to say that the mind is fallible.  This sort of
thing would cut against any theory of mind, though.  To
say, we sometimes get things wrong does not explain
why or why we often get things right.

>Anyway, I haven't actually had a chance to read

I too, though I've enough books now that I should read
that I will need to get my life extended just for that!

This is the usual starting point for all who attack
causality.  The thing is not that we "humanize them
by assigning 'cause'" BUT that we assign causes
at all.  To say we do something in such a way is not
a refutation of it.  Nor is it a proof that it has nothing
to do with reality.  Instead, it might actually the way
minds have to understand reality BECAUSE there
are causes -- even given that we might never
know all of them or be mistaken about quite a few.

I disagree, and note how he has assigned a cause
here!  He implies "neural processes" are the cause
of the way we "humanize" the "interrelations of
objects and events.":)  As usual, those who deny
axioms must use the very axioms in the denial.

But observer-related need not imply nonobjective.

But even so, the explanations do not contradict one
another and fit together well.  Remove the instruction
from the program and, ceterus paribus, the beep will
not happen.  Likewise, remove the speaker wires
and, ditto, ditto.:)  To use another example, imagine
you witness one woman shoot another.  The shot
man dies.  You assign the cause of her death as
the other woman.  The medical examiner assigns
the cause as a bullet wound to the heart.  Etc.
Do the various views conflict?  No.  Instead they
fit together just like my friend and I seeing my bath-
robe from different angles.  (He might even be
color blind.)  His view is not wrong while mine is
right, or vice versa, we just have different yet
integratable perspectives.

This is not to say any causal picture is right.  The
person who believes that the gods caused the
computer to beep, or magic made the woman die,
or a government conspiracy makes the bathrobe
look different to Bob and me has made a mistake
-- entertaining as it might be.:)

Not really.  I don't accept Cartesian dualism or the
alternative you offer.  Instead, I see causality as
active in a universe that is a totality -- an integrated
whole.  That mind is a material process does not
mean causality is a chimera.

Actually, they are found all over the place.  If they were only in the cold
parts of
the Pacific, how did they wind up in Mediterranean cuisine?  It is the giant
octopus which is native to the _Northeast_ Pacific.  Though this organism has
lots of potential, I think due to problems with handling and feeding it
(octopodes
of most types are big eaters, probably because of their active lifestyle),
it would
not be a good candidate for uplifting.  I am more inclined toward the brown
octopus, which is found on both American coasts, is much smaller, more studied 
and more common.

I don't completely understand your molluscaphobia:), but I can just as easily
think of uplifting mammals being a threat.  But right now, the most dangerous
mammals for you and me are humans.  I am more likely to be killed or injured
by a human, either intentionally or otherwise, then I am by any mollusc or
other organism, save microrganisms.

I don't think intelligence plus nonhuman form equals enemy of humanity.
If so, what will posthumans be?

You can send the $100 along to the Estate of the late Dr Gerald Feinberg,
who did a lot of the early work on the hypothetical tachyon and many years
proposed a Prometheus Foundation (IIRC) devoted to exploring long-range
options for humanity; he wrote a nice book about it, probably out of print
now.

*Daedalus*, BTW, is the title of a long-established journal of science and
the arts, as well as the pseudonym of a witty scientist who once had a
weekly column in *New Scientist* and later moved, I think, to *Nature*.
His ideas were not a million miles from the wild & wacky stuff that appears
on this list, although under his own name he famously lambasted Drexler's
nanotech.  (Ref'd in Ed Regis's NANO! I think, but since the fiend hasn't
included an index...)

Yes, but this sociality is only expressed during sex!  Mind you, that is one

Meet the Transistor of the Future
                     by Ilan Greenberg 

                     8:51am  21.Nov.97.PST
                     Things will get a lot faster in about 12 years. 

                     That's when computers and other digital devices will
                     reap the rewards of Bell Laboratories' latest transistor
                     advance. The research arm of Lucent Technologies
                     published a report this week outlining its newest world
                     record, a transistor that is four times smaller, five
times
                     faster, and draws 60 to 160 times less power than
                     today's similar devices. 

                     While Bell Labs and others - most recently Toshiba in
                     Japan - have built small transistors in the past, this
                     latest advance in nanotechnology is the most
                     promising new technology for building the kind of
                     power-integrated circuits that boast many billions of
                     transistors on a single silicon chip, as opposed to
                     today's chips, which pack mere millions of transistors
                     together. 

                     [...]

                     While the achievement is an engineering milestone,
                     many other advances must come together before this
                     new transistor - which is only 182 atoms wide and
                     boasts an insulation layer that is only three layers of
                     atoms thick - appears in commercially available
                     devices.

It would still be missing, since it is detected (or rather, a
discrepance is detected) by the rotation curves of galaxies. The
cosmological density doesn't come into the question directly, although
many scientists no doubt hope the missing mass sets omega=1.

Obviously I failed the humor part of the Turing test. Oh well, I can
still manage to fool people at the scientific bombasm test. :-)

Sorry for reacting that way, my norepinephrine levels have been a bit
too high recently - we better find a way to directly deal with the
adenoisine-tiredness signals than caffeine. As you might know,
caffeine also impairs cognition dealing with uncertain or contradictory
stimuli, which might include humor. Well worth researching.

We both claim to understand one another, but I still feel I'm utterly
failing to get my point across.  Lojban, in order to be parsed by a
linguistically-capable human mind, must have nouns and verbs.  It DOESN'T
MATTER that Lojbanist's don't call them that; these categories are, as you
admit, a wired-in structure.  They're simply a part of how language works.
It doesn't matter that Lojban's creators don't make phonological
distinctions between noun and verb forms, or that you can use the word
for "blue" as a noun or as a verb or as an adjective; all those parts of
speech are how the pieces of information are relayed and relate to one
another.  Read on.

 It may well be that I and

All I'm trying to say is, if you parse a string of phonemes in a way that
corresponds to a verb in a natural language, it's a verb.  Period.  I've
read everything that the Lojban site offers, and I still see nothing that
distinguishes its not-verbs from verbs.  Give me some examples of
predicates that don't correspond to a verb phrase (confusingly labeld "the
predicate" in syntax) and I'll do my best to understand how they're not
verbs.

 Many other verbs--even

Ah, I start to see the problem.  Being a verb doesn't have anything to do
with volition, intention, motion, or time.  This is the fault of those
damned lies we're taught in elementary school. "A noun is a person, place,
thing, or idea.  A verb is an action."  As I've written many times now, a
verb is something that acts verby.  Well, if we agree that "belong,"
"resemble," "surround," etc., are verbs in English and other natural
languages but don't demonstrate "action" in the sense of movement,
intention, etc., what does that leave?  The relationship between
"actors."  And that, philes, is all verbs are.

BTW, it may be that verbs for abstractions, mental states, and
relationships have the same form as normal things we think of as verbs
(run, kiss, walk, excoriate) because language evolved primarily to
communicate social information and was later expanded to communicate other
things (hunting, gathering, where to find water, how far away the nearest
cave is) by metaphorically extending intension, etc., to non-social
topics.  In other words, the groundwork was already there for showing
action and relationship ("Hey Grok, you won't believe what Zog just did!
Ook found her giving berries to Lop from the clan on the other side of the
valley!"); these algorithms were expanded by using the same patterns for
describing things outside of the social world.

I've never been convinced there's anything wrong with language.  I can't
even remember the last time anyone said anything I found ambiguous because
of the structure.  It's been my experience that people have to work 
to come up with a string that _anyone_ would find ambiguous.  Let's see...
"The man wrote the letter on train."  Now, this _could_ mean that Mr
Vandal took some paint and wrote the letter "Q" on the side of a
locomotive, but that meaning would be made clear by the context.

"A man in a trainyard thought about the letter Q.  He wrote the letter on
a train."

"After leaving Shanghai, the traveler thought about her brother and
decided to write him. She wrote the letter on a train."

Real speech isn't an assortment of bizarre propositions made in isolation.
Context, context context!

There's plenty of ambiguity around, but that has more to do with foggy
thinking than the words those thoughts are framed in.

On the other hand, I can imagine some ways that language could be better.
For example, it would be very useful to be able to follow three or four
discourses at once; say, hearing two people talking at the same time while
reading two braille books, or to be able to produce several streams at
the same time.

The following is assuming that current scientific 
usage is consistent with Latin, rather than merely based on it... 
which is quite an assumption...

The plural of "octopus" is "octopi".  

"Octopodes" is the proper plural of "octopod" which means "eight 
feet" (in terms of appendages, not distance).  An octopus is indeed 
an octopod.  So is a squid, or a crab, or a lobster, or a spider, or 
a daddy-long-legs (which isn't a spider), or a scorpion if I remember 
right.  Among others.

Of all these, I think that octopi are the only short-term viable 
candidates for uplift, and at least in the case of the Pacific giant, 
may already be uplifted without human intervention.

By the way, I've heard it plausibly suggested that octopi don't 
really need to be constantly immersed in water to do well.  They do 
require high humidity, and they do require near-neutral bouyancy with 
regard to the space around them.  And gills out of water usually 
don't work well, so they may need some help with respiration.  But 
high humidity we can do in air, and near-neutral bouyancy is readily 
achievable in space.

And, given comparable brain power, I would expect octopi 
to be better (or at least have a stronger aptitude) than humans at 
three-dimensional navigation.

Linguistics in the transformational-generative tradition is trying to make
a theory which explains the hows and whats of natural language.  The
Lojban program is doing something analogous to engineers trying to build a
hyperspace drive while ignoring quantuum and relativity theory.  I'm not
that current theories in linguistics are as satisfactory as those two in
physics, but the point is you need to have some idea of the territory
before you try to landscape it.

That depends on what they do with it.  Chances are, they will creolize it.
Creoles conform in every way to UG after taking a pidgin as a starting
point, as do every other language with native speakers.  This includes
the languages of Australian Aborigines and New Guineau highlands, who
were separated from the rest of the world's peoples for about 40,000
years.  That kind of universality says a lot about the accuracy of UG. 
If Chomsky & pals are right and a human language must, by definition,
conform to UG, children raised with Lojban will not turn it into anything
particularly interesting.

I don't think Lojban is alien to the way languages handle things but to
the way people express their thoughts.  Language didn't appear for the
purpose of expressing propositional logic, and most people don't think in
terms of hairsplitting logical distinctions.  If we want to make the
logical implications of our thoughts explicit, we can do so within the
confines of natural language.  The point is, why bother?  Teaching someone
a created language is not the simplest way of getting them to think
critically.

As many people hate Chomsky's guts as follow research in his wake; what
can you say, he made it into a real science and not something
anthropologists and philologists did in their spare time.  I really don't
see anyone as treating him like a god; he just made a lot of work possible
that other social scientists had ruled out due to logical positivism.

Yes, there have been shown to be very, very weak effects of language on
thought, mostly unconscious and unimportant.  For example, English
speakers need to explicitly say whether they learned something directly or
by hearsay; Navajo (IIRC) does this automatically, but doesn't specify
time. 

As for perceptual effects, I can only assume you refer to studies on how
the visible spectrum is named.   Every language on Earth breaks up colors
into, at the very least "light" or "white" and "dark" or "black."
Thereafter is a distinct hierarchy of color names.  If a third color is
distinguished, it is always red.  Four colors adds green, yellow, or blue,
depending on how you ask.  Five colors includes a second of those three,
and so on.  And there is a hierarchy of implication: if a language has a
word for "brown" or "grey," it has the basics in the Crayola 8-pack.

Does this mean that speakers of different languages see different colors?
Of course not, as tests with chips tinted in colors not distinguised by
the testees' language show.  People everywhere see the same colors; we all
have the same eyes and it seems improbable that language, however powerful
a system it may be, can reach down and rewire the retina.  We see the same
spectrum; where the distinctions are drawn are different, but not
unimaginably so.  Furthermore, even if, say, Hopi lacks the vocabulary to
talk about, say, libertarianism, speakers are very good at making new
words to express new ideas, either by compounds, abreviations, acronyms,
borrowing, or other such devices.

So you're right, linguistic determinism is dismissed by mainstream
linguistics except in a very weak form which surprises nobody anyway.
And until somebody demonstrates that the conceptual systems of some pair
of languages are different to the point where they CAN'T be translated
into each other, nobody will take Whorf seriously.  His writings certainly
aren't impressive, and all his examples (e.g., the Hopi and their "utterly
different" view of time) were wrong.

This has nothing to do with linguistic determinism.  "Hearing the breaks,"
i.e., distinguishing words, is completely a result of the interference of
literacy, as studies with non-literate peoples and pre-literate children
have shown.  Spaces between words were, AFAIK, a European innovation of
the medieval period; classical Mediterranean and Indian texts do not show
breaks between words.  Literacy interferes with a lot of things, such as
getting people to make phonological distinctions.  Ask someone to say a
word backwards; chances are, they'll pronounce the _spelling_ backwards.
"Sink" [singk] --> "k'niss." 

 These effects deserve

Again, that's strictly a matter of orthographic fashion.

Not particularly interesting.  Compare the spoken English of a German and
a Russian who use English to communicate by email; or any other
international language, such as Russian used in the former soviet
republics.  More than this, there is study in the emergence of "world
Englishes" --the standard English of regions using English as a 2nd
language, such as Nigeria, Sri Lanka, and many other Commonwealth nations.
It doesn't particularly matter whence a language comes "originally"; local
environment prevails, asside from the leveling effect provided by
communication between regions.

It's an interesting project, but unless the research is carried out with
an understanding of contemporary theories in mainstream linguistics, it's
simply not going to go anywhere.  Furthermore, there's a long history of
new, improved languages that utterly failed to catch on.  Esperanto,
anyone?  There's no need for something like Lojban when natural languages
have so much more communicative possibilities in terms of vocabulary and
literary heritage.  To create an auxilliary language with as great
expressive ability as any real language would require an unimaginable
amount of work.

This depends on whether language comes from an innate structure or from an
interaction of circuits for symbolic thinking and a vocal (or visual)
signal using social environment.  Connectionism isn't quite as persuasive
nor as widely accepted as innateness, but it certainly has adherants.

Anyway, if it is a matter of a language module, we need to figure out how
to build one in an uplift-species' brain.

Not at all; I thought it pretty clever.  Anyone who gets upset by a clearly
joking list of mere Ex-words sorely misundertands the principles at issue.
 No one can own a word.  But organizations that use certain identifying marks
do have the right to prevent others from using confusingly similar marks in
similar circumstances.

ExI would not have any claim against someone using "Extro" in, say, a news
story about Extropianism.  It would probably not have a claim against someone
naming, say, a shampoo "Extro".  But it would have a claim against someone
using a similar mark to achieve similar goals--say, someone naming their
transhumanist group "Ekstro."

>How about putting ExI next to names when refering top them?

Not necessary; the marks alone should suffice.  Indeed, to follow this course
of action might actually harm ExI's claims to the distinctiveness of its
marks.  Thanks for trying to help, though.

even accounting for that leaves the amount of mass needed under current
estimates between one tenth and one hundredth that need to "close" the
universe -- i.e., give it global positive curvature.  I've talked to a few
friends
of mine who have backgrounds in the field, and they agree.  They believe
that the cosmologists who subscribe to positive curvature are far from
proving their case.  I suspect other motives at work -- such as intuition:
an open, infinite and everexpanding universe is not neat and simple like
a finite, closed one that bounces back and forth.

Arjen, and eavesdroppers, 

I was not offended by your taking our discussion public, but its effect on my
workload vexes me.  Frankly, I do not think that most casual observers do a
very good job with the complicated and subtle issues at stake.  Even some
interested parties flub them.  While I'll let a great many silly statements
by third parties slip by, a few inevitably pop up that might harm ExI's
interests if not challenged (or so I, a worrywort about ExI's intellectual
property, judge).  I did not mind teaching trademark and unfair competition
law when paid as professor to do so, and I did not mind writing briefs on the
subject when I worked as an attorney in Silicon Valley.  But I've got a life
now, for Newton's sake, and better things to do.

Still, if the public appeal for new names generates an alternative label that
satisfies all parties, I'd regard that as ample recompense.

Tom

Of course!  And how such a module can be integrated so that we don't wind

Pedant-time:

Octopus is Greek, oktopoys.  The "oy" (omicron ypsilon) is pronounced
"oo" as in "boot", and Latin did not distinguish orthographically between
a long and a short u. 

poys, "foot"
		singular	plural
nominative	poys		podes
genitive	podos		podon
dative		podi		podois
accusitive	poda		podoys

There are a lot of words where the NOM.SG ending is different from the
real root word.

Anyway, contemporary usage of Graeco-Latin words doesn't have much to do
with the real languages.  It always annoys me, fer ex, when someone says
"boni" instead of "bonuses"; it's unnecessary.

According to some of the literature I've read, they often leave their
tanks to raid other tanks, and then return to their original tanks.
I don't think any of the squid have the same capability -- for
comparison.

There are two different types of crackpots. the amusing and the vicious.  
Despite Tony Hollick's attack on the memory of a very great man I honestly 
wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt and put him in the amusing 
category, and when in the middle of a muddled description of quantum mechanics 
he started to rant about flying saucers, false teeth, and electrically powered 
roller skates I thought there was real hope, but then he said this:

 "I don't think much of Hawking's ideas.  Look what his mind did to his poor   
  body...  Would you want that to happen to you?" 

Suddenly I stopped laughing and knew which category to put Mr. Hollick into.

Sasha:

Just speaking very generally, it seems that in many of your
interests, you would be assisted by a general theory of
"complex functionally-defined systems". (So would I!)
Perhaps the first step in making such a theory would be
to identify all the possible elementary functions, and 
"rules of combination" - ie ways in which elementary functional
systems can be combined to make more complex ones.

The theory of computation offers some precedent for this
sort of theory, but it ignores functions which have some
physical component (e.g. "energy production"). I also think
that existing computational theory doesn't really address
the semantic level very much. Someone called James Miller
wrote a book, _Living systems_, advancing a "general
theory of living systems" which claims that each living
system must contain 19 (!) types of subsystems at least,
or at least must have access to such subsystems (which 
might be located in another organism, or externally).
I have a list of Miller's subsystem types at
http://www.thehub.com.au/~mitch/systems.html. I don't
recall anything in Miller's book which said that these
are *all* the types of functional systems there can be.

Identifying *all* the possibilities for elementary
functional systems I think requires some metaphysical
assumptions, about what sorts of relationships are
possible. Maybe one could find prototypes for such
arguments somewhere in the philosophical literature;
I think Kant claimed that his enumeration of judgment-types
(in _Critique of Pure Reason_) was necessarily complete 
(although I never found the actual argument demonstrating 
this).

 Okay, other people have nailed me on this one. Yes, I was assuming that the giant
octopus was the only one worth considering, since trying to uplift a smaller one
might turn out to be like trying to uplift a capuchin monkey. The carrying capacity
of the larger frame seems better to me. The expense issue is about the same for
cetaceans and primates: the bigger they are, the more they eat.

I am aware that octopi (generic) are found lots of places. Sorry if my hurried
assumptions made it seem as if I didn't.

I don't think you are taking the point I'm tryiing to make, which is that molluscs
are very nearly as different from us, evolutionarily, as insects. This almost puts
them in the microorganism camp {in the old joke about Tonto and the Lone Ranger, it
wasn't the Lone Ranger who said, "What you mean, 'we'?").

The points you make above are true but irrelevant--it is _you-all_ who are talking
about making some other species of critter an *additional* potential threat. Please
note that such potential is not something I invent; the potential is a consequence
of the increased capabilities you-all propose to add.

I think uplift is a fine thing to do once we aren't tethered to this particular
ball of rock.

I agree with you when you mention (in a portion of post I've elided for bandwidth's
sake) that mammals are risky too. Someone mentioned wolverines--yeah, right.

If they occupy the same niches as humans, they'll compete with us for the same
resources but be at least easy to find. If they occupy very different niches,
they'll hit resources we only dimly understand or have a handle on, and they'll be
harder to neutralize if we ever war.

Not when, but _if_.

I am taking the "con" side in this argument because it's one I feel needs taking
up--suppose "we" succeed in uplifting one or more species, but "we" screw up and
the culture falls back to a stabler plateau for a while? One, say, at around the
just-able-to-build-an-Aqualung level?

It's customary for Europeans to regard Yanks as naive and not-worldly. :) :)
This is not disasturbation, it's a question of prudence.

That remains to be seen, doesn't it? You talk as if there will be a standard-issue
posthuman. "Expectation foils perception." We might _all_ be wrong. A very dear
acquaintance of mine wanted to eat the universe until I convinced him some of us
would make it harder for him. Others might take more convincing. I think the means
of convincing are likely to be traditional.

OK, I'll formally mention (having elected myself as Devil's Advocate
here) that your plan does not include:

A.) Handling publicity (or secrecy)
B.) Handling physical security: extra-lab *and* intra
C.) An explicit guarantee of pulling the plug if needed
D.) A description of what would be grounds for pulling the plug
E.) A description of what mechanisms would be used to pull the plug.

This is all stuff that's standard for dealing with those microorganisms
you mentioned in a post to me.

If you don't consider uplift at least as risky as working with
bioweapons... _why_?

This is my experience too, and it seems to suggest that we should
think of how we use the net to communicate, plan and act. For diffuse
questions where the debate is itself important (such as looking at a
problem from different angles) a mailing list works well, but it
doesn't work well if we want something done in a focused manner. So in
the future it may be a good idea think about how widely we want to
disperse our attention; it is a non-trivial problem to balance
efficiency with an useful spread of opinions.

Maybe it's an idea to anounce a topic in the list and ask for 
the relevant people to speak up and mail to the one who
asks for the topic to be discussed. Then he/she will become
the owner (not the ruler) of the discussing process and will
send everybody involved "CC" a mail with what he/she would like to 
achive. After this he/she posts the results (or updates) again in the list
(with permission to quote). This last one is dangerous of course, 
since it could be that the whole thing starts again.....
But we could invent some voluntary rule for this.

Because we are dealing with a multicellular animal.  Much easier to
control than current microbes.  Also, the octopus is a marine
animal.  Despite its escape artist skills, it will be much easier to
control such an organism, which is less likely to, say, escape to
the oceans from my apartment than, say, an uplifted rabbit or dog.

      I tell the truth, and document it, and argue critically and rationally.

      John responds to good-faith writings by a 'veritable vocabulary of

      and indeed _facts_ which he dislikes.  He defends orthodoxy.

      I take great exception to this -- 'Extropians' is supposed to be an 
      intelligent 'flame-free' venue...  John Clark owes me an apology.

      'With all the attention devoted in recent years to perceived

      have barely noticed that the most critically scarce commodity of all

I've not seen any studies done on giant octopodes that make them appear more
likely candidates.  To make an analogy, the dolphin appears more intelligent
than
the blue whale.  So, larger might not mean better.  Humans are also smaller than
a lot of other land mammals, from elephants on down, yet our intelligence seems
-- anybody want to argue otherwise?:) -- much more than theirs.

Do you assume that uplifted octopodes would see humans as a threat?  I think
there is more reason to assume otherwise.  (I admit, I would not try to uplift
insects.:)  We live in different environments and our ecologies are a bit
different
too.  (Admittedly, humans do eat octopodes and many of the things that
octopodes prey on, but octopodes do not raid human farms or livestock --
for now.:)

It seems like a kind of speciescentrism -- akin to racism.  If Black learn
to read
and write...  If octopodes...  See the similarity?

If this fear is valid, why not wipe out any species that might threaten us now?
Why not exterminate dolphins and nonhuman primates?

The assumption here is that smarter octopodes would not change in any other
relevant way.  Yet humans today do not live like our ancestors.  We do not
scavange after lion kills, etc.

That is far fetched.  If there is war, what makes you think that all
octopodes would
be antihuman?  What makes you think there would be a sort of species wide
consensus?  Aside from that, we humans do now possess an understanding of
octopodes' needs and limits, greater than theirs of ours.

>Not when, but _if_.

A big if.  It might be humanity that teaches octopodes war NOT vice versa.

What if we don't uplift and the culture falls back?  That would be a
disaster too.

The problem here is What if we don't do it?  That has consequences too.  Also,
the cat is out of the bag.  If someone wants to do it, it will be done.  I
think it is
only an engineering problem.  If anything of your worst case scenarios are true,
then it might be better to have many uplifted species than one.  Balance of
power!

Most (if not 99.9%) of anti-Microsoft hype is due purely to the herd
mentality.  It all started YEARS ago when MS was still located in New
Mexico.  Bill et al wrote a BASIC compiler for the early micros.  The MS
boys used to drive around in a van and demonstrate it to try and sell
it.  This was when most systems used tape for uploading and storage.
They visited the Homebrew Computer Club in Silicon Valley and in their
excitement a tape was stolen (supposedly one that would run on the
pre-apples being developed by Woz and Jobs).  The tape was duplicated
and given away free to all who wanted it.  Bill found out and wrote a
letter to the early Dr. Dobb's journal (it wasn't called that
then...forgot exactly the name) about how whoever took the tape was a
thief and blah blah.  This did not sit well with the early enthusiasts
who basically saw all software as public domain.

All the wannabe's of the world just got onboard the anti-Bill campaign
to 'belong'.

The rest is history.

For the record, I'm speaking boldly in these matters because it's important
that someone do it. I don't mind sounding foolish.

These are points I figured you'd mention, and they seem sound. But permit
me to remind you that microbes don't think for themselves, and as far as we
know don't take an interest in their whereabouts.

I don't know if you're familiar with Dr. Fouts' work with the signing
chimpanzees (including the famous Washoe). One of the points he raised in
discussions with me was that the chimps were all stuck in an environment
not unlike a prison camp. How grateful/cooperative/happy/docile do you
think the organisms you choose to uplift will be? Or are you just thinking
of the final result? This is another reason, perhaps, to prefer mammals--I
suspect people can learn to "read" them easier. OTOH, a chimp with a pull
strength of half a ton could dismember a human if it ever seemed like a
really good idea, and Fouts still had all his arms & legs last time I saw
him. :)

Daniel, I'm not just worried about a team of red octopi storming the
streets outside your apartment armed with steak knives and carrying
sandwich-bag knapsacks of seawater (:)). I'm concerned that you not blind
yourself to _possible_ real danger to _yourself_ should you start to succeed.

With uplifiting, we face some of the same problems we face in dealing with
AI's. One of these similarities is our inability to actually know *WHEN* the
uplift has reached the level of sentience. (I.e., when do we *STOP* the
uplift?) Given that the uplift is likely to be a gradual process, we will
certainly have to find a method of estimating intelligence based on something
other than observed behavior or observed problem-solving ability. I suppose a
marked increase in brain activity/waves may be a clue, but this seems to be a
relatively inelegant, and in the end, inconclusive means of estimating our
success or failure. One concern that would stem from this is that the
newly-created intelligence may not *want* us to know it is intelligent. In such
a case, it is possible that we would have discovered the means to uplift
ourselves, but instead of doing so, we continue iterating our uplift procedures
on the test subjects, and before we realize it, we have uplifted them to be
smarter than we are.

Maybe this is not probable, but I think finding some way to answer the question
of when we stop the uplift is necessary before we can even begin.

Regards,

Keith

Daedalus (David E. H. Jones) did lambaste nanotechnology while

temporal peculiarities.

True for now, until nanotech makes nanomachines which can and do.
By the same token, a sentient nonhuman might also see the risks inherent
in becoming a threat to the species which uplifted it.

Keith Elis brings up a similar point in regards to AI, but both Elis' and
Butler's
fears can be applied to any transhuman project.  AI, uplifting, augmentation
of humans, allowing MS Windows 98 to hit the market, or Marylin Manson
to play in NJ, all have consequences which we can't foresee.  Is this
really a strang argument against them?  At best, it can be an argument
for caution, but who decides and how much?

My personal tack would be to uplift in an environment that is almost as open
as the oceans, though the cautions you seem to want woudl favor a more
prison camp like environment.

I think it would take too long to uplift a mammal.  Also, the supply of chimps
is too small to really mess around.  And the mammals that are plentiful, e.g.,
rodents, small carnivores (dogs. cats), etc., might even more easily escape
the lab.  (I did write two science fiction stories on this a few years ago.  One
was "Other Minds," which appeared in THE THOUGHT and the other was
"Splitting Hares," which was printed in KASPAHRASTER.  I would think
some better writers out there might use the idea to come up with some
entertaining SF.)

Thanks for your concern.  I kind of like that image of escape sophoctopodes.:)

I just don't have the same fears as you.

We woudl have to come up with some sort of independent way to measure
sentience -- of which I cannot fathom right now.  There does seem to be
correlations in humans between the speed with which neurons fire/react
and intelligence.  However, this correlation is not that clearcut.  Perhaps
Sandberg or others could add to this.

The same problem would happen for augmenting humans.  If you posit anti-
human motives for the upliftee/augmentee (uplifting is augmenting a non-
human, in a way), then, of course, this sort of thing could happen.  It's
likelihood is another matter.

I kind of doubt on the first experiments octopodes are going to come out of
the tank with genius level IQs, a bad attitude, and deceiving us into thinking
they are relatively stupid and benign.  More likely, we will be lucky to wind up
with something as smart as a chimp on the first tries.  Along the way, we will
learn a lot about how brains/intelligence works.

>Maybe this is not probable, but I think finding some way to answer the question
>of when we stop the uplift is necessary before we can even begin.

When we achieve sentience.  After that the upliftees will have to decide whether
they want to go further.

Apply this to humans.  If you fear uplifted octopodes (or chimps, etc.) what
about posthumans?  Should we allow posthumans, if such are produced,
only to be so smart, etc.?

Given the rabid fear by some of uplifting, perhaps it is best to publish the
results of experiments as they take place.  Given that this work might
have to take place underground, the publication could be done
through trusted connections to an anonymous ftp.

What do you mean? Daedalus escaped quite handily, it was Icarus who died, and that
was payback for Daedalus' earlier  transgressions. Daedalus killed his nephew (an
apprentice more skilled than he) out of jealousy. That's why he was in Minos' palace
to begin with (exile or something).

An organization that largely exists on the net should at least at least 
air an issue on the net, in an introductory sense.  As a matter of 
nettiquette, it should be simple enough to suggest further, more 
focused discussion in another forum.  Problem may be in part that 
people aren't sure of how to reach people off the net, not wanting to 
annoy them in person!

Well, permit me to tell you what I meant to mean. :) I meant to mean that
their goals and our goals may not be any more copasetic than our goals and

I apologize for my part in the misunderstanding. I was not referring to raw

While I agree that current observations tend to suggest an open universe, I
disagree that this is any less intuitively pleasing than a closed universe,
and that this is why cosmologists search for missing mass. There are a
multitude of other observed phenomena which align well with the theory of a
closed universe, as well as theoretical reasons for believing that such a
case is probable. An open universe is just as intuitively pleasing - if only
to suggest that our notion of time is in some way accurate - that it does in
fact have some degree of linearity.

It is getting more scary by the e-mail!!!!  I
wonder if computers will be able to develop
unique "personality" traits in the future?
In future we'll be saying to our partners "Your
network or mine?"  in fact, in the future who
needs partners.!!!

Haven't they already? Not just the user interface styles,
but even the way they act "on their own" are already
different.

But according to some myths (Heisod?) he was freed by Hercules. There
is one poem I read by some author (memory reference failure) where he
is described as smiling while the eagle sent by Zeus hacks at his
liver, since he knows he will be freed by his remote
descendant/relative in just a few millennia. A quite fitting symbol
for cryonics.

No, that is not entirely true. Daedalus did (according to the story)
kill his nephew, and was forced to flee from his home city to Rhodos
where Minos greeted him and allowed him a place at the court where he
began to build the Labyrinth. But the king's wife had got a thing
about the holy bull in the temple, and asked Daedalus to help her get
its attention. So he fashioned a hollow cow-model for her, and she
went to the temple. Nine months later Minos got very upset by her
child (as a rule, *never* have intercourse with something from the
greek pantheon without contraceptives! :-), and imprisoned it, the
Minotaur, and Daedalus (plus Icaros, I suppose) in the Labyrinth.

The moral seems to be: think a bit about the consequences before you
invent something (and do explain the operational parameters to the
users!).

I really like the Daedalus character, with all his flaws. I have been
thinking writing up a small dialogue/micro drama with Daedalus,
Icaros, the Minotaur and Minos as characters. Daedalus is dynamic
optimism ("Let's find a way to get out of here!"), Icaros is passive
optimism ("Everything will be all right if dad says so"), the Minotaur
is the passive pessimist ("I'm an ugly monster and I deserve to be
locked in") and Minos the active pessimist ("The whole bunch is
dangerous to mankind, let's lock them in").

OK, let's go over these -- knowing full well most of us -- including me --

On that last point, yes.

But current humans have goals that are not copasetic.  For instance, Janet
Reno's and the Branch Davidians, Jeremy Rifkin and many of us, Saddam
Hussein... etc. ad nauseam!:)  Is there any reason to believe all sophoctopodes
would coordinate together in a way humans do not?  (This is not a trait of
humans alone.  Chimps have wars too.)  Heck, there are even humans who
believe humanity should cease to exist -- e.g., deep ecologists, religious
fanatics.

I think the point was that molluscs might be more closely related to us, ergo,
more likely to allign with us.  If relatedness is a key, then they are.
However,
I doubt it is.  In fact, I bet genetic similarity is not helpful at all.
Ideology and
motives will most likely depend on other factors.

BTW, I believe the rational thing -- what benefits their long range self-
interest -- for sophoctopodes to do would be not to war against humans.
The benefits of sentient diversity benefit them as well as us.

 Indeed, and the possible conclusion to this line of thought is that
Machines may soon ask "Who needs people" 
 Kevin Warwick ( March of the Machines) anticipates the possibility of
this within 20 to 30 years.   Within 50 years, Warwick believes " it will all
be over."

I think one important thing to remember here is that the sophoctupi
will not be "pure" cephalopods, they will get a lot of their mental
structure and culture (and hence values) from their patrons. That
means that they will likely have a somewhat "humanesque" outlook,
tinged with extropianism if the uplifting team are extropians. Just
like teenagers they may rebel against these values if they are
motivated to do so, but it is hard to remove the basic values of
oneself and one's culture. So let's make sure it is the nice people to
uplift smart animals, not nasty people uplifting cute animals.

Yes, it is a good question really. Of course, the most important
question for people to think of is how to be needed. As for myself, I
plan to integrate myself into the AI infrastructure, just like I got a
fish nervous system in my spinal cord and some reptile-like structures
in my mesencephalon.

Hmmm Anders, you may well go down in History for that quote ( I hope

Welcome! Nice to know that we really exist across the entire globe
(Mitch is in Australia, do we have somebody in South America too? And
who will be the first extropian in Antarctica?)

I Never Thought I'd Be the One Telling You This:


I Actually Read a Piece of E-Mail & I'm Going to Europe on the Proceeds!

Hello!


My name is Karen Liddell; I'm a 35-year-old mom, wife, and part-time accountant.  As a rule, I delete all unsolicited "junk" e-mail and use my account primarily for business.  I received what I assumed was this same e-mail countless times and deleted it each time.


About two months ago I received it again and, because of the catchy subject line,  I finally read it.  Afterwards, I thought , "OK, I give in, I'm going to try this.  I can certainly afford to invest $20 and, on the other hand, there's nothing wrong with creating a little excess cash."  I promptly mailed four $5 bills and, after receiving the reports, paid a friend of mine a small fee to send out some e-mail advertisements for me.  After reading the reports, I also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for free! 


I was not prepared for the results.  Everyday for the last six weeks, my P.O. box has been overflowing with $5 bills; many days the excess fills up an extra mail bin and I've had to upgrade to the corporate-size box!  I am stunned by all the money that keeps rolling in!


My husband and I have been saving for several years to make a substantial downpayment on a house.  Now, not only are we purchasing a house with 40% down, we're going to Venice, Italy to celebrate!


I promise you, if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up (and count your money!), you will make at least as much money as we did.  You don't need to be a wiz at the computer, but I'll bet you already are.   If you can open an envelope, remove the money, and send an e-mail message, then you're on your way to the bank.  Take the time to read this so you'll understand how easy it is.  If I can do this, so can you!


                       GO FOR IT NOW!!


                       Karen Liddell


The following is a copy of the e-mail I read:

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


This is a LEGAL, MONEY-MAKING PHENOMENON.
PRINT this letter, read the directions, THEN READ IT AGAIN !!!

You are about to embark on the most profitable and unique program you may ever see.  Many times over, it has demonstrated and proven its ability to generate large amounts of cash.  This program is showing fantastic appeal with a huge and ever-growing on-line population desirous of additional income.


This is a legitimate, LEGAL, money-making opportunity.  It does not require you to come in contact with people, do any hard work, and best of all, you never have to leave the house, except to get the mail and go to the bank!  


This truly is that lucky break you've been waiting for!  Simply follow the easy instructions in this letter, and your financial dreams will come true! When followed correctly, this electronic, multi-level marketing program works perfectly...100% EVERY TIME! 


Thousands of people have used this program to:
    -  Raise capital to start their own business
    -  Pay off debts
    -  Buy homes, cars, etc., 
    -  Even retire! 


This is your chance, so don't pass it up!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
OVERVIEW OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY 
ELECTRONIC MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING PROGRAM
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Basically, this is what we do:


We send thousands of people a product for $5.00 that costs next to nothing to produce and e-mail. As with all multi-level businesses, we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products.  Every state in the U.S. allows you to recruit new multi- level business online (via your computer).


The products in this program are a series of four business and financial reports costing $5.00 each.  Each order you receive via "snail mail" will include:


  * $5.00 cash
  * The name and number of the report they are ordering
  * The e-mail address where you will e-mail them the report they ordered.


To fill each order, you simply e-mail the product to the buyer.  THAT'S IT!  The $5.00 is yours!  This is the EASIEST electronic multi-level marketing business anywhere! 


FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND
BE PREPARED TO REAP THE STAGGERING BENEFITS!


******* I  N  S  T  R  U  C  T  I  O  N  S *******

This is what you MUST do:


1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell them if you don't order them).
     
     *  For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE 
        REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR
        RETURN POSTAL ADDRESS (in case of a problem) to the person
        whose name appears on the list next to the report.
  
     *  When you place your order, make sure you order each of the
        four reports.  You will need all four reports so that you 
        can save them on your computer and resell them.


     *  Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of 
        the four reports. Save them on your computer so they will
        be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people
        who will order them from you.


2.  IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed
     next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way
     other than is instructed below in steps "a" through "d" or you
     will lose out on the majority of your profits.  Once you 
     understand the way this works, you'll also see how it doesn't
     work if you change it.  Remember, this method has been tested,
     and if you alter it, it will not work.


    a.  Look below for the listing of available reports.


    b.  After you've ordered the four reports, replace the name and
        address under REPORT #1 with your name and address, moving
        the one that was there down to REPORT #2.  


    c.  Move the name and address that was under REPORT #2 down to 
         REPORT #3.  


    d.  Move the name and address that was under REPORT #3 down to 
         REPORT #4.  


    e.  The name and address that was under REPORT #4 is removed from
         the list and has NO DOUBT collected their 50 grand.


Please make sure you copy everyone's name and address ACCURATELY!!!

3.  Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, 
     and save it to your computer.  Make NO changes to the instruction
     portion of this letter.
  
4.  Now you're ready to start an advertising campaign on the
     WORLDWIDE WEB!  Advertising on the WEB is very, very inexpensive,
     and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Another
     avenue which you could use for advertising is e-mail lists.  
     You can buy these lists for under $20/2,000 addresses or you
     can pay someone a minimal charge to take care of it for you. 
     BE SURE TO START YOUR AD CAMPAIGN IMMEDIATELY!


5.  For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the
     report they ordered.  THAT'S IT!  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE 
     ON ALL ORDERS!  This will guarantee that the e-mail THEY send
     out, with YOUR name and address on it, will be prompt because
     they can't advertise until they receive the report!


------------------------------------------
AVAILABLE REPORTS
------------------------------------------
***Order Each REPORT by NUMBER and NAME***

Notes:
-  ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH FOR EACH REPORT 
-  ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA FIRST CLASS MAIL 
-  Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two 
   sheets of paper  
-  On one of those sheets of paper, include: (a) the number & name
   of the report you are ordering, (b) your e-mail address, and (c)
   your postal address.

HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PLAN WILL MAKE YOU $MONEY$
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to get 10 people to participate on your first level. (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger response.) Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members.  Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below.


1st level--your 10 members with $5...........................................$50
2nd level--10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100)..................$500
3rd level--10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000)..........$5,000
4th level--10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10,000)...$50,000
                                                   THIS TOTALS        ----------->$55,550


Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each.  Think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate!  Most people get 100's of participants! THINK ABOUT IT!


Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can afford $20). You obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!! REPORT#3 shows you the most productive methods for bulk e-mailing and purchasing e-mail lists.  Some list & bulk e-mail vendors even work on trade!


About 50,000 new people get online every month!


*******TIPS FOR SUCCESS*******

 *  TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS!  Be prompt, professional, and follow 
     the directions accurately.


 *  Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when 
    the orders start coming in because:


    When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested
    product/report to comply with the U.S. Postal & Lottery Laws,
    Title 18,Sections 1302 and 1341 or Title 18,  Section 3005 in
    the U.S. Code, also Code of Federal Regs. vol. 16, Sections 
    255 and 436, which state that "a product or service must be 
    exchanged for money received."


 *  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.


 *  Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the 
    instructions exactly, the results WILL undoubtedly be SUCCESSFUL!


 *  ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!


*******YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE*******

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:


If you don't receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, continue advertising until you do.  Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT #2.  If you don't, continue advertising until you do.  Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in!


THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:


Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report.  You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you.  If you want to generate more income, send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again!  There is no limit to the income you will generate from this business!


NOTE:  If you need help with starting a business, registering a business name,                  how income tax is handled, etc., contact your local office of the Small Business Administration (a Federal agency) for free help and answers to questions. Also, the Internal Revenue Service offers free help via telephone and free seminars about business taxes.


*******T  E  S  T  I  M  O  N  I  A  L  S*******

     This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY!  Especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of potential income.  I'm living proof that it works.  It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost to you.  If you do choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security. 
          Sean McLaughlin, Jackson, MS


     My name is Frank. My wife, Doris, and I live in Bel-Air, MD. I am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received the program I grumbled to Doris about receiving "junk mail." I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved.  I "knew" it wouldn't work. Doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me!  Within two weeks she had received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was shocked!  I was sure that I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work.  I AM a believer now. I have joined Doris in her "hobby."   I did have seven more years until retirement, but I think of the "rat race" and it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM.
           Frank T., Bel-Air, MD


    I just want to pass along my best wishes and encouragement to you.  Any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in. I even checked with the U.S. Post Office to verify that the plan was legal. It definitely is! IT WORKS!!!
           Paul Johnson, Raleigh, NC


    The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time. I was approached several times before I checked this out. I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required.  To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks, with money still coming in.
           Sincerely yours, Phillip A. Brown, Esq.


    Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. Boy, was I surprised when I found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders!  For awhile, it got so overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before. The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where in the U.S. the people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return.
         Mary Rockland, Lansing, MI


    I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another program...11 months passed then it came...I didn't delete this one!...I made more than $41,000 on the first try!!
          D. Wilburn, Muncie, IN


     This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money.  The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it. For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity.  Good luck and happy spending!
           Charles Fairchild, Spokane, WA

Well there is an extropian in South America. Im writin from Uruguay, a
little country between Brasil and Argentina. Probably it would be
interesting to translate extropians writings to spanish. I find the list
very interesting, and Im also wanting to know more and build a farm in
which begin building a new world... Recommendations for readings are welcomed.

My friend and fellow founder Berrie was so good to remind me of a
legal/administrative detail related to a newly chosen name.

We have to clear a new name with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (make sure
the name is not already taken by another company or organisation). This
will cost some time and money. Regrettably this is yet another limiting
factor in our name-choosing proces. The contest will close on the 6th of
december and them we have to choose and register the name, that will take a
week minimum. Expect final results around 15th of december.

On the up-side: if ideas keep coming in at the current rate there will be a
_LOT_ of choice. And while we're at it we are getting a nice classical
education ;-)

My break is nearly over so I'll keep this short:
Thanks to everyone who came up with an idea so far (keeo 'en coming!) and
thanks to all those who helped keeping this a civilized and grown-up
discussion. We owe you.

Greetings,
Arjen

That would be a great idea! After all, these ideas should not just be
restricted into one language. This is a good way of spreading interest
in extropianism.

Recently, I have received an Unsolicited Commercial E-mail from you.
I do not like UCE's and I would like to inform you that sending
unsolicited messages to someone while he or she may have to pay for
reading your message may be illegal.  Anyway, it is highly annoying
and not welcome by anyone.  It is rude, after all.

If you think that this is a good way to advertise your products or
services you are mistaken.  Spamming will only make people hate you, not
buy from you.

If you have any list of people you send unsolicited commercial emails to, 
REMOVE me from such list immediately.  I suggest that you make this list 
just empty.

	----------------------------------------------------

If you are not an administrator of any site and still have received
this message then your email address is being abused by some spammer.
They fake your address in From: or Reply-To: header.  In this case,
you might want to show this message to your system administrator, and
ask him/her to investigate this matter.

Note to the postmaster(s): I append the text of UCE in question to
this message; I would like to hear from you about action(s) taken.
This message has been sent to postmasters at the host that is
mentioned as original sender's host (I do realize that it may be
faked, but I think that if your domain name is being abused this way
you might want to learn about it, and take actions) and to the
postmaster whose host was used as mail relay for this message.  If
message was sent not by your user, could you please compare time when
this message was sent (use time in Received: field of the envelope
rather than Date: field) with your sendmail logs and see what host was
using your sendmail at this moment of time.

Thank you.

I Never Thought I'd Be the One Telling You This:


I Actually Read a Piece of E-Mail & I'm Going to Europe on the Proceeds!

Hello!


My name is Karen Liddell; I'm a 35-year-old mom, wife, and part-time accountant.  As a rule, I delete all unsolicited "junk" e-mail and use my account primarily for business.  I received what I assumed was this same e-mail countless times and deleted it each time.


About two months ago I received it again and, because of the catchy subject line,  I finally read it.  Afterwards, I thought , "OK, I give in, I'm going to try this.  I can certainly afford to invest $20 and, on the other hand, there's nothing wrong with creating a little excess cash."  I promptly mailed four $5 bills and, after receiving the reports, paid a friend of mine a small fee to send out some e-mail advertisements for me.  After reading the reports, I also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for free! 


I was not prepared for the results.  Everyday for the last six weeks, my P.O. box has been overflowing with $5 bills; many days the excess fills up an extra mail bin and I've had to upgrade to the corporate-size box!  I am stunned by all the money that keeps rolling in!


My husband and I have been saving for several years to make a substantial downpayment on a house.  Now, not only are we purchasing a house with 40% down, we're going to Venice, Italy to celebrate!


I promise you, if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up (and count your money!), you will make at least as much money as we did.  You don't need to be a wiz at the computer, but I'll bet you already are.   If you can open an envelope, remove the money, and send an e-mail message, then you're on your way to the bank.  Take the time to read this so you'll understand how easy it is.  If I can do this, so can you!


                       GO FOR IT NOW!!


                       Karen Liddell


The following is a copy of the e-mail I read:

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


This is a LEGAL, MONEY-MAKING PHENOMENON.
PRINT this letter, read the directions, THEN READ IT AGAIN !!!

You are about to embark on the most profitable and unique program you may ever see.  Many times over, it has demonstrated and proven its ability to generate large amounts of cash.  This program is showing fantastic appeal with a huge and ever-growing on-line population desirous of additional income.


This is a legitimate, LEGAL, money-making opportunity.  It does not require you to come in contact with people, do any hard work, and best of all, you never have to leave the house, except to get the mail and go to the bank!  


This truly is that lucky break you've been waiting for!  Simply follow the easy instructions in this letter, and your financial dreams will come true! When followed correctly, this electronic, multi-level marketing program works perfectly...100% EVERY TIME! 


Thousands of people have used this program to:
    -  Raise capital to start their own business
    -  Pay off debts
    -  Buy homes, cars, etc., 
    -  Even retire! 


This is your chance, so don't pass it up!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
OVERVIEW OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY 
ELECTRONIC MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING PROGRAM
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Basically, this is what we do:


We send thousands of people a product for $5.00 that costs next to nothing to produce and e-mail. As with all multi-level businesses, we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products.  Every state in the U.S. allows you to recruit new multi- level business online (via your computer).


The products in this program are a series of four business and financial reports costing $5.00 each.  Each order you receive via "snail mail" will include:


  * $5.00 cash
  * The name and number of the report they are ordering
  * The e-mail address where you will e-mail them the report they ordered.


To fill each order, you simply e-mail the product to the buyer.  THAT'S IT!  The $5.00 is yours!  This is the EASIEST electronic multi-level marketing business anywhere! 


FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND
BE PREPARED TO REAP THE STAGGERING BENEFITS!


******* I  N  S  T  R  U  C  T  I  O  N  S *******

This is what you MUST do:


1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below (you can't sell them if you don't order them).
     
     *  For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE 
        REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR
        RETURN POSTAL ADDRESS (in case of a problem) to the person
        whose name appears on the list next to the report.
  
     *  When you place your order, make sure you order each of the
        four reports.  You will need all four reports so that you 
        can save them on your computer and resell them.


     *  Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of 
        the four reports. Save them on your computer so they will
        be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people
        who will order them from you.


2.  IMPORTANT-- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed
     next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way
     other than is instructed below in steps "a" through "d" or you
     will lose out on the majority of your profits.  Once you 
     understand the way this works, you'll also see how it doesn't
     work if you change it.  Remember, this method has been tested,
     and if you alter it, it will not work.


    a.  Look below for the listing of available reports.


    b.  After you've ordered the four reports, replace the name and
        address under REPORT #1 with your name and address, moving
        the one that was there down to REPORT #2.  


    c.  Move the name and address that was under REPORT #2 down to 
         REPORT #3.  


    d.  Move the name and address that was under REPORT #3 down to 
         REPORT #4.  


    e.  The name and address that was under REPORT #4 is removed from
         the list and has NO DOUBT collected their 50 grand.


Please make sure you copy everyone's name and address ACCURATELY!!!

3.  Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, 
     and save it to your computer.  Make NO changes to the instruction
     portion of this letter.
  
4.  Now you're ready to start an advertising campaign on the
     WORLDWIDE WEB!  Advertising on the WEB is very, very inexpensive,
     and there are HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Another
     avenue which you could use for advertising is e-mail lists.  
     You can buy these lists for under $20/2,000 addresses or you
     can pay someone a minimal charge to take care of it for you. 
     BE SURE TO START YOUR AD CAMPAIGN IMMEDIATELY!


5.  For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the
     report they ordered.  THAT'S IT!  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE 
     ON ALL ORDERS!  This will guarantee that the e-mail THEY send
     out, with YOUR name and address on it, will be prompt because
     they can't advertise until they receive the report!


------------------------------------------
AVAILABLE REPORTS
------------------------------------------
***Order Each REPORT by NUMBER and NAME***

Notes:

HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PLAN WILL MAKE YOU $MONEY$
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to get 10 people to participate on your first level. (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger response.) Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members.  Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results below.


1st level--your 10 members with $5...........................................$50
2nd level--10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100)..................$500
3rd level--10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000)..........$5,000
4th level--10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10,000)...$50,000
                                                   THIS TOTALS        ----------->$55,550


Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate only recruit 10 people each.  Think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people to participate!  Most people get 100's of participants! THINK ABOUT IT!


Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can afford $20). You obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!! REPORT#3 shows you the most productive methods for bulk e-mailing and purchasing e-mail lists.  Some list & bulk e-mail vendors even work on trade!


About 50,000 new people get online every month!


*******TIPS FOR SUCCESS*******

 *  TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS!  Be prompt, professional, and follow 
     the directions accurately.


 *  Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when 
    the orders start coming in because:


    When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested
    product/report to comply with the U.S. Postal & Lottery Laws,
    Title 18,Sections 1302 and 1341 or Title 18,  Section 3005 in
    the U.S. Code, also Code of Federal Regs. vol. 16, Sections 
    255 and 436, which state that "a product or service must be 
    exchanged for money received."


 *  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.


 *  Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the 
    instructions exactly, the results WILL undoubtedly be SUCCESSFUL!


 *  ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!


*******YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE*******

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:


If you don't receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks, continue advertising until you do.  Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT #2.  If you don't, continue advertising until you do.  Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in!


THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:


Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report.  You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you.  If you want to generate more income, send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again!  There is no limit to the income you will generate from this business!


NOTE:  If you need help with starting a business, registering a business name,                  how income tax is handled, etc., contact your local office of the Small Business Administration (a Federal agency) for free help and answers to questions. Also, the Internal Revenue Service offers free help via telephone and free seminars about business taxes.


*******T  E  S  T  I  M  O  N  I  A  L  S*******

     This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY!  Especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of potential income.  I'm living proof that it works.  It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost to you.  If you do choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security. 
          Sean McLaughlin, Jackson, MS


     My name is Frank. My wife, Doris, and I live in Bel-Air, MD. I am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received the program I grumbled to Doris about receiving "junk mail." I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved.  I "knew" it wouldn't work. Doris totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me!  Within two weeks she had received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was shocked!  I was sure that I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work.  I AM a believer now. I have joined Doris in her "hobby."   I did have seven more years until retirement, but I think of the "rat race" and it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM.
           Frank T., Bel-Air, MD


    I just want to pass along my best wishes and encouragement to you.  Any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in. I even checked with the U.S. Post Office to verify that the plan was legal. It definitely is! IT WORKS!!!
           Paul Johnson, Raleigh, NC


    The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time. I was approached several times before I checked this out. I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required.  To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the first 14 weeks, with money still coming in.
           Sincerely yours, Phillip A. Brown, Esq.


    Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. Boy, was I surprised when I found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders!  For awhile, it got so overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before. The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where in the U.S. the people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return.
         Mary Rockland, Lansing, MI


    I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another program...11 months passed then it came...I didn't delete this one!...I made more than $41,000 on the first try!!
          D. Wilburn, Muncie, IN


     This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money.  The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it. For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity.  Good luck and happy spending!
           Charles Fairchild, Spokane, WA

Hello all,

I was watching discovery channel.
They had something about the new space station
and the impact on astronauts of weightless training
activities to keep their bones srong etc......

I was wondering: Why didn't they include a
spinning part (chamber) in the form of a wheel
to have some gravity in space. I mean, the thing
is already the size of 2 football fields (acc, to discovery)

Greetings,

Berrie

        The poem is (most likely) Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Prometheus
Unbound" Act III.  Other versions of the Prometheus myth have examined Zeus'
reasons for keeping the fire for the gods...thus depicting Prometheus as an
altruistic thief.

	Needed for what?  What is it that is "over" in 50 years?  Is
there some God or machine or something that will kill us because we
are not "needed"?  Why?  This all seems bassed on completely backwards
assumptions and absurdities.  We are the ones that have need aren't
we?  Not the other way around or not something that needs us!?

	In a world of plenty there is plenty to fulfill all needs.
There will be Gods and machines just waiting to do whatever it is each
and everyone on of *US* needs, whatever we are and whatever we freely
decide that we need.

                 W H Y   M O R E   L I E S ?



   (c) (11/23/97) Ian Williams Goddard

   Because we don't have videotape of the U.S. Navy shooting
   down TWA 800, we cannot prove by 100% they did.  However, 
   we can prove by 100% that the FBI is spreading new lies 
   to wrongfully damage the TWA 800 Navy-missile theory.

   On the Bob Grant show (WOR Radio, 11/21/97) FBI agent 
   James Kallstrom, who headed the FBI's "investigation,"
   said in reference to my TWA Flight 800 inquiry [1]: 

       Ian Goddard just two weeks ago was quoted on 
       CNN, if CNN quoted him accurately, saying he 
       had made it all up, just to sort of poke fun 
       at the U.S. government. He backed off of that 
 --->  remark, Goddard did, but he sent me an email 
 --->  saying in fact he knew it was not true.

   Here you will find the email I sent to Kallstrom, which
   was the article "CNN's Ian Goddard Plot." Kallstrom read
   from it during the FBI's final TWA 800 press conference:

http://home.dc.lsoft.com/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind9711&L=flight-800&D=1&O=D&P=64
34 

   The beginning of the sentence that Kallstrom read, which was
   the part he did not read, states: "I've always promoted what
   I believe..." The email I sent Kallstrom was an unambiguous
   defense of the  fact that I never perpetrated a hoax.  Yet
   Kallstrom stands before the American people and tells you
   the opposite of the truth, he tells you that my message
   refuting the false charges of hoax was an admission of
   a hoax. As all can see by simply reading my message,
   Kallstrom's claim is a lie. So why must he lie??

   Kallstrom can't seem to stop. At the press conference mentioned 
   above, Kallstrom said that when Pierre Salinger called him a few 
   weeks ago, Salinger said he no longer believed the Navy-missile
   theory. Always eager to initiate and/or promote government 
   disinformation, CNN commented on that lie, saying:

       He (James Kallstrom) spoke to Pierre Salinger 
       who now says he believes the friendly fire 
       rumor was just that, a rumor, that is was false.

   The only falsehoods are those flowing from the FBI and CNN.
   On WABC [2] Kallstrom said "Salinger's actually recanted."
   Salinger NEVER told anyone he no longer believes the theory.
   While he said that due to the unrelenting media attacks he 
   would stop talking about it,  he still believes it is true.
   On the Bob Grant show, Kallstrom also said, in reference to 
   the evidence Salinger has presented,  "He had  no witnesses,
   in reality, he had nothing."   No witnesses,  no radar tape,
   no drone photo. If we keep saying it, maybe it will be true.

   Kallstrom also said: "Eyewitness testimony is not evidence."

   The truth is that the FBI is actively and willfully spreading 
   false information about Pierre Salinger and myself. With such
   proven lies, how is anyone to believe they are spreading true
   information about the crash of TWA Flight 800? If TWA 800 was
   not shot down with a Navy missile, why should the FBI need to 
   assault that theory with lies?  W a k e  U p  A m e r i c a !

   With the FBI planning to prosecute another Navy-missile 
   theorist, James Sanders, author of "The Downing TWA Flight 
   800," the truth is only too clear to see: the FBI is out to 
   destroy those who have promoted the Navy-missile theory by 
   any means possible. This is a vicious  war on freedom of
   speech, inquiry, and the right to question authority.

Since when is that a goal, or for that matter, even possible?
I certainly don't think such a thing is possible.  In an open,
unedited, unmoderated forum such as this, a "civilized" thread
of discussion is compeltely useless.  If nobody is pissed off,
that's a sure sign that little of importance is being said,
or else the subject is so obscure not enough people understand
it to have an opinion.

Anything everyone agrees on has, by definition, no useful
information content.

Now, since every time I make this point, someone misunderstands,
let me be clear: I'm /not/ saying that pissing someone off
should be the purpose of a statement, only that any statement
that merits thought is likely to piss someone off, so it's a
very bad idea to try to prevent that, because you will wind up
preventing useful thought.  It is far more effective to teach
listeners tolerance than to expect it of speakers.

If I would not get destroyed by jumping into volcano and pain period
would be short, I would do it now. So I'm not assuming anything
original would not do if he could survive it.

Why I'm thinking that I wouldn't be destroyed?
Two scenarios:

1) I'm tapping original in the head and saying: "I'm continuing living 
here. So I'm not really dying when I jump into volcano."

2) Before jumping I would make backup of myself. After jumping I
would be restored. Restored copy would then study 'brain tapes' of
destroyed copy and try to understand how it feels to 'die'.

3) Actually case 1 is almost same as 2 expect that restore is made
before jump ;-)

Maybe there wouldn't be any new information but at least I could say
that I have died ;-)

At 09:18 AM 11/21/97 I wrote that Mark Turner's
Literary Mind theory suggested to me that human
thought is based principally on pattern matching, an
on-going variation and selection, feedback between
many levels, where it is effectively impossible to
untangle all the causal threads.

On Sat, 22 Nov 1997 15:43:22 -0500 (EST) Twink
neptune@mars.superlink.net responded:
< The statement here implies that there are causal
threads -- i.e., that causality is operative!:) >

I meant that we usually have imputed causality to
'things' where the physical causes are probably
several levels removed: Did I throw the ball, or did
my arm throw it, or did the game I'm playing cause me
to throw it?

Perhaps the point these people I quoted were trying
to make is that, while there is always some
object-level causality going on, that may not be the
most effective way to describe or study a situation.

Regarding the Walter J. Freeman quote that we
humanize the relationships among things by assigning
a cause, and "we do this through neural processes of
corollary discharge and reafference", Twink responds:

< I disagree, and note how he has assigned a cause
here!  He implies "neural processes" are the cause of
the way we "humanize" the "interrelations of objects
and events.":)  As usual, those who deny axioms must
use the very axioms in the denial. >

Perhaps he has just been a good eliminative
materialist and pared things down to the 'real'
underlying cause ;-)  But, as in my ball-game
example, there's some circular causality involved in
most complex situations.

As you point out in your example of the cause of
death of a woman who has been shot, the material
cause of death was the bullet, the efficient cause
was the pulling of the trigger, the formal cause was
the killer deciding to shoot her, and the final cause
... ?  Perhaps the one who was shot had threatened
the one who shot her.

Of course, relativism can be taken too far and
interpretations can become trapped in a hermeneutical
circle - then the 'causes' are in the stories we tell
ourselves about what we think we perceive.  In the
case of the woman's death, unless it was strictly
self defense on the killer's part, I have no problem
with convicting her of murder, or at least
manslaughter.  But, this is a case of human actions
with rather final results for one of the participants.

We don't really know the final causes in most
situations; but, in most situations, one or the other
causes will usually suffice to get us by.  However,
if we are trying to get a better understanding of the
"universe that is a totality - an integrated whole"
(as you put it), a relational viewpoint may often
offer a more complete picture than a causal viewpoint
that is practically restricted to a limited set of
objects and their apparent direct impacts on each
other.

Along the lines of a general theory of
representations, it's interesting to note the recent
Hayek-L discussion of Barry Smith's "The
Connectionist Mind: A Study of Hayekian Psychology",
particularly the distinction between propositional
(pre-defined) and non-propositional
(dynamically-derived) knowledge:
"The whole resultant process is then not so much a
matter of 'classification' as of 'evaluation' ...
making distinctions of degree as well as distinctions
of kind ... The map's job, from Hayek's perspective,
is to facilitate a certain sort of cognitive laziness
(or what Mach called 'thought economy') ... not,
however that of a passive-memory storehouse, but of
an active-memory competence ... It is remarkable how
little explicit (conscious) knowledge is required by
the agent in order for him to be able to react in
appropriate ways to changes in his circumstances ...
the most essential information is passed on in the
form of abbreviated signals."
(See
http://wings.buffalo.edu/philosophy/faculty/smith/articles/HAYEK.HTM
)

Joel Henkel's 971111 response to this essay may be of
interest for the development of effective situational
awareness representations: he notes that what we want
are linkages that are represented "in a mode that is
free from classes, signs or symbols ... a
representation in kind" that uses a connotative
rather than denotative association. 
(See
http://maelstrom.stjohns.edu/CGI/wa.exe?A2=ind9711&L=hayek-l&O=T&P=3596
)
He is probably describing a theory of the human mind,
but we may need something similar for societies of
intelligent agents on the Net.

In other words, rather than try to explicitly
classify and rate millions of agents or sites, it
would be better to implicitly capture the relations
among agents in some semi-anonymous, statistical
manner, much as price signals do in the material
economy.  In short, the trick is to find some
self-organizing mechanisms based on ubiquitous signal
exchanges rather than rely on explicit rating schemes
(although such could certainly be supplementary).

Another reference I recommend (for theory) is Robert
Pallbo's "Mind As Evolution and Evolution As Such"
(see
http://lucs.fil.lu.se/Abstracts/LUCS_Studies/LUCS34.html
) for its generic description of knowledge
acquisition systems in terms of active components vs.
preservative components, and retention vs. revival
mechanisms, while defining the ways that variation
and selection can be applied to such systems.

While I'm still doing references, Mitchell Porter
wrote about James G. Miller's Living Systems Theory.
There is a paper by Chen and Gaines at
http://ksi.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~lchen/current/ijis/
called "A CyberOrganism Model for Awareness in
Collaborative Communities on the Internet" that uses
Miller's theory as a foundation.  They have lots of
other related papers one step up at
http://ksi.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~lchen/current/ 

Next, Sasha wrote:
< Multi-agent systems and action spaces >

Warning: the rest of this is just
off-the-top-of-my-head stuff that may or may not be
addressed in 'the literature' as I haven't done much
research in this area.

Is there a way to publish ones 'action space', e.g.,
web browsing history, in an anonymous way but such
that primitive net agents could access it, whenever a
relevant search or send was initiated?  These same
agencies must be able to accept feedback. 

< I would envision the future intelligence as a
collection of highly specialized tools, with
high-bandwidth interconnections, with
"personalities", or complex problem solvers
("achievers", "goal engines", "research tools",
"development threads") consisting of limited
contractual relations between multiple
problem-solving, planning, perceiving, and acting
entities, that can at the same time be employed in
many other similar relations. So the entities may use
the same "body parts" on a cooperative or
time-sharing basis. >

To me it seems that 'personalities' are the hardest
part here. Perhaps this could be partially
implemented by tracking my browsing history; better
yet, a diary of my email filtering (saves vs. reads
vs. skips) through some sort of semi-anonymous
'signaling' that would enable personality indices and
pointers to be prepared.  The trick, of course, is to
find a way to implement this without compromising
privacy too much.

Sasha again:
< Unfortunately, while the economy provides its
agents with accurate estimates of generic values, it
has little to offer to each individual agent in their
attempts to figure the value of a certain product to
their particular needs, or offer any other
personalized or situational advice. >

This is because each agent's utility functions are
usually known only to that agent (and then only in
some amorphous, embedded analog manner).  However, if
my customized search agent knows my interests
(according to some standardized classification
system) and can report a history of my demands to
other service agents, and all demands could be
aggregated by some set of interest indices, then
prospect-mining entities could queue up pointers for
my type of agent (e.g., wants info on memetics), when
I initiate a search, such agents could immediately
recommend various threads (sets of URLs) and rate
them according to my responses (at the most basic,
whether I follow them or not).

< Among the first applications of this approach I
envision large automated collaborative filtering
projects, link exchange programs and targeted
advertising, balancing flows of information in
accordance with diverse and dynamic interests of
creators, consumers, providers, and sponsors of the
Web content. >

My favorite application would be a history of a
browsing session - time-stamped, each link rated by
duration of review, the extent of excerpts
downloaded, any subjective evaluations explictly
entered, automatically stored as a thread
'somewhere'.  This seems to be a logical extension of
the more 'unconnected' site rating that is (was?)
available, e.g., with Firefly on Yahoo!  I tried this
about a year ago and obtained a few good links but
found that the biggest deficiency, aside from the
effort required to rate a bunch of sites to get
started, was that one could only rate sites that were
in the database and there was no provision to add new
sites on the fly.

If the entities doing the browsing had already
submitted some interest profile, then the recorded
browsing thread could be classified and retrieved by
similar agents when they commenced a related search. 
But, ideally we want a way to create the interest
profile without any explicit effort on the inquiring
agent's part.

A payment mechanism is probably essential as an
implicit rating system.  Once established, this
'point of sale' data, tracking knowledge acquisition,
could be fed into various indices of interest and
intent that would drive the development of additional
sources and services.

Of course, until it becomes acceptable to charge
(some small amount) for such value-added search
services, and there is a secure, unobtrusive
crediting mechanism in place, it is doubtful that
resources to maintain such a service would ever be
allocated.  I DON'T want to buy somebody's service
'whole-hog' but I would gladly pay (if there's some
kind of easy, one-click payment procedure) a few
cents here or a dollar there for value-added hints
and recommendations.

Mark Crosby

P.S. I love the 'What's New' page on your site.  One
of my biggest complaints about so many Web page
providers is that they never think to date/time-stamp
their entries.  Situational awareness in
collaborative searches is exponentially enhanced by
the availability of such chronological logs.  For
example, a quick glance at it tells me that you just
added the Hayek-L list to your Mailing Lists page, so
I know you're probably aware of the "Connectionist
Mind" essay I mentioned in the beginning.

It's probably too much too ask that everyone take
such care with their web sites or publish their
'itinerary' for explicit viewing; but, it would be
nice if anonymous delivery agents were able to track
such information and somehow route information
appropriately.

Your vision sounds nice, but can it be guaranteed? We live in a world
where things do go wrong, where unexpected things happens despite
precautions and where not everything is done with positive
consequences in mind. Our development is linked with dangers, and
the future tends to turn out vastly different than our predictions.

I don't believe in the "robots peeling grapes for us scenario" nor the
"humans red queened and darwinnowed scenario". But we better make sure
the future turns out reasonably well (or better, unreasonably well) -
we have a respondibility for it. And that includes analysing possible
risks and taking steps to minimize or circumvent them.

There is a lot of unreasonable fear about SI, even among
transhumanists (we have had this debate often enough on this list),
and it is quite natural that people worry about the future of the
human species or its close descendants. While we can of course try to
develop AI and other autonomous technology that serves us (say by
being created already in love with humans or similar stuff), things
can go wrong and nasty systems could be built for a variety of
reasons. Even in the grape scenario it may turn out that the humans
turn into traditional pets for the posthuman powers, and that doesn't
appeal to our sense of dignity. So it is IMHO worthwhile to see if we
can make sure humans remain an important and useful part of the future
infra/ultra structure, whatever it is.

My personal suggestion is to concentrate on intelligence amplification
in various forms; it both has practical uses right away, and may be a
good way to bootstrap superintelligence that has humans and human
memetic complexes as integral parts. In the long run the human aspect
may become insignificant compared to the rest of the entity, but it is
still there after an exponential but continous development. How IA is
implemented is another question, we already have plenty of tools:
hypertext, agents, cognitive psychology, nootropics and expert
systems; in the future we may add bionic interfaces and uploading -
there is a broad research front here with a lot of worthwhile stuff
both for the present and the uncertain future.

What if some advanced civilization replaced one of your neurons with
artificial one that behaved from the viewpoint of other brain like
original. What if they replaced all neurons one by one with artificial
one. Would your consciousness change? Would your phenomenon change?

	True, but just because some religious people reject technology
all together and are surpassed and made insignificant by the rest of
the technological world, doesn't mean they loose their right to exist
or to need!  We don't go out and kill them or anything just because
they reject technology.  They still own and farm land and do what it
is they want.  Just because our "needs" deal with more technology and
progress doesn't mean their "needs" should be disregarded does it.

	True we should be cautions and careful.  But why would
anyone's need, no matter what, be thrown out as everyone (man,
machine, transhuman...) else's ability to fulfill their needs are
increased?  If I have a robot that feeds me grapes, why would I want
to suddenly go out and kill some backwards religious person that fears
technology?  It's absurd to think there would be a reson for such
right?

I think the use of hyper-economy also hints that some knowledge
might be gained in this direction from studying extant economic
theories.  I would recommend reading Brooks' and Wiley's
_Evolution As Entropy_ 2/e for macroecological paradigms
which might have a lot of applicability here.

I would just call them _assumptions_!:)  Of course, all sorts

	Yes.  I think this kind of substitution is a fallacy which
would not work as many think it would.

	When I am picking strawberries in a strawberry patch, the
neurons in my brain produce a phenomenal green field of leaves filled
with phenomenal red spots in my consciousness.  The phenomenal
difference between the red and green representations are what enable
me to know where the strawberries are so I can pick them.  If you
replace the part of the visual cortex that would otherwise be
producing the phenomenal red of a particular strawberry in the patch,
it must also produce this same fundamental red experience that is
integrated into our consciousness, or our consciousness would not be
aware of the red strawberry and we would not be able know to pick it.

	If you simulated the entire process abstractly, you could
reproduce the behavior, but the subjective experience would not be
there.  Once you replace the real phenomenal red with abstractly
represented red, the subjective experience is gone.  You would
recognize this as soon as the first part of the visual cortex switched
to be abstract since it would then be a blind spot in your conscious
visual awareness.

	Sure, you could bypass the consciousness by enabling the
abstract representations to cause the hand to move to pick the
strawberry, but long before we get to this level we will clearly see
what qualia are and how critical they are to behavior, intelligence
and conscious knowlege.

Dear fellow Extropians:
Eventually, the insurance companys that represent TWA will have to do their
thing. They will probably try to use every possible legal ploy and maneuver
to avoid paying all the negligence and damage claims resulting from
casualties in the flight.

If there is any validity at all to Mr. Goddard's claims, logic and the
expediency that prevails in pre-litigation procedures would dictate that the
attorneys for the airline will use the theorys proposed by Mr. Goddard in
the defense of their client. As I'm sure you are all aware insurance
companys are usually quite reluctant to part with large amounts of money.

 Let's see what happens next.

By all means, let's imitate what original thinkers do.

My example of someone killing someone else is
similar.  As long as there are no contradictions, I
see no problem with integrating the views.  You
threw the ball, through the medium of your arm.
(The game itself supplies the motive behind you
doing so.  I would not deny ideas -- the rules of
various games being such -- have an effect, but
not in the sense of they exist outside of minds
and directly cause things to change.  But I,
unlike Freeman et al., offer no general theory
on this -- for now.:)

>Perhaps the point these people I quoted were trying

I sign on to that, in some cases.:)  Look, we are going
to far for a book I haven't read.  I am only talking about
the quote I read and your rejoinders to me.  I'd really
have to dig deeper into the argument.  If I get the
time and the dough, I'd like to read Turner's book.

As long as you limit causality to the kind that many
Moderns denote by the term, then, yes, there is much
beyond causality.  However, there is a wider, more
_realistic_ (to me:) view of it which I subscribe to.

My point: Freeman implied in your quote of him that
causality is a human thing -- as if to mean, causality
is a fantasy we impose on reality.  He then went on
to give the causes of this.  That was what was
circular -- i.e., his argument.  Now, if causality is a
chimera, then so is his argument, since he relies on
it.  If not, then his argument is self-defeating, don't
you think?

Again, that is only one view of causality.  The neo-
Aristotelean/Objectivist view is not of billiard balls,
but of entities having natures and changing
according to their natures.  The reason a billiard
ball moves like it does when hit by another in
your average game, as opposed to what an egg
or a puff of moist air is because of what it is.

Oh.  So if I understand you right, mere *empirical* evidence won't break
classical mechanics - you can always add enough epicycles to preserve a
classical *description* of the phenomena.  There comes a time, though,
when folks get tired of piling epicycle on epicycle, and look for a
simpler formalism.

I've heard that Gauss went up three mountains and measured, as seen from
each, the angle between the other two; added up the angles and found that
space is locally flat to within the error in his procedure.

		Attention East Coast Cryonicists and Extropians

	The first annual Boston CryoFeast is set to take place December 6
, beginning at 5 p.m., hosted by Tony Reno and Roderick A. Carder-Russell.
This is a pot-luck gathering in celebration of life and it's boundless
potential, it is a gathering of cryonicists and life-extension advocates
and anyone is welcome to attend regardless of cryonics organization or
lack thereof.  
	We are anticipating lots of great food, intriguing conversation,
music, films such as Future Fantastic and Immortality on Ice, perhaps even
a teleconference with the West Coast CryoFeast, hosted by Natasha Vita
More, on a 61 inch screen!
	The party will be held in the home of Tony Reno located at 161
Heald St, in Pepperell MA.  Directions can be obtained by contacting
Roderick at rodc@shore.net or (603)433-5574.  We invite you all to attend!

I would have to disagree.  You are making a tight connection between the
hardware and consciousness.  There is nothing special about a neuron that
synthetic duplicate couldn't contain.  To say so appears to attach a
mystical (and mythical) value to the individual neuron.  Specific aspects
of your consciousness may be tied to specific parts of the brain, but only
with respect to organization and interfacing.  As long as an artificial
visual cortex maintains identical neural interfaces as the old one, and
exhibits the same protocols as the meat cortex, the rest of your
consciousness would have no means by which to tell the difference.

There is nothing intrinsically phenomenal about how the visual cortex
processes the color red.  The fundamental experience of red is only
relevant to your consciousness in how it relates to the other parts of the
brain.  If the rest of the brain receives the fundamental "red" signal as
usual from a synthetic visual cortex, your consciousness will experience
the usual fundamental red response.  Any subjective response from the
consciousness is in response to the red abstraction created by the visual
cortex.  The job of the cortex is to create and communicate that abstraction.

This may be a little out of context, but it was the first thing that popped
into my mind when I read this.

In the last year or so, a couple pieces of pretty sophisticated image
processing software were produced that could generate fairly detailed 3d
objects and spaces by analyzing normal 2d photographs.  Some of this
software is quite good at making educated "guesses" as to the nature of
parts of objects that are not explicitly shown in the photographs.  Of
course, the more different photos you have, the better the model that is
constructed.  All in all, the best of this class of software produces very
impressive results.

The point of all this is that I see a clear convergence between the ability
of computers (given the proper software) and the ability of the human mind.
 The description of human visual processing quoted above, is noticeably
similar to the computer image processing software I mentioned below it.
Given the abundance of detailed 2d imagery of the earth's surface and
man-made structures and objects, it would be possible for a computer to
sample the world in much the same way we do by reading (for example)
National Geographic.

Did you read the FAQ before posting to this list? Even if not entirely 
possible, it is a good ideal which keeps the signal:noise high.

I am by no means an expert, the most I can claim is to have studied first or
second year university level cosmology for the majority of last year. Most
learnings of which have drained into the undercurrent of my mind...

No it does not. In the first instance I said that *observations* tend at this
stage to support an open universe. In the second instance I said that there
are many *theoretical* reasons for believing a closed universe is probable.

I was in the midst just now of reading "The Media Equation", a
book describing how people treat media socially as if it were
another person, when I came to a chapter describing praise.

Humans seem to be hard-wired in how they deal with praise and
other social behaviors; for instance, people care much more
about praise from other people than they do from self-praise.
Reading that, it struck me just how illogical that is- I
am generally the best judge of myself and my abilities (as
long as I'm honest :-), and therefore praise from myself
should be "worth the most".

I'm wondering if it is possible for regular humans such as
ourselves to transcend these stupid genetic behaviors and
live more logical lives? Can it be done by strict self-
monitoring, or are there limits to how far we can progress?
Any books written on this subject?

Exactly. I don't think there are any extropians (if there are, they
should think about the principles a bit closer) that think eradicating
the "pesky mehums" is a good thing. But not every posthuman will be a
saint, and a slight error in judgement of a transcendent superbeing
could destroy the remaining humans ("Oops... my cleaning nanites have
just cleaned away the entire biosphere. What a mess. Let's hope nobody
notices..."), not to mention Eugene's scenario of the posthumans one
day deciding that carbon based life is so trivial and simple that
there is no need to preserve it outside virtual reality (or at all). 

What I want is to find ways of ensuring human survival even in the
very long run, even if the ethics of our descendants changes. The
problem isn't the religious nuts, the problem is the big uncertainty
about the future.

What Brent is talking about is allegorised by David Chalmers in his Fading
Qualia model (which, as I recall, that metaphysical dualist rather
surprisingly declines to accept).  As the neural structures with their
supposed specific Searlean `causal powers' are chipped, something like the
neuropathology of Blindsight would be experienced.  You'd find yourself
mysteriously functioning quite competently while your dumbfounded and
`blindspotted' consciousness assessed that you ought to be acting at
random.  But this phenomenal glitch *already occurs*, to people without a
single implanted neurode.  Brent's opinion is an act of faith (as, of
course, is James's and mine to the contrary), and I guess we'll have to
wait for some GregEganist experiment to learn which turns out to be the
case.  But I judge that James's position is more firmly consistent with
everything else we already know about the material world.  Surely Brent
would allow a single atom to be replaced, or a single molecule (since,
after all, this is always happening).  At what exact point of replacement
would the allegedly unique powers kick in?  Even when one grants the
extraordinary and difficult special character of experience - of qualia, of
phenomena, of what mind's functioning *is like* from the inside - I can't
see any reason at all to expect it to require any more mysterious material
explanation than hypercomplex relatedness, which we know describes the
brain and which can be replicated piecemeal (in principle at least) at
whatever degree of granularity.

Why wouldn't a posthuman be a saint ?

I think (or maybe I hope it to much) that while the
intellect is growing. the respect for every "life-form"
is growing too. Would a posthuman really bother about
trivial things as good and evil. Wouldn't he be more interested
in just BE......Will he still strife for more matter/energy and
get to it at all cost. I know I asked something similar already
in this list. But I find it hard to grasp, that we will never become 
mature enough to deal with these instincts.
What's the point........

I hope there will be a time were the posthumans are so wise,
they will say: why bother, let them have their playground.
But since (hopefully) everybody is posthuman they will accept
this limit, because there is no alternative. as is with life and
dead. Dead is no alternative for anything, since your not
aware of it anymore. If posthumans can foresee the dangers of
wanting ever more mass/energy. They know they will destroy
them selves. 

What did I miss......... ?

Space Stock Surfers
Mission Statement

The Vision

The Space Stock Surfers envision a day when human civilization reaches across
the expanse of the Solar System, and all people are free to work, live, play,
and associate with others, according to their own natures, with minimal
interference from authoritative powers.  Energy will be free, cheap, and
plentiful, supplied directly by the Sun through Solar Power Satellite
systems, nuclear fusion, and other systems not yet developed, but that will
be inspired by space development.  Trade will be free and open, between the
planets and the multitude of intraplanetary settlements, and the economy of
the entire human species will be assured of expanding and thriving, due to
the influx of extraterrestrial resources.  This affluence will cause a
renaissance in the human spirit, and the arts and culture will flourish in
diverse and beautiful ways.  People will live in expectant hope for tomorrow,
secure in the knowledge that, although life, liberty and happiness are not
guaranteed, all will be able and allowed to choose their own destinies, and
can strive as they see fit for the highest good. 

The Philosophy

A necessary prerequisite for such a vision is the continuous, sustainable
expansion of the global economy.  That is impossible with finite resources.
 The Earth is completely explored; there are no more "new worlds" on this
planetary surface.  The only way to increase the resource base is by
off-world expansion.  This should be undertaken peacefully, with opportunity
and benefit generated for all people of the Earth who wish to participate.
 Even those who do not actively participate should benefit from the general
expansion of the worldwide economy.

The Mission

To that end, the Space Stock Surfers have formed to invest in the companies
that are actively creating the infrastructure and systems necessary to
economically develop space and acquire the resources available there.  We
believe that, in the very long term, but still within our lifetimes, space
will be one of the most profitable and opportunity-producing endeavors of
humanity.  We seek to invest in companies that are financially sound and
thriving today, yet have set their sights on the technologies and ideas that
will revolutionize our economy by bringing the benefits of space to Earth,
and by opening space to Earth-dwellers.  This includes not only aerospace
firms, but any companies with the vision to look past the limiting two
dimensions of the surface of our planet.

The Strategy

The Space Stock Surfers is an investment club patterned after the National
Association of Investors Corporation model.  We seek to make long term
investments based on fundamental analysis, and we eschew market timing and
other technical strategies.  We look for undervalued companies that are out
of favor because of reactions to recent news by investors who think on a
quarterly basis.  Whenever possible, we engage in dollar cost averaging,
preferring to establish Diveidend Reinvestment Programs with the stocks we
hold.  We are not limited to any size, age or temperament of companies.  Our
portfolio contains a wide range of stocks, from Dow-Jones Industrial Average
components to small companies that have recently gone public and have little
or no earnings.  We believe in diversification for dilution of risk.
 Therefore, not all of the companies in which we invest are necessarily
engaged in space development.  The common thread throughout our investments
is a long-term focus on value and sustainable growth, with an emphasis on
developing new technologies that can lead to the opening of the space
frontier.

The Challenge

We challenge all space enthusiasts and those interested in the long-term,
sustainable growth and survival of our culture and species to follow our
example.  If these ideas resonate within you, you can do it, too.  We are
average people that live and work ordinary lives.  All it takes is a belief
in yourself, a belief in the future, and an interest in how the economy and
the markets work.  We are willing to help any individuals or groups that wish
to form their own space stock clubs.  The challenges are great, but so are
the opportunities and the rewards.  Join us in our quest, and someday, in the
not-too-distant future, we can all meet in space to celebrate our successes.

This is possible - but would you want to literally bet your life on it? 

I certainly think that very rational and intelligent beings will be
"good" in some sense, but even that goodness could have unpleasant
consequences for lesser beings ("We are really sorry, but to prevent a
spin-alignment disaster in this part of the galaxy, we need to turn
all mass of the solar system into a ridgeways kamtorus. We will upload
all of you to this emulated earth now"). And evolution has shown us
that in every evolving system parasites and opportunists will appear -
even if the posthumans are benevolent, their web agents or >cockroaches 
might cause a lot of grief before their "masters" notice it.

This "master" idea is exactly the thing which I find hard to take.
Who will stay behind, and why ?
Won't there be some "magical" point of no return...
You smart and won't do harm anymore.
or your dumb, and can't do any harm................

As things are going right now, I would not be the least surprised if
the Singularity affects a minority of all humans, the rest living
relatively normal lives in the shadow of Powers simply because they
couldn't adapt fast enough, didn't see what was coming, didn't care,
didn't have the money or just refused (there are a lot of people who
think our visions are actually horrible, remember that). Exponential
growth makes differences grow exponentially too.

> Won't there be some "magical" point of no return...

> or your dumb, and can't do any harm................

Maybe, but my point still stands: we cannot be sure about this, and we
definitely should *not* rely on it. It is a very dangerous Polyanna
mentality.

Besides, this point may be at a very high power level, and we already
know that individuals with defective ethics (not to mention accidents)
can hurt a lot of people fairly easily, and as the power level
increases, the range of effects can be much larger. So while the IQ
5000 posthumans are utterly benign, the IQ 500 transhumans can be
somewhat nasty - and we have to pass that stage safely first.

What I want is to find a way to guarantee my, and hopefully others',
survival in the face of this uncertainty.

Sentimentality. Besides, I'm a packrat who hates throwing away any
information that can someday be useful.

It is very easy to deceive yourself.  Feedback from respected peers can
be valuable as a checksum.  If intelligent, like-minded people disagree
with one of your assessments, it is a clue to evaluate that assessment
very closely.  It may be wrong, or it may be a radical idea that no one
else can grasp yet.  Either way, it is a signal to investiage further. 
Self-praise can just be a feedback loop with no added information. 
Praise from others can be additional information.

We have the instincts we have because they were evolutionarily advantageous
in the Stone Age.  Our culture classifies our instincts into the 'higher'--
e.g. love for spouses and children, not hurting those who don't hurt you,
fairness, appreciation of music, and the 'lower'-- e.g. mob violence, rape,
theft.  The progress of civilization has been, in large part, the
development of mechanisms for suppressing the 'lower' and enhancing the
'higher'.  It is a natural assumption that posthumans will have progressed
down this path even further than we have.

I am not convinced of this.  Let me explain.

Instincts originate from the evolution of replicating minds.  The process
of replication that formed our minds occured mostly before the invention of
agriculture.  The process of replication that will give rise to
posthumanity has not yet started.  When it happens, many different
architectures for the mind will contend.  They may contend peacefully, by
convincing people that they should reconstruct themselves along certain
lines, or by creating offspring according to a certain plan.  But they may
also contend violently, by forcing reconstruction on others, or by siezing
others' rescources and diverting them to the production of offspring.
Which strategy or mix of strategies proves most effective determines what
kind of posthumans we end up with.  I could well imagine all posthumans
being saints, but I could also imagine them combining the powers of gods
with the morals of bacteria.

I spent a while looking into this last year, and, as is my wont, never
wrote anything down.  Let's see what I can remember... 

There are walls between the bubbles, whose thickness is small compared to
the size of the bubbles.  This is inconsistent with the notion that life
originated at random times and places and spreads spherically, since in
that case we would observe that some bubbles had run into each other, while
others were small and in the middle of large 'uncolonized' areas.  However,
if civilizations for some reason like to leave 'neutral zones' between
them, then this would explain the observed pattern.  In this case, we are
in a neutral zone, and can expect to be swatted down as soon as we become
politically unacceptable (:-).

The bubbles are not completely empty.  The contain the occasional galaxy.
This is a small problem for the theory.

The stars in the dark zones cannot simply have been Dysoned, since their
waste heat would be clearly visible to some kind of telescope, regardless
of its temperature.  The bubbles contain 90% of the volume of the universe,
so if the universe was uniform, 90% of the stars would have been Dysoned.
Alas, the spectral region between 10 microns and 1000 microns (300K to 3K)
where the Dyson spheres would radiate does not contain 10 times as much
light as is emitted by all visible stars.  Also, the bubbles should be
visible as large infrared blobs, and they're not.  

If the Dyson sphere heat radiators are built of solid hydrogen, they could
be big enough to actually be opaque on a galctic scale, and would have a
radiation temperature on the order of 5K, which would be close to a
thermodynamic optimum.  Unfortunately, the bubbles would have clearly
visible effects on the cosmic background radiation.

If the civilizations that built the bubbles wanted to conserve energy for
the longest possible time, they might have modified the stars in their
domains to make them burn more slowly.  In this case, the objections of the
previous two paragraphs vanish.

If a civilization is expanding at a speed comparable to that of light, we
would see their frontier as an ellipsoid rather than as a sphere.  The long
axis of the ellipsoid would be pointed toward us, and the closer the
conquest velocity was to lightspeed, the more elongated the ellipsoid.
This isn't really an issue, since the 'neutral zone' hypothesis requires
that all expansion was complete a long time ago.

	It is indeed very surprising to me that so few people are
signing up for cryonics.  If the Prometheus project is successful at
making cryonic preservation and restoration of a mammalian brain
provably successful how many people will start signing up?

	Why is it that so many people seem to want to die?  Could it
be because our consciousness are just so scared from all the death and
suffering to date that we just don't care for anything better anymore?

	I like a lot of Chalmer's stuff but I don't like the usage of
"Fading" for something like this.  This phenomenal stuff isn't
something that fades.  When something is in you conscious visual
awareness it is definitely there, and when the neurons start failing
to fire, it clearly goes away, is switched off, and you then have a
blind spot in your awareness.  You either see red or you don't.

	I think it is much more than an "act of faith" if you just
think about it properly.  Our brain has evolved in a way that makes us
think that color qualia are things that exist beyond our eyes, when in
reality they are in our brain simply representing what is beyond our
eyes.  It is "common sense" to think that 700 nm radiation has a "red"
quality to it but this is completely wrong.  All we know about 700 nm
radiation is it's causal properties and how we "abstractly" represent
such causal properties with phenomenal red.

> molecule (since, after all, this is always happening).

	Only because actual atoms, though different, would probably
have the same phenomenal qualities resulting in identical conscious
sensations.  It may be that other physical things like electromagnetic
radiation have phenomenal qualities that we simply haven't yet known
how to look for since all we're looking for is causal properties and
not actual fundamental qualities.  Evolution has learned how to
harness such phenomenal qualities to represent information in our
consciousness producing our very powerful intelligence and awareness.
We must know this more than we know that there is a real physical
world beyond our eyes.  We know absolutely that we are conscious, we
can only infer that there is a real world beyond the cause and effect
process that our eyes use to see.  We know absolutely what red is
like, we can only abstractly infer what 700nm light's causal
properties are and only abstractly represent them with phenomenal red
in our brain.  We don't really yet know what light is fundamentally
like.

	Many of you seem to be claiming that we know everything about
neurons and how they work, to the point that we can simulate
everything that goes on.  But I completely disagree with this.  Sure
we can track the red light, representing the strawberry, landing on
our retina, through the optic nerve, to specific locations in our
visual cortex.  Sure we can see what causes our muscles to move our
hand towards that strawberry, and trace this cause back to the brain.
But, in between these two we don't yet have any idea what is going on.
We are still learning much about all the electro chemical processes
involved and there is still much we do not know.

	The important thing is to get over the "common sense" lie,
evolution has taught us, thinking that red is something out beyond our
eyes that we already know about.  It is not!  Red is something in our
brain that we don't yet objectively know anything about.  It isn't
light, it only abstractly represents light.  There is more to this
world than the causal properties we only abstractly know about.  There
are also phenomenal qualities.  Because we are only aware of these
phenomenal properties inside our brain, we haven't yet learned how to
properly look for them.  Once we start looking for more than causal
properties, and realize that phenomenal qualites are something very
real, and intelligently powerful, and that they really exist in our
brain, we will finally be able to properly look for them and only
thereby discover and understand them.

	As long as we think there are some unexplicable, non existent
thing that some how abstractly "arises from" "hypercomplex
relatedness" in some incomprehensible way or that red is something
beyond our eyes, we will never discover what things fundamentally are
really phenomenally like.  In order to find consciousness, we must
start looking in the right place and accept the fact that it is built
out of something fundamentally and phenomenally real and
understandable.

Alas, I don't expect fully reversible suspensions to emerge as a result of
the Prometheus project -- physics seems to interfere all too strongly
here. But a dramatic enhancement of current suspension protocols -- why,
certainly. (And we all should be _very_ interested in enhancement of such

Susceptibility to 'we all are already immortal' or 'ignore death ignore
death ignore death' memes is an integral part of human genotype -- which
made perfect sense before immortality has become a nonephemerous item
(which sounds suspiciously like the first type of memoids btw, and thus
may trigger memeimmunological response) due to the advent of cryonics. I
believe it's a cryonics FAQ item.

The current model for how the brain works is that it is a network of
interacting neurons.  The neurons interact at points of (near) contact
called synapses.  There, neurons are bombarded with various neurotransmitter
chemicals from nearby neurons.  When a sufficient level of stimulation is
reached, the neuron cell membrane triggers a cascade of events leading to
a nerve impulse.  This travels through the neuron and eventually triggers
it to release its own neurotransmitter chemicals at synapses where it
impinges on other neurons.

Each neuron works in this conceptually simple way.  The complexity of the
brain arises from the fact that billions or trillions of neurons are
all interacting in a very complex network.  But if we zoom in on any small
portion of it, we see that this simple, essentially mechanical activity is
all that is happening.

Now it is true that this model is not complete nor is it fully verified.
It could turn out that there are other important effects that are not
yet recognized.  But most people would agree that this model is at least
logically possible.  It might be wrong, but equally it might be right.
There would be no logical inconsistency if it turned out that brains
and neurons actually do work this way, that underlying the complexity
of brains, with all their sensations and qualia, are these simple neural
interactions.

I am not sure whether Brent believes this.  It almost seems that he is
forced to say that this model must be wrong, that by pure introspection and
reasoning he can conclude that there has to be more to the brain than this.

The reason is because he does not accept the obvious conclusion of
the neuron-substitution thought experiment.  Given that neurons work
as postulated above, it should be possible to replace a neuron with an
electro-mechanical device.  It works identically to biological neurons at
the inputs and outputs, sensing and emitting neurotransmitter chemicals.
But inside it is a computer, which is designed to exactly mimic the
behavior of the biological neuron it replaces.  When the inputs reach
certain thresholds, it waits for an appropriate delay to simulate the
travel of the neural impulse over the body of the biological neuron,
and then triggers its output mechanism to release neurotransmitters in
the same amount and timing that the biological neuron would have done.

Substituting this electronic neuron for a biological one cannot change
the behavior of the neural net.  If we imagine two identical brains, with
one of them having a biological neuron replaced by an electronic one,
they will both operate exactly the same.  All the patterns of neural
impulses in the two will be identical.  In particular, everything the
two brains say and do will be the same.  It will not be the case that
one says that it can see normally, while the other says that it seems
to be blind.  That would be a difference in speech patterns which would
require different patterns of nerve impulses in the brain.  But no such
difference will occur because the substitute neuron behaves identically
to the real one as far as patterns of input and output go.

Even if more biological neurons are replaced, and even if we forego
the need for chemical neurotransmitters at synapses which involve only
electronic neurons, there will still be no changes in the patterns of
activity.  The two brains will remain identical in their nerve firing
patterns.  Each time a neuron fires in the purely biological brain,
the corresponding neuron will fire at exactly that same instant in the
partially electronic one.  So it will not be possible for the two brains
to report any differences in what they perceive.

Some philosophers suggest that what will happen is that the consciousness
in the partly electronic brain will get "out of sync" with the brain
firing patterns.  It will notice that the qualia are gone, but somehow
it won't be able to report it.  Apparently it will have lost control of
its mouth.  This would presumably lead very quickly to a total disconnect
between the true consciousness, which is panicking at having lost control
of its body, and some other sort of simulated consciousness, which seems to
be going about its life quite normally.  This would then imply that
consciousness apparently has virtually nothing to do with brain activity
since they can behave so independently.  Most people will not go so far
into this form of dualism.

I think that Brent will suggest instead that the thought experiment won't
work.  It would be impossible to substitute an electronic neuron for a
biological neuron without disrupting the brain's activity.  We have to
assume that our understanding of the brain's mechanisms is incomplete, and
that with further understanding we will find that there are more complex
aspects which no electronic neuron can capture, since it is only modelling
a real biological neuron and is not actually the same as one.

This is a very strong assertion.  It's not just a matter of saying
"we may be wrong", it's saying, "we must be wrong".  It is saying that
purely by introspection and thinking about the nature of consciousness,
we can _know_ that there is more to the brain's function than the simple
model of interacting neurons I summarized above.

Personally, I don't find this very convincing, so perhaps my extrapolation
from Brent's postings is wrong.  I am curious to know whether this does
in fact reflect his views.

If it actually did that, I'd be all for it.  Yes, of course I read

courtesy is noise, not signal.  And a lot of good signal is rude.

I haven't read it for a while, but Dennett made a case in 'Consciousness
Explained' that red is not a physical phenomenon but merely a tag which
we attach to certain stimuli. This seems to match my own experiences; I
remember an optics lecture at school where the lecturer shone a light on
a board of colored squares, and the center square was red. Only when he
switched off the light did we realise that he was shining a non-red light
on a non-red square, and there wasn't a single photon of 'red light' 
reaching our eyes. So something else had confused our brains into 
sticking a 'red' tag on that square, even though it had received no
supporting data from the retina.

Most people seem to believe that they know how their brains work, but
most people haven't seen what happens when their brains go wrong, which
is where the real data on brain operation lies.

Never heard that one (boni) but I can't imagine that being used as
anything but facetious.  People do, however, use "virii" as if it
were legitimate, where it fails on two counts: one, like "octopus",
"virus" is a Greek rather than Latin root, and even if it were
Latin, it would only be "viri" (which is actually Latin for "men").
And what's wrong with good old English plurals like viruses or
antennas anyway?  Are antennas less effective than antennae?  It
would be one thing if people who used Latin plurals used words like
criteria, genera, axes, and alumni correctly, but my experience is
that they don't.

ObOctopus: The preferred form is "octopuses".  "Octopodes" is a
bit stuffy, but also fine.  "Octopi" is probably too ingrained in
out culture to eradicate, but it really should be eliminated.

	I'm sorry I don't have a reference, but there was recently a
discovery made of some chemicals that neurons can release that effect
large numbers of near by neurons, even ones that have no direct
synaptic connections.  Any simulation would have to take into account
such chemical behavior and properly simulate it's changing effect on
the behavior of other neurons.  The fact that we are still discovering
things like this still leaves open the possibility of many things.

	I'm not saying that what we know about the brain is wrong.
I'm sure there are some kind of, what Crick calls, "Neural Correlates"
to qualia.  We simply don't yet know how these phenomenal qualities
arise from these Neural Correlates and how they unify themselves into
our phenomenal awareness.

	Red has real qualities.  We directly experience Red.  We know
what red is like.  We can even come up with textual responses to try
to describe what red is and isn't like.  Any machine that was
abstractly simulating the behavior of a consciousness that experienced
red, rather than actually producing conscious red, would have to have
very complex abstract representations to identically reproduce all the
qualities of red itself.  Indeed, the fact that red is so phenomenal,
that it is so different than green, and even more different than salty
and all our other sensations, and the way it can all be unified into
one awareness model of the world, is what makes us so intelligent.
Abstract representations, though they theoretically could model this
powerfully intelligent behavior, I don't think they could do it
practically.  You'd be programming a computer to lie if you tried to
make it describe what red was really like.  And we all know that it
takes much more complexity to consistently lie, than it does to tell
the truth.

	Yes, this is not at all what I'm trying to describe.  All I'm
saying is the neurons, in some natural way, produce the conscious
qualia that we experience.  That the information we consciously know
is represented by the complex models built out of these qualia in some
way.  That the "quality" of the phenomenon is important and what
consciousness is.  I am saying that any simulation would have to take
into account and represent all these qualities and their differences.
I believe that such would be only theoretically possible and not
practically so because of the rich diversity of all our sensations.

	I'd bet that there are phenomenal qualities that our
consciousness do not use.  That there are sensations that we have not
yet discovered.  I look forward to the discovery of other color qualia
so we can have something to represent wavelengths of light outside of
the current visual spectrum.  We can abstractly represent light
outside the visible spectrum by mapping the wavelengths onto what we
use to represent the visible wavelengths, but this will not be
anything like, what actual different qualia will be like.

> This is a very strong assertion.  It's not just a matter of saying
> "we may be wrong", it's saying, "we must be wrong".

	I am saying that the common sense idea that the tree we are
aware of that we think is beyond our eyes is wrong is not really
beyond our eyes.  The tree we are aware of is a tree constructed of
phenomenal qualia in our brain via certain not yet completely
understood neural correlate.  This tree we are aware of only
abstractly represents the real tree beyond our eyes.

	I am also saying that the idea that phenomenal sensations can
some how magically arise from "hypercomplex relatedness" is also very
wrong.  What we know must be represented by something very real.  Our
conscious knowledge is built out of this stuff, whatever it is.

	I am not saying that our current understanding of neural
phenomenon is wrong.  I'm simply saying there is a bit more that we
haven't discovered yet, and that the phenomenal quality of this stuff
is just as important as the abstract causality of this stuff.

> Personally, I don't find this very convincing, 

	What and where, then, do you think red is and what do you
think our conscious knowledge is represented with?

	But think about this.  What is this "tag" that you talk of?
Why is it?  What is it like?

	In consciousness explained Dennet claims we don't really have
qualia "...it just seems that we do".  But what is such a false
"seeming"?

	For a representationalist, a false seeming is an internal
representation in the mind that does not accurately model what it
represents.  A mirage is something in the mind that does not
accurately represent what is beyond the eyes.  That is why it only
"seems" that there is water out there.  There is a representation of
water in our mind, but no real water beyond our eyes.

	According to this Dennett's statement is self contradictory.
He is saying we don't have representations, we just have false
representations that represent such which of course is absurd and self
contradictory.  If Dennet intends some non representationalist meaning
for "seem" he should more explicitly explain what it is he means.
What, why, and how, is this knowledge that is our seeming that is
incorrect?  It must be something in order for it to be incorrect
right?  If it was nothing how could it be incorrect or correct?

	If it is merely a "tag" what how and why is this tag?  And
most importantly, what is this tag really fundamentally and
phenomenally like.

To some extent, merely understanding these inate predelictions in
yourself helps in counteracting them.  (Though I'd suggest that the
majority of these are actually socially scripted, rather than
genetically scripted.)  An excellent, extremely insightful book on our
scripted behavior is Cialdini's _Influence_.  

One technology that claims to allow humans to "rescript" themselves is
Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP).  A good book on NLP is "NLP: The New
Technology of Achievment", by the NLP Comprehensive training team,
edited by Steve Andreas.

Caveat:  I've been experimenting with NLP on myself for the past few
months, so my objectivity is quite possibly blurred.  However I must say
that I find it both very interesting in the abstract, and very effective
when put to use.  Most external measures of my well being and
effectiveness (health, fitness, job performance, comments from friends &
associates, etc..) also seem to back up the positive effect it's had,
though these positive effects may also be attributued to other factors.

Last hour, wandering around the net , I found and interesting address with

Faculty of Information Sciences, Hiroshima City University, 3-4-1,

OSAMU HIWAKI 

The responses of neurons in the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to
magnetic fields were
investigated. Urethane anesthetized rats fixed with ear bars were exposed to
40 micro tesla magnetic
fields in the magnetically and electromagnetically shielded room. It was
verified that the electrical
activity of the neurons in the SCN responded to the change of the direction
of the magnetic field.

I'm a bit ambivalent about NLP. I have not yet read up heavily on it,
but what I have read and tried seems to suggest that is mainly a large
toolbox of more or less different tools with no real underlying Big
Theory. That is of course not necessary as long as the tools work, and
some certainly do. But at the same time I notice the tendency for
"believers" of NLP to believe a little bit too strongly in it for my
taste - it seems to have some memetic "cult potential" (I do not
suggest it is a real cult, just that it somehow promotes a cohesion
among NLPers and their beliefs that I find unhealthy for critical
thinking and strict empirical testing). Since I also recognize that
this may just be my prejudices talking, I get even more ambivalent.

Are there any outside examinations of the efficiacy of NLP methods?

Of course killing them is not the solution and would never be an admitted
behaviour in an evoluted world. 
But a solution sometimes is necessary since such religious people
generally get politically organized and simply say (and may even "win" at
the end) that your robot
 or human cloning, or anything else are "things of the devil"...and "against
god's wish" ...
Cause of such behaviour they are not so pretty good boys/girls...and we
always must have a more intelligent
(and stronger) response for them.

I agree that we experience red (directly or indirectly), and I also agree
that we know what red is "like." But I gave it a whirl, and I am as yet
unable to describe red without reference to something else. I don't think
"red" has any qualities other than redness.

First, a machine that did so, need not do it abstractly. I think those
with the counterpoint to your position are suggesting that if the brain
can do it with physical components, a tech-based "brain" made of
non-biological physical compnents should be able to do it. But this is a
common argument which we see all the time around here. :-)

The more controversial suggestion is that no matter how amazing our
hardware "brain," there is no way to purposefully program the brain to
experience a universal red signal. Specifically, and since I argue red has
no qualities other than redness, the red "signal" some seem to be talking
about may not be universal at all. Consider that in stimulating the optic
nerve (or the visual cortex) we directly remove a step from the process of
"seeing." If we've always experienced red by way of this step, and it has
been circumvented, it is likely that the artificial signal we apply will
not be the same as the signal we have come to identify as red. Especially
since our subjective experiences have as much to do with what "red" is as
does our ability to see color.

The consequence, if this is valid, is that the only way to program such a
manufactured brain to see red, is to provide it with a visible light
detection device and let it "live" among redness for a while. Then it will
be able to assign a textual label to the experience. Comments?

It seems impossible without reference to something else.

Considering that the people most likely to transcend to posthuman states
are those most far to the right of the intellectual bell curve, and that
such people also tend to endure a large amount of persecution from
mundanes during childhood and adolescence, I think it highly likely that
at least one, if not many, of the first post humans will have highly
negative viewpoints towards mundanes, and extremely negative viewpoints
towards anti-tech and anti-intellectual idiots, which they would tend to
use their newfound powers to devise methods of a)eliminating such
morons, or b) using the technology to make such idiots forcibly into the
sort of people they once despised, thus achieving (a) without killing
anyone. Reactionaries will of course be on the opposite side, forming
terrorist insurgencies to oppose the transition. Anyone who thinks the
transcendant period will not be violently dynamic is living in a fools
paradise.

A good example is to compare how many conservative moslem countries have
reacted in recent years to the influx of progressive western
technologies, ideas, and ideals. The more extreme the distance between
the ends of a political/cultural axis, the more likely this dynamism
will turn to violence.

There is so much space, I don't think this is so.  I want out of this
gravity well.  Earth can left to preposthumans -- er, humans.:)
That might solve the accidental death scenario, provided the >Hs

The universe is a big place...

The current problem is that humans who are preservationists --
whether religious fanatics, deep ecologists or what have you --
and who have enough tech, can wreak harm on the rest of us,
or, if we transcend, others of their species.

I am not a Whig.  In other words, I do not think progress is
guaranteed.  It seems unlikely to stop now, but the record of
human existence is one of cultural progress broken by long,
dark ages.  Ergo, the sooner we can break the terrestrial
umbilical, the better.

Don't want to nitpick too much, but your statement was "There are a
multitude of other observed phenomena which align[sic] well with the
theory of a closed universe, as well as theoretical reasons for believing 
that such a case is probable."  (The statement this contradicts is your 
qualified admission that "...I agree that current observations tend to 
suggest an open universe...")  The first part of that sentence seems
to me to translate into there being _evidence_ for a closed universe.
What is this evidence?  And why would there be good theoretical
reasons if somewhere the theory did not match up with some facts?

It appears the universe is open, but I'm interested in why, if it does,
do some still maintain otherwise.  What reasons do they have?  And
are these reasons valid and tractable?  In the interim, we might do
well to discuss/try to understand the idea of an open, globally
hyperbolic universe -- rather than be shackled to the current
Standard model, which might become obsolete.

One, but by no means the only, model of an open universe is that
of David Layzer.  But even if his model is found to be faulty, any
good theory of cosmology should be able to account for the fact
that the universe has a lot less mass than would needed to close
it -- given current observations.

Please do not take the above to mean that I think science is
ruthlessly empirically driven.  It is not -- at least, not in the
fashion pure empiricists would have us believe.  Instead, I
think it rest not on accumulating evidence, but on
explaining/integrating wider fields of evidence.  (This is
why, to try to add something to the quantum physics
debate, classical mechanics has been superseded.  Post-
classical theories (QM, QFT, QED, QCD, ST, GT, etc.) are
able to explain more with less: more facts with less ad hoc
hypotheses.)

An aside: What are the probabilities and how are they
measured in this area?

Eagerly,

Daniel Ust

As much as I agree with you, Ian, if you aren't going to file a lawsuit
against the press and the FBI, then just give it up. You have already
made the Missile Theory synonymous with terms like The Grassy Knoll,
Roswell, etc. so you have accomplished something. Ranting on and on on a
mailing list is not doing you any favors in improving your tarnished
image, and is starting to tick off the freinds you do have here. If you
want to do something constructive, hire a lawyer, hire a publicist,
publish a book, or go postal on the FBI.

Though I tend to favor the open universe notion, what exactly is an
epistemological reason in this context?  As opposed to what other
type of reason?

Grant money and government involvement certainly does influence
research, but it remains to be shown that the influence here is in the
direction of supporting a closed universe theory.

The best revenge would be to kidnap them and upload them. It would be
interesting to see an uploaded antitechnologist try to sue someone for
forcibly uploading them.... are they really the plaintiff, or merely a
devil spawned simulacrum???? If they don't have a soul, can they testify
in court, or even file suit????? If they are prolife, wouldn't voluntary
deletion of the upload constitute both murder, abortion, and suicide, or
merely the same thing as erasing a video tape????

It might be that the discussion bogs down in different definitions for the
same words.  

I'm assuming that `phenomenal' is being posited by contrast to `noumenal' -
that it denotes the inward experience of things outside consciousness, via
sensory registration and cognitive mapping of a conjectured world of
things-in-themselves.  

Those noumenal things might be fields of force, or hosts of angels, or
computer lists in a higher-dimensional space... but for the terminology to
be useful, we assume with Kant that noumena are inaccessible, in their
suchness, to human awareness and apprehension.  

So of course, on this usage, redness cannot be on the far side of our eyes.
 It's an experience, a construct, a phenomenon.  (The trouble with this
traditional philosophical usage is that it stumbles over the common usage
where `phenomenon' is taken to denote a bounded thing or activity in the
world.  Pity about that.)

Yep.  It's a tenet of NLP that practitioners experiment, try what works,
and reject what doesn't work, with no real need for an underlying
theory.

That having been said, after relatively scant experience with it (a
handful of books over the past few months) I see the outlines of theory.
Or minimally of a set of extensions to the generally conceived
folk-psychological theory.

I'd characterize the key insights of NLP thus:

1)  One's identity and emotional landscape are malleable.  Indeed, they
are constantly changing in response to our internal dialog, subjective
experience, interpretation of that experience, the social mirror, etc..
This forms a feedback loop where [ identity & emotional landscape ]
-affects-> action (including internal dialog) -affects-> [ identity &
emotional landscape ].  Thus if we wish to affect our future identity &
emotional landscape, we can do so by modifying our subjective
experience, and also by taking certain actions that sculpt our future
selves.

2)  Our subjective experience is constructed from multiple qualia, and
is usefully sculptable at this level.  This is elementary cog sci, but
rarely put into use.  For example, most of us at some time use internal
dialog to reason or motivate ourselves.  However, it is far less common
to find individuals who consciously create imagery, sounds, or
kinesthetic experiences with the intent of self-motivation or more
generally self-modification.  (Though I do grant that abstract thinkers
extremely often use visual imagination to explore abstract ideas.)

3)  Both the /content/ and /structure/ of subjective experience affect
our emotions in predictable ways.  The simplest example of this is the
set of NLP techniques commonly used to cure a phobia.  Generally, it
seems, when a phobic individual is asked to describe the precise content
and structure of their imaginations of the subject of their phobia, the
phobia subject is seen from the first person, very large and near, often
exaggerated in proportion to the seen, in many colors, and with the
scene as a whole occupying the entire visual field.   

By contrast, when asked to think of something they have extremely little
attachment to, most individuals report that it is moderately distant, of
dull color, moderately small, often seen in a third person perspective
with the individual in the picture at the same time, and quite often the
entire scene takes up a fraction of the visual field or is "bounded"
visually in some way by a border or frame.

The essence of the NLP "cure" to the phobia, then, is to have the phobic
individual imagine the subject of their phobia in a small, distant,
unthreatening way.

To me this points to a basic tenet that the /intensity/ and /immediacy/
of a sensation (including an imagined sensation) is proportional to the
intensity of the emotional response evoked.   Again, fairly elementary
on the face of it - the insight of NLP is to use the imagination to
/change/ the intensity and immediacy of a stimuli to evoke the desired
response.

This can be used both positively and negatively.  For example, I may
have a goal which I rationally believe to be important to my well being
- exercise being a good example - but which I am relatively unmotivated
to pursue.  The NLP solution to this is to vividly imagine the /results/
of the goal, and then link that to a vivid imagination of the /process/
I shall use in attaining that goal.

A final note on what NLP is and is not:  NLP is a hammer and not a
compass.  That is to say, it is a tool for making modifications of our
own emotional & motivational states, as opposed to a tool for abstract
thinking or problem solving.  Of course, training in NLP includes
training on detailed observation of the world around you, as well as
detailed analysis of one's own life and goal structure, but I find this
to be peripheral to the actual toolset.

Heh.  This is a tricky subject.  On the one hand you are right to be
skeptical of NLP, if only for the massive, single-minded enthusiasm of
many of its proponents.

On the other hand, NLP is very much an attempt to leverage our
subjective experience to augment our objective capabilities.  In this
light, belief in the effectiveness of NLP is a boon to the practitioner,
and disbelief is a detriment.  This is essentially a manifestation of
the placebo affect: those who firmly believe in the cure are cured,
those who do not are not.

I wrestle with this from time to time and have come to the tentative
conclusion that the best course is to separate my /intent/ to cause
something to happen from my objective evaluation of the results.  Which
is to say that I aim to get myself pumped up for an NLP technique,
vividly imagine it suceeding, /believe/ that it will work, and then once
I'm done I must return to a balanced, objective state to analyze the
results of the technique.

So far, as I said, I've been fairly happy with the results.  I encourage
list members to pick up one of the better NLP introductory books and
give it a shot for themselves.  NLPers seem to agree that the NLP
Comprehensive / Steve Andreas book (NLP: The New Technology of
Achievement) is the best all around introduction to the topic.

> Are there any outside examinations of the efficiacy of NLP methods?

I'm researching this now.  So far I've found relatively little, however
a great many of the NLP techniques are essentially hypnotic techniques,
for which there is a fair bit of evidence of efficiacy.  When I've
compiled my findings I'll post them to the list.

Yes religious fanatics or anti technologists are a danger.  But as a 
superior intelligence or evolved being one should only pacify threats to 
our freedom, not  kill off whole peoples since there ideologies are 
directly against ours.  Diversity must be preserved.  If we are talking 
about what technology on a scale that nanotechnology will bring us, then 
there should be room for all kinds of man to live on one planet let 
alone the universe.  For example the quakers are fine,  in many ways 
educational to the way we once lived.  Thats the way I see it if others 
does not desire to join us in evolving to the next level.  Then we 
should leave a world for them to exist on.  With our technological might 
we do not have kill them off, or assimilate them.  Just declaw them and 
leave them be.  The threat is always high that one of these mundanes 
might kill us all.  We must always take them seriously, have safe guards 
in place, and be one step ahead of them.  If we are so intellectually 
superior, than we should be able to do this

Having studied with one of the founders of the thing called NLP, and having
observed various practitioners at close hand, permit me to say that there
are downsides present for some practitioners. And some of these
practitioners are high-vis. :\

In my view, the work being done by the Andreases shows significant value.

Richard Bandler, and Tony Robbins, to cite two high-vis people, seem to be
focused on getting the word out, and possibly on getting wealth (not that I
find fault with that per se), and may be less attuned to or concerned with
possible developing personality cults. They may also be aiming for "80-20"
results. Buttonhole me sometime face-to-face; I've got some droll stories
to relate.

The last seminars I had with John Grinder and Judith Ann Delozier (as best
I can recall, around 1990-1991) were very rewarding. At that time, their
area of concern and approach to models/metamodels was varieties of focused
attention. I think you would have enjoyed it had you been present, Anders.
And the resistance those two had to cults of personality was obvious.

On the third tentacle, there has been a tendency for extravagant claims to
be made. I believe that some branch of the US military did some
investigation into the utility of some published/promoted NLP techniques,
but I doubt their applications and investigative methodology would satisfy
you.

What does epistemology have to do with the issue of an open or closed

I am sorry - I used the term in it's non-empirical sense, which is what 
has caused the confusion. There is such a thing as theoretical evidence 
yes? I don't want to get into semantics; I concede that I worded my 
statement badly. My only excuse is that I generally read the list email late 
at night when, I am beginning to suspect, my mind has already began the 
processes necessary for sleep.

If, for instance, there are fairly good empirical results from which 
theoretically pleasing models can be made, but the models do not 
completely and utterly explain all phenomena. This type of thing occurs 
often in a science such as cosmology where a small amount of very 
important observations (microwave background radiation, expanding 
universe, etc.) are the basis for a great deal of theory. An analogy on 
a smaller scale: we don't even understand how our own solor system 
formed, even though we know a great deal about how it works.

Or be so fitted to other observations that an examination for other

There's another issue: how does a "web of trust" get fostered, transferred
and maintained in the face of this odd thing, foreseeable incredible stress? 

And a third, akin to this: what does it mean to humans or other sophonts to
be "one of 'us'", and what can we do about that? What _should_ we do about
that?

And a fourth: given the aforementioned stresses, and the possible perceived
opportunities if one defects, is there such a thing as a unified context of
sufficiency? Are we stuck with a zero sum game? If we are, should we all
agree to promulgate a white lie ("there's enough for everyone"), if that
creates a context of sufficiency?

I'll add one other point: it won't be "reactionaries" alone who find
themselves on the other side of the street: it'll also be anyone who's
afraid they're missing the boat.

It is entirely possible that during the cishuman-transhuman period,
transumans may come into being, but civilization may go out the window. I
would hate that.

C-CAL was created to address these sorts of issues, but it's slow going...

Hello, my name is Tony and I'm with Dove Network Technologies.  I got 
your name and e-mail address from the Internet and I am forwarding 
this to you in the belief that you will be interested in the content.
If you aren't, please forgive the intrusion.  To remove your name, 
send a message to nasca@dovenet.com and put the subject: "REMOVE"

DISCOVER WHAT EXPERTS ARE CALLING THE MOST INCREDIBLE PART TIME OR 
FULL TIME MONEY MAKING BUSINESS  AVAILABLE TODAY!

AND IN DOING SO, YOU CAN JOIN THE RANKS OF THOSE EARNING $5,000.00+ 
PER WEEK, WORKING FROM HOME 

What follows is information on the POWERFUL, EXPLOSIVE, OPPORTUNITY 
you now have to join the fastest growing group I know of REAL PEOPLE,
WHO ARE RAPIDLY BECOMING WEALTHY!

 We are an international group of individuals with very diverse
 backgrounds.  It takes no special knowledge or experience to succeed
 with what we do.  Our members include:

  attorneys
  physicians
  CPA's and  licensed financial consultants
  housewives 
  students  
  blue collar workers
  It really doesn't matter!

Since the original founders of our organization first banded
together just over three years ago, we have grown to over 14,000 in
our membership throughout the United States and Canada and we are
adding literally 100's of new associates every day. 

 WHY ARE WE GROWING SO RAPIDLY? 

 BECAUSE WE ARE MAKING SO MUCH MONEY.  THAT'S WHY!

We are all independent thinking entrepreneurs who believe that the
working class of our society will prosper financially in the years to
come ONLY BY TAKING DEFINITIVE ACTIONS TODAY!  We all make our 
substantial livings by simply helping others to learn as we have, just 
what logical actions to take.


HERE ARE 15 GOOD REASONS YOU SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER JOINING US...

1.    YOU REALLY CAN EARN $5,000+ PER WEEK, WORKING FROM YOUR HOME....
By and large, the majority of us already are.  Why not you too?

2.    IT'S FAST AND EASY....
You can be up and going, trained and generating a HUGE CASH FLOW,
within 24 hours from the time you decide to join.   All you need is a
phone!!

3.    PROFITS THAT BOTH BUSINESS EXECUTIVES AND ENTREPRENEURS USUALLY 
ONLY DREAM OF.... A 90% profit margin on sales of $1,250 or $6,250 
respectively, means YOU NET EITHER $1,125.00 OR $5,625.00 ON **EVERY**
SALE!!

4.    EASY TO MARKET -- WE DON'T DO ANY SELLING....
Literally, all we do is explain what we offer and approximately ONE
IN FOUR BUYS!!  THERE IS NO HIGH PRESSURE (not even any LOW 
pressure)!  Fully 25% of our contacts just take our products right
out of our hands. 

5.  IT'S  NOT MLM....
This is just a straight up traditional business selling highly
marketable and valuable products that everyone wants, but can't get
anyplace else for ANYWHERE NEAR the price.  (Our $1,250 product's
ACTUAL VALUE is estimated by our industry's professionals at between
$10,000 and $15,000!!!) You can choose to join just for the powerful
products we offer, or you can do as many of us do and offer these
powerful products to others as well.  The choice is yours!

6.    NO INVENTORY MAINTENANCE OR ORDER FULFILLMENT....
Spend ALL of your time GENERATING PROFITS.  All you do is explain the 
products and the business.  Then, when someone purchases our
life-changing products, they are drop-shipped to your customers WITH
AN UNCONDITIONAL TEN DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE.  
(FYI; our product return rate is incredibly low)

7.    DEAL EXCLUSIVELY WITH ONLY INTERESTED PROSPECTS....
You will be talking ONLY with individuals who have previously
inquired about our products and/or business!!  If you have
even a LITTLE BIT of business or sales experience, you know that this
fact alone is a marketer's dream come true.  

8.    ALL PROCEEDS ARE PAID DIRECTLY TO YOU
Unlike most MLMs, this business REALLY IS your own!  Most "companies" 
tell you that you'll be operating your own business, but get you to 
sell their product with all the checks endorsed to, THEM.  This leaves
YOU with -0- financial control in "your own" business.  Here, YOU'RE
IN CONTROL!!

9.   ALL THE FRESH HOT LEADS YOU CAN HANDLE....
So many people have been looking for a business like this for so long,
that you'll have MORE ALREADY INTERESTED PROSPECTS TO TALK TO EVERY 
DAY THAN YOU'LL EVER KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH. In fact, we will show you 
how to decide which of the people who have contacted you, you should 
call back.  It is truly a matter of YOU DECIDING WHO GETS TO LEARN 
ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE TO OFFER.  You will have so many people contacting
you for information, you won't be able to handle the full response any
more than we can!

10.   TRAINING & MARKETING  SUPPORT SECOND TO NONE....
First, we'll train you in our unique, tried and proven marketing
techniques. Then, you'll begin calling back your first batch of people
who asked for information.  Most people who market our products make 1
or 2 sales their VERY FIRST WEEK.

But if you DO have any trouble making your sales at first, we're ALWAYS
there to HELP YOU MAKE THEM!!  Incidentally, even when WE sell them for
you, they still make the check out directly to YOU.  YOU still get to 
keep ALL OF THE PROFIT!  NOT BAD, HUH?

11.   OUR PRODUCTS STAND ON THEIR OWN..
Simply put, what we sell to earn our EXTRAORDINARY LIVING, IS
EDUCATION;  INCREDIBLE AND VERIFIABLY FACTUAL INFORMATION that 99% of 
the world's population doesn't even know exists -- INCLUDING most 
Attorneys, CPA's, Tax Experts, Tax Consultants, Financial Consultants,
Investment Strategists and the like.  In fact, this information is so 
valuable to so many people, that fully HALF OF THE PEOPLE JOINING OUR 
ASSOCIATION ARE DOING SO JUST TO OBTAIN THE KNOWLEDGE  FROM OUR 
PRODUCTS!  SEE WHAT I MEAN.....

HERE ARE EXAMPLES OF WHAT YOU WILL LEARN...

The single greatest SECRET the ultra wealthy have used for
generations to minimize or even eliminate their tax liabilities,
legally! YOU DONT HAVE TO BE A MILLIONAIRE TO BENEFIT FROM THIS!

The SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT STRATEGY the super wealthy have utilized 
to protect their families' assets from liens, judgments, and 
seizures!  (Did you know that today, thousands of American families 
a month are losing everything they have worked years for, through 
liens, judgments and seizures?)  THEY DIDNT THINK THEY NEEDED 
PROTECTION, EITHER, UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE!  NOW YOU CAN PROTECT 
YOUR FAMILY'S ASSETS TOO, QUICKLY AND INEXPENSIVELY!   

How the wealthy consistently pass their wealth from generation to 
generation WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY ANY PROBATE OR ESTATE TAXES.  AND,
THE ASSETS CHANGE HANDS IMMEDIATELY UPON A DEATH, NOT YEARS LATER!  
WE CERTAINLY ARENT TALKING WILLS AND LIVING TRUSTS HERE!

How to protect your family's PERSONAL AND FINANCIAL PRIVACY.  YES, 
YOU CAN, IF YOU KNOW HOW!!

How to TAKE MONEY OUT of a special account we can show you how to 
establish, FROM AROUND THE BLOCK,  OR AROUND THE WORLD, with no 
paper or electronic trail for snoops to follow!  Only YOU know you
got the funds!

How to set yourself up in business, with MORE PROTECTION than that
offered by incorporating, for much less money, AND WITH NO
GOVERNMENTAL REPORTING OR ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS!

How the really wealthy are able to achieve FINANCIAL RETURNS
(without risking their money!) WHICH ARE TEN OR MORE TIMES what we 
are offered!  BUT, HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS!   YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A 
TON OF MONEY TO SHARE IN THESE RETURNS!

How to get for  FREE the kind of PERSONALIZED FINANCIAL ADVICE the 
super wealthy have had to spend tens or even hundreds of thousands 
of dollars to get!  FREE, ONE-ON-ONE CONSULTATIONS!!

AND MUCH, MUCH, MUCH, MORE!!!

I THINK YOU CAN SEE WHY THE VERY SPECIAL INFORMATION WE HAVE TO 
OFFER IS IN SUCH HIGH DEMAND!  AND WE ARE THE ONLY ONES OFFERING 
ALL  THIS INFORMATION!  BELIEVE ME, THAT'S THE POSITION YOU WANT 
TO BE IN!! 

12.   CREDIBILITY....
Our association is only about four years old, but has already
established itself as a well recognized, well reputed and universally
respected INTERNATIONAL organization.

13.   INCREDIBLE, VERIFIABLE TRACK RECORDS OF SUCCESS....
You'll be introduced to many, MANY others in our association (mostly
just average middle class people like you and me), WHO ARE ALREADY
EARNING (MANY) THOUSANDS OF $$$ PER WEEK IN THIS BUSINESS.  And, they 
have been making this money since almost the first week after joining 
us! Because of HOW we do what we do, there's a VERY short cash flow 
curve from when you get started. Sometimes less than one (1) WEEK!!


14.   SPEND LOTS MORE TIME WITH YOUR FAMILY....
If you are a seasoned parent, you already know how important this is. 
If you are a new parent, YOU NEED TO DISCOVER THE IMPORTANCE OF IT!

15.   THIS IS IT -- NO HYPE -- NO EXAGGERATION....
In over 20 years of Fortune 500 management experience, and several
more of owning and operating my own (some very successful) businesses,
before I TOOK A REAL GOOD LOOK AT THIS, of course I thought I'd seen 
it all.   But when I ran into this, as soon as I got the full picture,
it turned my previous view of business and even the views I had of
myself, INSIDE OUT!! I got started back in April of 1996, and haven't
had a second thought since!

Looking back now, I CAN TELL YOU TWO THINGS WITHOUT ANY 
HESITATION WHATSOEVER...  

 1.  You don't have to sell very much at all in this business to earn
 a FAR ABOVE AVERAGE INCOME.  And, if you wish to work at it,        
 you can even generate absolutely VULGAR profits, and    

 2.  You can expect an UNUSUAL BONUS.  Not long after I got up 
 and going, I learned that operating this business is not only very
 profitable, but also A LOT OF FUN!!  In fact, it is so much fun, and
 so lucrative that within six weeks of starting I dumped everything
 else I was doing, to do this full-time (Only about 30 hours a week!). 
 AWESOME!!

Michael, I'd love to hear some of your overall impressions of NLP,
particularly the evolutions of it over time and the manner by which
Grinder et al go about exploring/inventing new techniques.

Very interesting stuff indeed, from what little I've read.  I find it to
be quite congruent with, and complementary to, the studies of focused
attention one finds in the literature of meditation.  Particularly the
concept found in Buddhist (vipasana) and Zen meditation of constant
mindfulness or bare and precise attention at all moments of
consciousness.  It seems to me (without having gone through a
practitioner training myself) that the NLP focus on detailed observation
could serve to develop these faculties.

Hmmm, I'm interested in reading the results of even poor-methodology
studies in the area.  Any references would be appreciated.

Hmm, I *think* you mean something like this: the conceptualization of
the closed universe will be something like a ball, inside a space of
some kind. That space will be another universe, and so on. Am I right?

This is of course a completely bogus argument. First, our
conceptualizations doesn't have to be at all similar with how the
universe really looks; if your conceptualization of something leads to
problems, it is not the fault of the object you are referring to, it
is your conceptualization that is bad. Second, and more importantly,
there is no problem at all dealing with manifolds with no embedding
space, mathematicians do so every day. They are just strange to people
not used to topology.

(Apologies if I misunderstood your argument).

I think we all hopefully have learned a bit from this little

     Hi.  Rick and I are really excited to be a part of this great financial opportunity.  We hope that you will feel the same way and join with us in building your finacial future!  This program only requires 3 things; a computer, an online hook up, and perseverance.  Please take the time to read about this program.  We're really glad we did. 

Shannon and Rick

PS  Our downline is now international!!  We hope that you, too, will join us.

******************************************************************************************************

 My name is Christopher Erickson.  Two years ago, the corporation I
worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was
eliminated.  After unproductive job interviews,  I decided to start my
own business.  In short order, however, I encountered many unforseen
financial problems.  I owed my family, friends, and creditors over
$35,000.  The economy was taking a toll on my business and I just
couldn't seem to make ends meet.  I had to refinance and borrow
against my home to support my family and struggling business.  I truly
believed it was wrong for me to be in debt like this.  AT THAT MOMENT
something significant happened in my life and I am writing to share my
experience in hopes that this will change your life
FOREVER....FINANCIALLY!!!        In mid December, I received this
program via e-mail.  Six months prior to receiving this program I had
been sending away for information on various business opportunities.
All of the programs I received, in my opinion, were not cost
effective.  They were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the
initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they worked
or not.  One claimed I'd make a million dollars in one year...it
didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make it.        But like I
was saying, in December of '92 I received this program.  I didn't send
for it, or ask for it, they just got my name off a mailing list. THANK
GOODNESS FOR THAT!!!  After reading it several times, to make sure I
was reading it correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes.  Here was a
MONEY-MAKING PHENOMENON.  I could invest as much as I wanted to start,
without putting me further in debt.  After I got a pencil and paper
and figured it out, I saw I would at least get my money back. After
determining that the program is LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER, I asked
myself "WHY NOT?" and decided to do it.
        Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails.  It only cost me about
$15.00 for my time on-line.  The great thing about e-mail is that I
didn't need any money for printing to send out the program, only the
cost to fulfill my orders.  I am telling you like it is, I hope it
doesn't turn you off, but I promised myself that I would not "cheat"
anyone, no matter how much money it cost me!.
        In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for
REPORT #1. By January 13th, I had received 26 orders for REPORT #1.
When you read the GUARANTEE in the program, you will see that "YOU
MUST RECEIVE 15 TO 20 ORDERS FOR REPORT #1 WITHIN TWO WEEKS.  IF
YOU
DON'T, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO!"  
        My first step in making $200,000 in 6 months was done.  
By January 30th, I had received 196 orders for REPORT #2.  If you go
back to the GUARANTEE, "YOU MUST RECEIVE 100 OR MORE ORDERS FOR
REPORT
#2 WITHIN TWO WEEKS.  IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU
DO.
ONCE YOU HAVE 100 ORDERS, THE REST IS EASY, RELAX, YOU WILL MAKE
YOUR
GOAL."  Well, I had 196 orders for REPORT #2, more than I needed.  So
I sat back and relaxed.  By March 19th, of my e-mailing of 10,000, I
received $58,000 with more coming in every day.
        I paid off  ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car.
Please take time to read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR
LIFE FOREVER! Remember,  it won't work  if you don't try it.  This
program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY!  Especially the
rules of not trying to place your name in a different place.  It
doesn't work, you'll lose out on a  lot  of  money!  REPORT  #2
explains this.  Always follow the guarantee, 20 orders minimum for
REPORT #1, and 100 or more orders for REPORT #2 and you will make
$200,000 or more in 6 months.  I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS !!!

        If you choose not to participate in this program, I'm sorry.
It really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you.  If
you do choose to participate, follow the program and you will be on
your way to financial security. If you are a fellow business owner and
you are in financial trouble like I was, or you want to start your own
business, consider this a sign.  I DID!

"THREW IT AWAY"
        "I  had  received  this program before.  I  threw  it away,
but later wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try.  Of course, I
had no idea who to contact to get a copy, so I had to wait until I was
e-mailed another copy of the program.  Eleven months passed, then it
came.  I DIDN'T throw this one away.  I made $41,000 on the first
try."

"NO FREE LUNCH"
        "My late father always told me, "Remember, Alan, there is no
free lunch in life.  You get out of life what you put into it."
Through trial and error and a somewhat slow, frustrating start, I
finally figured it out. The program works very well, I just had to
find the right target group of people to e-mail it to.  So far this
year, I have made over $63,000 using this program.  I know my dad
would have been very proud of me."
                                        Alan B., Philadelphia, PA

A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM

By the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the
enclosed program and reports, you should have concluded that such a
program,  and  one that is legal,  could not have been created by an
amateur.

Let me tell you a little about myself.  I had a profitable business
for ten years.  Then in 1979 my business began falling off.  I was
doing the same things that were previously successful for me, but it
wasn't working.  Finally, I figured it out.  It wasn't me; it was the
economy. Inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that
had been with us since 1945.  I don't have to tell you what happened
to the unemployment rate...because many of you know from first hand
experience. There were more failures and bankruptcies than ever
before.

The middle class was vanishing.  Those who knew what they were doing
invested wisely and moved up.  Those who did not, including those who
never had anything to save or invest, were moving down into the ranks
of the poor.  As the saying goes, "THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR
GET POORER."  The traditional methods of making money will never allow
you to "move up" or "get rich"; inflation will see to that. You have
just received information that can give you financial freedom for the
rest of your life, with "NO RISK" and "JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT."
You can make more money in the next few months than you have ever
imagined. 

I should also point out that I will not see a penny of your money, nor
anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program.  I have
already made over FOUR MILLION DOLLARS!  I have retired from the
program after sending out over 16,000 programs.  Now I have several
offices which market this and several other programs here in the US
and overseas.  By the Spring, we wish to market the 'Internet' by a
partnership with AMERICA ONLINE.

Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED.  Do not change it in any
way. It works exceedingly well as it is now.  Remember to e-mail a
copy of this exciting program to everyone that you can think of.  One
of the people you send this to may send out 50,000...and your name
will be on every one of them!.  Remember though, the more you send
out, the more potential customers you will reach.

So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and
opportunity to become financially independent, IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!

"THINK ABOUT IT"

Before you delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did,
take a little time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.  Get a pencil
and figure out what could happen when YOU participate.  Figure out the
worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it, you will
still make a lot of money!  Definitely you will get back what you
invested.  Any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come
in.  IT WORKS!

                                        Paul Johnson, Raleigh, NC

HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU $$$$$$

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and
we'll assume you and all those involved send out 2,000 programs each.
Let's also assume that the mailing receives a .5% response.  Using a
good list the response would be much better.  Also many people will
send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2,000.  But
continuing with this example, you send out only 2,000 programs.  With
a .5% response, that is only 10 orders for REPORT #1. 
 Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000 programs each for a
total of 20,000.  Out of those .5%, 100 people respond and order
REPORT #2.  Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of
200,000.  The .5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3.
Those 1,000 send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total.  The
.5% response to that is 10,000 orders for REPORT #4.  That's 10,000
five dollar bills for you. CASH!!!!  Your total income in this example
is $50 + $500 + $5000 + $50,000 for a total of $55,550!!!!

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF 2,000 PEOPLE YOU
MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING... AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM!
DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE
OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF ONLY 2,000.  Believe me,
many people will do that and more!  By the way, your cost to
participate in this is practically nothing.  You obviously already
have an Internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!!  REPORT#3 will show
you the best methods for bulk e-mailing and purchasing e-mail lists.

THIS IS A LEGITIMATE, LEGAL, MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY.  It does not
require you to come in contact with people, do any hard work, and best
of all, you never have to leave the house except to get the mail.  If
you believe that someday you'll get that big break that you've been
waiting for, THIS IS IT!  Simply follow the instructions, and your
dream will come true.  This multi-level e-mail order marketing program
works perfectly...100% EVERY TIME.  E-mail is the sales tool of the
future.  Take advantage of this non-commercialized method of
advertising NOW!!  The longer you wait, the more people will be doing
business using e-mail.  Get your piece of this action!!

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability.  It is
being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford
Research and The Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50% and
65% of all goods and services will be sold throughout Multi-level
Methods by the mid to late 1990's.  This is a Multi-Billion Dollar
industry and of the 500,000 millionaires in the US, 20% (100,000) made
their fortune in the last several years in MLM.  Moreover, statistics
show 45 people become millionaires EVERY DAY through Multi-Level
Marketing.

This is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making
opportunity.  Basically, this is what we do:  As with all 
multi-level business, we build our business by recruiting new 
partners and selling our products.  Every state in the USA allows you
to recruit new multi-level business partners, and we offer a product
for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR ORDERS COME AND ARE FILLED THROUGH THE
MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling.  You do it
privately in your own home, store or office.

This is the GREATEST Multi-level Mail Order Marketing anywhere:

Here is how to work the program:

Step (1)   Order all four 4 REPORTS listed by NAME AND NUMBER.  
  Do this by ordering the REPORT from each of the four (4) 
 names listed on the next page.  For each REPORT, send $5 
  CASH and a SELF-ADDRESSED, STAMPED envelope  (BUSINESS 
  SIZE #10) to the person listed for the SPECIFIC REPORT.  
  International orders should also include $1 extra instead 
  of postage.  It is essential that you specify the NAME and 
 NUMBER of the report requested to the person you are 
  ordering from.  You will need ALL FOUR (4) REPORTS because 
 you will be REPRINTING and RE-SELLING them. DO NOT alter 
  the names or sequence beyond doing what the instructions say.       
          NOTE: Write your request on an 8 1/2 x 11 piece of paper 
 and wrap the cash in that BEFORE you put it in the 
  envelope. This helps to ensure the mail gets through!

Step (2)   Replace  the  name  and  address  under  REPORT #1  with
           yours,  moving the one that was there down to REPORT #2.
           Drop  the  name and address under REPORT #2 to REPORT #3,
           moving the one that was there to REPORT #4.  The name and
           address that was under REPORT #4 is dropped from the list
           and this party  is  no doubt on the way to the bank.  
   When doing   this,   make   certain   you  type  the  names  
  and addresses ACCURATELY!  DO NOT MIX UP MOVING 
  PRODUCT/REPORT POSITIONS!!!

Step (3)   Having made the required changes in the NAME list, save it
           as a text (.txt) file in it's own directory to be used 
 with whatever e-mail program you like.  Again, REPORT #3 
 will tell you the best methods of bulk e-mailing and 
 acquiring e-mail lists.

Step (4)   E-mail a copy of the entire program (all of this is very
           important) to everyone whose address you can get your 
 hands on. Start with friends and relatives since you can 
 encourage them to take  advantage of this fabulous money-making
           opportunity.  That's what I did.  And they love me now, 
 more than ever.  Then, e-mail to anyone and everyone!  Use 
 your  imagination!  You can get e-mail addresses from 
 companies on  the Internet who specialize in e-mail mailing lists. 
 These are very cheap: 100,000 addresses for around $35.00.

IMPORTANT:  You won't get a good response if you use an old list, so
always request a FRESH, NEW list. You will find out where to purchase
these lists when you order the four (4) REPORTS.

ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS!!!

CONCLUSION

        I am enjoying my fortune that I made by sending out this
program. You, too, will be making money within six months, if you
follow the SIMPLE STEPS outlined in this mailing.
        To be financially independent is to be FREE.  Free to make
financial decisions as never before.  Go into business, get into
investments, retire or take a vacation.  No longer will a lack of
money hold you back.
        However, very few people reach financial independence 
because, when opportunity knocks, they choose to ignore it.  It is
much easier  to say "NO" than "YES," and this is the question that you
must answer for yourself.   Will YOU ignore this amazing opportunity
or will you take advantage of it? If you do nothing, you have indeed
missed something valuable, and nothing will change.  Please re-read
this material; this is a special opportunity. If you have any
questions, please feel free to write to the sender of this
information.  You will get a prompt and informative reply.        My
method is simple.  I sell thousands of people a product for $5 that
costs me pennies to produce and e-mail.  I should also point out
again, that this program is legal and everyone who participates WILL
make money. This is not a chain letter or pyramid scheme.  At times
you have probably received chain letters, asking you to send money, on
faith, but getting NOTHING in return, NO product what-so-ever!  Not
only are chain letters illegal, but the risk of someone breaking the
chain makes them quite unattractive.        You are offering a
legitimate product to your people.  After they purchase the product
from you, they reproduce more and resell them. It's simple free
enterprise.  As you learned from the enclosed material, the PRODUCT is
a series of four (4) FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS REPORTS.  The information
contained in these REPORTS will not only help you in making your
participation in this program more rewarding, but will be useful to
you in any other business decisions you make in the years ahead. You
are also buying the rights to reprint all of the REPORTS, which will
be ordered from you by those to whom you mail this program.  The
concise one and two page REPORTS you will be buying can easily be
reproduced at a local copy center for a cost of about 3 cents a copy.
Best wishes with the program and Good Luck!

"IT WAS TRULY AMAZING"

"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my
mind to participate in this program.  But conservative as I am, I
decided that the initial investment was so little that there was no
way that I could not get enough orders to at least get my money back.
BOY, was I ever surprised when I found my medium sized post office box
crammed with orders!  I will make more money this year than any ten
years of my life before."

                                        Mary Riceland, Lansing, MI

TIPS FOR SUCCESS

Send for your four (4) REPORTS immediately so you will have them when
the orders start coming in.  When you receive a $5 order, you MUST
send out the product/service to comply with U.S. Postal and Lottery
laws.  Title 18 Sections 1302 and 1341 specifically state that:  "A
PRODUCT OR SERVICE MUST BE EXCHANGED FOR MONEY RECEIVED."

WHILE YOU WAIT FOR THE REPORTS TO ARRIVE:

1.      Name your new company. You can use your own name if you 
  desire.

2.      Get a post office box (preferred).

3.      Edit the names and addresses on the program. You must 
 remember,  your name and address go next to REPORT #1 and the 
 others  all move down one, with the fourth one being bumped OFF the 
 list.

4.      Obtain as many e-mail addresses as possible to send until 
 you receive the information on mailing list companies in REPORT 
 #3.

5.      Decide on the number of programs you intend to send out.  
  The more you send, and the quicker you send them, the more money
         you will make.

6.      After mailing the programs, get ready to fill the orders.

7.      Copy the FOUR (4) REPORTS so you are able to send them out 
  as soon as you receive an order. IMPORTANT: ALWAYS PROVIDE
         SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ORDERS YOU RECEIVE!

8.      Make certain the letter and reports are neat and legible.
*******************************************************************

YOUR GUARANTEE

The check point which GUARANTEES your success is simply this:  you
must receive 20 orders for REPORT #1.  This is a must!!!  If you don't
within two weeks, e-mail out more programs until you do.  Then a
couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for
REPORT #2, if you don't, send out more programs until you do.  Once
you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, (take a deep
breath) you can sit back and  relax,  because  YOU  ARE  GOING TO MAKE
 AT  LEAST  $50,000. Mathematically  it  is  a  proven guarantee.   Of
 those  who  have participated in the program and reached the above
GUARANTEES, ALL have reached their goal.  Also, remember, every time
your name is moved down the list, you are in front of a different
REPORT, so you can keep track of your program by knowing what people
are ordering from you. IT'S THAT EASY; REALLY, IT IS!!!

I think you've got the wrong end of the stick.  An open universe is one
which keeps expanding indefinitely, whereas a closed one is one which
will expand to a certain point, and then begin to contract again.

Or is it me whose wrong?  Some confusion here :-)

Several significantly superrealtime Mminds are a damn dynamic society. 
Transcension may occur within very short time periods, possibly less time
than it takes for you to purchase a ticket to LEO. I don't think we will
have a significant number of humans out of the gravity well living
sustainably by 2030/2040. Besides, technosphere may expand hard at the
light cone's limits. Get lost, in space? Might not be a viable

Fortunately, our universe does not seem to hurry too much to comply to ye

It's an entry in a database; tomato.red = TRUE. Everything you see
around you is just a database, and Dennet goes to great lengths to
demonstrate this. This is why human perception is so easily fooled,
and why hallucinations may well change a tomato into an elephant,
rather than swapping around bits of the visual field.

Nonsense. He's just saying that the high-level executive software 
doesn't realise how the low-level software works and is making false
assumptions about it.

It's an entry in a database. What's a database entry "really fundamentally
and phenomenally like"?

Recently, I have received an Unsolicited Commercial E-mail from you.
I do not like UCE's and I would like to inform you that sending
unsolicited messages to someone while he or she may have to pay for
reading your message may be illegal.  Anyway, it is highly annoying
and not welcome by anyone.  It is rude, after all.

If you think that this is a good way to advertise your products or
services you are mistaken.  Spamming will only make people hate you, not
buy from you.

If you have any list of people you send unsolicited commercial emails to, 
REMOVE me from such list immediately.  I suggest that you make this list 
just empty.

	----------------------------------------------------

If you are not an administrator of any site and still have received
this message then your email address is being abused by some spammer.
They fake your address in From: or Reply-To: header.  In this case,
you might want to show this message to your system administrator, and
ask him/her to investigate this matter.

Note to the postmaster(s): I append the text of UCE in question to
this message; I would like to hear from you about action(s) taken.
This message has been sent to postmasters at the host that is
mentioned as original sender's host (I do realize that it may be
faked, but I think that if your domain name is being abused this way
you might want to learn about it, and take actions) and to the
postmaster whose host was used as mail relay for this message.  If
message was sent not by your user, could you please compare time when
this message was sent (use time in Received: field of the envelope
rather than Date: field) with your sendmail logs and see what host was
using your sendmail at this moment of time.

Thank you.

Hello, my name is Tony and I'm with Dove Network Technologies.  I got

DISCOVER WHAT EXPERTS ARE CALLING THE MOST INCREDIBLE PART TIME OR 
FULL TIME MONEY MAKING BUSINESS  AVAILABLE TODAY!

AND IN DOING SO, YOU CAN JOIN THE RANKS OF THOSE EARNING $5,000.00+ 
PER WEEK, WORKING FROM HOME 

What follows is information on the POWERFUL, EXPLOSIVE, OPPORTUNITY 
you now have to join the fastest growing group I know of REAL PEOPLE,
WHO ARE RAPIDLY BECOMING WEALTHY!

 We are an international group of individuals with very diverse
 backgrounds.  It takes no special knowledge or experience to succeed
 with what we do.  Our members include:

  attorneys
  physicians
  CPA's and  licensed financial consultants
  housewives 
  students  
  blue collar workers
  It really doesn't matter!

Since the original founders of our organization first banded
together just over three years ago, we have grown to over 14,000 in
our membership throughout the United States and Canada and we are
adding literally 100's of new associates every day. 

 WHY ARE WE GROWING SO RAPIDLY? 

 BECAUSE WE ARE MAKING SO MUCH MONEY.  THAT'S WHY!

We are all independent thinking entrepreneurs who believe that the
working class of our society will prosper financially in the years to
come ONLY BY TAKING DEFINITIVE ACTIONS TODAY!  We all make our 
substantial livings by simply helping others to learn as we have, just 
what logical actions to take.


HERE ARE 15 GOOD REASONS YOU SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER JOINING US...

1.    YOU REALLY CAN EARN $5,000+ PER WEEK, WORKING FROM YOUR HOME....
By and large, the majority of us already are.  Why not you too?

2.    IT'S FAST AND EASY....
You can be up and going, trained and generating a HUGE CASH FLOW,
within 24 hours from the time you decide to join.   All you need is a
phone!!

3.    PROFITS THAT BOTH BUSINESS EXECUTIVES AND ENTREPRENEURS USUALLY 
ONLY DREAM OF.... A 90% profit margin on sales of $1,250 or $6,250 
respectively, means YOU NET EITHER $1,125.00 OR $5,625.00 ON **EVERY**
SALE!!

4.    EASY TO MARKET -- WE DON'T DO ANY SELLING....
Literally, all we do is explain what we offer and approximately ONE
IN FOUR BUYS!!  THERE IS NO HIGH PRESSURE (not even any LOW 
pressure)!  Fully 25% of our contacts just take our products right
out of our hands. 

5.  IT'S  NOT MLM....
This is just a straight up traditional business selling highly
marketable and valuable products that everyone wants, but can't get
anyplace else for ANYWHERE NEAR the price.  (Our $1,250 product's
ACTUAL VALUE is estimated by our industry's professionals at between
$10,000 and $15,000!!!) You can choose to join just for the powerful
products we offer, or you can do as many of us do and offer these
powerful products to others as well.  The choice is yours!

6.    NO INVENTORY MAINTENANCE OR ORDER FULFILLMENT....
Spend ALL of your time GENERATING PROFITS.  All you do is explain the 
products and the business.  Then, when someone purchases our
life-changing products, they are drop-shipped to your customers WITH
AN UNCONDITIONAL TEN DAY MONEY BACK GUARANTEE.  
(FYI; our product return rate is incredibly low)

7.    DEAL EXCLUSIVELY WITH ONLY INTERESTED PROSPECTS....
You will be talking ONLY with individuals who have previously
inquired about our products and/or business!!  If you have
even a LITTLE BIT of business or sales experience, you know that this
fact alone is a marketer's dream come true.  

8.    ALL PROCEEDS ARE PAID DIRECTLY TO YOU
Unlike most MLMs, this business REALLY IS your own!  Most "companies" 
tell you that you'll be operating your own business, but get you to 
sell their product with all the checks endorsed to, THEM.  This leaves
YOU with -0- financial control in "your own" business.  Here, YOU'RE
IN CONTROL!!

9.   ALL THE FRESH HOT LEADS YOU CAN HANDLE....
So many people have been looking for a business like this for so long,
that you'll have MORE ALREADY INTERESTED PROSPECTS TO TALK TO EVERY 
DAY THAN YOU'LL EVER KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH. In fact, we will show you 
how to decide which of the people who have contacted you, you should 
call back.  It is truly a matter of YOU DECIDING WHO GETS TO LEARN 
ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE TO OFFER.  You will have so many people contacting
you for information, you won't be able to handle the full response any
more than we can!

10.   TRAINING & MARKETING  SUPPORT SECOND TO NONE....
First, we'll train you in our unique, tried and proven marketing
techniques. Then, you'll begin calling back your first batch of people
who asked for information.  Most people who market our products make 1
or 2 sales their VERY FIRST WEEK.

But if you DO have any trouble making your sales at first, we're ALWAYS
there to HELP YOU MAKE THEM!!  Incidentally, even when WE sell them for
you, they still make the check out directly to YOU.  YOU still get to 
keep ALL OF THE PROFIT!  NOT BAD, HUH?

11.   OUR PRODUCTS STAND ON THEIR OWN..
Simply put, what we sell to earn our EXTRAORDINARY LIVING, IS
EDUCATION;  INCREDIBLE AND VERIFIABLY FACTUAL INFORMATION that 99% of 
the world's population doesn't even know exists -- INCLUDING most 
Attorneys, CPA's, Tax Experts, Tax Consultants, Financial Consultants,
Investment Strategists and the like.  In fact, this information is so 
valuable to so many people, that fully HALF OF THE PEOPLE JOINING OUR 
ASSOCIATION ARE DOING SO JUST TO OBTAIN THE KNOWLEDGE  FROM OUR 
PRODUCTS!  SEE WHAT I MEAN.....

HERE ARE EXAMPLES OF WHAT YOU WILL LEARN...

The single greatest SECRET the ultra wealthy have used for
generations to minimize or even eliminate their tax liabilities,
legally! YOU DONT HAVE TO BE A MILLIONAIRE TO BENEFIT FROM THIS!

The SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT STRATEGY the super wealthy have utilized 
to protect their families' assets from liens, judgments, and 
seizures!  (Did you know that today, thousands of American families 
a month are losing everything they have worked years for, through 
liens, judgments and seizures?)  THEY DIDNT THINK THEY NEEDED 
PROTECTION, EITHER, UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE!  NOW YOU CAN PROTECT 
YOUR FAMILY'S ASSETS TOO, QUICKLY AND INEXPENSIVELY!   

How the wealthy consistently pass their wealth from generation to 
generation WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY ANY PROBATE OR ESTATE TAXES.  AND,
THE ASSETS CHANGE HANDS IMMEDIATELY UPON A DEATH, NOT YEARS LATER!  
WE CERTAINLY ARENT TALKING WILLS AND LIVING TRUSTS HERE!

How to protect your family's PERSONAL AND FINANCIAL PRIVACY.  YES, 
YOU CAN, IF YOU KNOW HOW!!

How to TAKE MONEY OUT of a special account we can show you how to 
establish, FROM AROUND THE BLOCK,  OR AROUND THE WORLD, with no 
paper or electronic trail for snoops to follow!  Only YOU know you
got the funds!

How to set yourself up in business, with MORE PROTECTION than that
offered by incorporating, for much less money, AND WITH NO
GOVERNMENTAL REPORTING OR ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS!

How the really wealthy are able to achieve FINANCIAL RETURNS
(without risking their money!) WHICH ARE TEN OR MORE TIMES what we 
are offered!  BUT, HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS!   YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE A 
TON OF MONEY TO SHARE IN THESE RETURNS!

How to get for  FREE the kind of PERSONALIZED FINANCIAL ADVICE the 
super wealthy have had to spend tens or even hundreds of thousands 
of dollars to get!  FREE, ONE-ON-ONE CONSULTATIONS!!

AND MUCH, MUCH, MUCH, MORE!!!

I THINK YOU CAN SEE WHY THE VERY SPECIAL INFORMATION WE HAVE TO 
OFFER IS IN SUCH HIGH DEMAND!  AND WE ARE THE ONLY ONES OFFERING 
ALL  THIS INFORMATION!  BELIEVE ME, THAT'S THE POSITION YOU WANT 
TO BE IN!! 

12.   CREDIBILITY....
Our association is only about four years old, but has already
established itself as a well recognized, well reputed and universally
respected INTERNATIONAL organization.

13.   INCREDIBLE, VERIFIABLE TRACK RECORDS OF SUCCESS....
You'll be introduced to many, MANY others in our association (mostly
just average middle class people like you and me), WHO ARE ALREADY
EARNING (MANY) THOUSANDS OF $$$ PER WEEK IN THIS BUSINESS.  And, they 
have been making this money since almost the first week after joining 
us! Because of HOW we do what we do, there's a VERY short cash flow 
curve from when you get started. Sometimes less than one (1) WEEK!!


14.   SPEND LOTS MORE TIME WITH YOUR FAMILY....
If you are a seasoned parent, you already know how important this is. 
If you are a new parent, YOU NEED TO DISCOVER THE IMPORTANCE OF IT!

15.   THIS IS IT -- NO HYPE -- NO EXAGGERATION....
In over 20 years of Fortune 500 management experience, and several
more of owning and operating my own (some very successful) businesses,
before I TOOK A REAL GOOD LOOK AT THIS, of course I thought I'd seen 
it all.   But when I ran into this, as soon as I got the full picture,
it turned my previous view of business and even the views I had of
myself, INSIDE OUT!! I got started back in April of 1996, and haven't
had a second thought since!

Looking back now, I CAN TELL YOU TWO THINGS WITHOUT ANY 
HESITATION WHATSOEVER...  

 1.  You don't have to sell very much at all in this business to earn
 a FAR ABOVE AVERAGE INCOME.  And, if you wish to work at it,        
 you can even generate absolutely VULGAR profits, and    

 2.  You can expect an UNUSUAL BONUS.  Not long after I got up 
 and going, I learned that operating this business is not only very
 profitable, but also A LOT OF FUN!!  In fact, it is so much fun, and
 so lucrative that within six weeks of starting I dumped everything
 else I was doing, to do this full-time (Only about 30 hours a week!). 
 AWESOME!!

Actually, both is equivalent (at least in the simpler cosmological
models; I'm not sure this holds for more complex models). An open
universe is spatially infinite and will expand infinitely, a closed
universe is finite and will contract to a point after a certain time.

You are correct, but Anders was making a guess at what this "infinite 
regression fallacy" is, and why it is a faulty argument. He was not 
trying to explain a closed universe.

Recently, I have received an Unsolicited Commercial E-mail from you.
I do not like UCE's and I would like to inform you that sending
unsolicited messages to someone while he or she may have to pay for
reading your message may be illegal.  Anyway, it is highly annoying
and not welcome by anyone.  It is rude, after all.

If you think that this is a good way to advertise your products or
services you are mistaken.  Spamming will only make people hate you, not
buy from you.

If you have any list of people you send unsolicited commercial emails to, 
REMOVE me from such list immediately.  I suggest that you make this list 
just empty.

	----------------------------------------------------

If you are not an administrator of any site and still have received
this message then your email address is being abused by some spammer.
They fake your address in From: or Reply-To: header.  In this case,
you might want to show this message to your system administrator, and
ask him/her to investigate this matter.

Note to the postmaster(s): I append the text of UCE in question to
this message; I would like to hear from you about action(s) taken.
This message has been sent to postmasters at the host that is
mentioned as original sender's host (I do realize that it may be
faked, but I think that if your domain name is being abused this way
you might want to learn about it, and take actions) and to the
postmaster whose host was used as mail relay for this message.  If
message was sent not by your user, could you please compare time when
this message was sent (use time in Received: field of the envelope
rather than Date: field) with your sendmail logs and see what host was
using your sendmail at this moment of time.

Thank you.

     Hi.  Rick and I are really excited to be a part of this great financial opportunity.  We hope that you will feel the same way and join with us in building your finacial future!  This program only requires 3 things; a computer, an online hook up, and perseverance.  Please take the time to read about this program.  We're really glad we did. 

Shannon and Rick

PS  Our downline is now international!!  We hope that you, too, will join us.

******************************************************************************************************

 My name is Christopher Erickson.  Two years ago, the corporation I
worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was
eliminated.  After unproductive job interviews,  I decided to start my
own business.  In short order, however, I encountered many unforseen
financial problems.  I owed my family, friends, and creditors over
$35,000.  The economy was taking a toll on my business and I just
couldn't seem to make ends meet.  I had to refinance and borrow
against my home to support my family and struggling business.  I truly
believed it was wrong for me to be in debt like this.  AT THAT MOMENT
something significant happened in my life and I am writing to share my
experience in hopes that this will change your life
FOREVER....FINANCIALLY!!!        In mid December, I received this
program via e-mail.  Six months prior to receiving this program I had
been sending away for information on various business opportunities.
All of the programs I received, in my opinion, were not cost
effective.  They were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the
initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they worked
or not.  One claimed I'd make a million dollars in one year...it
didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make it.        But like I
was saying, in December of '92 I received this program.  I didn't send
for it, or ask for it, they just got my name off a mailing list. THANK
GOODNESS FOR THAT!!!  After reading it several times, to make sure I
was reading it correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes.  Here was a
MONEY-MAKING PHENOMENON.  I could invest as much as I wanted to start,
without putting me further in debt.  After I got a pencil and paper
and figured it out, I saw I would at least get my money back. After
determining that the program is LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER, I asked
myself "WHY NOT?" and decided to do it.
        Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails.  It only cost me about
$15.00 for my time on-line.  The great thing about e-mail is that I
didn't need any money for printing to send out the program, only the
cost to fulfill my orders.  I am telling you like it is, I hope it
doesn't turn you off, but I promised myself that I would not "cheat"
anyone, no matter how much money it cost me!.
        In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for
REPORT #1. By January 13th, I had received 26 orders for REPORT #1.
When you read the GUARANTEE in the program, you will see that "YOU
MUST RECEIVE 15 TO 20 ORDERS FOR REPORT #1 WITHIN TWO WEEKS.  IF
YOU
DON'T, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO!"  
        My first step in making $200,000 in 6 months was done.  
By January 30th, I had received 196 orders for REPORT #2.  If you go
back to the GUARANTEE, "YOU MUST RECEIVE 100 OR MORE ORDERS FOR
REPORT
#2 WITHIN TWO WEEKS.  IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU
DO.
ONCE YOU HAVE 100 ORDERS, THE REST IS EASY, RELAX, YOU WILL MAKE
YOUR
GOAL."  Well, I had 196 orders for REPORT #2, more than I needed.  So
I sat back and relaxed.  By March 19th, of my e-mailing of 10,000, I
received $58,000 with more coming in every day.
        I paid off  ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car.
Please take time to read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR
LIFE FOREVER! Remember,  it won't work  if you don't try it.  This
program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY!  Especially the
rules of not trying to place your name in a different place.  It
doesn't work, you'll lose out on a  lot  of  money!  REPORT  #2
explains this.  Always follow the guarantee, 20 orders minimum for
REPORT #1, and 100 or more orders for REPORT #2 and you will make
$200,000 or more in 6 months.  I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS !!!

        If you choose not to participate in this program, I'm sorry.
It really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you.  If
you do choose to participate, follow the program and you will be on
your way to financial security. If you are a fellow business owner and
you are in financial trouble like I was, or you want to start your own
business, consider this a sign.  I DID!

                                        Sincerely,
                                        Christopher Erickson

PS.  Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look like 
        piled up on a kitchen table? IT'S AWESOME!

"THREW IT AWAY"
        "I  had  received  this program before.  I  threw  it away,
but later wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try.  Of course, I
had no idea who to contact to get a copy, so I had to wait until I was
e-mailed another copy of the program.  Eleven months passed, then it

try."

"NO FREE LUNCH"
        "My late father always told me, "Remember, Alan, there is no
free lunch in life.  You get out of life what you put into it."
Through trial and error and a somewhat slow, frustrating start, I
finally figured it out. The program works very well, I just had to
find the right target group of people to e-mail it to.  So far this
year, I have made over $63,000 using this program.  I know my dad
would have been very proud of me."

A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM

By the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the
enclosed program and reports, you should have concluded that such a
program,  and  one that is legal,  could not have been created by an
amateur.

Let me tell you a little about myself.  I had a profitable business
for ten years.  Then in 1979 my business began falling off.  I was
doing the same things that were previously successful for me, but it
wasn't working.  Finally, I figured it out.  It wasn't me; it was the
economy. Inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that
had been with us since 1945.  I don't have to tell you what happened
to the unemployment rate...because many of you know from first hand
experience. There were more failures and bankruptcies than ever
before.

The middle class was vanishing.  Those who knew what they were doing
invested wisely and moved up.  Those who did not, including those who
never had anything to save or invest, were moving down into the ranks
of the poor.  As the saying goes, "THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR
GET POORER."  The traditional methods of making money will never allow
you to "move up" or "get rich"; inflation will see to that. You have
just received information that can give you financial freedom for the
rest of your life, with "NO RISK" and "JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT."
You can make more money in the next few months than you have ever
imagined. 

I should also point out that I will not see a penny of your money, nor
anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program.  I have
already made over FOUR MILLION DOLLARS!  I have retired from the
program after sending out over 16,000 programs.  Now I have several
offices which market this and several other programs here in the US
and overseas.  By the Spring, we wish to market the 'Internet' by a
partnership with AMERICA ONLINE.

Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED.  Do not change it in any
way. It works exceedingly well as it is now.  Remember to e-mail a
copy of this exciting program to everyone that you can think of.  One
of the people you send this to may send out 50,000...and your name
will be on every one of them!.  Remember though, the more you send
out, the more potential customers you will reach.

So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and
opportunity to become financially independent, IT IS UP TO YOU NOW!

"THINK ABOUT IT"

Before you delete this program from your mailbox, as I almost did,
take a little time to read it and REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.  Get a pencil
and figure out what could happen when YOU participate.  Figure out the
worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it, you will
still make a lot of money!  Definitely you will get back what you
invested.  Any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come
in.  IT WORKS!

                                        Paul Johnson, Raleigh, NC

HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU $$$$$$

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and
we'll assume you and all those involved send out 2,000 programs each.
Let's also assume that the mailing receives a .5% response.  Using a
good list the response would be much better.  Also many people will
send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2,000.  But
continuing with this example, you send out only 2,000 programs.  With
a .5% response, that is only 10 orders for REPORT #1. 
 Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000 programs each for a
total of 20,000.  Out of those .5%, 100 people respond and order
REPORT #2.  Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of
200,000.  The .5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3.
Those 1,000 send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total.  The
.5% response to that is 10,000 orders for REPORT #4.  That's 10,000
five dollar bills for you. CASH!!!!  Your total income in this example
is $50 + $500 + $5000 + $50,000 for a total of $55,550!!!!

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF 2,000 PEOPLE YOU
MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING... AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM!
DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE
OR HALF SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF ONLY 2,000.  Believe me,
many people will do that and more!  By the way, your cost to
participate in this is practically nothing.  You obviously already
have an Internet connection and e-mail is FREE!!!  REPORT#3 will show
you the best methods for bulk e-mailing and purchasing e-mail lists.

THIS IS A LEGITIMATE, LEGAL, MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY.  It does not
require you to come in contact with people, do any hard work, and best
of all, you never have to leave the house except to get the mail.  If
you believe that someday you'll get that big break that you've been
waiting for, THIS IS IT!  Simply follow the instructions, and your
dream will come true.  This multi-level e-mail order marketing program
works perfectly...100% EVERY TIME.  E-mail is the sales tool of the
future.  Take advantage of this non-commercialized method of
advertising NOW!!  The longer you wait, the more people will be doing
business using e-mail.  Get your piece of this action!!

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability.  It is
being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford
Research and The Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50% and
65% of all goods and services will be sold throughout Multi-level
Methods by the mid to late 1990's.  This is a Multi-Billion Dollar
industry and of the 500,000 millionaires in the US, 20% (100,000) made
their fortune in the last several years in MLM.  Moreover, statistics
show 45 people become millionaires EVERY DAY through Multi-Level
Marketing.

This is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making
opportunity.  Basically, this is what we do:  As with all 
multi-level business, we build our business by recruiting new 
partners and selling our products.  Every state in the USA allows you
to recruit new multi-level business partners, and we offer a product
for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR ORDERS COME AND ARE FILLED THROUGH THE
MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling.  You do it
privately in your own home, store or office.

This is the GREATEST Multi-level Mail Order Marketing anywhere:

Here is how to work the program:

Step (1)   Order all four 4 REPORTS listed by NAME AND NUMBER.  
  Do this by ordering the REPORT from each of the four (4) 
 names listed on the next page.  For each REPORT, send $5 
  CASH and a SELF-ADDRESSED, STAMPED envelope  (BUSINESS 
  SIZE #10) to the person listed for the SPECIFIC REPORT.  
  International orders should also include $1 extra instead 
  of postage.  It is essential that you specify the NAME and 
 NUMBER of the report requested to the person you are 
  ordering from.  You will need ALL FOUR (4) REPORTS because 
 you will be REPRINTING and RE-SELLING them. DO NOT alter 
  the names or sequence beyond doing what the instructions say.       
          NOTE: Write your request on an 8 1/2 x 11 piece of paper 
 and wrap the cash in that BEFORE you put it in the 
  envelope. This helps to ensure the mail gets through!

Step (2)   Replace  the  name  and  address  under  REPORT #1  with
           yours,  moving the one that was there down to REPORT #2.
           Drop  the  name and address under REPORT #2 to REPORT #3,
           moving the one that was there to REPORT #4.  The name and
           address that was under REPORT #4 is dropped from the list
           and this party  is  no doubt on the way to the bank.  
   When doing   this,   make   certain   you  type  the  names  
  and addresses ACCURATELY!  DO NOT MIX UP MOVING 
  PRODUCT/REPORT POSITIONS!!!

Step (3)   Having made the required changes in the NAME list, save it
           as a text (.txt) file in it's own directory to be used 
 with whatever e-mail program you like.  Again, REPORT #3 
 will tell you the best methods of bulk e-mailing and 
 acquiring e-mail lists.

Step (4)   E-mail a copy of the entire program (all of this is very
           important) to everyone whose address you can get your 
 hands on. Start with friends and relatives since you can 
 encourage them to take  advantage of this fabulous money-making
           opportunity.  That's what I did.  And they love me now, 
 more than ever.  Then, e-mail to anyone and everyone!  Use 
 your  imagination!  You can get e-mail addresses from 
 companies on  the Internet who specialize in e-mail mailing lists. 
 These are very cheap: 100,000 addresses for around $35.00.

IMPORTANT:  You won't get a good response if you use an old list, so
always request a FRESH, NEW list. You will find out where to purchase
these lists when you order the four (4) REPORTS.

ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS!!!

REQUIRED REPORTS

CONCLUSION

        I am enjoying my fortune that I made by sending out this
program. You, too, will be making money within six months, if you
follow the SIMPLE STEPS outlined in this mailing.
        To be financially independent is to be FREE.  Free to make
financial decisions as never before.  Go into business, get into
investments, retire or take a vacation.  No longer will a lack of
money hold you back.
        However, very few people reach financial independence 
because, when opportunity knocks, they choose to ignore it.  It is
much easier  to say "NO" than "YES," and this is the question that you
must answer for yourself.   Will YOU ignore this amazing opportunity
or will you take advantage of it? If you do nothing, you have indeed
missed something valuable, and nothing will change.  Please re-read
this material; this is a special opportunity. If you have any
questions, please feel free to write to the sender of this
information.  You will get a prompt and informative reply.        My
method is simple.  I sell thousands of people a product for $5 that
costs me pennies to produce and e-mail.  I should also point out
again, that this program is legal and everyone who participates WILL
make money. This is not a chain letter or pyramid scheme.  At times
you have probably received chain letters, asking you to send money, on
faith, but getting NOTHING in return, NO product what-so-ever!  Not
only are chain letters illegal, but the risk of someone breaking the
chain makes them quite unattractive.        You are offering a
legitimate product to your people.  After they purchase the product
from you, they reproduce more and resell them. It's simple free
enterprise.  As you learned from the enclosed material, the PRODUCT is
a series of four (4) FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS REPORTS.  The information
contained in these REPORTS will not only help you in making your
participation in this program more rewarding, but will be useful to
you in any other business decisions you make in the years ahead. You
are also buying the rights to reprint all of the REPORTS, which will
be ordered from you by those to whom you mail this program.  The
concise one and two page REPORTS you will be buying can easily be
reproduced at a local copy center for a cost of about 3 cents a copy.
Best wishes with the program and Good Luck!

"IT WAS TRULY AMAZING"

"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my
mind to participate in this program.  But conservative as I am, I
decided that the initial investment was so little that there was no
way that I could not get enough orders to at least get my money back.
BOY, was I ever surprised when I found my medium sized post office box
crammed with orders!  I will make more money this year than any ten
years of my life before."

                                        Mary Riceland, Lansing, MI

TIPS FOR SUCCESS

Send for your four (4) REPORTS immediately so you will have them when
the orders start coming in.  When you receive a $5 order, you MUST
send out the product/service to comply with U.S. Postal and Lottery
laws.  Title 18 Sections 1302 and 1341 specifically state that:  "A
PRODUCT OR SERVICE MUST BE EXCHANGED FOR MONEY RECEIVED."

WHILE YOU WAIT FOR THE REPORTS TO ARRIVE:

1.      Name your new company. You can use your own name if you 
  desire.

2.      Get a post office box (preferred).

3.      Edit the names and addresses on the program. You must 
 remember,  your name and address go next to REPORT #1 and the 
 others  all move down one, with the fourth one being bumped OFF the 
 list.

4.      Obtain as many e-mail addresses as possible to send until 
 you receive the information on mailing list companies in REPORT 
 #3.

5.      Decide on the number of programs you intend to send out.  
  The more you send, and the quicker you send them, the more money
         you will make.

6.      After mailing the programs, get ready to fill the orders.

7.      Copy the FOUR (4) REPORTS so you are able to send them out 
  as soon as you receive an order. IMPORTANT: ALWAYS PROVIDE
         SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ORDERS YOU RECEIVE!

8.      Make certain the letter and reports are neat and legible.
*******************************************************************

YOUR GUARANTEE

The check point which GUARANTEES your success is simply this:  you
must receive 20 orders for REPORT #1.  This is a must!!!  If you don't
within two weeks, e-mail out more programs until you do.  Then a
couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for
REPORT #2, if you don't, send out more programs until you do.  Once
you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT #2, (take a deep
breath) you can sit back and  relax,  because  YOU  ARE  GOING TO MAKE
 AT  LEAST  $50,000. Mathematically  it  is  a  proven guarantee.   Of
 those  who  have participated in the program and reached the above
GUARANTEES, ALL have reached their goal.  Also, remember, every time
your name is moved down the list, you are in front of a different
REPORT, so you can keep track of your program by knowing what people
are ordering from you. IT'S THAT EASY; REALLY, IT IS!!!

Sorry, I just let my reflexes run amok in my mailbox (I just press a
button to respond to spam). I'll try to check the recipients of my
responses more closely. However, I have got some responses back which
suggests that extropians@extropy.org has been removed from the spam
list; a small consolation.

Never having formally done Zen or vipanasa, all I can say is that the
congruency has occurred to me as a possibility, too. The hazards seem
similar, too--am I falling asleep? am I ego-tripping? am I only kidding
myself that I am seeing something at a particular time?

But some approaches invite a kind of relaxed split attention, which is
probably not true Zen: you still have a little agenda nudging you along,
whether that's playfulness or generative change or whatever.

One simple (silly?) example, illustrative of the kinds of things Grinder,
Delozier & Associates were using as, I think, a combination of warm-up
exercise and research: without letting it become the exclusive focus of
attention, see if you can, in the course of a normal conversation,
correlate the other person's lip dimensions and color with some aspect of
the communication you are having. Make a determination. Complete the
conversation. Check your results with another person doing the same
exercise with that particular person.

No guarantee is made that you will see the same thing. But isn't it
interesting what a room full of people can (think?) they see? Did everybody
just groupthink their way along? Hmmmm.

And I remember sharply the discovery that "simple" is not identical with
"easy". :) :)

I don't have the info ready at hand. Third-party accounts disagree over
what the results meant, but that in itself means little. I'll post to the
group if I find good source material.

I'm not too sure about a closed universe being finite - or to be more
specific existing in a finite space.  From my understanding, a way
around the problem of there being boundaries to the closed universe is
to say that "in a closed universe, space is infinite, but the matter
within it only expands to a finite point".

It makes a great deal of difference to cosmological models in my
experience of them, but only on the grand scale of things, not re. local
events.

Not that this is the point of this thread :)

Nononono! A closed universe doesn't have a boundary, but its total
volume is finite. It is not a ball of stars in a huge emptiness.

The spatial geometry of a closed Friedman universe is equivalent to a
3-sphere, while the geometry of an open universe is a
3-pseudosphere. General relativistic cosmology does not assume
anything "outside" the spacetime manifold - it is simply not
necessary.

Don't apologise - it's nice to see that someone is keeping an eye on
spammers!  I am sure your response did more good than harm.

OK....  I think I'll have to check my physics books tonight (unless

	In spite of his arguments, Dennett's eliminative materialist
position is not very popular.

	When I see a juicy red strawberry, there is something very
phenomenally real and 3 dimensional built out of qualia in my
conscious mind that is representing this package of sugar in my hand.
Though this representation is, in a way, data, there is no
strawberry.red = TRUE.  There is a red phenomenon that represents the
fact that this package reflects 700nm light.  My percept of a
strawberry just is.  There is no high/low level interpretation of the
representation of the strawberry required like interpretaion of
abstract data is required.  It just is my perception of the
strawberry.

> What's a database entry "really fundamentally and phenomenally
> like"?

	By definition, abstract data representations ignore the actual
fundamental qualities.  Typically they are fundamentally the
orientation of magnetic flux on a disk.  At the fundamental level this
is what abstract models are built out of.  But of course you could use
punched paper to represent the same "abstract" information even though
it is fundamentally very different.  This is the meaning of
"abstract".  It is one physical phenomenon being set up to model or
represent something else or some other phenomenon.

	Red is fundamentally not anything like 700 nm light.  It's
phenomenal qualities only abstractly represent what light is like.  It
is one phenomenon modeling another.  It is conscious knowledge about
something.  It is so much more than a particular bit being interpreted
as the red bit being true.  It is red, no interpretation required.

The question isn't whether he's popular, but whether he's right. When
people first suggested that humans were descended from apes their
position wasn't very popular, and that situation seems very similar
to the current antipathy to the idea of humans being pretentious
computers.

Three-dimensional in your conscious mind? You mean there's a 3D
strawberry inside your head? Presumably this means that noone can
ever perceive an elephant or whale, since the 3D qualia wouldn't 
fit? And could you point to a qualia, because I'd really like to
see one?

A statement which, frankly, tells us absolutely nothing about 
anything... except your belief that you understand how your
brain works. As a scientist I like to have some evidence for
theories, and you aren't providing any.

Yes, it's a database entry.

You assert. Now can you give us some evidence?

 As much as I agree with you, Ian, if you aren't going to file a lawsuit
 against the press and the FBI, then just give it up. You have already

I have a small confession to make: as you might guess, my childhood
peers were not particularly fond of people who wanted to read or think
about "weird" things. As a result, I decided in a classical cartoon
mad scientist style to get my revenge upon them in the future, in some
creative way (preferably involving large amounts of thermonuclear
power or something similar). But a while later I realized that any
normal kind of revenge would be rather pointless; what would I really
accomplish with it? Instead I came up with a truly devious plan: I
wanted to remake the world so that the likes of me would be on top,
and all the idiots would know that in order to become successful they
would have to become like me. That would be a most fitting revenge,
and quite constructive too.

Unfortunately Bill Gates seems to have beaten me to my revenge, but it
still seems to work. :-)

Seriously, I think it is more rational and efficient to find ways to
circumvent or ignore the anti-tech/anti-intellectuals. Direct
confrontations are so silly.

We discussed this at the Aleph dinner yesterday. One idea we came up
with in order to avoid strong reactionary forces is to make sure we
listen to dissidents, and make them an acknowledged part of our way of
planning. Despite their views, they sometimes have true things to say,
and letting them argue their case makes some of the steam blow off,
which otherwise would have increased the pressure.

If we look far enough out, we should see when the voids formed, and this
theory would seem to predict that each void would expand rapidly from a 
central point.  We aren't too far from testing this prediction I think.

Radical energy conservation seems a bizzare tendency to observe in *all* voids
across the universe.  They obviously aren't hiding from each other, after
all.  It would seem to imply they can't create new universes to explore, and 
so realize that their local energy is all they'll ever have.  

Having neutral zones full of visibly noisy galaxies also seems odd.
In neutral zones on earth, one tries to minimize activity so that it is easist
to tell if someone is trying to cross.

Hmm, I *think* you mean something like this: the conceptualization of
the closed universe will be something like a ball, inside a space of
some kind. That space will be another universe, and so on. Am I right?>>

	YES!  It is possible that the actual lay out of this 3D space
is somewhat or even extremely distorted, like an autocad 3D model laid
out on a hard drive is almost randomly distributed, but there is some
evidence that this distortion isn't two extreme, at least within the
visual cortex itself.  And if you think about it, it is much more
efficient, having the layout somewhat 3D, for processing such
information as edge detection and such.  The more the representation
distorts from actual 3D, the more inter neuron communication there
must be to comprehend the representations.  I have some papers on this
that go into much more detail if your interested.

	Also, 3D parts of our body are very clearly laid out in
portions of the brain.  True, the hands are distorted to be much
larger and dense than other parts of the body for obvious reasons, but
the general 3D maps can clearly be seen.  If you stimulate the correct
part of the brain while doing brain surgery, the person feels a
sensation in the corresponding part of his body, not in his brain.

	When you are looking at a 6 foot Christmas tree, you think
your perception of it is 6 feet tall when in actuality it is less than
a centimeter in your visual cortex, depending of course on how close
you are to it.  It only seems that big because it is in the proper
preportions with all your other conscious visual knowledge.  Haven't
you ever seen one of those brain pictures with the tree being
projected onto the retina of the eye, and the corresponding image
overlaid in the primary visual cortex which would be a representation
of the tree in our consciousness in the visual cortex at the back of
the brain?

	Why do you think mountains on the horizon several miles away,
the moon many hundreds of thousands of miles behind them, the sun many
millions of miles behind it, and the stars many light-years behind it,
all look like they are the same distance?  It is because there is only
so much room in your visual cortex and these objects are all
represented at the edge of this representational space in your mind.
Again, the representation is obviously nothing like reality.  But it's
hard for you to realize this because your representations are all you
know.  But remember, you can abstractly cognisize about the difference
between a light year and and several miles, even though these
distances don't fit within your visual cortex without some distortion.

> And could you point to a qualia, because I'd really like to see one?

	This is precisely the point.  We can point to more or less 3D
spaces in our brain which must be some kind of neural corelate to
conscious qualia.  If we stimulate a certain part of the visual
cortex, a visual sensation occurs in the visual space that seems to
the experiencer to be beyond his eye wrather than in his brain.  (If
you really think abou this, if this were not true, artificial eyes
would not be possible, yet more scientific proof...) The qualia must,
in some way, be very closely related to such stimulation at that
location in the brain.  Though we know the general location, we don't
yet quite know what qualia are and how they are produced, and how they
are unified together to make up our conscious knowledge.  Once we
discover the answer to this question, we will have made the greatest
scientific discovy to date and finally know what consciousness is
fundamentally made of.

> As a scientist I like to have some evidence for theories, and you
> aren't providing any.

	Some of what I say is assertions, but it is mostly rational
reasons and scientific evidence which you seem to be ignoring or
failing to comprehend.  My communication abilities aren't to swift so
it is probably mostly my fault.  I apologize for this and appreciate
your patience.  There is plenty of scientific evidence for all this
stuff.  Most of it is in common every day thinking and experience,
it's just that our common sense thinking about it is incorrect in some
places (like you think the tree is really beyond your eyes).  Once you
realize this it all makes perfect sense and the "common sense"
contradictions and impossibilities become much more obvious and vanish
with true acurate predicting understanding.

Mental masturbation.
I've read many of your posts concerning the brain, uploading, etc. and
without knowing much more about you I consider you very thoughtful
and intelligent. However, society subtley assaults you daily(as it does most
of us) with its mystical epistemology and it is cutting off your integration

  those fallacies as superior to the facts. Amazing how

Why does the economy grow?  Why do some places and times grow
faster than others?  The relevance to such questions to 
topics frequently discussed on this list should be obvious.

There is a large economic literature on economic growth, and 
I can assure you that those who contribute to this literature
understand a lot of important things about growth.  I urge
anyone who really wants to speculate well on the future
to understand this literature.

I can't say I understand it that well, but I've been reading a
bit the last day or so.  Here's some interesting tidbits:

-- Total growth is mainly due to improved productivity via diffusion
of lots of little insights in societies where innovation is accepted.  
Scale effects, via standardization, size of markets, etc., are crucial.
The capital/labor share of improved productivity is about 50/50.
-- Per capita growth rates between nations have been highly divergent; 
The lower nation that catches up to the higher nation is the 
exception; typically the higher pulls away.  The lowest nations now
are about as low (in per capital income) as all nations were once.  
-- Since 1870, US growth rates have been roughly constant.  
-- Britain took off initially most likely due to strong social 
controls on birth rates, free markets, and a strong culture of 
hobby science.  Even then the takeoff was very slow.
-- American then took over because of additionally having a
combination of natural resources and a large integrated market.
British capital was invested in the U.S.
-- The soviets grew fast at first, via huge capital influxes from
high (forced) savings, but this was understandably a one-time effect.
-- Depending on the technology of the time, human vs. other capital 
were complements or substitutes.  When newly complements, those 
higher skilled got extra wages, increasing the income gap, 
and education shot up.  Computers favor complementarity.
-- Most of the recent Asian growth has been due to high capital
inputs, rather than productivity growth.  High capital came from 
high savings due to a demographic change, then capital came from abroad.

Whether "global warming" is currently occurring or will occur in the
future is somewhat controversial.  Forced reductions in the emissions
of "greenhouse gases" is currently the main strategy proposed when
governmental policy makers consider the topic.  Is there an
alternative or complementary approach?  If the effect is real then
some interesting mega-engineering might be attempted.  Below are some
proposals that have been considered by the National Academy of
Sciences.  Of course, some of these proposals can be criticized for
ignoring unintended consequences, being unrealistic, or being
hubristic, etc. But they are fun, and one or more of them might work
in a desirable fashion. We should not foreclose options.

Space Mirror's: Place 50,000 100 km^2 mirror's in Earth's orbit to
reflect incoming sunlight.

Stratospheric Dust: Use guns or balloons to maintain a dust cloud in
the stratosphere to increase the sunlight reflection.

Stratospheric Bubbles: Place billions of aluminized, hydrogen-filled
balloons in the stratosphere to provide a reflective screen.

Low Stratospheric Dust: Use aircraft to maintain a cloud of dust in
the low stratosphere to reflect sunlight

Low Stratospheric Soot: Decrease efficiency of burning in engines of
aircraft flying in the low stratosphere to maintain a thin cloud of
soot to intercept sunlight.

Cloud Stimulation: Burn Sulfur in ships or power plants to form
sulfate aerosol in order to stimulate additional low marine clouds to
reflect sunlight.

Ocean Biomass Stimulation: Place iron in the oceans to stimulate
generation of CO_2-absorbing phytoplankton.

Atmospheric CFC Removal: Use lasers to break up CFCs in the atmosphere.

Reforestation: Reforest 28.7 Mha of economically or environmentally
marginal crop and pasture lands and nonfederal forest lands to
sequester 10 percent of U.S. CO_2 emissions.

Nuclear: Replace all existing fossil-fuel-fired plants with nuclear
power plants such as advanced light-water reactors.

Methanol from Biomass: Replace all existing gasoline vehicles with
those that use methanol produced from biomass.

Solar Photovoltaics: Replace fossil-fuel-fired plants with solar
photovoltaics generation potential of 2.5 quads.

The National Academy of Sciences report that considers these proposals
and many others is available on the web.

  IAN: The identity of a thing encompasses the whole.
  As such, TWA 800 is larger than TWA 800. On this list
  the discourse, or should I say one-sided debate with
  myself offering facts countered only by anti-intell-
  ectual slop, has provided an important example of 
  barbarian-memetic-defense strategies.

  Just as the immune systems of a cell defends its core
  genetic code against invasive viri (that would attempt
  to insert a new genetic code) with focused free-radical 
  bombardment, so too the immune system of the "authoritarian
  cell" defends itself memetic code (truth by authoritarian
  decree) against invasive memes with focused bombardment
  of anti-personnel ad hominem fallacies: "crazy" "wako"
  "paranoid" "get a life."

  We've seen a beautiful display of that right here with my
  non-insulting presentation of factual data countered with
  a bombardment of anti-personnel ad hominem fallacies.

  I find it as pathetic as I do fascinating. Only a memetic
  code that was not logical, and which the host could detect
  was not logical, would require recourse to self-defense by 
  resort to fallacy. A logical memetic code would require 
  only the use of logic to test competing memes. 


  I've offered the Navy-missile theory, while based on facts,
  not as a fact itself. I have encouraged others to test it
  with logic -- it could be false. Unfortunately all those 
  who test it, test not it but ME with personal attacks.
  This is itself a situation larger than TWA 800, it 
  stands as a shinning example of inquiry vs insult,
  facts vs fallacies, theory vs thuggery, proposition 
  vs persecution, civility vs barbarism.

  When challenging "truth by authoritarian decree"
  what else should one expect? Expecting otherwise
  was my mistake in pursuing this line of inquiry.

  IAN: So, since you defined Abraham's TWA 800 arguments,
  which were 100% ad hominem, as "truly meaningful," and
  thanked him for posting them, and yet found my arguments, 
  100% facts, as "ranting" inappropriate for the list, it 
  follows that only ad hominem as appropriate for the list. 

  I quite disagree.

Just so. Our CO2 emmissions may just as easily be forestalling an Ice

Umm, Brent, on this particular matter I think you may be off the beam a
bit. I think they all look like they're at the same distance because
there's only so much distance between my eyeballs. I am of the opinion
that if I could provide myself with a long enough interpupillary distance,
I could indeed tell the diference.

I think there may well be representational/modeling nonlinearities, I
*know* there are perceptual and mediation nonlinearities (for a simple
example, a fixed frequency tone source changes pitch depending on how loud
it is)... I just think this particulat one may be a somewhat bogus
example.

There is an interesting serialized essay, "Volitional Synapses" by 
Stephen Boydstun in volume 2 issues 1, 2 and 4 of _Objectivity_ that 
covers some of these notions.  See

	http://www.bomis.com/objectivity/

for details.

I tend to agree with Damien (love that name!:).  I would also say, even
without the neuroscience perspective, it is possible to integrate the
inner (phenomenological) and outer (causal) views of mind.  The
probably has been that philosophies of mind usually approach these
either by dualism or monism.  Either they radically separate the two
realms -- as if they are metaphysically distinct -- or they completely
reduce one to an epiphenomenon of the other (e.g., Berkeley's
idealism or Marxist materialism).  But I'd rather not go into a lot of
detail on this.  My desire is to achieve technotranscendence (then
take it for granted:) -- not endlessly discuss it.:)

A theory is usually implied in any of this stuff.  Making it explicit
is the first step toward refining it.

Insight?  I'd be more likely to call it a banality.:)

Again, this seems commonplace, though it might be good to make

An instance of this might be anorexics who generally start the dieting 
process by "seeing" themselves as extremely obese.  They try to
picture themselves as overly fat when they look in the mirror.

It all sounds very interesting, but does it work?  And as compared to 
other cures, what is its success rate?

I believe there is some precedent for this.  NLP might have deep roots.
For example, it would seem that Aristotle's theory of tragedian is
based on the notion that the guided (by the poet) action of the drama
can effect changes in the audience's emotional makeup.  See my:
http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/8422/ust1.htm and the
references contained therein.

I would think otherwise.  It could be placebo, but it could be more
if actual "permanent" change is had.

You will get no argument from me on the philosophy of science
issue, BUT in this particular case -- positive vs. negative or zero
curvature -- doesn't the latter view cohere with a lot more data
-- however scant the data for either may be?

For the record, I have no problem accepting a theory which is not
supported by shiploads of evidence, but I do have a problem
accepting one that seems to contradict evidence.  In this area,
one has to do some major handwaving to avoid some of the
evidence.  Also, unlike, say, the example of the neutrino, where
a major item of knowledge seemed to be contradicted by proton
neutron decay, there is nothing like that going on here.  In other
words, nothing to warrant acceptance of dark matter on the
scale needed to make the universe closed.

(For those unfamiliar with the neutrino example, what happened is 
basically this.  In nuetron decay it was discovered that they break
down into an electron and a proton.  The paths, from cloud chamber
tracks, between the proton and electron as they fled from the decay
event was not as expected, exactly opposite -- the electron heading
one way which the proton went in the opposite direction. To account
for this Pauli guessed there must be another particle, the neutrino --
so named for it being small and neutral in charge -- that took up the 
slack and preserved conservation of momentum.  The latter is the
major item of knowledge seemingly contradicted by the evidence.
It could have been that neutrinos were a fantasy, but later
experiments proved their existence.  Ergo, Pauli's guess was a
good one.  I believe the case with lots of exotic dark matter is NOT
the same.  We don't have the same kind of weight with theories of
cosmology.  At least, this is my judgment in the matter.  Sorry for
the digression and I hope I recalled my history correctly.:)

Certainly, but that position is already spoken for and widely
accepted.  We need go no further than the current Standard
Model and its supporters.  Let's assume, for the moment,
that they are wrong.  What next?

You wrote:  "There are a multitude of other observed phenomena
which align[sic] well with the theory of a closed universe, as well
as theoretical reasons for believing that such a case is probable."
I'm homing in on the last word and wondering why you think so.
How is a closed universe theory more likely than an open one?

Yes, but by the same token, can you?  I can only look at what is most

Perhaps, but I fear all of this might be overoptimistic.  Also, I have this

Daniel Druckman and John A. Swets, eds, *Enhancing Human Performance:
Issues, Theories, and Techniques*, National Academy Press, 1987.

Here's a bit from my book THE LOTTO EFFECT:

================================

It was distinctly creepy, when the full report from the Committee on
Techniques for the Enhancement of Human Performance was published in 1988,
to read of `an initiative within the Army to consider techniques based on
paranormal phenomena, for example, extrasensory perception to view remote
sites and psychokinesis to influence the operation of distant machines.'
		
Had the Defense Department gone mad?  Not entirely.  The Committee did not,
for example, examine the credentials of the Flat Earth Society.  It
neglected to study the guidance and ancient wisdom said to be available
from the stars, unlike its Commander-in-Chief who, it was later revealed,
never took a consequential step without the all-clear from Nancy's
astrologer.  

The methodologies under scrutiny were more sober than that - but only just.
 Apart from parapsychology, various programs meant to boost psychological
cohesion and effectiveness were perused.  Suggestive Accelerative Learning
and Teaching, for instance, employs `a combination of physical relaxation,
mental concentration, guided imagery, suggestive principles, and baroque
music with the intent of improving classroom performance'.  This discipline
has its own academic journal, based at Iowa State University.  Hemispheric
Synchronisation, or Hemi-Sync, is advocated by an early out-of-body
enthusiast, Robert Monroe, and purports to do you good by running a
binaural beat into your head through two earphones.  SyberVision uses
expert coaching by videotape, augmenting your powers via mental rehearsal.
NeuroLinguistic Programming is perhaps the best known, a kind of New Age
hot-tub behaviourism meant to put you in charge of the control procedures
said to script and orchestrate our lives - just what the Army needed to
spruce up its officer training regime.

By and large, the results reported were disappointing.  None of these
technique packages were thought likely to turn out supermen.  Learning
during sleep, for example, was debunked.  Hemi-Sync's bid to integrate the
two cerebral hemispheres failed to impress the Committee, as did `attempts
to increase information-processing capacity by presenting material
separately to the two hemispheres', which is rather a shame.  Visual
concentration was written off.  Still, the Committee did recommend
follow-ups on several lines: accelerated learning, biofeedback, and
NeuroLinguistic Programming - even though it found `no scientific evidence
that neurolinguistic programming is an effective strategy for exerting
influence.'

==================

...less saliently...

==================

Indeed, even a cursory reading of the very sprightly chapter `Paranormal
Phenomena' in Enhancing Human Performance suggests that right from the
outset the committee had its tongue well over into its cheek.  This is the
way avowals of the paranormal are outlined:

`The claimed phenomena and applications range from the incredible to the
outrageously incredible.  The "antimissile time warp", for example, is
supposed to somehow deflect attack by nuclear warheads so that they will
transcend time and explode among the ancient dinosaurs, thereby leaving us
unharmed but destroying many dinosaurs (and, presumably, some of our
evolutionary ancestors).'  

Who is alleged to be making these preposterous claims, here presented as if
they are representative of the parapsychological research community?
Anyone who has laboured through the statistics-encrusted pages of the
Journal of Parapsychology will be dazed at the impertinence of this passage.

The committee had not exhausted their fun and games.  `Other psychotronic
weapons,' they added, `such as the "hyperspatial nuclear howitzer", are
claimed to have equally bizarre capabilities.  Many of the sources cite the
claim that Soviet psychotronic weapons were responsible for the 1976
outbreak of Legionnaires' disease, as well as the 1963 sinking of the
nuclear submarine Thresher.'

Of course, this is good funny copy, a hoot.  The only question is, if
serious parapsychology were as off the wall as this, why would the US Army
be shelling out bucks to inquire into its possible contributions to
national security?  Of course, it's not - this is persiflage, intended to
alert professional onlookers to the light-hearted sense of fun with which
the luckless committee members are pressing on with their unwanted task of
mucking out the stables.  (It's a filthy job, but someone's gotta do it.)

What kind of evidence would have satisfied these scrutineers?  General
objectives are listed: `replicability, robustness, lawfulness,
manipulability, and coherent theory'.  It is granted in advance that
mainstream parapsychologists deny the likelihood of finding strict
replicability, a position based on many years of experiments which
nevertheless present other kinds of lawful recurrence.  So in order to
apply their own criteria, `the entire committee made a site visit to Cleve
Backster's laboratory in San Diego', the sole on-site `experiment'
witnessed and reported.

The knowledgeable reader's jaw sags.  Cleve Backster's laboratory?
Backster, as the report notes, `is a polygraph specialist who had at one
time helped develop interrogation techniques for the Central Intelligence
Agency and now runs his own polygraph school in San Diego'.  By no stretch
of the imagination is Backster a research parapsychologist.  His small fame
derives from reports of his rather silly and notably sloppy experiments
with sensitive mind-reading philodendrons in the grotesque 1970s'
bestseller The Secret Life of Plants, by Peter Tompkins and Christopher
Bird.  

With a straight face, the committee members watched one of their number
spit into a tube and then attempt to influence the electrical activity of
his shielded sputum leucocytes from another room.  Amazingly enough,
Backster's program failed to rate highly with the committee - and, by
rhetorical decree, was imagined to take the reputation of serious
parapsychologists with it down (as it were) the tube.


=========================

If the parapsychology community doubted that their claims had even got
through the door, one sees that there was more than paranoia involved in
this suspicion.  In their reply, they point out that another background
paper (along the lines of the one provided by Alcock), commissioned from
Monica Harris and Robert Rosenthal from Harvard, was effectively
`disappeared' when its conclusions proved disagreeable to Hyman.  

Suppression of evidence?  Consider their case:

`Rosenthal is a leading social science methodologist and a pioneer in the
development of meta-analytic techniques...' write Palmer, Honorton and
Utts.  Such techniques were used by both Hyman and Honorton in their famous
debate over the reality of Ganzfeld, and permit a batch of heterogeneous
studies to be correlated and boiled down into a single robust measure,
despite surface differences.  
		
`These authors undertook a comparative study of the major topics reviewed
by the Committee [that is, including sleep-learning, motivational, NLP,
etc] and concluded that "only the Ganzfeld ESP studies... regularly meet
the basic requirements of sound experimental design"...  On a 25-point
scale of "overall quality", the Ganzfeld experiments were given a rating of
19, whereas the other (nonparapsychological) areas reviewed received
ratings from 3 to 13.'
		
In other words, on methodological grounds, the paranormal data were more
solid than any of the other candidates.

This is not the kind of report that members of the executive committee of
CSICOP enjoy hearing from their consultants.  It is the kind of thing that
might make a skeptic think again.  Well, no, actually.  The published
chapter in Enhancing Human Performance doesn't mention Harris and
Rosenthal, though their findings are cited in the chapter on Accelerated
Learning.  Still, this omission by itself does not constitute evidence for
suppression.  What does is quite breathtaking:

`Incredibly, at one stage of the process, John Swets, Chairman of the
[overall] Committee, actually phoned Rosenthal and asked him to withdraw
the parapsychology section of his paper.'  Rosenthal refused to do so.  A
certain toing and froing ensued.  `The overall behaviour of the Committee,'
conclude Palmer and his co-writers, `suggests that it was eager to give
Rosenthal's dissenting views as little exposure as possible.'

==================

...but I digress...

Fun that you ask, I regularly ask how we could close an open universe :-)

I have so far not heard a good suggestion in this area, there are
unfortunately too few experts on global relativity on this list. I
think there is a theorem somewhere, mentioned in Tipler's Physics of
Immortality, that says it is not possible to open a closed universe.
This is a rebuttal to Freeman Dyson's proposal in his paper "Time
Without End" where he wonders if this is possible:

	I only raise one question which may offer us a thin chance of
	survival. Supposing that we discover the universe to be
	naturally closed and doomed to collapse, is it conceivable
	that by intelligent intervention, converting matter into
	radiation and causing energy to flow purposefully on a cosmic
	scale, we could break open a closed universe and change the
	topology of space-time so that only a part of it would
	collapse and another part of it would expand forever?  I do
	not know the answer to this question. If it turns out that the
	universe is closed, we shall still have about 10^10 years to
	explore the possibility of a technological fix that would
	burst it open.

I think the basic problem is the topology change; general relativity
doesn't allow the drastic change in topology from S^3 x [0:1] to
R^4. However, all is not lost since there are plenty of people who
study how topology change could occur in quantum gravity. It it can
occur, at least we might be able to make basement universes that are
open or closed depending on our cosmological preferences.

It appears to me like you do not know or understand anything about
general relativity, instead preferring to propose neotech as the
solution at any opportunity.

Here is some basic cosmology, equations quickly cut and pasted from a
Freeman Dyson paper:

Closed universes are represented by the metric

ds^2 = R^2 [dpsi^2 - dchi^2 - sin^2 chi dOmega^2],                     

where chi is a space coordinate moving with matter, psi is a kind of
time coordinate related to physical time t by

t = T_0 (psi - sin psi),                                               

and R is the "radius" of the universe (perhaps better seen as a scale
factor) given by

R = c T_0 (1 - cos psi).                                       

(it will recollapse at time 2 pi T_0)

The spatial geometry of a closed universe is at a given time
equivalent to a three-sphere (S^3): it is bounded, the integral of the
volume of space exists and is finite and it has no "edges" (if you
move straight forward in any direction you will eventually end up
where you started).

I don't see why people have any problems with this. :-)

[While I'm at it, and cutting and pasting equations from Dyson, the
metric of an open universe is

ds^2 = R^2 [dpsi^2 - dchi^2 - sinh^2 chi dOmega^2],        

where 

t = T_0 (sinh psi - psi),  

R = c T_0 (cosh psi - 1),  

and 0 < psi < infinity 0 < chi < infinity. This universe lasts forever
and has infinite volume.]

I actually read this argument in Lucretius De Rerum Natura yesterday
(wonderful book, by the way; I really recommend it), he argues that
the universe must be infinite, since if you stood at the edge and
threw a spear, it would either hang in the air (impossible, or
requiring some force from the outside) or fly into space (and hence
there is something out there). 

The fallacy in this argument is the assumption of some kind of edge,
of course. But you can have a finite surface with no edges, like a
sphere, and with nothing "outside it". A manifold (a surface, volume
or spacetime) doesn't need to be embedded in anything at all to have
an intrinsic geometry that is consistent and has all the necessary
properties to run a physics; this is basic differential geometry, see
any introductory book in the subject for a proof of Gauss Theorema
Egregium. 

Of course, this *sounds* extremely counter-intuitive and silly to
anybody who is used to handling objects embedded in three-space, but
it is actually self-consistent and parsimonious. See any introductory
book about cosmology for more discussions of how you can have a
finite, closed space with no edges and nothing outside.

Thanks for the cite and interesting excerpts.

I would not dispute that Grinder & Bandler were doing work that was not
closely controlled when compared to, say, the RPK work currently being
facilitated via John Walker's "Hotbits" site at www.fourmilab.ch.

I am unaware of any research of that rigor into Ericksonian hypnosis or
Satir's family therapy, for that matter; yet both fields are respected in
some reputable quarters, and both informed some of Grinder & Bandler's
pursuits of "modelling excellence". I don't think all their work is
prudently rejected out-of-hand; nor should every claim made by every person
claiming to be doing NLP be swallowed whole.

Two things: you wrote:

>NeuroLinguistic Programming is perhaps the best known, a kind of New Age
>hot-tub behaviourism 

1) I've heard things that could be interpreted as such, but I wonder what
you drew that capsule summary from? Could it have been a narrow
interpretation of such heuristics as "The meaning of a communication is the
response you get"? Or just the technique-y style of certain
practitioners/promoters? Please tell me more, if you can. :)

2) This phrasing makes me think of adversary-manipulation psyops, rather
than general officer training. 


Re: NLP *and* psi: If it depends on the skill of the operator, it's not
engineering, at best it's art. And one of the signs of pathological science
is appeals to things like the skill of the operator,
just-noticeable-differences, etc. So it's a slippery slope with interesting
terrain, not a simple thing like a magic (MKULTRA?) bullet to the brain.

Rather amusingly, the British government, which has committed itself
to reducing CO2 emissions in the future, recently announced they were
going to increase the cost of nuclear power because it put coal miner's

Traditionally at this time of year, Americans take a few minutes to 
contemplate what one has been given, what one has at this time.  Many 
think back to times when things were less bountiful in their 
own lives and compare that with the accomplishments of today.  

Transhumanists can extend thanks into the future.  Take a few minutes to 
contemplate what we will create in years to come, and give thanks for 
living at a time wherein we live on the brink of obtaining the knowledge 
and resources to make dreams reality.  While others focus mostly on what 
has been given, think about what we have earned and what we will 
build, what we will envision and what we invent.  

That, and the future prospect of a huge, caloric feast!

So you call these two utterances objectively consistent?

You never did answer the substance of my _polite_ challenge post,

This sounds wonderful.  It also brings up something I haven't been able
to get a handle on.  Give thanks to who (or what)?  I fancy myself a 
fairly rational sort, but often I feel thankful, in large ways or small.  
For example, if I'm running late and I make it across the railroad tracks 
just before the train barrier comes down, I'll sometimes say "Thank you",
and immediately stop and think "Thank who?".  "The universe" is the best
I've been able to do.  But I don't imagine an anthropomorphized universe
giving me favors, and consciously I know it was just chance that I made
it across the tracks, so why doesn't "Oh good!" seem sufficient?

Doesn't this just mean that we are aware of the tree beyond our eyes? 
What is wrong with saying that we are aware of two kinds of things: our
own organism's reaction to reality, and reality *via* analysis of that
reaction?

Me too. I think I'm thanking the universe for all the wonderful things
in it more often than most believers thank their gods :-) 

(Just imagine: I just saw a star through my window. Those photons must
have been travelling for *years* just to be refracted in the right way
to hit my eye and cause a sense of wonder. Isn't that worth thanking
for? Not to mention all the nice coincidences and patterns in the world.)

I think it is part of our memetic and possibly genetic hardwiring to
be thankful to somebody when things go well - usually, at least to a
small child, it is a parent who has fixed the situation. I think this
thanksgiving tendency is a holdover from previous stages of
development, but it is a nice holdover.

Just a question: For keeping pure transhumanist coherence, give thanks to

( an answer is important, since in the future we will possibly want to keep
the feast... isn't it ??)

It is simple, you have made the mistake of mixing up the section
dealing with a closed universe (which is finite) and the section
dealing with an open universe (which is infinite). Read the original
post more closely (somehow I don't think you will bother).

Actually, my research into memetics and philosophy, as well as
discussions with other objectivists including you, have convinced me
firmly that objectivism (as understood by many of its adherents) is a
very bad immune system given my personal goals of growth and
openness. Can't you see that you have closed your own mind much more
firmly than the closed universes you refuse to believe in? Essentially
you are subscribing to a self-supporting, doubtless comfortable, meme
complex that tells you that you are right, everybody else who does not
share your opinion is wrong, and that you must at every chance
proselytize. It is extremely similar to the Jehova's Witnesses meme.

First, some Caltech people have created the first neurochip: 16 neurons
which can be linked together on a chip, so they're all connected to
electrodes as well.
http://www.caltech.edu/~media/lead/102797JP.html

Second: I've just finished Greg Egan's _Axiomatic_, and he is a cool
author.  Extropian hard SF; what more can one ask for?  (A copy of
_Diaspora_ is what.)  But what struck me most was his Ndoli device, or
"jewel", which is an approach to uploading I don't think I've ever seen
before, but which seems obvious after the fact.  It's a neural network
implanted in the brain in childhood.  It receives the same input you do,
and it's output is corrected by a "teacher" to conform to the output of
your brain.  It doesn't actually do anything: it's just a backup brain
inside your skull, but the identity isn't maintained by direct neural
mapping, but by bullying a neural network to conform.  Later in life
your brain can be scraped out and the jewel given control.

I've only seen some form of scanning before, for uploading.
Nondestructive (super CAT-scan) or destructive (unravel the brain by
neurons, or the related in situ replacement of neurons.)  Imitation is
new to me.

It's not clearly easier than the older alternatives: you not only need
to put a human in something much smaller than the meat-brain, but it
needs to run at much lower power (otherwise you boil our brain.)  I also
wonder about measuring the output of our brain; much activity is
internal, and you can measure that, you might be able to do a direct
scan.  Then again, if the jewel can be made to match your physical and
verbal output for 10 years, one might presume congruence internally.

I don't know if adult implantation could work -- Egan starts early --
and it's useless for cryonics patients.  But it's still neat.

Just got a review copy, yum.  A pal who's read it sez `City & the Stars'
homage, and I can live with that - Clarke's book, though dated, is one of
the great dreams of sf.  DIASPORA has folded into it `Wang's Carpets',
which as of now I regard as Egan's best story.

I'm surprised by Damien S.'s havng just found `Learning to be me'.  Maybe
it's because Greg is an Australian, and we all dote on him, but I'd
supposed that the Egan jewel in the head mechanism was by now one of the
standard tropes in the uploading biz.  GGranted, Varley was doing this sort
of thing 20 years ago, but Egan brings his own curious pizzazz to the
philosophical-technological gedankenexperiment thang.

I have to confess many Objectivists do fit this bill -- i.e., as inactive
minded, parroting, ready-to-slander-their-opponents followers.  (Let's
use capital O Objectivists to distinguish those people who are
somehow influenced by Ayn Rand and her cohorts from small o
objectivism, which I take to mean someone who believes that
reality exists independent of the mind.)  However, you paint with too
broad a brush.  Many Objectivists are reasonable people who do
examine issues thoughtfully.  This seems to be true of the Institute
for Objectivist Studies -- though even people affiliated with that
group are sometimes dead brained.  There are also many splinter
groups and individuals who are independent minded...  Too many
to list here, but two examples are Peter Saint-Andre, whose web page
is at:

        http://www.plantaganet.com/stpeter

And Chris Sciabarra (author of _Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical_),
whose web page is at:

        http://pages.nyu.edu/~sciabrrc

Take a look and judge for yourself.

This said, the main issue in regards to this (or any) philosophy should
be is any (or all?) of it valid?  That would, of course, go well beyond
the discussion of an open vs. a closed universe.

Good point!  I tend to agree.  How would one know there was a tree
or a neural structure or a correlation without some awareness of the
external world.  The problem I see here is that we need to integrate
the external/causal view of mind with the internal/phenomenological
one.  The two are not opposites, but part of a seamless whole.  One
cannot be aware of something without a means of awareness.  And
just because one is aware by a specific means does not invalidate
one's awareness.

I'm not sure either.  Of course, as Dyson noted, we have time -- and as
I am inclined to believe, the universe may very well be open anyway.

There might be other things involved to.  Perhaps, on a global scale,
we are not limited to topological changes...  For instance, perhaps
(and someone else has raised this possibility; so I make no claims to
originality here:) we can "tear" off a region in such a way as to
achieve just what Dyson was after.

Another intriguing possibility in an open universe is that entropy and
order can both increase -- in absolute NOT relative amounts.:)  This
is Layzer's idea.  He might be wrong, but we should see if there's
anything to his idea.

How about the United Nations, the Keystone Cops, Interpol, and The United
Federation of Planets? 

LOVE the acronym for the National Association of Attorneys General. Who pays
for that club, I wonder?
The FBI is a branch of the Justice Department, by the way.

Yeahboy..I can feel those FRNS sliding out of my grip now.  All because some

The idea that those empty bubbles are huge spheres of dysoned galaxies
is a fanciful one, but not supported by observed evidence. That most
observable matter coalesced into the interbubble regions is an observed
confirmation of big bang theory predictions, that its the small
percentage of fluff normal matter that was in excess of the ~50%
matter/antimatter ratio.

Additionally, if there were just dysoned stars in those bubbles, then
there would still be ample interstellar gasses for new star formation,
as well as a measurable amount of nova and supernovae detritus.

One area where missing mass may be found is in megagalaxies. Astronomers
have recently found a galaxy that is ten times the mass of our own
galaxy, but is so large in size(100x the milky ways diameter) that its
mass is spread out to the point of undetectability unless you are
specifically looking for it, and can expose long enough to gather enough
light to visualize.

Has anyone found a current guesstimate of the matter "equivalence" of
all of the energy in the universe at that 3 deg K cosmic background
level? has this been accounted for in the missing mass calcs???

Such a strategy is the most successful one, of course, however, not all
geniuses always make decisions based on their own rational long term
interest. They ar of course, more likely to than the average cluck, but
there is also the observed attendant higher odds of mental illness among
the genius level population than the common 'danes. Constructing
safeguards to test new uploads for mental stability are of course, in
order, but who decides, and who watches the watchers???

You guys are so lucky to live in such a homogenous country. Your ideas
about political/cultural polarization are so quaint. SOrry to sound
demeaning, but I recommend you read _Culture_Wars_. When there is
political polarization, those who lead the sides tend to be radicals
that push out voices of moderation. The longer it takes to come to
political solution, the greater the polarization, the more shrill and
uncompromizing the parties. Solutions usually take the form of reactions
to atrocities enacted by an extremist. Usually opposite of what the
extremist intended. The way to neutralize anti-techers is to frame
extremist members of their groups in a plot to bomb some symbolic center
of high tech, say, the first AI, or the Patent Office. I know it sounds
darkly Machiavellian, but history shows that it works... Tell me, what
do you think of Luddites when you think of Theodore Kazinski??? He's an
excellent example of what we need to see more of. Marginalization by
making them seem like they are all wackos. Its worked for anti-gun
activists to to the same in PR against gun owners.

        That's easy.

        Thanks should go, every day, to all those who thoought, built,
suffered, produced and died to create all most of us take granted today. We
owe our very lives, all our technology, wealth and hope for a spectacular
future to millions who won't or didn't make it.

        Someday, rational beings will thank some of us. I hope we're around
for them to do it in person.

I haven't read that much fiction with any uploading; most SF still
prefers to use FTL.  (Much SF I consider analogous to a Victorian

thinking of what runs around the extropian web sites and mailing lists;
if people have been listing "stick a small neural net in your brain and
have it try to be you for 20 years" I've totally missed it.

Australia seems to be the world capital of hard extropian fiction: Greg
Egan, plus Vinge lets it be a world power in a couple of short stories
(although only because the North had nuked itself and the rest of the
South had burned its libraries in panic.)  And you perhaps, although I
haven't read any of your books.  Any basis for this in real life?

16 neurons and two dimensions.  Might end up on the shelf with the 10

To link this with the cosmology thread, I'll note that old aliens in his
Heechee books apparently closed the universe.  Pohl did not try
suggesting how.

   IAN: I believe that the mystical experience -- the perceptual 
   identification with infinite being -- is a product of a neuro-
   logical condition, and thus initiating that neurological con-
   diton would faithfully initiate the mystical experience. 

   But it does not follow therefore that the mystical experience 
   is false; which is to say, if the experience of infinite being 
   is derived from neurological conditions, it does not necessarily 
   mean that there is not an infinite being to which we are unified, 
   which remains hidden under normal neurological conditions. 

   All states of mind resulting in various conclusions about the 
   nature of reality are the product of various neurological con-
   ditions. If X is false simply because it's a neurological con-
   dition, then all conclusions about reality, being the result 
   of neurological conditions, must also be false.


   WHICH PERCEPTION IS MOST TRUE?

   It stands to reason that some neurological conditions and the 
   conclusions about reality derived therefrom are more accurate 
   than others. How do we determine which conclusions are more 
   accurate? We could choose to believe whichever we like most, 
   but the most reasonable measure would be that X is most accurate, 
   or true, where X adheres most consistently with physical facts 
   that all or most perceptual beings can mutually experience, 
   even under different neurological conditions.

   Most logical positivists would agree with that standard, and 
   most would therefore assume that it would push the mystical 
   experience out of contention for any degree of accuracy, much
   less that of being "most accurate." I believe that that assup-
   tion is, however, false and that I have proven it to be false.

   The mystical experience states, as it were, that "I am all 
   things, all space, and all time," the experience of which is 
   said to be union with  God, or "yoga." How could this be true? 
   The relational nature of identity: A thing, A, is A only as 
   derived from the relation of A and not-A. The identity of 
   A IS this relation and this relation is not in either A or
   not-A, the relation is nonlocal; therefore, ispo facto: 
   I am all things, all space, and all time.

   http://www.erols.com/igoddard/holistic.htm

   The mystical experience is a cleansing of the doors of
   perception, as Huxley put it. As the source of less-than-
   the-full-truth -- of the perception that I am limited -- 
   is the brain, it follows logically that the remedy to 
   this illusion would also arise from the brain, and 
   specifically from the cessation of its normal function. 


   AN ANALOGY

   If a radio is so loud you cannot hear anything except it, 
   to hear the reality beyond the radio requires modulation 
   of the radio. But it does not follow that the auditory 
   reality beyond the radio discovered after modulating the 
   radio comes from the radio simply because it is discovered 
   by modulation of the radio. So too, simply because the 
   "mystical reality" is discovered after modulating the 
   brain, it does not follow that it comes from the brain,
   i.e., that it is a reality isolated to the brain.

   Think of the brain as the radio: the normal neurological
   traffic, or noise, is so loud it drowns out the reality
   beyond it. Neurological modulation causing the mystical 
   experience to arise, typically prolonged mediation, I 
   believe, turns down the "brain noise," thereby allowing 
   the perception of the reality beyond the brain noise.
   
   No wonder that that experience is associated with the
   cessation of mental dialog, or noise. It is an experience
   beyond all play words, and as such is, I believe, the 
   real and true experience: being is eternal and free.

The infinite regress fallacy does in no way apply to the closed universe. 
The universe is entirely self contained: there is no "outside" or 
"beyond". The easiest way to conceptualise this is to think of the 
surface of a sphere: the area has no bounds, but is finite. Likewise, the 
(idealised) hypersphere of the closed universe is finite in spacetime but 
boundless (ie. there is no "outside"). In the closed universe one could 
theoretically start travelling in one direction into space and end up 
where one started.

btw, I have read Lerner's book, which details the less known "plasma" 
model of the universe. I found it pretty interesting, and a decent read.

I dare say it would be a proposition for the topologists. The best way to 
conceptualise an open universe in three dimensional space is by imagining 
a "saddle". Changing from a closed universe to an open would be a similar 
problem to morphing (for want of a better term) a sphere into a saddle.

Changing from an open to a closed universe is, of course, a nice thought 
experiment but the most practically unlikely an engineering feat as has ever 
been dreamed up!

I have to concede that I have been conversing from memory here, and a 
quick look on the web verified that my statement that there are good 
empirical reasons for believing in a closed universe is not correct. 
Here's a good summary of what I found:

http://www.physics.gmu.edu/classinfo/astr103/CourseNotes/ECText/ch23_txt.htm#23.5.

I am certain that there are come good arguments for a closed universe 
also, as I wrote a paper last year discussing the issue. Unfortunately it 
is still located back home with mummy and daddy and demands an excursion. 
When I have recovered the paper in a few weeks (if I remember) I will 
return to the issue...

Allow me to intervene for Anders here please. I believe that he meant 
volume which is infinite in extent.

And while I'm at it, I might say that while Physicists use 
experimentally verifiable equations to explain and solidify feelings and 
intuition, Mysticists like yourself use feelings and intuitions to 
counter science. My question is which pursuit produces reproduceable 
results which can be applied to the betterment of humans?

I wrote an essay on the development of an information society and economy 
in Australia which can be found at:

http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Lab/3896/iactass1.htm

As a culture we have certainly been one of the fastest in the uptake and 
application of information techonology, most likely due to our remote 
geographic location and sparse demographic. This may help to explain 
why Australian writers have a good turnout of Extropian fiction.

I am very new to Extropian ideas, and am in the process of gathering for 
myself various books and essays to read. I assume you are referring to 
Vernor Vinge above? I have read some of William Gibson's work, which I 
thought was great, and am looking for some good non-fiction. Is Moravec a 
good place to start? I have read some of his essays...they're excellent.

As an aside, when I first read the name Damien Broderick I was racking my 
brain to try and remember where I had heard the name. When he posted to 
this list I remembered (I think). Damien, you're the author of Spike 
right? I heard the beginning of your interview on JJJ driving to work 
earlier this year, and have been planning to get the book. So G'day from 
a fellow Aussie!

Moravec's _Mind Children_ was the book that made me into the
transhumanist I am, together with Tipler and Barrow's _The Anthropic
Cosmological Principle_ (heavy, but gives one the right billion-year
perspective of history). I'm looking forward to Moravec's next book,
even if it seems to be just an updated version of Mind Children.

Yes, this is an interesting problem. Mitch made a suggestion a month
ago on the transhuman list for a way of creating a closed
mini-universe, but I think it wouldn't work in its proposed form (just
an idea, Mitch: what about a non-spherical geometry?).

I think it sounds reasonable. Divide the universe into two sides, and
use one as an entropy dump. If it gets too "hot", wait for a while
until it has expanded, and then fump more entropy into it. Of course,
I suppose this would run into the NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) effect
on a cosmic scale.... :-)

We'll see about that; in a few billion years it may be quite
practical. It is also the biggest possible engineering feat, of
course.

Yuck; I don't like that idea. I'm far more convinced of survival of
identity by scanning arguments than I am by output arguments. If a
computer is a duplicate of my brain and acts just like me I'm pretty
much convinced that it is me in a real sense. But in this case I can 
see no good reason for believing that the internals of the network will 
bear any resemblance to mine, and hence it's unlikely to continue to 
act like me after it's disconnected.

Today, I received a message,  followed by IBM, about an email virus:

The "Trojan Horse"

It apparently comes with the following email messages (there may be possibly
other):

>>>       PENPAL GREETINGS
>>>       Join the Crew
>>>       RETURNED OR UNABLE TO LIVER

Its said to delete the info in the HD's (terrific...) and .... to self send
to the addresses in your mail... (interesting...)

Do not know if it is true, but I wouldn't risk...
The instructions are to delete the suspected email, without reading it...

One more action of some idiots who do not work nor even want the other to...

Sin,

I agree... and I repeat that such simple actions must be correctly
psychologically filtered and understood, so we, in the future may keep the
"good part"of them, throwing out silly unreallities but retaining the
associated pure emotions...
(for me rationallism is a condition to self-control...and more real freedom)

This is a great "meme" to study... after all, it has been living in
Internet for at least 3 years now, and there is still some people
believing it! :-D

Of course this isn't true!
But it is quite funny to see that even people still pass this around!

No.  This is not what I meant, though this too is possible.  The dissipative
structure analogy still means that total order plus total entropy is a fixed
sum.  Eventually, too, the system would run down.

In the model I am using, one would not need a dump for excess entropy.
Instead, the expanding space itself increases both the order the entropy.
The model is called the expanding phase space idealization.  Layzer, to
my knowledge, is the originator of this idea.

To picture what I am talking about imagine a bunch of molecules in a
box.  Let's say that at first they are all in one part of the box.  After a
certain amount of time, ceterus paribus, they will be spread out -- in
the sense one would be likely to find them anywhere within the box.
This would be an equilibrium state -- or more, accurately, collection of
states.  Now imagine that the box can expand faster than the
molecules move.  The molecules will never be able to fill the whole
box, in the sense of the first example.  One will always be able to
give a rough estimate of where they are.

Now if the universe as a whole behaved like that...

In that case you really should read Egan's "Learning to be me". The
protagonist also struggles with this problem, with a rather surprising
and worrying conclusion.

I too.  With a title like that, it would have been hard to ignore.  Anyway,
though
it has been a few years...  I found Lerner's book a bit too polemical, though a
very good read.  It still remains to be seen if his (extension of Alfven's)
theory is
correct.

To detail the argument as I recall it for the rest, Lerner basically think that
electromagnetic fields play a big role on large scales -- as opposed to the
conventional view that such fields have little affect on interstellar, galactic
and intergalactic scales.  Lerner believes that the known universe is
merely a portion of an infinite universe.  He explains inflation as a local
phenomena.  He thinks that what has happened is that gravitational
collapse influenced by electromagnetic separation of matter and anti-
matter created a local bang.

Some of his arguments look cogent.  He is able to explain via this theory,
e.g., large scale structures.  To him, they predated the local expansion.
He also is able to fit quasars and active radio sources into this too.  They
are caused by plasma filaments.

However, much of the book is devoted to polemics against scientists
who are pro-Big Bang.  I guess this was necessary to make a popular
book -- and perhaps to get attention of the scientific community too,
as Lerner's theory is not taken seriously at all.  It would be good to

Dear Rute,

3 years ago, I was 16 hours a day involved in my M.Sc. thesis, using 4
computers at a time,
for running millions of silly Monte Carlo photons scattering simulation
cases and did not have time to give attention
for the really silly stuff that came to me via net ( just the important ones). 
But now I could remember, from the deep of my memory archives, some comments
about a fact like this ( false virus alarms...)
Sorry for boring you :-|D  

Respcf.

Gomes.

Well, I read 'Permutation City' a couple of weeks ago and found it
interesting, but thought Egan's reasoning had fundamental flaws. Is
that story any more convincing?

You have touched upon another component of my ruminations yesterday:  
the difference between gratitude and thanksgiving.  For most of us 
raised within a Judeo-Christian culture, the two concepts have become 
intertwined, because we are taught that we are unworthy creatures who 
do not really deserve the abundance we enjoy in life--the goodies 
have been bestowed upon us through the benevolence of a higher being. 
We should, therefore, be grateful for whatever is given us.  When one 
expresses gratitude, one implies that one is completely undeserving 
and that one owes the person/higher being in ways that can never be 
repaid.  I can see expressing gratitude to another person in 
instances such as someone saving one's life, but to express gratitude 
on all levels does not seem consistent with transhuman ideas.

The act of giving thanks, on the other hand, consists of an 
expression of appreciation and enjoyment.  As such, it can be 
directed at any person, organization, or even to ourselves.  You, 
Natasha and Dave provided wonderful examples of giving thanks in your 
postings yesterday.  Thank you for doing that!

If Tipler is correct, and I think he probably is, then opening a closed 
universe, even if it were possible, would be the last thing life would want 
to do because only a closed universe offers the possibility of immortality. 
Given the fact that, at least right now, there is more experimental evidence 
for it being open than closed a more relevant question is "If the universe is 
open is there any way we can make it closed?". I'm not sure of the answer to 
that question but I rather doubt it, if so then eventually this party must 
end, and not with a bang but with a whimper.

We'll see about that; in a few billion years it may be quite
practical. It is also the biggest possible engineering feat, of
course.

Why are you shouting? Are you just trolling for flames?

I suggest you chill out, have a civilized conversation or two, and see if
you're around in a few billion years to say the same thing. :)

Futurologists (or any forecasters in the social or natural sciences) will tell you
that prediction/forecasting beyond 20 years is folly.  I think this is sort of
like the extropian idea of the Singularity. Brilliant people like Stephen Hawking
does talk about "Baby Universes" that could be pinched off from our own (possibly
from wormholes) and the possibility of traveling to a prior point in time within
this universe is also plausible.  These notions are more likely to me than saving
a part of the current cosmos we live in per se. Sincerely, Bill

|
|     Corrections officials IN FOUR STATES are tapping into

|sex offenders released into the community.
|     Through global-positioning technology, authorities can know
|instantly if a parolee leaves home or enters a restricted zone,

|     "You can literally track any place he goes 24 hours a day,"

|     In recent years, the Pentagon has opened the door for

|satellites set up in the 1970s to help guide missiles and keep
|track of enemy troops and equipment.  Global positioning has been
|used for commercial purposes ranging from ship navigation and

|     Both Advanced Business Sciences and Pro Tech Monitoring Inc.

|equipment is being tested by the Florida Department of

|planned for counties in Minnesota and Pennsylvania.
|     The companies say global positioning is a better way to
|monitor parolees than the use of electronic anklets, which tell
|the monitors only whether the subject has remained at home.
|     ABS's system, known as ComTrak, requires the person being
|monitored to wear a tamper-resistent wristband and be within a
|few feet of a 4-pound tracking unit, which looks like a laptop
|computer and can be slung over the shoulder or worn like a
|backback or vest.
|     The tracking unit constantly receives signals from a
|"triangulation" of three satellites that determine global
|coordinates.  The unit sends the information in a wireless signal
|to the ComTrak communications center in Omaha, Neb., which
|transfers the data to the law enforcement agency through a fiber-
|optic line.
|     ABS equips the law enforcement agency with a computer
|station and printer to go with its link to the communications
|center.  Notification appears on the printer if any of the
|subjects being monitored violate geographic "hot zones" or fail
|to meet time constraints, like the amount of time given to go
|from home to school.
|
|Protection against tampering
|
|     If the parolee tampers with the wristband or abandons the 4-
|pound unit, the computer sounds an alarm and gives the subject's
|last coordinates.  
|     Users of the system can check a subject's activities at any
|time, for example, at the end of a day or week.  A complete
|record of the parolee's movements is archived at the ComTrak
|communications center.
|     Feilmeier said the technology still had some limitations.
|     The satellites can lose the subject in dense downtown areas
|and other places with large natural or man-made structures which
|may deflect the signal, he said.  It can be particularly
|ineffective in metal highrise buildings.
|     But Feilmeier said the unit reported every four seconds and
|tracked exactly where the subject entered or exited an obstructed
|area and at what time.
|
|     William Lockwood, Pro Tech's vice president for sales and
|marketing, said global positioning could be used by law
|enforcement agencies to track the targets of investigations.
|He said a tracking unit could be *surreptitiously* positioned,
|for example, by attaching it to the bottom of a suspect's car or
|the side of a boat.

|be added to the LIST of people automatically notified by pohone

I thoroughly agree with Kennita.  Transhumanism is a special variety of
humanism which emphasizes the Brotherhood, Sisterhood or Siblinghood of
Humankind and our historical, and futurological connection to past and coming
generations.  This is a perfectly appropriate form of thanksgiving.
"Thankfulness" for pleasant surprises or luck )e.g. getting across a railroad
pass in the nick of time is likely an evolutionary holdover from our genetic
and psychological past re: parents (as Anders Said I believe) which,
incidentally, is also an intergenerational thanksgiving of a particular type.

I'm afraid you're already a victim :) 

Here's something out of SKEPTIC vol.2 no.5 ... from an article titled "The Power
 of the Meme Meme" by Susan Blackmore:

        "Internet viruses are a relatively new arrival.  Last week I received a 
very kind warning from someone I've never met. 'Do not download any message 
entitled PENPAL GREETINGS' it said-- and went on to warn me that if I read this 
terrible message I would have let in a Trojan Horse virus that would destroy 
everything on my hard drive and then send itself on to every e-mail address in 
my mail box.  To protect all my friends, and the world-wide computer network, 
I had to act fast and send the warning on to them. 
        "Have you spotted the trick? The virus described does not make sense; in
fact, it does not exist.  The real virus is the warning.  This is a clever 
little meme-complex that uses both threats and appeals to altruism to get you--
the silly, caring victim-- to pass it on."

    "Epistemologically there are zero reasons for believing
     a closed universe is even possible."

Since Rand was quite clear that questions about the nature of
matter and energy were what she called "empirical questions",
properly studied by making observations first, then reasoning
from those observations, your contention that the open vs.
closed universe issue can be decided on introspection alone
amounts to a mystical belief in the God of common sense over
the facts of science.  If there is no reason to believe in the
possibility of a closed universe, there is even less reason to
believe that human introspection not based on measurements can
produce any relevant enlightenment on the subject of cosmology.
Ayn Rand would be ashamed, and as an admirer of the great woman,
I am ashamed.

I have trouble predicting next week's stock prices.  Does anyone really have
any proven techniques for short range forecasting of technoprogress?  Or is
it all just hunches and guesses?

Hi, pal.  That's me.  JJJ had one of the more intelligent and whimsical
interviewers, as I recall - a sprightly exchange.  If you enjoy THE SPIKE,
try my current somewhat posthuman sf novel THE WHITE ABACUS, and if you can
find a 2nd hand copy (easier to do in Oz than in the States) my 1982 novel
THE JUDAS MANDALA.

This is the premise behind L.E. Modesitt's SF/Fantasy Recluce series. In
it, physics as we know it are warped a bit in that chaos and order are
recognized "magical" forces that people can sense, and some can
psychically manipulate. This leads to White (chaos) and Black (order)
magicians. Naturally the chaos wizards are the bad guys.

How would one go about constructing an entropy pump???

The requirements for one method of opening a closed universe -- or 
closing an open one -- are known, at least roughly.

All we need is the ability to shift very large masses of matter 
arbitrarily through time.

If the universe is closed, and you wish it open -- throw a few 
thousand galactic clusters a few billion years into the future, 
decreasing the current mass of the universe.  Repeat as necessary.

If it is open, and you wish it closed -- throw those same galaxies 
equally far into the past, increasing the previous mass of the 
universe.  That same mass will by normal means then occur twice in 
your time (or at least your immediate past).

Of course, the engineering problems in this proposal are somewhat 
daunting.   :-)

And if some people want an open universe, while others want a closed 
universe...

Most of all we should thank those who tried to do things that "cannot 
be done".  Most of them failed.  Many of them died.  But if they had 
not tried... 

I believe it was Heinlein who said something on the order of:

"If an elderly and knowledgeable scientist tells you something can be 
done, he is very probably right.  If an elderly and knowledgeable 
scientist tells you something cannot be done, he is almost certainly 
wrong."

To which I add:  

Listen very carefully to WHY it cannot be done, because there's a 
good chance he'll accidentally tell you how to do it.

I'm looking for a cliology mailing list.  I've found a few references 
to it being at msu.bitnet, but mail to that server bounces and 
listserv@msu.edu doesn't know anything about it.

Can anyone point me toward such a list?

"Tommy the Terrorist", on rec.arts.sf.science, has suggested linking the
500 million year old crust of Venus and our Cambrian explosion.
Venusian civilization destroyed itself, but seeded Earth?

(Based on meteor crater distribution, the entire crust of Venus is
thought to be 500 million years old.  This suggests total liquefaction then.)

My turn to play ignorant newbie with wacky idea:

If we think the universe was somehow imbalanced in matter/antimatter,
could there be a charge imbalance?  I.e. the universe has a net charge.
In which case wouldn't there be a repulsive force?  Physicists look for
a cosmological constant, but there seems to be one at hand...

Umm... you're a plastic neural network.  It's a plastic neural network.
It has received the same inputs you do.  After 20 years, it produces the
same output you do.  The only differences between the two of you are that
it probably started with a different structure (but yours was not
genetically fixed, and the jewel is plastic, so it can change) and that
you die faster than it does.  Not resemble you?  What the hell else
would it resemble?  

I haven't read _Permutation City_, although I've heard he pulls
something out of his ass.  _Quarantine_ was interesting, much of
_Axiomatic_ was really cool, and _Distress_ is looking good so far,
although the climax is still out of sight.

I have been collecting the various names, subject to erratic editorial
judgement.  Nothing's on the Web at the moment.  But today I remembered
one phrase of mine I'd forgotten, inspired by the Second Law, and the
way life lives off of gradients while helping them to equlibirum.

Dyson says that life processes could continue indefinitely in a open universe, 
but that's not good enough, I'm interested in consciousness and intelligence, 
I don't care if digestion continues for eternity or not. Immortality means  
experiencing an infinite amount of subjective time, and that means being 
able to think an infinite number of thoughts and that doesn't seem like a 
realistic possibility in a open  universe. In an open universe everything 
will keep getting colder and most things will get larger and weaker too. 
Life will have to keep adapting to new  conditions and it won't be easy.

The components of any machine, including a brain, must keep getting more  
distant if it's going to work.  The reason is that a heat engine in such a 
universe will only be able to exploit very tiny differences in temperature  
and that means it will be very inefficient. To get a usable energy output it  
would need to be HUGE. With parts that far apart and the finite speed of 
light the brain is going to slow way down.

There are more problems, all electromagnetic photons would be of VERY low  
energy and so would have to have an enormous wavelength. A simple quarter 
wavelength antenna for a billion mile photon, or a trillion light year one, 
would need to be astronomical, and then some. A reflector to concentrate the
photons for energy use would be MUCH larger still. Also, in order to 
establish reliable communication it's going to take more and more photons of 
light to send one bit of information. It won't be easy for one part of a 
brain to hit it's target a billion trillion light years away, almost zero 
chance if you only send one photon. Also, each photon will be strongly and
increasingly redshifted, to compensate the sender must keep shorting the 
wavelength of the photons he uses but this takes energy and you only have a 
finite amount of it in a open universe.

Contrast this with a closed universe. Tipler thinks that the universe will be  
able to perform an infinite, and not just astronomical, number of calculations 
between now and the final singularity at the end of the Big Crunch. With this 
much computer power it would be easy to emulate every human being who ever 
lived and do it for an infinitely long subjective time. But isn't infinite 
computation a fantasy? If the universe has a finite number of particles and 
all of them are engaged in computation, isn't that a limit?  Perhaps not. 
The particles could be performing calculations at a faster and faster speed,
of course you'd need an unlimited supply of energy to do that, but that's 
exactly what you'd have at The Big Crunch. Tipler thinks that life will be 
able to engineer the Universe so that when it contracts to a mathematical 
point, it will do so in a asymmetrical way, so one part of the sky will 
always be hotter than another thus you can always run a heat engine.   
All life on Earth also gets it's energy from a hot spot in the sky that we  
call "the sun", the Omega point would also have a hot spot, but the 
difference is it will keep getting hotter without limit, in other words 
infinite energy.

You'd also need a way for the parts of the computer to communicate with the  
other parts at a ever increasing speed, you can't move faster than light, so  
the only way to do this is to make the distance between the parts shorter.  
This is also exactly what you'd have at The Big Crunch. 

And You'd need infinite memory. Tipler found a way that the Universe could  
hold an infinite amount of information, he wants to store information as 
standing waves and use the entire universe as a wave guide. As the universe  
shrinks toward The Big Crunch the amount of time needed to access this  
information is reduced too, but so is the amount of energy needed to store a
bit of information, because you need to keep making your information storing 
photons at a shorter and shorter wavelength and that takes energy. If you 
only have a finite amount of energy this would be a fatal problem, but if the 
universe shrinks to a geometric point then the amount of gravitational sheer 
energy in the Universe would diverge to infinity, and as I said if the  
collapse is not symmetrical then the energy is usable. 

There is a finite amount of time to the Big Crunch, but Tipler says that a  
beam of light could circle the entire universe an infinite (and not just very 
large) number of times before then, because the universe will keep getting 
smaller without limit. In this way a finite amount of matter in a finite 
amount of time could produce a infinite number of calculations and so 
generate a infinite subjective time. To put it another way, the idea is to  
trade energy for subjective time, we have infinite energy so we have infinite 
subjective time.

As for Entropy, it's only a problem if it ever stops increasing as it would 
in the heat death of an open universe, in a closed universe the Entropy never 
stops increasing and the heat never stops increasing. Of course all of this  
is irrelevant if the universe is open, and it's starting to look like it may 
be, we should know in a few years. Tipler also made a number of testable 
predictions, I'll get into that if you're interested.

Can I just jump in here for a quick minute and wonder publicly how much
effort it takes to quote with attribution to the author? Please, I don't
mean to nitpick, but I have a very limited time to keep up with the
posts on this list. I really don't think it's unreasonable to request
that quoting conventions be upheld in this forum. Comments?

Thanks,

Dear fellow Extropians:

Within the past few weeks I've received a good deal of spam scams on this
frequency. Naturally, I've forwarded it all to the appropriate law
enforcement agencies via fax from my office.
In a previous note I advised you all that if you continue to receive
nonsense spam offering multilevel distributorships or variations on themes
of chain letters to simply send them via e-mail or fax to whatever law
enforcement agency web site you feel is appropriate.

Despite the claims of many politicians it's not violent crimes in the
streets that is our biggest law enforcement problem. Rather, the greatest
amount of money lost is through consumer fraud and other white collar
crimes.

Spam scams are among those forms of crimes. Eventually, the justice system
will, hopefully, develop a new paradigm and a better understanding of this
ethical and legal issue.

Until they do, however, watch out!!

I am specifically interested in technical analysis.  (I think when combined with
other methods it could be useful.)  Given the level of scientific proficiencies
here can anyone recommend any software/books?

I hear that.

Some have suggested better filters. I just reviewed my all the posts I
could get to on the archive; I was expecting to pay money for a
subscription to a high-Q list.

You get what you pay for?

Whatever, I've given it a year and it's not working; no significant changes
in the SSNR are likely to occur; none of the suggested plans for improving
it have been implemented.

Be well. See you on the Funway.

While Permutation City has a lot of ontological speculations (the dust
theory), the story above is just about the question: would you dare to
switch over to the emulation of you? Are they the same person? It is
quite good, IMHO.

Nice. And of course we can solve overpopulation and the Halting

Yes. They are always the hard part when solving problems with
imaginary technology :-) That is why I really admire Dyson for
actually calculating how to move stars and galactic masses using known
physics, instead of imaginary physics. I think we need more of that on
this list.

Hmm, as far as I know there is no conservation of order plus entropy;
order is simply the negative of entropy, and the sum must according to
the laws of thermodynamics always go in the entropy direction. But
regions can achieve as much order as they want if they have energy and
can pump away the entropy. So the main questions are if there is
enough energy in an open universe, and if there are enough entropy
sinks.

Yes, that would be nice. Unfortunately this is the
ball-of-galaxies-expanding-from-a-center-somewhere-in-a-big-void-model,
and not compatible with what we know or believe. The universe seems to
be expanding more like a big balloon with galaxies on its surface,
being slowly blown up. That means we do not get any low-entropy
regions for free, even when the spacetime expands. A pity.

Quantum computers are devices for processing information at the scale of
atoms, photons and spins.  Because of their ability to process information
in a way that preserves quantum-mechanical coherence, quantum computers
can perform tasks that classical computers can't.  This talk discusses new
developments in the theory of quantum computation and presents recent
experimental results in the application of quantum information processing
to problems of computation, communications, and control.

[WARNING: The following contains Gross Generalizations.]

The global warming conference starting Monday in Kyoto has focused a lot of
attention on environmental degradation caused by industrialization in Asia.
 This has lead me to think about a phrase I think I coined and that has been
germinating in my head for a year or so now: "Confucian Capitalism".  That
phrase evokes mixed emotions for me.  On the one hand, I'm glad that Asia,
including China, has by and large rejected its dalliance with Marxism.  On
the other hand, though, I am deeply troubled by the offspring of capitalism
and Confucianism.

Some elements of the Confucian tradition are fundamentally compatible with
the core values of capitalism; especially industry, thrift and secularism.
 These values have provided a rich cultural seed bed for the development of
capitalist, industrial societies.  Others Confucian values, though, present
very deep conflicts with capitalist values.  At its bedrock level, the
Confucian world view encourages a reverence for static social structures of
authority that is thoroughly inconsistent with the concept of vital
individualism, a multiplicitous polity and a "loyal opposition".  

The Confucian concept of civil society is strictly hierarchical and does not
encourage individual creative variation from the ideal norm.  In the
Confucian world, industry consists of a vigorous climb up the pre-determined
steps of an established hierarchy.  The sort of "paradigm shifting" lauded in
the creative geniuses of bourgeois culture from Galileo to Gates has no place
in the fixed, linear value system of the Asian orthodoxy.  This is such a
well-established element of Sinitic culture that students of Asian history
come to reflexively associate the word "orthodoxy" with the word "Confucian".

I believe we can see the effects of the marriage of Sinitic Confucianism and
"western" capitalism in comparisons of the economic and social development of
various Asian countries.  Japan stands out as the most successful of these
unions and its success is premised to some degree on the extent to which its
culture was NOT thoroughly "Confucianized".  

Japan engaged in a wholesale importation of Chinese cultural structures in
the 8th through the 10th centuries.  However, the Japanese have always had a
flair for maintaining certain indigenous cultural structures, even while
mimicking major elements of foreign social systems.  The Japanese notions of
a feudal blood nobility and the samurai values of bushido ("the way of the
warrior") provided living reservoirs of alternative cultural values that
significantly offset the simple linear hierarchism of classical Confucianism.
 Furthermore, and perhaps just as importantly, Japan's exposure to China
happened to coincide with the flowering of the T'ang dynasty's influence by
Hinayana (and, significantly, NOT Mahayana) Buddhism.  Thus, Japan's history
subsequent to its sinification consisted in large measure of a "multi-axis"
dynamic tension between the individualism of these other cultural matrices
and the social orthodoxy of classical Confucianism.  Upon Japan's exposure to
and subsequent importation of western capitalism, these alternative cultural
paradigms provided a ready source of values that could easily and naturally
be adapted to the individualism inherent in a social system grounded in the
bourgeois values of individual activity and responsibility.  This is not to
say that Japanese society isn't troubled by on-going "cultural dissonance"
between the elements of its Confucian past and its capitalist present; but I
think it explains why in Asia Japan has made the greatest success of adapting
to bourgeois modernism.

The other "Asian Tigers", geographically and/or culturally closer to the
Confucian core,  have so far not produced societies as able to accommodate
the individualism of capitalism.  Consider the on-going conflict in Korea
between the established power center of state capitalism and the apparently
inexhaustible seed of youthful rebellion in that country's universities.  It
seems that each generation of students in Korean universities engages in
sometimes bloody acts of rebellion, only to be co-opted into established
hierarchy of "Confucian corporate culture".  In Singapore one looks in vain
for even the level of opposition to the status quo one can find in Korea.
 Taiwan, while producing several generations of successful entrepreneurs, has
yet to begin a significant development of polycentric civil society: The
Kuomintang continues to represent the sole vital source of political
legitimacy in that country's public life, despite it thorough corruption by
western standards.

In light of these ideas, I am not optimistic about the short term for China's
and the rest of Asia's (with the exception of Japan's) ability to come to
grips with the pollution caused by industrialization with current-generation
technology.  More generally, I doubt the conventional wisdom that with
capitalism comes the other virtues of bourgeois society, i.e. individualism
and tolerance for personal diversity.  So long as the established power
structures place a low value on environmental quality and individual liberty,
we can expect no significant SUCCESFUL indigenous protest, but rather what
will be to the West an infuriating willingness to accept a steady rise in
pollution and limits on individual freedom.  Furthermore, the traditional
Confucian disdain for "foreign opinion" will serve to insulate the native
power structures from influence from abroad.  Prescriptions calling for an
internal "free press" will have some impact, but not nearly what would be
expected in Western countries.  The output of such a "free press" will run
into the fatalistic acceptance of the status quo inherent in the Confucian
world view.

There is perhaps, though, a ray of hope.  Confucian orthodoxy always
coexisted with another tradition; Taoism.  Taoist naturalism was always an
intensely individualistic cultural matrix that was essentially skew to the
mainstream of Confucian culture.  A more or less easy peace existed between
the two cultural traditions because the Taoist ideal of the lone eccentric in
the wilderness had little impact on the settled urban and agrarian society
ruled over by the Confucian imperial government.  In fact, I have always
believed that Taoist eccentricism provided a necessary "escape valve" for
individualism in the Confucian world.  By bleeding off the energies of the
occasional individualist unable to conform to Confucian orthodoxy, Taoism
ironically served as an important element of the stability of the Sinitic
world.  Taoism's stress on a passive internalization of the "Way" ("Tao") of
nature ensured that those unable to conform to the Confucian ideal of a
static social and political hierarchy would not engage in any significant
rebellion against that hierarchy, but rather would simply absent themselves
from it.

Taoism may provide a cultural avenue for opening up a consciousness of
environmental degradation in Asia and, perhaps, a memetic pathway for
adoption of extropian values.  With its stress on the value of nature, it's
traditions may become the springboard for a wider awareness of the impact of
low-tech industrialization.  Furthermore, the "magical" aspects of
traditional Taoism might well also serve Asia well.  There was a strain of
alchemy in Taoism that could resonate with the development of next-generation
molecular technology.  Perhaps even more promising, the Taoist mages
cultivated magical formulae for life extension, consisting of caloric
restriction and yogic exercises (probably well-grounded in reality) as well
as probably ill-fated programs of experimental poisoning.  Chinese Taoist
lore is replete with legendary figures who achieved extremely long lifetimes
through these practices.  At least in theory, Taoists sought their alchemical
and life-extension goals through careful observation of nature's "way", a
cultural antecedent for scientific empiricism.  Finally, the general Chinese
romance with textual symbolism (almost certainly a function of the
ideographic nature of their written language), provides ample historical
context for active participation in computer science in general and
cryptography in particular.

All that is needed is an infusion of activism into the Taoist tradition.
 While the notion of "Taoist activism" seems at first like an oxymoron, one
need only look to the Japanese tradition of the warrior-monk to see that such
a cultural construct was at least possible in a closely related milieu.
 While less well developed in the Chinese cultural matrix, the discipline of
"Kung Fu" points at least in part to the individual as the locus of action as
part of a natural process.  At a deeper, philosophical level, extropian ideas
might find a comfortable and fertile marriage with the Taoist tradition in
the natural sciences.  Our stress on values and knowledge arising from an
objective inquiry into the natural world provides a bridge into basic Taoist
thinking.  What is required though, is a means to transmit the insight that
nature itself has given rise to the values of individualism and action in the
world.

We should be on the lookout for personal bridges into the Chinese cultural
world.  A few billion humans are both a great resource for and a great threat
to our future.

Actually we are about to make a change. To post to the Extropians list you
will need to be a member of Extropy Institute, although non-members will be
able to read only.

I've been too busy with getting the newsletter to post about this change,
but now it's out I will explain the hows and whys, probably today.

Apart from restricting the list, we are about to open several
special-purpose lists that will also be restricted.

Look for details of both of these changes here.

A good point, but the problem also exist already now in the middle east.

The patriarchal pyramid of the Confucianism (and even earlier in the
middle age here in Europe) is also expressed in Egypt with the recent
massacre of tourists. The Muslim millits who did the killing consists
mostly of well educated young men who hasn't been able to find a job
after finishing their education.
They where not at the right level of the patriarchal pyramid. Other more
well connected members of society gets the awailable jobs.

A couple of notes on my own earlier post regarding the "Asian Tigers".  Local
elections in Taiwan have just yielded the result of fairly massive rejection
of the Kuomintang party and, as a friend of mine has correctly pointed out
off-list, Korea is currently undergoing what appear to be fairly "real"
anticorruption trials pointed at members of the existing power structure.

With these points in mind, I should have said that the fact that it has taken
so long bears out my thesis.  I don't think that the idea of "Confucian
Capitalism" is some sort of cultural monolith.  I just worry about capitalism
without concommitant values of individual liberty and responsibility.  All
I'm really saying is that capitalism with too great a stress on
authoritarianism and orthodoxy seems like a weird and possibly bad mutation.
 The outcome of the public corruption trials underway now in Korea will be
very important for Korea's and Asia's future.  Assuming their polity comes
out the other side of the current crises as an intact democracy, that might
be just the rite of passage they need.

With it's concentration of wealth and talent, Singapore is definitely a place
to watch.  A question I'll be asking over the next decade is the extent to
which Singapore remains "Chinese" culturaly.  The very explictly Confucian
regime of Lee Kuan Yew might give way to a much more culturally diverse
environment there that could become a laboratory of 21st century
technological society.

It's been a while since I read it the last time...so maybe I should read it
again soon...but the ocassion of this post is a good opportunity to ask a few
questions and make a few comments...unfortunately based on memory.

Lerner questions quantum mechanics if I recall correctly?....or at least it's
interpretation...as well as relativity?....

Personally I've not been convinced of either...perhaps because I had
difficulty following the explanations...

Lerner's explanation I COULD follow...and plasma filaments seem
plausible...as well as being experimentally verifiable I belelive?

I may be a little premature in saying this (since you haven't given your
"hows and whys"), but I think this decision may turn some good people off
extropy.  Having to pay to join an institute to participate on a
discussion has a culty feel to it, even if the justification is to reduce
the signal-to-noise ratio.  Also, I don't think being a member of the
extropy institute implies you make less "noise."  Some people may join the
extropy institute for the purpose of making some noise on the list.
Others, who would contribute a lot to the list, may not be interested in
joining the extropy institute, either for monetary reasons or because they
do not want to incur the wrath of those who would take out their petty
frustrations on the members of the extropian movement.(ie. misguided
neo-luddites) 

One restriction I would like to see is allowing only list-members to post.
Restrictions beyond this may reduce the S/NR, but I don't think the
reduction noise will be worth the loss of perfectly good signals! ;)

I tend to agree, but it is ExI's list.  And the amount of spam has been, well
not terribly high, more than I expected.  Also, moderating the list would be
a full time job.  (Of course, it could be distributed.)

I am, BTW, not a member of ExI, so when the list gets restricted I will be
reduced to read=only status.:(

Well, a compromise might be to have an ExI member sponsor someone
to be a participant.  Still, this will be restictive, but what does everyone
think?

Only in a closed system.  Your prigoginic universe -- one side as a dump, the
other to live in -- is merely a closed system on a higher level.  The
possibility
Layzer discusses -- the expanding phase space idealization -- is not closed
on any level.

No.  The point is Is the expansion rate fast enough to insure the universe
will never reach equilibrium.  Layzer thinks it is.  (For the record, his model
of cosmology is called the Cold Big Bang.  See his _Cosmogenesis_ for
a lay account.  He also presents his view in his _Constructing the
Universe_.)

The box example is merely an analogy as is the "big balloon with galaxies
on its surface."  BTW, the latter assumes the universe is positively
curved, which is what we were questioning!

Nonetheless, if the "ballon" can expand forever at a rate faster than
equilibrating interactions, then the same result occurs.  I.e., there is no
heat death, expansion and order growth are eternal.

} extropy institute for the purpose of making some noise on the list.

Given the $95 price tag on membership mentioned in the most recent
Exponent newsletter, this may not be too likely.  Of course, it may
drive signal people away as well.  A list membership fee of $8 hit the
list hard some years ago.  $95?  I don't think I can justify that to
myself.  And the "benefits" were interesting: a t-shirt, mug, or
mousepad, oh my.

More interesting is the right to "sponsor one new member".  This implies
either that future membership will be restricted to those spoken for by
members, which is disturbing, or (more likely) that a current member
gets to bring in one new one for free.  Perhaps people will be more
likely to spring for that than paying lower fees and sponsoring their
friends directly.  To me, it seems odd.  And expensive.

We had this back when the list started.  I was one of the first people to
pay for list access, including a membership in ExI to obtain a cheaper
rate.  (In fact, I paid when Max made a similar pre-announcement, before
they were really ready to accept applications.)

As I recall, it didn't improve the signal-to-noise ratio.  I believe the
intent at the time was to emphasize ExI's ownership of the list and their
right to control it.  The actual effect, if I recall correctly, was to make
people believe that they had purchased the right to post.  Those who were
told not to post on "forbidden" topics claimed to have been swindled out of
money.

I don't know if paying for access is a good idea or not.  I do know that it
will change people's attitudes  toward and participation in the list.  I
previously paid for access, and will probably do it again.

I wasn't around when the list became free again.  What was the reasoning
behind that decision?  Have the motivating factors changed?  I also was not
around when the PPL system of voluntary list-policing was abandoned.  What
happened to the PPL experiment that governed the original list?

Hate to sound like a dyed in the wool Randroid, but individual rights are
the cause
of prosperity in our various society.  To the degree that a society even
implicity
practices them, it does better.  And there should be no separation between the
practical and the moral -- if our morality is really one meant to deal with
reality.

It's clear that if this is a canonical Hot Big Bang universe, then at some
time (at least) space expanded faster than the interactions it contained,
otherwise it would still be clogged with monstrously hot quark soup or
something even less appetizing.

I was rather impressed by Layzer's popularisation COSMOGENESIS, BTW.
Here's what I wrote about it in 1991 (after briefly discussing THE MATTER
MYTH by Gribbin & Davies):

=====================

COSMOGENESIS
The Growth of Order in the Universe
by David Layzer
Oxford University Press, 322pp, Index, $20.95

A very much more impressive attempt to construct a working model of the
universe that is neither simple-mindedly mechanistic nor dismally mystical,
Layzer's ambitious book is frankly a hard read, but a worthy one.  True,
some of its key claims and bold conjectures seem already out of date.
Science is the perfect consumer item, endlessly shifting last year's stock
into the junkyard.  Still, following this distinguished Harvard
astrophysicist on his intellectual journey from the Big Bang to the nature
of brain and consciousness proves that to travel hopefully is better (and
more stimulating) than to arrive.

`Contrary to conventional wisdom, there is a vast amount of genuine,
irreducible randomness in the world.'  But quantum processes, inherently
indeterminate, are not thereby more `creative' (an argument that should
give Davies and Gribbin pause). `The outcomes of self-creation are new and
unforeseeable, yet coherent with what has gone before.'

To fans of Big Science, Layzer offers one stunning challenge after another.
 The standard story of creation has a highly ordered fireball Big Bang,
inflating instantly to a smooth expanding cosmos - and can't easily explain
why galaxies clump into vast walls hugging cosmic bubbles.  Layzer proposes
a highly random cold origin, distinctly unfashionable but intriguing.  

Nothing daunted, he applies his theory to evolution - `beta genes', he
suggests, both provoke and edit mutations, spurring development - and to
the nature of language.  Ultimately, order emerges in hierarchies of
self-organisation, attributable in the final instance to the very expansion
of spacetime itself.

=================

And while I'm here - I probably won't be posting any more once the proposed
new rules come into play, because I don't wish to join ExI.  Thanks for all
the fish.

I can't dispute that you have the experience of a culty feel. But I invite
you to consider the following:

Is the Rotary a cult? is the Princeton Institute for Advanced Studies a
cult? Is 4-H a cult? Is the specialty-certified service station I take my
car to a cult? How about the letters-to-the-Editor column of Scientific
American?

In each of these examples, members are selected, and "dues" of one sort or
another must have been paid.

As for participation in discussion, there's always the CRIT engine.
Bidirectional links permit open communication across the boundary, while
keeping the SSNR higher. Kind of like a sodium pump. :)

You say they don't know about CRIT? Well, they'll just have to learn, won't
they? :)

>Also, I don't think being a member of the

Being born a Presbyterian doesn't guarantee you a seat in the Choir Invisible.

>Some people may join the
>extropy institute for the purpose of making some noise on the list.

Begging your pardon, it doesn't matter what their intent is, it matters
what the result is. Some reasonable people think the SSNR is too high. One
man's signal is another man's noise. Otherwise, why not just have one big
maillist for everyone on the net? Reductio ad absurdum, QED, E Pluribus Unum.

Every decision has a cost. Good people are not doing their best on the list
right now because of the current state of affairs.

>One restriction I would like to see is allowing only list-members to post.

Have you heard about the two message-credit-token plans? :) :)

Personally I think one of the issues is that, given the increase of interest in
extropy, the idea of single list for an international community is outdated.
Perhaps the communication in the ExI could be better distributed by separate
lists for different topics.  Also, an emphasis on local gatherings outside of
California and other forms of networking might help.  I for one would like to
hear from extropians and transhumanists in the Chicago area.

It comes down to "am I getting $95 worth of value out of the connections I
make and the things I get to put together out of pieces I find each year on
this list?"

I'd say I got at least that much out of the list this past year.
Unfortunately, I also let myself get sucked into a lot of time-wasting
arguments, so my year on the list comes out as a net loss. I am coming to
be more aware that my attention is the only thing I have of value to me.

Yes it's expensive, if this is the plan. But _I'll_ gamble a 1-year
membership if the people who stay all plan to make the experience worth
$95/yr to each other. I think of it as a pledge. I'm not being snotty about
the decision I've made to invest. I expect dividends or I'll cut my losses. :)

YMMV.

Not being a member doesn't mean anything. Being a member means you put some
money where your mouth is.
What's the problem? Honestly?

It's a possible alternative (and I don't know what I think of it yet).
Subscription is simple, any complication starts to grow nonlinearly.

Well, ExI isn't the only game in town. There is a lot of transhuman doing

Hi People, that subject title happens to strike a deep
chord in me, ... I'd move to suggest that some extropian posts
did change my life ... I'm still sure that we've got a good thing
going here,...

We all could do better with a little more effort put
into thinking about people who are on list ,... and been 
more sensitive and not resorting to 'flaming' down one another
( an eye for an eye , makes the world go blind  - Gandhi )

I think the guidelines and rules laid down at the beginning when
we all first logged onto extroppians are well thought thru and we
should strive to adhere to them ....

That's reassuring to know too,.. because we can't possibly
get our hands on every thread we see , and I like the idea of
people talking confidently about their field of exppertise ...
doesn't everyone agree to that ? the ssnr would definitely improve
and if one is not a member of that restricted list, one still can
read but not write to it , right ?!

Anyways, I'm optimistic about the future outcomes

List readers are familiar with the deflation in computer and data network
prices. These price reductions have been moving through the economy with,
in some cases, vertiginous results.  A powerful example of the
"destructive and creative" forces of the market is found in the changing
cost of performing stock trades. Why pay $672.59 to perform a stock trade
when you can pay $7.95? See the table below.

I think the more important question is: Are these institutions really in
danger of being labelled a cult?  When I show an issue of Extropy magazine
to a friend, the first thing that happens is their cult-o-meter goes
berzerk. Why?  Because Extropy is very radical, and it is
all-encompassing.  The first sense people get is "these extropians are
trying to tell me how to live."  Obviously, for those who actually read
the magazine, this thought is ridiculous, but that doesn't stop perfectly
intelligent people from making erroneous prejudgements.  I think it is in
ExI's best interest to minimize these prejudgements, and the best way to
go about that is reducing those things that may be miscontrued as "culty."
The fact that you have to pay at least $100 dollars to join an institute
to participate on a general extropian mailing list reeks of one of those
cults where the members are wearing rags, and the leader is driving around
in a Mercedes.

What if they don't have web access?  Many of us are restricted to e-mail
only services provided by our respective universities.  Limiting comments
from university students seems to me to be a *very* bad idea.

Exactly.  Empiricism is important here.  In this respect, I think we
should bow to those who have been here longest.  If you read Harvey
Newstrom's post, you will see that making people pay does not reduce the
S/NR ratio since those who paid think they are getting ripped off if they
can't ramble on about irrelevant topics.

> Some reasonable people think the SSNR is too high. One

True.  Which is why those who think someone's post is noise should just
ignore it.  If many people think it is noise, the noise-maker will get no
replies, and get discouraged through silence not to post irrelevant
material again.  The seems to me to be the best system (and most
extropian)  Kennita Watson tend to be a strong advocate of this way of
policing the list, and I agree.

I think the cost is not worth the value.  If Harvey Newstrom is correct,
S/NR will not change significantly, so what is the value of restricting
posts to the list?

$100 a year doesn't pay for a lot of luxury cars. No one is offereing
$3000 nine-day intensive ExI workshops.

No offense, but I think you need your cultometer adjusted.

OK, you may be right. I don't have a glib answer for this. But I know what

I'd agree if it worked; it hasn't (either?) :) :)

ExI gets a little money, I get messages from people who felt like making a
bet. I believe that Harvey's one data point deserves another.

Geoff, I hope you undertand I'm not trying to throw weight around or
bellyache. I am describing that I *expected* to have to pay, and was
*disappointed* that I didn't.  Call me a mutant.

I didn't see this until I read the updated mission statement.  I'm 
not going to be able to renew next year at that price, and I can't 
imagine that other members at my income level will be able to either.

Being ignored doesn't discourage some people.  Paying money may
discourage some, encourage/self-justify others.  Filtering, however,
does work.  Really.  My life is much nicer with 24 people sent to
/dev/null.  14 people receive my much tighter list of selected
messages.  Filtering people based on whether they pay money is a crude
filter; it tells me something about their committment, possibly, but
nothing about their quality.  It may be a good tool for some face to
face clubs with no alternative.  Here, however, I can filter people
directly based upon my perception of their quality.  Much more subtle.

I feel that most intelligent people who have a lot to contribute probably find it
an excessive waste of time to wade through so many postings.  Therefore, I
suggest that all those who post should be Extropy Institute (EI) members.  I do
not believe that basic EI membership should have a price tag though. Another
electronic community that I am a member of (the HTML Writer's Guild at
http://www.hwg.org.) has several levels of membership but basic membership is
free.  In this way those who have more time (and admittedly a bit of money) can
subscribe to a print copy magazine (sort of like Web Magazine), other services,
get a plaque (ala Public Television) or whatever. A live chat room for Level 2
members, for example might be set up.  An archive of the most popular threads
could be available for Level 3.  A member's Guide (on paper, CD-ROM, or online by
access number) is possible.  These things cost money for the owner of the list
but would be paid for by the members who desire such services.  It's a thought
worth serious thought.  Maybe a vote of sorts could be taken.  Who would I
contact about this plebiscite notion?

Gee, no kidding. I better write that down; I couldn't possibly already know
that. Thanks for cluing me in, there. My dim, milklike perception of
reality, not unlike the pale eyes of the dogfish, didn't suffice for me to
be aware of my own free will. But the l;laser of your intellect has cut
away the cataracts. thank you, thank you, thank you.

It is also my choice, and my responsibility, to say, as I have, that I
*want* *some* sort of across-the-board "speed bump", and I have already
proposed one such, not costing money from me but requiring some sort of
investment from others,  that turned out to be similar to something Robin
Hanson had mentioned. That approach would require the establishment and
maintenance of some sort of one-time-use "currency" and a trickle-feed of
unique serial numbers of same to all list participants. The maillist would
have to be gate-keeper'd by some sort of turnstile automaton. End result
could be a predictable-total-bandwidth list.

But who bells the cat? So that "solution" appears to be far too
labor-intensive at present to set up.

I am aware of that option. Leaving the list is an extreme example of
filtering, nicht wahr?

A few years ago I read that any Egyptian who graduated from
