Tony Hollick latest post is, as usual, full of errors, I list a few of them 
below but I only glanced at it so I don't claim it's anywhere near complete.

Dead wrong, Richard Feynman never said anything that stupid in his life.       
             

        >Not according to observation.    

A statement without a particle of fact.

Spectacularly wrong.

Tony says a lot more stuff but I lost interest, correcting his other bloopers 
I will leave as a exercise for the reader.

Robert Efron's _The Decline and Fall of Hemispheric Specialization_
is a great book on this subject.  Efron not only attacks the left-right
brain dualism, but presents an alternative which seems to account
for much of the dualism's evidence.

I asked Jim Halperin if there was a mailing list on the topic of
Truth Machines. He said there was not any to his knowledge. I
personally do not have the resources to support a mailing list,
and wonder if any of you can host a majordomo mailing list on
this topic. If you can, let me know by private email. Also, if
you are interested in administering such a list let me know by
private email. I am willing to be a participant, but not willing
to handle administration.

The focus of this list is what is needed to build a Truth Machine.
The other consequences of a TM can be discussed on other lists.

Please feel free to forward this message to anyone you feel can
help with this idea.

I can say it both ways, I think.  The art is ineffective because its
intention is to, in part, separate the audience from the inside elite.
Yet, while positioned comfortably on the inside, it does has depth.  (Sorry
if this sounds a bit like rattle -:)

I do think that the content of the art reference in this epoch has value
not only for the cultural content (it does reveal a lot about the times),
and also because abstract art and abstract thought are valuable brainwork.

this is true, but I just thought I'd mention that if the user inserts a
disk under windows 95 that has an autorun.inf file, it can autoexecute
files. So even though one must excute the viral program, is is possible for
damage to occur by simply inserting a disk.

  The effect of switching between a phytohemagglutinin-containing and a control

Source
  J Exp Ther Oncol.  1(5):273-7, 1996 Sep.
Abstract
  The present study concerns the importance of the timing of feeding mice a
  PHA-containing diet (7 mg g-1 diet) on tumor formation. The major decrease in
  tumor weight occurred in mice fed on the PHA diet for 11 days. A marked
  reduction was also observed in animals pre-fed for 3 days with PHA before
  tumor cells were injected and the diet then changed to lactalbumin, La. A
  large decrease in tumor weight was also evident when a change of diet from La
  to PHA was made on the day of tumor cell inoculation. Despite the presence of
  the developing tumor PHA was able to induce hyperplasia of the small
  intestine in all groups of animals fed PHA during a part or the whole of the
  experiment. The dry weights of tumors attained in each of the experimental
  groups plotted as a function of duration of PHA feeding, and the percentage
  lipid content of the tumors, mirrored almost exactly one another, suggesting
  that the availability of essential lipid material is severely reduced by the
  lectin. This would appear to have a major effect on the observed reduction in
  tumor growth.

Title
  Phytohemagglutinin-induced gut hyperplasia and the growth of a mouse
  lymphosarcoma tumor.
Source
  J Exp Ther Oncol.  1(3):171-6, 1996 May.
Abstract
  NMRI mice injected subcutaneously with Krebs II lymphosarcoma cells and fed
  on a diet containing the kidney bean lectin phytohemagglutinin (PHA) within
  the range 0.45-7.0 mg/g diet, developed tumors during a 10 day period which
  on average were only 35% of the dry weight of tumors in lactalbumin (La) fed
  mice (control). The reduction in growth occurred in a dose-dependent manner
  in the range 0.45-3.5 mg/g diet. The degree of hyperplasia of the small
  intestine in response to feeding the PHA diets was higher in non-injected
  compared to injected mice. A lipolytic effect of PHA was observed above 1.75
  mg/g diet in control mice and the highest concentration had a major effect on
  body weight. Since the index of hyperplasia at the lowest PHA concentration
  tested did not correlate with the reduction in tumor size, it is suggested
  that other factors in addition to the initial lectin-induced gut hyperplasia
  are involved in slowing down the progression of tumor growth.

	He might be overly pessimistic about this, but Dr. Hayflick is a
great scientist. We might disagree with him on some points, but there is
no reason to call into question his intelligence and rationality.
	This is the guy who in the 40's tore down the prevailing dogma
that cell cultures are immortal-- even though the field at the time was
dominated by a famous and very influential scientist named Alex Carel who
believed this. Hayflick repeated the experiments without the contamination
that Carel's lab was introducing into the cell cultures, got opposite
results, and stuck by them despite the flack he got for it for several
years.

The huge difference between the hemispheres is is largely a myth,
there is no fundamental difference in how they work. It is just that
the functions tend to be lateralized when they have no direct
connection to sensory input or actions requiring both sides of the
body. Mathematics can be both logical-verbal and artistic-visual, so
there is no strong reason to think it will be found on one side or the
other.

   IAN: OK, so you made up that definition

   of atomism, no problem; but then you say...

   IAN: I think that atomism defined by the Three Laws
   of Thought and "mystical" as "holism" are the logical,
   indicated, and standard definitions. The definitions you 
   have presented are not indicated and are nonstandard, so 
   the implication that I've modified definitions to suit 
   my metaphysics is unfounded and contraindicated; in 
   fact I have addressed the standing definitions!

   It's true that "1 = 0" could be a definition of mysticism,
   but it's one that does not explain what it's saying, it's
   like erasing part of an explanation (the -1 part). If
   we model the case of a school of thought by erasing 
   critical data that is required to understand their
   position, we will not be able to understand it.
   The point is that 1 => (1 + (-1)) which = 0.

   IAN: Yes, so we mostly agree, and it seems your 
   definition of atomism is "semi-holism" if not 100% 
   holism, which means it's not real atomism. Your a 
   holist, not an atomist. The relation of 2 or 7 to 
   0 must be static, since it is a static relation 
   by definition. This relation does evidence atomism.

   The relation of A or B to 0 may not be static; 
   for example, if A is a car and A is moving at 
   35 mph relative to a fixed point of reference 
   that we say is moving at 0 mph, and A accele-
   rates to 40mph, the relation of A to 0 has 
   changed. But if B followed A exactly, then 
   that relation has not changed (as you note), 
   yet then we have a relation of change to 
   not-change, which is holism, not atomism:

   [(A,B) = static relative to (A,0)] = holism.

   IAN: If in holism we have A and -A, it follows
   that we would have change and not-change, so 
   I don't see that citing examples of not-change
   in a whole wherein there is change defines atom-
   ism since it presents no example outside holism.

   One way to look at it is, if we need to 
   whole to observe X, we're defining holism. 
   The example you cite relies upon the whole.

   IAN: Excellent points! I think we agree even 
   more. What your referring to as "atomism" is 
   what I've seen as my analysis has progressed
   over time that what we call atomism IS in holism,
   that the two are not antithetical: the get parts
   you need the whole. My point though is that the 
   100% atomist definition I cited never holds up.


>So my definition, in the clearest form you'll get from me at this hour:
>Atomism is the statement that the truth of partial identities does not
>necessarily change as other partial identities change.


   IAN: But it will in that if A and B stay the 
   same size, and C is also the same, but then 
   C grows larger, A dn B get smaller by relation.
   And when we say A and B are not changing, we 
   say that relative to change. If there was no
   change in the universe, "no-change" would not
   be a definable concept.

    IAN: But when I refer to part A I refer to 
    part -A by exclusion. When I say look at 
    that bird, I saying something about all 
    else, I say "Don't look at all else,"
    and thus I refer to all by default.
    I may not list all that is in all
    else, and so to I may not list 
    every feature of the bird.

    IAN: Yes, and that's the crux of the issue here.
    The traditional concept of "mystical" is something
    that is antithetical to logical and physics. I have
    had the "mystical experience, white light and the 
    awareness of eternal and infinte being (really 
    awasome!), so I'm defining what that mystical 
    experience "told me" about reality. It told
    me that all things are connectd, that no
    thing is free from the All, and that 
    each things contains All by relation.

    Feeling that this "mystical" eperience has 
    been wrongfully defined as something other 
    than the profound experience of the logical
    union of all things, I've sought to map out
    the reality that is seen during "the light."
    It's my feeling that its UN-mystical, that 
    it's a phenomenal explosion of intelligence.

    So my saying "mystical validation" skirts two
    worlds, in that it does not purport to say 
    anything about Gods, ghosts, psychics... but
    simply that this type of experience that is
    defined as "mystical" and what is seen to 
    be the truth during it, is in fact logical.


>... I even begun to convince you that we atomists aren't so
>bad after all. (A task which a series of great minds on this list have
>apparently tried and failed to do.) 

    IAN: I disagree with that. I think that I've
    clearly shown that the example of a not-changing 
    relation amidst changin realtions is not an exmaple
    of atomism, but of holism, since C is C realti to not-C.
    Also, the not-C relation changes it's relative identity
    (such as becoming bigger, slower, smaller, faster...)
    relative to C. Similarly, no other exampls have been 
    shown of A that is A free, so I totally refute the 
    implication that you and others have been providing 
    evidence that holism is less than 100% absolute.

I've been archiving the medical references and looked over some today.

I have one to add.  

Buffalo berry is a shrub we grow for field shelterbelts to trap snow,
stop wind, prevent soil erosion.  we have now about 30 miles of these.

In a time when there is no rain and thus no crop maybe it gladdens the 
step when an article like the attachement comes along.  Apparently
several of the constituents of buffaloberry may deter or treat aids.

New hydrolyzable tannins, shephagenins A and B, from Shepherdia argentea as
HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University, Japan.

Two new hydrolyzable tannins, shephagenins A and B, were isolated along
with hippophaenin A and strictinin from the leaf extract of Shepherdia
argentea, which showed a remarkable inhibitory activity against human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 reverse transcriptase. Their structures,
having a gluconic acid core, have been elucidated on the basis of
spectroscopic and chemical methods. The inhibitory effect of the leaf
extract on HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was found to be due to tannins, and
their activities were stronger than that of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate as
a positive control.

We've been wanting to set up special purpose lists to build the "NodeNet".
This issue would be a good list as part of that project. The NodeNet
structure does require one person to decide who is allowed to post to the
list (anyone can read). Jim -- would be you be willing to suggest
subscribers and to approve applicants? If so, I can send you the info
(written by Greg Burch) on how the NodeNet lists work.

Mr. Sparks: "Are you, or have you ever been, a member of Extropy
Institute?" :-)  I'm not concerned about persecution of ExI members, though
I agree it would be good, if practicable, to allow anonymous membership.
The point about online delivery of magazines isn't an issue -- Extropy has
already become online-only, and the newsletter is about to do the same.
I'll certainly keep your suggestion in mind. Thanks!

Here are the current ExI membership detials. If you just want to know current
subscription rates, you can go to the end.

The next Exponent newsletter will go into production soon. It's easier to send
it out all at once than individually to new members, so if we receive your
renewal by June 10, USA members can subtract $10. (Overseas folks already have
a lower rate...)

     Extropy = the extent of a system’s intelligence, information, vitality,
diversity,
     opportunity, and capacity for growth.


E X T R O P Y  I N S T I T U T E

Extropy Institute (ExI) is a 501[c][3] tax-exempt educational corporation,
founded in 1992 as an outgrowth of the Extropy journal. ExI acts a catalyst
for
a better future by helping individuals extend their lives, augment their
intelligence, optimize their psychology, and improve their communities. The
Institute pursues this catalytic role in two ways: through a creative process
of networking and an educational process of disseminating ideas.

In its creative role, the Institute brings together the finest critical and
innovative minds in an intellectual and social network. This network of
thinkers challenges conventional ideas about human limits and develops new
ideas about the use of technologies of all kinds to improve the future.
Seeking
to develop careful thinking about extending the human life span, augmenting
human intelligence, improving human psychology, and refining economic and
political organization, Extropy Institute provides several forums for
networking and creative thinking. The Exponent newsletter gathers news of
developments, members’ projects, and Institute activities. The EXTRO
conferences bring together thinkers from numerous fields of study. Other
seminars and local meetings, the Extropians email list, and the web site
provide additional forums for developing and refining ideas.

In its educational role, the Institute brings these (always open and evolving)
extropian ideas to the public in order to encourage more rational practices
and
beliefs. The Institute’s web site provides information on extropian thinking
and links to further resources. Extropy Online presents extropian thinking
gathered from the best minds in a manner accessible to intelligent
non-specialists. The EXTRO conferences, in addition to their networking role,
also act as a means of communicating current extropian thinking to the public.
The Institute disseminates ideas and educates the public through
appearances of
its members on television and in newspapers, magazines, and books, and by
representing extropian perspectives at conferences and in debates.

In essence, the Institute seeks to catalyze continual discoveries that extend
our lives and increase the power and depth of our minds. While Institute
members may hold diverse and sometimes conflicting ideas about how to pursue
these ends, we agree in affirming the values expressed in the Extropian
Principles: Boundless Improvement, Self-Transformation, Self-Ownership,
Dynamic
Optimism, Intelligent Technology, and Spontaneous Order. [see
<http://www.extropy.org/extprn26.htm%5D>www.extropy.org/extprn26.htm]


E X T R O P I A N S  O N  T H E  N E T

Extropy Institute sponsors a number of forums for sharing limit-busting,
life-extensionist, pro-technology, and other extropian ideas with bright,
like-minded individuals around the globe.

You can also access the Frequently Asked Questions file, and other Extropian
writings, on the World Wide Web. The official ExI Web page:
     <http://www.extropy.org/>http://www.extropy.org

The most popular service is the Extropians e-mail list (founded in 1991),
which
boils over with lively discussion and debate on numerous topics. You can join
the members-only list by sending a message to:
          extropians-request@extropy.org

In the body of your message put only the following: 
          subscribe extropians <your e-mail address>

You can also unsubscribe yourself at any time in the same way, by replacing
"subscribe" with "unsubscribe".  For other Majordomo commands, send to the
above address with "help" in the body of the message (and nothing else).

You can find a web-based interface to the lists at:

Our successful third conference, EXTRO-3, took place in San Jose,
California in
August 1997, with Dr. Eric Drexler of the Institute for Molecular
Manufacturing
as keynote speaker. 165 attendees a range of stimulating sessions and talked
with some of the leading extropic thinkers of today. Audio and videotapes of
all the sessions are available (at a discount for Institute members).

EXTRO-4, focusing on extension of the maximum human life span (both the
research being done, what measures can be taken today, and the economic and
psychological consequences), is being planned for early 1999, either in
California, Las Vegas, or Santa Fe. Members will receive updates, which will
also appear on the web site.

I'd really rather discuss Sontag's work from the 1960s and why is it not

A couple of additional list ideas:

A list requiring the users to PGP encrypt and PGP sign their messages.

A sprinkling of regional lists, consisting of people who have met each

	Most people here probably don't use or know much about Pretty Good
Privacy (PGP), but they really should, if they are serious about privacy
and digital security. PGP is a method for people to encrypt data intended
for your eyes only. Equally useful is PGP's ability to generate digital
signatures so people know that a message really was written by you. The
first step is to download the freeware version of PGP 5.55 from...
www.pgp.com (both Mac and PC versions available). Then, mess around with
it, see how it works, even read the manual perhaps. Finally, if you still
can't get it to work properly, send me email personally with "PGP" as the
subject and time permitting, I will try to talk you through it over email
or some other medium.
	Please note that certain misguided countries, including the USA,
have export restrictions on PGP.

Well, isn't there a type of anonymous remailer that works two-ways? You
could send in your subscription request through such a remailer. Let me
get back to you after I find and re-read the anonymous remailer FAQ.

I'm certain that some things can be 100% true and others 100 % false, and my 
opinion may even be correct, but even if so it doesn't follow that all things 
have this all or nothing property. Which slot did that particle go through?  
If you insist that my answer be non fuzzy then there are only 4 possible 
answers I can give you, right, left, both, and neither. Unfortunately each of 
these 4 answers is equally unsatisfactory. 

Is the statement "the particle went through the left slot"  100% true? 
No it's not true, but the strange thing is that its logical negation is not 
true either.

   IAN: Something that occurred to me that other
   day is in-line with what you say. I'm a very 
   visual art-oriented person, and I always had
   trouble with math, but if I can see what's 
   the math is describing, bingo, I get it quick.

   It occurred to me that some others don't have
   to see it to "see it," so to say, and those 
   others that I know of are very much not-art-
   istic, very, shall we say, "left-brained," 
   to coin the "myth." But what occurred to me 
   was that they MUST be seeing it internally,
   and thus people like me may actually have 
   a internal visual deficit for which external
   visual stimuli acts as a compensation. This
   would tend to imply that those that we call
   "left brained" actually have some variety of
   advanced internal visualization. I say some 
   kind because artists such as myself do have
   strong internal visual capabilities, but in
   the case of fast math learners, this seems 
   to map out a utilization of the right side,
   such that, as you note, the idea that math
   isn't utilizing the right side is not true.

For all of us who think CTCs and cosmological engineering are
reasonable pursuits :-)

http://publish.aps.org/ejnls/prdfetch/abstract/PRD/V58/E023501/
(accessible for subscribers only):

Can the Universe create itself? 

J. Richard Gott and III Li-Xin Li 

Department of Astrophysical Sciences, Princeton University, Princeton,
New Jersey 08544

15 July 1998 
Phys. Rev. D 58, 023501 (1998) (43 pages) 

(Received 30 December 1997; published 29 May 1998) 

The question of first-cause has troubled philosophers and cosmologists
alike. Now that it is apparent that our universe began in a big bang
explosion, the question of what happened before the big bang
arises. Inflation seems like a very promising answer, but as Borde and
Vilenkin have shown, the inflationary state preceding the big bang
could not have been infinite in duration---it must have had a
beginning also. Where did it come from? Ultimately, the difficult
question seems to be how to make something out of nothing. This paper
explores the idea that this is the wrong question---that that is not
how the Universe got here. Instead, we explore the idea of whether
there is anything in the laws of physics that would prevent the
Universe from creating itself.  Because spacetimes can be curved and
multiply connected, general relativity allows for the possibility of
closed timelike curves (CTCs). Thus, tracing backwards in time through
the original inflationary state we may eventually encounter a region
of CTCs---giving no first-cause. This region of CTCs may well be over
by now (being bounded toward the future by a Cauchy horizon).  We
illustrate that such models---with CTCs---are not necessarily
inconsistent by demonstrating self-consistent vacuums for Misner space
and a multiply connected de Sitter space in which the renormalized
energy-momentum tensor does not diverge as one approaches the Cauchy
horizon and solves Einstein's equations. Some specific scenarios (out
of many possible ones) for this type of model are described. For
example, a metastable vacuum inflates producing an infinite number of
(big-bang-type) bubble universes. In many of these, either by natural
causes or by action of advanced civilizations, a number of bubbles of
metastable vacuum are created at late times by high energy
events. These bubbles will usually collapse and form black holes, but
occasionally one will tunnel to create an expanding metastable vacuum
(a baby universe) on the other side of the black hole's Einstein-Rosen
bridge as proposed by Farhi, Guth, and Guven. One of the expanding
metastable-vacuum baby universes produced in this way simply turns out
to be the original inflating metastable vacuum we began with. We show
that a Universe with CTCs can be stable against vacuum
polarization. And it can be classically stable and self-consistent if
and only if the potentials in this Universe are retarded---which gives
a natural explanation of the arrow of time in our
universe. Interestingly, the laws of physics may allow the Universe to
be its own mother. [S0556-2821(98)00614-6]

Can't tell you that on this public list ;-)

Just think of the biggest taboos today's society has, taboos 
so bad that you need a private, incripted list to discuss them.
Actually, people (listmembers) have complained about the
bad PR of topics like grey goo, superminds stepping on humans
as if they were ants, the stupidity of most people, saying 
transhumanism is superior to other philosophies etc, etc.

The logical consequence is of course to have these discussions
on a separate list, so that people can speak freely for once,
without having the weight of being co-responsible for the PR of the
whole movement on their shoulders, or having to worry about
being harassed or even prosecuted because of what they
write.

Is this such a stupid idea? We all want good PR and protection
of our privacy, right? Yet we also want to be able to speak freely, 
and to say very controversial things if necessary (and if you've 
nothing "socially unacceptable" to say, then you're simply not 
thinking hard enough). This is the way to do it.

 IAN: The question/answer is fuzzy, yes! But the fuzziness
 measures a disjunction between (1) our questions, words, 
 and concepts and (2) physical reality. Number 2 is, in 
 and of itself, true by 100%, but the match between 1
 and 2 may or may not be true by 100%. That's my read.

 The question "Which slit did the photo pass through,"
 is an "artificial" construct that says, "It must have 
 passed through one or the other." The mapping between
 that concept and reality is not a one-one mapping, but
 the mapping of reality to reality is a one-one mapping.
 Where truth is a one-one mapping, reality is 100% true.

 Notice that to map A to A is a de facto "zero mapping."
 Notice also that "zero mapping" is an "identity function."

	The second logical consequence is that the open list will need to
_improve_ it's PR. People who choose to be on both lists (IMHO) should
have the responsibility of being diplomatic, setting a good example, and
always putting the list in the best possible light. Perhaps
well-intentioned new members who start "grey-goo" or "cloning for
transplantation" threads on the open list could be privately encouraged to
move the discussion to the private list.

I find myself once more facing the drudgery of a rather visionless IT job,
and, having worked through several months of exceptionally non-Extropian
thinking, think it time to resubscribe to the list. To those of you who
already know me I say, 'Hello again,' and to those that do not I say,
"Hello and www.seraph.org".

The Extropy web site tells me that we are 'Catalysing the Future': I hope
that that is not entirely true. Catalysts remain unchanged at the end of
the process, and I rather hope that I change with time, even if those
changes are designed to prevent other, less desirable ravages of time and
disease.

Anyway, just a short note to say 'Hello,' which I shall close now in the
interests of the lists signal-to-noise ratio.

Sarah

I think you missed the first part of this conversation.  Not every
question/statement will have 100% truth to it; indeed, you can obviously
have a statement with partial truth, despite the fact that the truth is
all or nothing. 

As you note, this particular statement certainly would not fall into the
category of having all or nothing truth, but that is not to say that the
truth itself is partial.  The words are fuzzy, not the truth.

      Perhaps if John Clark took a bit longer to understand these 
      problems, he would have a better understanding of them.
      
      
      I give a _physical_ explanation of Heisenberg's Uncertainty 
      principle, whereby I expressly demarcate the _physics_ of 
      Heisenberg's ideas from the observationalist/positivist religion:

    My assertion that we can retrodictively correct the 'observational' 
    'evidence' to the extent that we understand the underlying processes 
    and interactions is simply _true_ (we do it all the time), and I 
    cannot understand why John Clark should fail to grasp the point, 
    unless he doesn't _want_ to understand it.

       I was hoping to get Christian to see the difference between a ratio 
       and an (alleged) Absolute property.  SR/GR simultaneously states 
       that there are no absolute properties, then tries to sneak in an 
       Absolute velocity of light.  It just doesn't work.

      I have a hundred dollars that says that I can give you citation for 
      Feynman's saying exactly this, that photons can travel faster and 
      slower  than 'c'.  In QED.  Wanna play?  >:-}

      We start with a uniform cubic space, say one metre along each edge.  
      On the north side is a blue LED pointing south, and alongside it, a 
      photoelectric cell likewise aimed southwards.
      
      On the south side we have a red LED pointed north, and a northwardly 
      aimed photoelectric cell.  
      
      Our apparatus is rigged so that the red and the blue LEDs fire 
      simuultaneusly.  The photoelectric cells record the time of flight 
      of the red and the blue photons.
      
      Armed with this kit, we can do a timeslice-by-timeslice analysis of 
      the positions of the photons within the cube.  We can show 
      _conclusively_ that  -- for the photons to start where and when they 
      do, and end up when and where they do, the red photons MUST travel 
      at 2c relative to the blue photons.
      
      Your whole crumbling edifice rests upon the empty assertion that 
      simultaneity is impossible, and that we cannot establish a uniform 
      mapping of the photons' positions.  Yet we can, and do.  QED.

      So name six technologies critically (patentably) dependent on 
      Special and General Relativity.  You can't.  And don't hand out that 
      tired old 'GPS' nonsense -- NASA use CLASSICAL MECHANICS for all 
      navigational calculations.  e=mc^2 was derived classically 'way 
      before SR/GR, as every knowledgeable scholar in the field is (or 
      should be) aware.  'Black Holes' preceded GR by more than a hundred 
      years.

      Just name six.  If you can.  Wanna bet?
      
      John, I know the relativistic religion is alluring.  But it's just 
      plain myth...  >:-}

 The polymath has had much more influence on my ideas in the past 6 months
than the extropians list had over the past 2 years.
 For example, I used to be pretty sure that nanotech and AI would cause
a big, long-lasting increase in interest rates; I now think that the
increase will be moderate and temporary.

 Unfortunately, most of the changes in my ideas are due to one person
(Robin Hanson), so it is somewhat accurate to call the list inbred. I
don't see an easy way to get more people of Robin's calibur on the list,
and I suspect that opening the list would mainly cause the list to be
more dominated by familiar ideas. The extropians list has become ordinary
enough that I've virtually given up looking for important new ideas on it.

11. AN ANALYSIS OF DEMOGRAPHIC TRAJECTORIES OF HUMAN LONGEVITY 
Human old-age survival has increased substantially since 1950, 
and this evidence of extended post-reproductive survival is 
apparently puzzling biodemographers. Vaupel et al (14 authors at 
10 installations, DE US DK MX CN) review current questions and 
results in this field, presenting data from various sources. The 
reduction in death rates at older ages has increased the size of 
the elderly population considerably. In developed countries in 
1990 there were about twice as many nonagenarians and 4 to 5 
times as many centenarians as there would have been if mortality 
after age 80 had stayed at 1960 levels. Reliable data for various 
developed countries indicate that the population of centenarians 
has doubled every decade since 1960, mostly as a result of 
increases in survival after age 80. Here are selected data for 
people 60 years and older in 1997 and projections for 2025:

I know what it is. Light travels slower in denser matter. i.e. it travels slower
in air than in a vacuum, and slower in an optic fiber than in air. It is also
affected by gravity as well, which is why its slower when travelling through dense
matter, but this is described in SR/GR.

I'd like to see citations of mathematical treatments of black hole theory that
precedes SR/GR by 100 years. Lessee, that means they should be published before
1805.Solid state electronics cannot be described by classical mechanics, because
so much of electronic theory depends on tunneling.

Likewise,  lasers cannot function purely by classical mechanics.

Nor can polarizing filters on cameras.

the electroluminescent lamp cannot function by classical mechanics

nuclear fission cannot be described by classical mechanics.

the quantum tunneling microscope cannot function by classical mechanics.

Ok, thats six, now where is my money?

Yes, but it's hard not to feel some deep-in-the-bone sympathy with his
qualms about paradoxa in QT and Relativity.  This might mean nothing more
profound than a mismatch between human-scale expectations, perhaps
pre-wired by evolution, and the real substrate of the universe, or it might
be a clue to something truly radical awaiting physics.  

I note that the April 25 *New Scientist* (which I haven't seen) apparently
reports on one Anton Zeilinger's demonstration (presumably on paper) that
quantum photon entanglement can be extended to 2 sets of twins.  If one
photon from each otherwise independent pair becomes entangled, this has
curious and unexpected consequences for the states of the very distant
partners.  I wonder how far this can be extended?  We might end up,
horrifyingly, with something like the universal entanglement preached by
New Age quantum bliss merchants...  :(

D'oh!  I should have recognised his name - quantum `teleportation'.  As
another recent *New Scientist* article says:

       Transport the piece of incomplete information that
       you hold about C down to where B is, and you can construct a
       particle that's identical to the original C. This is the trick that
       Zeilinger's team pulled off late last year and reported in Nature (vol
       390, p 575).

Didn't Penrose say something about this?  If so, no doubt the mystics are

I too find the polymath list extremely valuable. A central feature 
of the "inbreeding" that Paul speaks of consists of exploring a 
smaller number of issues in greater depth than has been ever been 
done before. (You could call this "penetration" if you want.)

Extending health span with genetics

Fruit fly find suggests approaches for keeping youthful vigor

By Charlene Laino
MSNBC

June 1 —Canadian scientists reported Monday that they have successfully
extended the life span of the fruit fly by inserting into its DNA a designer
gene that prevented some of the cellular damage normally associated with
aging. The approach holds potential for increasing humans’ health span —
“our days of youthful vigor,” said researcher John Phillips of the
University of Guelph.

USING GENETIC ENGINEERING techniques, an extra gene was inserted into the
fruit fly’s motor neurons — nerve cells that control movement — boosting
their ability to remove toxins from the body and extending their life span
by 40 percent.
       While an extra 30 days added to the normal 80-day life span of a
fruit fly might sound insignificant, the find has enormous implications for
biology, Phillips said.
       “We have discovered that [weakening of the detoxifying mechanism] in
motor neurons is the Achilles heel of life span,” the Canadian scientist
said.
       Drug companies are already working on new pharmaceuticals targeted at
the motor neurons that would work to increase our health span, he noted.
       But perhaps even more importantly, the findings mark the first time
researchers have shown that a single gene in a single type of cell can
affect longevity.
       “We were really surprised,” said study head Gabrielle Boulianne, a
neurobiologist at the Hospital for Sick Children and a professor of
molecular and medical genetics at the University of Toronto. “We now know
that just manipulating just one gene, targeting one type of cell, has a huge
impact on aging.
       “Contrary to what was previously thought — that many different
factors contribute to aging — it now appears that the process may be
simpler,” Boulianne said.
       The study is published in the June issue of the journal Nature
Genetics.
       The new research grew out of work showing that the efficiency with
which organisms use oxygen directly correlates to their life span, Phillips
said. Humans, who have the longest lives of any organism, are the most
efficient users of oxygen, for example, while mice and hummingbirds, who
have relatively short lives, are inefficient users.
       The reason, he said, is that oxygen is very toxic. “Even at the 21
percent atmospheric oxygen that we breathe, there has evolved a detoxifying
mechanism without which we would all keel over and die,” Phillips explained.
       Over the past decade, scientists have identified the genes
responsible for this detoxifying mechanism. When this gene is made inactive
via a human-made mutation in the fruit fly, Phillips said, its life span is
reduced by some 80 percent to 90 percent.
       At about the same time, researchers came to better understand that
motor neurons are somehow associated with this detoxifying mechanism.
Studies have shown that people with Lou Gehrig’s disease, a paralytic
disorder that is caused by a loss of motor neurons, tend to have family
members whose genes controlling oxygen detoxification are faulty, for
example.
       Moreover, in species ranging fruit flies to humans, there is evidence
that loss of motor neuron function is a prominent feature of disease, aging
and death, molecular biologist Phillips said. “We theorized that motor
neurons might be at the nexus of aging and oxygen metabolism.”
       That research led to the question: What would happen if we upgraded
that detoxification defense mechanism? Would the organism live longer?
       To answer the question, the team created a designer gene that would
enhance oxygen detoxification in motor neurons.
       The human-made gene was then added to the fruit fly’s normal genetic
makeup.
       The experiment worked. Not only did the gene help the motor neurons
eliminate more waste, but the fruit flies they lived longer.
       Drug companies are already working on new antioxidant formulas
targeted at the motor neurons that work more efficiently in the nervous
system to rid our bodies of toxins and increase our health span, Phillips
said.
       While some theorize that the approach could be used to create a pill
that would let us all live 40 percent longer — boosting average age from 80
to 110 — Phillips said that is not his intention. “There are too many social
implications,” he said. “Already there are problems with old-age pensions,
for example.”
       Rather, the find can be used to help us live healthier, avoiding the
sickness and disease normally associated with old age, he said.
       “The way in which the approach extended the life span of the fruit
fly is encouraging,” Phillips said. “Life span was extended though
postponement of the onset of senescence.”
       In other words, he said, we could live our final days not in a
geriatric ward, but full of youthful energy.

So questions that seem perfectly meaningful, reasonable and clear cut to  
humans (Did the particle go through the left slot or the right slot or both 
slots or no slot?) are really ambiguous (How long is a piece of string?) 
or gibberish (Did the klognee go through the fisben or the onrobonob?). 
The trouble is this question is as simple and basic as it's possible to ask 
and you're saying we can't even get that one right. Well maybe, but if so then 
the word "truth", that after all humans invented, can't have much meaning. 

It seems to me saying our most basic questions are fuzzy but the truth is 
clear cut is equivalent to saying our questions are clear cut but the truth 
is fuzzy, one is just a euphemism for the other.

I posted this to the WTA list, but I thought some extropians might be
interested.
--------

I am currently working on a book about Transhumanism---but I have an
idea for another project. I was wondering if anyone from here would be
interested in putting together a "Transhumanist Reader" which would be a
collection of different essays that would represent a wide variety of
transhumanist concepts. A book like that would be a NYT best seller,
right? Well, ok, no, such a book is not likely to sell very well as 
trashumanist memes now are not that popular (which is funny, considering
all the space in bookstores devoted to NEW AGE topics). There would
probably not be a huge profit, especially if a group of authors
contribute, unless suddenly these memes take off--which would be the
point of putting out the book! 

If interested, please, email me at thomquinn@esosoft.com or
evolu@evolutionary.org

Thanks,
Thom Quinn

Perhaps I should clarify my position.  Yes again, the level of discussion on the polymath
list is quite high and I have gleamed some very useful insights from it over the past few
months.  I especially like the input of Anders Sandberg, Robin Hanson and Nick Bostrom.

However, in the end, it is the intrinsically elitist and *fallible* judgment of one
person (no offense Damien) that determines who gets to participate and who doesn't.  I
don't see Max More, Dan Clemmensen or Daniel Fabulich on the list - all of whom have had
substantial influences on my own thinking.

However with a big "Sigh", I have yet to determine a more sustainable way to maintaining
a high S/N other than the way Damien has approached it.  Anybody know of alternatives?

I think the most thanks should go to Anders, who despite his high caliber has
perseveringly continued a high level of discussion on *all* of the lists - at least I
*can* interact with him w/o resorting to private correspondence.

Alas, the confusion.

What we have here is that the experiment has observed results. If the
experiment is done properly, all observed results are 100% TRUE.

Viewing the results, one can determine if the photon had one or more
paths from source to target. Quantum Mechanics lets us calculate the
various possible results depending on the path options available when
the experiment is run.

If there is more than one path, QM can accurately calculate the resulting
detection pattern. However, QM has nothing to say regarding questions
like "which slit".

I guess apples and oranges are not fuzzy, but peaches are....

The above is partially incorrect as applied to magnetic disks (I am not certain 
about CDROM formats).

The boot sector actually contains a variety of information, ONE PART of which 
is executable code.  The other parts include necessary information about the 
layout of the disk.

On any attempt to open a file or directory on a disk (or upon detection of a 
removable-media change in OSes equipped to recognise this event), the boot 
sector is read -- so that the layout information is available to the system.

However, the executable code is *not* executed, except from the boot device at 
system boot.

A virus is, of course, executable code.  Thus, its presence in a boot sector is 
not important unless that boot sector's executable code is in fact executed.

Given ordinary intellect and supportive intellectual parents, IMHO a child can 
get a better education by spending 2 hours twice a week at a public library than 
by going to a public school for 30 hours a week.

Depending on the age of this young daughter, be sure to:
  * read to her
  * help her read
  * read for yourself, where she can see you doing it
  * include both light reading and serious study in your reading
  * comparable stuff for arithmetic and, later, math 
  * buy her books and intellectual toys that are appropriate to her
    age level -- *and* some that are a bit beyond her.
  * talk about current events, history, science,... in her presence
  * study enough to know what you're talking about
  * make it apparent that you enjoy all this stuff
  * live near a library plus have a lot of books of your own
  * get her her own library card as soon as she can sign her name on it
  * visit the library at least weekly
  * let her have free run of the books in the library

Do this, and you are extremely likely to have a well-educated child no matter 
what doesn't happen at her school.

Fortunately for us, however, our observations are consistent and, as Hara
noted, 100% true.  While "which slit did the photon pass through?" seems
like a precise question, this may be because we think about the world from
the perspective of Newtonian mechanics; if you had to diffract onto a
screen to get to work in the morning, you'd quickly get the sense that
this question isn't quite as basic as we might think.

Thom, this is a wonderful idea.  What we desperately need right now are 
publishing venues for transhumanist ideas--as many as possible!  I  
would very much like to have a 
book to place on my bookshelf that contains a variety of viewpoints, 
ideas and essays that reflect the diversity within transhumanist 
thought.  So many people enjoy browsing through friends' bookshelves, 
or in bookstores, or sharing books and this is an excellent way to reach the 
ninety percent of the world that does not have a web browser.  

Please put me on your list as a contributor.  I would bet there's 
something sitting in my hard drive right now that would suit....

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

British Journal of Nutrition 79: 213-221 1998

"Lipid Accumulation in Obese Zucker rats is Reduced by Inclusion of Raw
Kidney Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) in the Diet"

Abstract:

    The effects of inclusion of different levels of raw kidney bean
(Phaseolus vulgaris) of high lectin content (27 g/kg meal) in a
high-quality (lactalbumin control diet were tested in nutritional trials on
the growth and metabolism of obese Zucker (fafa) rats and their lean
littermates in comparison with pair-fed controls. All diets contained 100 g
total protein/kg and either 50 g lipids/kg (low fat) or 150 g lipids/kg
(moderate fat). The growth of both obese and lean rats on bean diets was
retarded by the daily bean intake in a dose-dependent manner. However, most
of this was because bean-fed rats contained less body fat than the controls
after 10 d. Thus, after feeding low-fat diets containing up to 130 g kidney
bean/kg (lectin intake <=0.2 g/kg body weight (BW) per d) in both 10 d and
70 d trials, the bodies of obese rats contained less fat but not protein
than their pair-fed controls. Moreover, by increasing the lipid content of
the diet to 150 g/kg, the level of bean inclusion could be increased to 280
g/kg (lectin intake >=0.4 g/kg BW per d) without loss of body protein and
skeletal muscle. Although these rats contained more body fat than those
which were fed on low-fat diets, their weight reduction could be accounted
for exclusively by reduced lipid content. In contrast, significant body
protein loss occurred when the same diet of high lectin content was fed to
lean littermates. Plasma insulin levels were significantly depressed in the
obese Zucker rats on bean diets but the pancreas was not significantly
enlarged nor its insulin content changed in 10 d trials. However,
significant pancreatic growth occurred on long-term (70 d) bean feeding
compared with pair-fed controls. The results suggest that, in addition to
animal nutrition, it may also be possible to use the bean lectin as a
dietary adjunct or therapeutic agent to stimulate gut function and
ameliorate obesity if a safe and effective dose-range can be established
for human subjects.

Additional quote from text of report:

    As shown previously, the inclusion of high amounts of kidney bean
phytohaemagglutinin, its main physiologically active lectin component, in
the diet of young actively growing conventional rats at levels of 0.4 g/kg
BW per d or more, adversely affects their growth and metabolism. It causes
a major reduction in their body fat but the accompanying high catabolic
protein loss makes this an unacceptable means of weight reduction. However,
phytohaemagglutinin is not harmful for germ-free rats, therefore the weight
and muscle losses are not direct lectin effects but rather the consequence
of the damage caused by the phytohaemagglutinin-induced E. coli overgrowth
in the small intestine. As this is negligible at daily phytohaemagglutinin
intakes below 0.2 g and particularly below 0.1 g lectin/kg BW,
phytohaemagglutinin is essentially harmless even in conventional rats at
such low intakes.

Extending health span with genetics

Fruit fly find suggests approaches for keeping youthful vigor

By Charlene Laino
MSNBC

June 1 Canadian scientists reported Monday that they have
successfully extended the life span of the fruit fly by inserting
into its DNA a designer gene that prevented some of the cellular
damage normally associated with aging. The approach holds potential
for increasing humans health span our days of youthful vigor, said
researcher John Phillips of the University of Guelph.

USING GENETIC ENGINEERING techniques, an extra gene was inserted
into the fruit flys motor neurons  nerve cells that control
movement  boosting their ability to remove toxins from the body and
extending their life span by 40 percent.

       While an extra 30 days added to the normal 80-day life span
of a fruit fly might sound insignificant, the find has enormous
implications for biology, Phillips said.
 
We have discovered that [weakening of the detoxifying mechanism] in
motor neurons is the Achilles heel of life span, the Canadian
scientist said.
 
 Drug companies are already working on new pharmaceuticals targeted
at the motor neurons that would work to increase our health span,
he noted. But perhaps even more importantly, the findings mark the
first time researchers have shown that a single gene in a single
type of cell can affect longevity.

 We were really surprised, said study head Gabrielle Boulianne, a
neurobiologist at the Hospital for Sick Children and a professor of
molecular and medical genetics at the University of Toronto. We now
know that just manipulating just one gene, targeting one type of
cell, has a huge impact on aging.

 Contrary to what was previously thought  that many different
factors contribute to aging  it now appears that the process may be
simpler, Boulianne said. The study is published in the June issue
of the journal Nature Genetics.

 The new research grew out of work showing that the efficiency with
which organisms use oxygen directly correlates to their life span,
Phillips said. Humans, who have the longest lives of any organism,
are the most efficient users of oxygen, for example, while mice and
hummingbirds, who have relatively short lives, are inefficient
users.

 The reason, he said, is that oxygen is very toxic. Even at the 21
percent atmospheric oxygen that we breathe, there has evolved a
detoxifying mechanism without which we would all keel over and die,
Phillips explained.

 Over the past decade, scientists have identified the genes
responsible for this detoxifying mechanism. When this gene is made
inactive via a human-made mutation in the fruit fly, Phillips said,
its life span is reduced by some 80 percent to 90 percent.
       
 At about the same time, researchers came to better understand that
motor neurons are somehow associated with this detoxifying
mechanism. Studies have shown that people with Lou Gehrigs disease,
a paralytic disorder that is caused by a loss of motor neurons,
tend to have family members whose genes controlling oxygen
detoxification are faulty, for example.

 Moreover, in species ranging fruit flies to humans, there is
evidence that loss of motor neuron function is a prominent feature
of disease, aging and death, molecular biologist Phillips said. We
theorized that motor neurons might be at the nexus of aging and
oxygen metabolism.

 That research led to the question: What would happen if we
upgraded that detoxification defense mechanism? Would the organism
live longer?

 To answer the question, the team created a designer gene that
would enhance oxygen detoxification in motor neurons. The
human-made gene was then added to the fruit flys normal genetic
makeup. The experiment worked. Not only did the gene help the motor
neurons eliminate more waste, but the fruit flies they lived
longer.

 Drug companies are already working on new antioxidant formulas
targeted at the motor neurons that work more efficiently in the
nervous system to rid our bodies of toxins and increase our health
span, Phillips said.

 While some theorize that the approach could be used to create a
pill that would let us all live 40 percent longer  boosting average
age from 80 to 110  Phillips said that is not his intention. There
are too many social implications, he said. Already there are
problems with old-age pensions, for example.

 Rather, the find can be used to help us live healthier, avoiding
the sickness and disease normally associated with old age, he said.
The way in which the approach extended the life span of the fruit
fly is encouraging, Phillips said. Life span was extended though
postponement of the onset of senescence. In other words, he said,
we could live our final days not in a geriatric ward, but full of
youthful energy.

I also like Thom's idea.  Perhaps we could have some discussion on which
topics would be most appropriate for the essays.  It would depend on the
target market, right?  Will this be a book aimed at educating the general
public or aimed at extropians (or other transhumanists)?  Maybe we should
consider two books.  Being rather new at this, I haven't been reading the
ExI journal but assume there's lots of potential material there.  Any
general text should certainly have Max More's collection of essays on the
Extropian Principles (first chapter maybe).

 IAN: Why is reality fuzzy? It is what it is. Reality is reality.
 Our concepts (such as the photon should go through slit 1 or 2) 
 seek to model reality, however, reality does not seek to model 
 our concepts. Therefore, the physical reality is the "winner" 
 in the contest over which is 100% truth. The fuzziness lies
 in the mismatch between concepts and the physical reality.
 If the photon goes through both slits, that is 100% true.

Actually Alex there are quite a few Cypherpunks on this list. I've
been using PGP since the 1.0 "bassmaster" edition. There's no real
reason to use it on an open list, besides since anyone can
subscribe, anyone would have access to the keys....

But it's always good to spread the word.....

PGP was legally exported months ago, taking advantage of a loophole
in the law, the sourcecode was printed out, then legally
transported out of the country and keyboarded in elsewhere. Export
restriction bypassed......

Yes. We've been discussing such a way for some time, but nothing much has come
of it due to a lack of volunteer help. The idea is NodeNet--a group of special
purpose email lists run by Extropy Institute.

The idea is to supplement the Extropians-Open and Extropians-Select lists with
a number of lists devoted to focused discussion of one area of interest. The
NodeMaster of each node or list would choose who may post to the list. The
lists would not be moderated in the usual sense (so the NodeMaster's workload
is small), but only persons considered qualified by the NodeMaster would be
able to post. Anyone else would be able to read but not post. However, those
not able to post could send a message to either the NodeMaster or anyone able
to post, and it would be up to the latter to decide whether to forward it to
the list.

The advantages of this system are:
--Focused discussion of particular topic areas
--Postings only by qualified persons
--Minimum administration
--Complements the more general lists, Extropians-Open and Extropians-Select

Some possible NodeNet lists:

Advanced Computation (quantum computing, nanocomputers)
Applied Ethics (esp. bioethics)
Approaches to Artificial Intelligence
Economic Effects of Technology
Entrepreneurs Forum
Environment
Epistemology
Extropic Art
Future Forecasting
Information Management
Intelligence Augmentation
Law
Life Extension-Practical
Life Extension-Consequences
Memetics
Nanotechnology
Neural-Computer Interfaces
Physics Frontiers
Singularity
Space Systems
Truth Machines

If you are interested in acting as NodeMaster for one of these lists (or any
other topic area), please let me know. We're looking for potential NodeMasters
with strong expertise in the area. What counts as "strong expertise" will vary
depending on the topic, as will what qualifies subscribers for each list.

Onward!

Same old same old tragic misunderstanding.  It's truly amazing how people
*just can't get their heads around this crucial point*.  Even assuming that
the nexus between jobs and income is bound to remain unchanged - an
absurdity, given increased cybernation and eventually virtually cost-free
nano minting of most consumables - commentators somehow seem stuck with the
notion that if we *now* go on the pension at 60 or 65 because we are
wearing out, we will *always* do so *at that age*, even if we are then in
the prime of extended-longevity middle age.  Note the mournful `our final
days', which has just a moment earlier been postulated as an additional 40
percent of mid-life healthy lifespan.  

We're going to have to work *hard* on this default meme, team.

It seems that the health-supplement banners
going for a quick ban. Here's a clip from a 
message from John Hammell <jham@iahf.com> 
of International Advocates for Health 
Freedom (http://www.iahf.com):


-------forwarded message------------

Supplement Consumers World Wide: PLEASE pay VERY close attention to the US
FDA's BAN on Cholestin, a dietary supplement derived from Chinese red rice
yeast which effectively lowers cholesterol. 

Cholestin is manufactured by a company called Pharmanex. Pharmaceutical
Giant MERCK has lobbied the FDA arguing that the product is a "drug"
because it contains a naturally occurring substance that is similar to, but
distinct from the drug lovastatin (which is marketed by Merck as
"Mevacor.") (In addition to the substance which is similar to lovastatin,
the red rice yeast also contains nine other active ingredients which
undoubtedly make it synergistically much SAFER than Mevacor.) 

Long time foe of the dietary supplement industry Bruce Silverglade of so
called "Center for Science in the Public Interest" (an inside the beltway
shill group for pharmaceutical interests) was quoted in the May 21st
Washington Post as saying "What this case stands for is the proposition
that just because a substance occurs naturally in the food supply doesn't
necessarily make it a dietary supplement." "The distinction is important"
says Silverglade. "Products like lovastatin treat dangerous conditions that
should be monitored by medical professionals" says Silverglade.

(When Silverglade makes THIS kind of statement, we had BETTER be ON GUARD!
This guy has a LONG history of attacking dietary supplements as a stooge
for the FDA, and he is ALWAYS widely quoted by the mass media. I've been
battling Silverglade and so called "Center for Science in the Public
Interest" since 1989, and have always thought they had a particularly
Orwellian name.)

Bill McGlashon, president of Pharmanex told the Washington Times that the
FDA is doing the bidding of the pharmaceutical industry, and in particular
lovastatin maker Merck, which has been asking the FDA to take action. "The
reason this whole thing began is because of Merck. Its REAL CLEAR what 
this is about," McGlashan said.

More to the point, if asked the question "which slot WILL the particle go 
through", there are also four possible answers.  And no matter which answer 
you give, it is very easy to devise two experiments - one guaranteed to prove 
you predicted correctly, and the other guaranteed to prove you predicted 
incorrectly, provided only that ONLY ONE of these two experiments is carried 
out.

I know, Damien.  I was nonplussed by the author's *stuckness* as well.  As
if it's actually a bad idea to work on life extension until all the
potential social bugs are worked out.   Meanwhile, irretrievable (I think)

every hour.  Is it going to take a *proven* process for significant (40-50
years) life extension before the *default* meme you refer to will even start
to be replaced?

I suspect that this meme won't be as hard to overcome as you seem to
believe, and as stated in the original media story, it may actually just be
the reporter's reasonable hedge against disappointment. After all, we here
in the US now enjoy an average lifespan nearly half again as long as our
great grand-parents did a century ago and yet we don't have any kind of
"Logan's Run"-like disbelief that only the rare individual might live
happily and healthily into his eighth decade or older, as was surely the
case in 1898. Quite the opposite, especially now, with large numbers of
people from the Baby-boom cadre approaching "senior citizen" status, I
think we are seeing a continuing shift of the media's image of older
Americans as active, healthy, alive individuals, as opposed to wizened old
prunes waiting to die. The two images, representing our fears and our
hopes, do constant battle. But the age of 'old-age' seems to keep racheting
up.

I suspect that the Average Joe and Jane's expectations about "reasonable"
life span will closely track the lifespan available to them. The challenge
to Extropians is to be ahead of that swell of general knowledge - we're
trying to surf that future-wave, not content to be dragged along as flotsam
by the inevitable current of progress or deposited on the bottom as
detritus by the turbulence of change.

Hang twelve baby!

	Glad to hear it. I didn't meen to imply that no one here uses PGP. 
PGP can be useful on an open list to confirm the sender's identity via
signature.  Otherwise, anyone can log into the server's SMTP port and send
out fake mail masquerading as that sender... and that's the moderately
knowlegeable hacker. The newbie hacker will just configure
Netscape/IE/Eudora/Outlook with a fake originating address and voila! I'm
years from being important enough to impersonate, but I figure I'll start
covering my butt early.
	In any case, people should seriously consider PGP regardless of
what list they're on, regardless of whether they are an industrial spy or
a school teacher. By their very nature, threats to one's privacy are hard
to predict. After all, one doesn't lock one's door only on nights when one
is expecting to be robbed, right? 
	I know the above ideas are old hat to the Cypherpunks on the list;
I'm going into this because, as you put it,

	Yup, and the beauty of it is, it's not a loophole they can close
without repealing or crippling the first ammendment. Here's the rub,
though: whether or not other countries already have PGP, it's _still_
illegal to export it from the United States in digital form. These guys
just don't know when to give up! 
	By the way, did they actually compile it yet? Are there sites
outside the US where PGP can now be downloaded legally?

	While we're on the subject... is there anyone out there who uses
Pine as their email client? It took me a while to come up with a
convenient way to integrate PGP with pine, and I want to save other people
the hassle. Contact me individually if you want the scripts.

I think its a valuable idea. Id like to suggest that the editors of the
book might consider publishing the essays in the book after first
sumbitting them to several peer reviewers. For instance, the Max Moore's
paper on PCR makes all sense to me, and I think a similar one should be
included in a book like that, but it could be prudent to first send it to
several philosophers, and whose field is epistemology at that.. Its just an
example, I dont think anybody would find anything wrong with that
particular paper, its just no other essay comes to my mind right now. At
worst, such process helps just polishing the style, at best, to pinpoint
any bugs which might be there.

Maybe it should be "autocatalysing the future"... not that it is

If you don't have any NodeMasters already, I would like to volunteer for

The observations are certainly true and they are consistent in the sense that 
they are repeatable, but they are not consistent with the way our everyday 
macro world seems to operate nor are they consistent with the classical laws 
of logic as Aristotle understood them.

Like an exasperated parent trying to answer the questions of a very 
intelligent but overly curious child, nature tells us that it's foolish to 
ask if an atom went through one slot or two, but it can't tell us exactly why 
it's foolish. I think if the question really is silly it's because even 
nature doesn't know the answer.
             

        >If the photon goes through both slits, that is 100% true.
             

Saying the particle went through both slits is no better than any of the 
other 3 possible answers. One quality truth is supposed to have is 
immutability, yet I can change what was true. Even though the photon passed 
the barrier with the slots in it 10 years ago I can manipulate the truth 
about what happened then and I can to it right now, it all depends on how I
set up my detecting  equipment. I can make whatever you want to be "true" 
10 years ago. If you want me to make it true that a photon went through one 
slit or both slits back in 1988 just tell me which you prefer and I'll make 
it happen.

This is an irritatingly common misperception.  How does something being
"natural" make it chemically any safer than synthetically manufactured
drugs?  Also how does having 10 active ingredients make something safer (as
opposed to one), when the opposite should generally be true?  Not to
mention that "synergistically much safer" is a lot of meaningless hand-waving.

While I disagree with the FDA action in principle, this particular post
panders to the sensibilities of New Age types and irritates mine.

In 1897 the Indiana house of representatives unanimously passed a bill (#246) 
that would change the value of PI from 3.14159... to 16 divided by the cube 
root of 3 or 9.2376. The bill was defeated in the state senate by one vote, 
good thing too because not only is it wrong it's blasphemous, according to 
the Bible Pi is exactly equal to 3.

In 1 Kings chapter 23 and again in 2 Chronicles chapter 4 it says.

  "Also, he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in    
   compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty cubits

I support a peer review process for journal publication, but not for 
compiled anthologies.  Many anthologies contain articles that have been 
previously published in journals, and thereby subjected to a review 
process.  But some of the most outstanding anthologies I have read 
contain material that it would be awkward to impose that sort of 
process on.  How do you peer review a poem?  A personal essay?  

One of my favorite anthologies, Bi Any Other Name, began as a personal 
project by two people who wanted to see certain material published that 
other publications were rejecting because it was too 'radical' (sound 
familiar?)  The two editors saw the quality of this work when no one 
else did, and the result was a groundbreaking book that did not sell 
well at first but has now become the 'bible of bi-ness' and is included 
in many academic curricula.

Sin,
Kathryn Aegis

It doesn't explain much, but still, it's a mention.

There is also a survey there - maybe if you all go and fill it, it will convince them
that there is considerable public interest and people are sympathetic to the idea...

  IAN: I was also puzzled by the logic implied in the
  statement that because it has more chemical agents 
  and because they act together, it is safer. Not 
  logical. But I suspect that rice yeast is safer 
  than Mavcor, albeit not for the reasons cited.

  But the big issue here revolves around the 
  defining of X as a "drug" and the subsequent 
  and automatic ideation that if X = drug then
  X must be controlled by the federal Govt.

  To concede that to be true is to loose the 
  case for individual liberty automatically,
  for the road to serfdom is then a semantics
  game of saying "If Y is a drug and is Z has
  effects like Y, then Z is also a drug, and 
  thus the Government gets to control Z/you."

This is an old misconception stemming from the time when accurate
chemical analysis was not available.  In the early days, nutrients were
detected by their biological activity in culture, and not by their
chemical composition.  Thus, different sources of a nutrient were
compared, even though they were different substances.

"Natural" vitamin A was actually beta-carotene, which is virtually
nontoxic.  "Synthetic" vitamin A was actually retinol which is toxic in
high amounts.  The "natural" version was obviously superior to the
"synthetic" version, but only because it was a different chemical
substance.

"Natural" water contains healthful minerals, whereas "synthetic" water
(distilled water) lacks these.  Obviously, "synthetic" water did not
include the mineral nutrients.  Obviously, differring ingredients are
being compared.

"Natural" vitamin D3 is nontoxic and occurs in small amounts in foods. 
"Synthetic" vitamin D2 is made by irradiating milk.  This form of
vitamin D can be toxic in high amounts.  Again, different chemicals are
being compared.

"Natural" vitamin C contains bioflavinoids and many cofactors that help
the nutrient, and also is often acid-buffered in foods.  "Synthetic"
vitamin C is pure ascorbic acid, which lacks the other nutrients, and
often its acidity can cause gastric distress.  Of course, different
chemical forms act differently.

Many times when people refer to "natural" versus "synthetic", they are
not comparing the same chemical substances.  Often, they are comparing
different forms.  The "natural" forms often have various foods,
cofactors, pH buffering, that provide different affects than is found
with a single, pure nutrient.  All chemical function is based on
chemical content.  The same substance will always act the same,
regardless of its source.  Differing substances or mixtures will act
differently, each according to its ingredient list.

Got it.  Thanks.

Has anyone looked at the results poll?  The majority wants to be around in
2200, yet only a minority would be cryonically frozen after death even
if financing it wasn't an issue.  What other option is there to live to
the year 2200 *after you've died*???  Maybe the public just needs to be
better educated... when's Halperin's miniseries going to be aired?

Also interesting is that all the names I saw were extropians: Robin
Hanson, Ralph Merckle, and Kennita Watson.  These people were classified
as "nerds."  Is that a fair classification?   From just reading the
contributions of these 3 extropians, "nerd" is not a word that pops into
my mind.  I always think of a nerd as someone who spends their time
exercising their mind at the expense of their body-- a pretty unextropian
thing to do if you ask me... hardly a good path to physical immortality.  

I remember Anders Sandberg classifying himself as a nerd.  Why was that?

Another point mentioned by the writer is that of the 26 people he found
signed up for cryonics, only 1 was female... is that a representative
figure? Does anyone have Alcor stats to support this gender gap?

A recommend extropians take the poll and skew their results-- maybe that
will alter the tone of articles like this one, where cryonicists and
physical immortalists are treated as a bizarre and insignificant fringe,
and good fodder for silly jokes about a post-apocalyptic Planet of the
Nerds.

Geoff.

  Nope, that's not it.  In QED, photons can travel faster or slower than 
  'c' in a full vacuum.  In the ballistic theory, the photons are emitted 
  and absorbed by the electrons of the transparent medium at 'c' relative 
  to the atoms in the medium.
  
    The 'gravitational slowing' you discuss is explained 
  by the ballistic theory of light in the ordinary classical-mechanical 
  way.  SR/GR have to assert that dimensionality is affected by gravity, 
  so that the photons are still travelling at 'c' but (somehow) space and 
  time are altered so this means they don't get very far.  I have never 
  seen a good explanation of this -- alleged -- process.

         You completely miss the point.  The only reason to have red and 
         blue photons is to colour-differentiate them for ease of

     Black Holes are implicit in Newtonian gravitation with a ballistic 
     ('corpuscular') theory of light.  If the velocity of emission of 
     light-particles is less than the escape velocity of the emitting 
     body, the light-particle cannot escape the gravitational field and 
     will eventually fall back.
     
       The calculations are fairly simple.  Once we had Newton's 
     gravitational theory and <inter alia> Roehmer's measurement of 
     lightspeed by astronomical observation the calculation of the 
     Schwartzchild radius etc. is fairly easy.  Everything's a whole lot 
     simpler with ballistic theory, remember.  We've had great 
     mathematical tools for centuries.

    Funny, then, that we can model matter so accurately with classical 
    mechanics (Car-Parrinello Method) that we can _calculate_ (say) the 
    melting-point of silicon.  You have to get your head around the fact 
    that the same physical phenomena can be explained by indefinitely many 
    different theories, as Leibnitz showed.  The photo-electric effect 
    preceded Einstein & Lenard's [1905].  Why do you think it's impossible 
    to come up with an auxilliary theory (even an ad hoc theory...) to 
    enable us to calculate tunnelling using classical mechanics?  All QM 
    is, is a statistically-based approximation method.
    

> Likewise,  lasers cannot function purely by classical mechanics.

    Absolutely, they can (leaving aside the loose language).  The 
    mechanics of electron orbits, and of absorption and emission of 
    light-particles (photons) are all in my RM paper.  You simply don't 
    understand how far-reaching and powerful Classical Mechanics is as a 
    system.  What is it about lasers you think we can't explain?

> Nor can polarizing filters on cameras.

   Simple: the light-particles spin (on up to 3 orthogonal axes).

> the electroluminescent lamp cannot function by classical mechanics

   A classical model of the atom (based on Bohr's baroque neo-classical 
   [1913] model) explains photon emission perfectly well -- RM explains it 
   even better.

> nuclear fission cannot be described by classical mechanics.

   Of course it can -- go look up 'packing fractions.'  All energy is 
   kinetic or potential.  Bound particles have potential energy.  Orbiting 
   particles have kinetic energy.
   
> the quantum tunneling microscope cannot function by classical mechanics.

    Again, you're missing the point.  The effect is not dependent on the 
    theory.  And I asked for six examples relating to SR/GR, by the way, 
    not QM.

> Ok, thats six, now where is my money?

  Not-OK!  Not six!  No cigar.  See above.

The URL is correct. I'll bet that you got hosed by the line break in Sasha's 
message (so that by clicking or cutting and pasting, your URL didn't include 
the "rozen_.htm" on the end).

I did read the article. What a piece of crap. He got quite a number of facts
wrong, and didn't appear interested in surfing beyond the couple of web pages
he looked at. What's more, he didn't even get the info right on the few pages
he did look at.  (E.g., his sample survey of cryonicists consisted entirely
of Ralph Merkle's links to home pages of some (26) fellow cryonicists. He 
claims 25 of them are male, citing Kennita as the only female. I can only 
assume that he didn't follow the links, since he missed Ailing Freeman, 
Chris Peterson, and Terry Stanley, females all).

I'm probably going to send him an email message. Hopefully, I can muster
enough
diplomacy that he'll consider printing corrections.

I am interested in getting information about the Oceana project that
ceased a while back.  It was, as I recall, intended as the start of a
libertarian country.  While the project failed financially, I am
interested in contacting the person involved.  Does anybody know who he
is and/or how that can be done?

Related to that question is this:  Are there any legal constraints on
what US citizens can build in international waters (I guess I would
prefer to call them anational waters)?  For example, are there any UN
treaties to which the US is a signatory that preclude US citizens from
building in anational waters?

Er, by this do you mean that you think that truth and falsehood CAN be

I presume you are referring to the notion that the photon can "pass
through the left slot" and not "pass through the left slot" at the same
time.  In this case, I want to assert again that this question is
gibberish from the perspective of quantum physics.  That it disagrees with
the macro world as described by Newton is isn't really relevant to this
point.

Yes!  I even voted.  I actually think online polls are an interesting

not scientific, but still... people can't help looking at those things

After you've died, probably none (though not necessarily -- the
"Universal Immortalists" think we'll eventually be able to revive
anyone who's ever lived). But that particular question wasn't
specifically saying "after you've died". I think it is quite possible
that many of us will get there simply by gaining access to good life
extension technology in the next few decades.

Well, Ralph's list (from www.merkle.com) lists only extropians, as far
as I can tell. The guy seemed to get almost all his info from Merkle's
page (not that he did a good job even at that... more on this below).

"Nerd" and "Geek" have both undergone serious makeovers in the past
decade. I think they both used to be pure pejoratives, but now many
wear the labels with pride. Intelligence, education, and technical
sophistication are sexier than ever.

And many folks in the extropian community are striving to add even
more to these connotations. We are the Uber-Nerds! Wanna hack some
code? Let's go! Wanna analyze the latest findings on the frontiers of
physics? We're down? Wanna pump some iron and knock out some pushups?
You betcha!

What can't we do? Of what are we not capable?

I ask you!

Not representative at all, not even representative of Merkle's sample
of 26. On that list, the guy missed Ailing Freeman, Terry Stanley, and
Chris Peterson, dynamic fem-geeks all, and quite representative of the
kind of babes you can find within our community.

This is not say that we're swimming with females in the cryonics and
extropian communities, but the ratio isn't as bad as it used to be. In
Alcor, I believe the ratio is something like 33/67 female/male. Max
might have figures for ExI.

The real problem, of course, is that so many of them are already
spoken for, romantically speaking. But if its just the female touch
you're looking for, it is all around us, and it is MARVELOUS!

I agree.

I wrote an email to the author of the piece (and copied it to the
letters to the editor email address). Leaving aside the tone of the
article, he got a number of facts just plain wrong, even just in
regard to his reading of Merkle's page. Never mind that a little
research on other pages would have given him a much better view of the
real cryonics community. (We're not all in California, we're not all
nerds, and a good deal more than 1/26 of us are female.) It will be
interesting to see whether a correction is printed.

Tony, really, this is village idiot level.

        a + b
    _________

               ab
      1 +  ____
               c^2

When a and b are c, the combined velocities are c.

Another way to look at it is to say that the photons experience no elapsed
time from emission to absorption, hence the distance they cross is
effectively zero.

Is this so hard to grasp?

I wouldn't characterize the project as "failed" just yet, though it
is certainly on hold.  I'm still around and easy to reach, and I can
get you in touch with Eric if you'd like (though I don't know if he'd
like his email address posted publicly).

  From what I understand, higher frequency light travels a longer 
path than lower frequency light due to the necessity of bouncing from 
center to circumference and back more times per distance (shorter 
wavelength = more waves per distance).  If you could pull the 3-d 
sine curves out into a straight line, the distance traversed per time 
unit would be the same; however, taking the curved distance involved 
in wave travel into account, higher frequencies will travel a bit 
slower.

I *did* e-mail him and expressed my strong disappointment with his shoddy
reporting and with the flippant and sarcastic tone he used throughout the
article.  Inaccurate and misleading articles like this are a disservice to
the reading public, and I wanted him to know it.

As for the survey, I was actually pleasantly surprised to see that almost
half of those responding indicated that they *would* be willing to be
cryonically preserved if the funds were available, and that about half would
place their trust in the cryonics firm to revive them.  That's a *much*
larger percentage than I think most hard-core cryonicists would have
expected.

I am hoping to design and conduct a more comprehensive survey in the late
summer, perhaps, assessing the publics familiarity with and their attitudes
towards cryonics.  I hope to identify the most common misconceptions and the
relative strength of various persuaders / dissuaders.  More when I am
further along.

I love this list!

I just received this exciting news from The First Millennial Foundation
(FMF):

------------------------------------------------------------
From: Phil Kopitske <kopit002@maroon.tc.umn.edu>

Hi everybody!

I just got off the phone with Robert Nicholson of Sea Solar
Power in York, PA.  I called him to invite him to speak at
our conclave on Saturday August 1st.  He agreed to give a
talk covering the design of the SSP 10 MW shore-based OTEC,
and the progress that SSP has made in lining up $40 Million
in venture capital to build the plant and to get an actual
contract for what will be the first commercial closed cycle
OTEC.

I want all you engineers and long-suffering members out there
to seriously consider attending the conclave, because SSP HAS
JUST GOTTEN A CONTRACT TO BUILD THEIR FIRST 10 MW OTEC!  This is
earth-shattering news because THE FMF HAS BEEN INVITED TO
WORK WITH SSP TO BUILD AND STAFF THE COMMERCIAL MARICULTURE and AQUAPONICS
FACILITIES THAT WILL ACCOMPANY THIS 10 MW OTEC!

I cannot overstate the significance of this first contract
for a commercial OTEC, nor can I overstate the importance
of the FMF working with SSP to do the ground breaking
research on mariculture and aquaculture using this OTEC's
discharge waters.  There will be many orders for shore-based
and then for larger floating OTECs once the commercial
viability of this OTEC has been demonstrated to the venture
capital community, and we can get into the OTEC game on the
ground floor by helping SSP to design and build the mariculture
and aquaponics facilities associated with their OTEC.

An even more exciting prospect is a second contract that
SSP is negotiating, where an uninhabited island with no
infrastructure whatsoever will be getting a $500 Million
dollar cruise ship pier, with attendant OTEC power and
fresh water production to be provided by SSP.  We have
here a perfect location for Aquarius Rising, where the
land will be either free or very inexpensive, where there
will be a continuous supply of cruise ship tourists, and
where our entire business plan for AR can be implemented
without the compications of an existing politicised
population base that raises barriers to new projects.

Bob wants the help of the FMF in coming up with the mariculture
and aquaponics facilities plans, and SSP ALREADY HAS THE
VENTURE CAPITAL TO BUILD THESE ON-SHORE AND NEAR-SHORE
FACILITIES.  Basically, the OTEC component of the business
plan for AR has become the SSP 10 MW shore-based OTEC with
its 300,000 gallon per day fresh water production facility
(via a first stage hybrid open cycle system).  The sub-sea
habitat, water bottling facility, pavillion, hotels, sub
tours, etc. can all be built as planned, and FMF MEMBERS
can help build and run these facilities!

This is going to be a pivital conclave, where we the FMF
transition from TALKING to DOING, so get to Denver any way
you can folks.

They are hosting their annual conclave (conference) in Denver this year
around the first of August.  For details please contact Phil above.

Are you sure about this?  The most authoritative version I have heard (which I 
acknowledge that I have not confirmed) is that the state was offered high-school 
math textbooks at a steep discount, provided that they enact into law a certain 
bill containing a bunch of mathematical language; analysis much later 
determined that the bill would have made pi legally equal to some unlikely value 
(5, I think);

but the rules committee of one house of the state legislature, finding the bill 
hard to penetrate and being unsure of what they would find within it, referred it 
to their Committee on Swamps.  (Even legislatures do something intelligent 
once in a while.)

And there it died.

[Technical data comms stuff in the middle. Extropian conclusions
at the end.]

This announcement is really hard to evaluate. As far as I can tell
after carefully reading their extensive press release, 
   http://www.sprint.com
they are announcing an amalgamation of several different technologies.
I can't tell for sure, but it looks like a "spraypaint integration"
(i.e., don't really change anything in several separate products,
just repaint then all the same color.) The internal hi-speed Sprint
network will apparently be IP over ATM and voice over ATM. The
high-speed lines to big busnesses will apparantly be ATM over SONET,
with IP over the ATM and voice over ATM(?) The high-speed local loops
for small business and consumers will apparently be xDSL, which is
currently specified to use ATM. The local loops are an interesting story.
They run on copper wire that belong to the local phone company, but
recent regulations require the phone company to permit competitors to
install gear at the telco central offices to interface the local loops.
A few small companies have succeeded in getting past the telcos' delaying
tactics and actually installing gear, but Sprint is likely to get tied
up forever in arcane disputes, so don't expect to see it in your house
any time soon. Among other things, many new local loops don't go all the
way from your house to the central office, but instead terminate in a
pylon in your neighborhood, with the voice converted to PCM on a fiber.
Thus, a competitor's switch in the CO cannot connect directly to your local
loop anyway.

OK then, what's the REAL meaning of this announcement? I think the real
meaning is that Sprint has invested heavily in ATM and is now panicing
because ATM may become obsolete before it really gets used much. In
particular, AT&T recently announced that their vision of the future is
to run naitve IP directly on the fiber, removing the SONET and ATM layers.
voice will then run over IP. This is a data net with a voice overlay,
instead of the current voice-oriented (i.e., TDM, constant bit rate) net
with a data overlay.) One piece of evidence that Sprint paniced is that
their entire multi-page announcement never once mentions ATM.

What does all this mean? Well, it means that the future is arriving
at a rate that large companies have trouble dealing with. The distributed
IP protocol, with its distributed quasi-informal standards organization,
has triumphed over the more centralized, top-down standards promulgations
of the ITU and even over the industry-driven ATM forum. Furthermore, the
fundamental driving assumption of ATM (that IP-style switching is too
CPU-intensive to compete.) has been decisively refuted, even though the
analysis was forward-looking and relatively recent. It also means that
we may have to add AT&T and cisco to the short list of companies (Microsoft,
Intel) that utterly dominate a major high-tech area.

Let me add to my list of suggestions:
- Investing and Money Management
- Action Requests (pointers to online surveys, e-mail campaigns,
letterwriting campaigns, etc.)
- Basics (a place to discuss basic beliefs so they can be excluded from
other nodes!)
- Polling Forum (for surveying Extropians' on questions, although a
survey webpage might be better)
- ExI Announcements (for official ExI information)
- ExI Member Announcements (for members to their promote web pages,
books, businesses, requests for jobs, public appearances, galleries,
projects, etc.)
- Rejected Posts (some lists have a seperate list that rejected posts
are sent to, thus no one is "censored" or posts "suppressed", but the
posts don't affect the signal/noise ratio of the intended list.)

		N O D E M A S T E R S  W A N T E D !


For those of you considering applying for the position of NodeMaster for
one of the possible new forums (and for everyone who may subscribe to any
of them), here is how it will work:

The NodeNet forums each focus on one topic area of interest to Extropians.

Subscription will be open only to Extropy Institute members (except
sometimes for specially invited experts). 

Most subscribers will be able to read the lists, but not post directly (the
Observers).

Those unable to post directly will be able to send their questions or
comments to either the NodeMaster or a posting subscriber (Participants).

The NodeMaster invites experts to participate, and grants or denys the
status of Participant to applicants.


The intended result of the NodeNet structure is to create forums intensely
focused on particular topics, while lightly restricting posting ability to
enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, while allowing the filtered input of ideas
from non-postering subscribers, and to do all this without burdening the
NodeMaster with the time-consuming task of moderating every message. 

Applications for NodeMaster positions are best directed towards those
forums in which you have qualifications (what kind of qualifications are
relevant or desirable will vary), and a particular enthusiasm. A general
requirement is an ability to say "sorry, you can be an Observer but not a
Participant)" when this deemed appropriate to maintain high standards of
discussion.

If you fit the bill, I would be delighted to hear from you. The more
potential NodeMasters we have, the better the NodeNet forum will enhance
the Extropian/Transhumanist community.

Onward!

Max

P.S. I'm also posting this message to the Transhumans list, since not all
subscribers to that list will see it on Extropians. (If you're on the
Transhuman list, please reply directly as I recented unsubbed.)

I remember discussing the outlines of this with Greg Burch in a London pub,
two years ago, in the context of how ExI might place itself within the
global scientific and economic community. That discussion thought of these
nodes as being limited in their membership to invited (or at least
'vetted') specialists, and hence carving out a niche for ExI as a global
facilitator of scientific networking and propagation. In that light, two
things occur to me. First, are these lists to retain the exclusivity which
might serve ExI best in the long run, by establishing its credentials as a
world-class organization, or are they to be open to all, hence increasing
publicity, but, more than likely, deterring the specifically
scientific/economic professional community from using the nodes as a
'trading' place? Second, with multiple, highly-specific nodes, how is ExI
to ensure that 'cross-pollenation' of ideas occurs effectively?

Put another way, is ExI a network for the discussion of popularized, though
sometimes innovative ideas, open to all, or is it to be a community of
multi-disciplinary thinkers, with a proven track-record of academic and
commercial success? Both roles are necessary in the world, but I can't help
thinking that ExI would serve its members more effectively in the
achievement of their goals, rather than the mere discussion of those goals,
if it were to become the latter type of organization.

One final way of considering this question: what form of organization does
ExI need to be in order to create the future, rather than merely comment on
it?

If you really want to "cheat' you can also yourself cast as many votes as
you want. Which (of course :-) I actually did, to test the size of the
sample (which was about 200 at that time).

When lists such as these are open to individuals who are aiming at truth,
they do well.  When they are open to individuals who are aiming at power,
they stink.  Credentialism per se is a destructive force because ideas are
rejected for vanity and not logic.  The signal-to-noise ratio in nature is
minute, only what grabs our attention at the moment produces signals, and
the s/n ratio on the lists is completely dependent on contributors' flights
of fancy.  The s/n cannot be managed any more than an economy can be
planned.  Only obvious relativists/compostmodernists need be booted from
contributing as being incapable of seriousness or coherency.

<Second, with multiple, highly-specific nodes, how is ExI to ensure that
'cross-pollenation' of ideas occurs effectively?>

They must all be in the same garden, the ExI agora, if you will.  I can't
express how important it is to discuss esoteric ideas in the vernacular,
and resist the temptation to use specialist language.  So often, I find
that very disparate disciplines are really discussing the same objective
phenomena, only you have to wade through specialist sludge interminably
before you find the commonalities.

<Put another way, is ExI a network for the discussion of popularized,
though sometimes innovative ideas, open to all, or is it to be a community
of multi-disciplinary thinkers, with a proven track-record of academic and

'Academic success' is an oxymoron.  :)

Only money counts, ask anyone, even the ivory-tower herd.  ExI obviously
has a single, solitary mission, namely, to increase extropy.  The lists
should keep this in mind, fostering exropic ideas, both through innovation
and propagation, and critiquing entropic ideas that lead either to nihilism
or dogmatism.  Offense and defense, always with an eye on the goal, the
competitors and the time-clock.  If you sit around filtering out everyone
without proven track-records and credentials, you have cut off the
creators, the visionaries, and the innovators.  You slide into smugness.

<One final way of considering this question: what form of organization does

it?>

It needs a whole boat-load of money.  Money, money, money and more money to
have direct or brute power.  Lacking gobs of money, commenting
intelligently exerts quite substantial indirect or influential power.

This may not be new "news" but I thought it was interesting nonetheless. It was in the May 28, 1998 edition of Computergram International.

TITLE: Australia Comes Out of the Nano-Lab

BODY: An Australian professor believes he could have a minute quantum computer out of the laboratories and into the real world within ten years. Nanotechnology, that rarified field of technological discovery most commonly associated with miniaturization, has thr own up the possibility of computers tiny enough to fit on the tip of a strand of human hair. Bruce Kane, research associate at the University of New South Wales' School of Physics, has recently published a plan for the creation of a quantum computer built from atom-sized silicon devices in the UK's Nature science journal. He believes the microscopic computers could be out of the laboratory and into the real world within ten years. One of the key applications foreseen for the devices is codebreaking. The publication of Kane's paper is a coup for the University's fledgling Nanofabrication facility, which is working with other Australian universities and the University of California on the development of the nano-device.

Most of the information I got from Petr Beckmann's book "A History Of Pi", 
the rest I got from an old Scientific American Column by Martin Gardner. 
After passing the Indiana house of representatives unanimously, the state 
senate killed the bill by voting on Feb 12 1897 to send it to the Committee 
on Swamps (a symbolic place I think) for future consideration.  Fortunately
the future never happened. The Hero of the story is  C A Waldo, a 
mathematician at Purdue who heard about this crazy bill and was astounded 
that it passed the House, he waged a frantic campaign to educate the senators 
and he was successful, but just barely.

        Thank you, Damien.
        

        What I find so hard to explain is why anyone should have problems 
        with what is essentially a profoundly _uncomplicated_ physics:
        
      [1] Classical Mechanics (the foundation of physics):
     
      [2] Faradayan Electric and Magnetic and Gravitational Forces 
        propagated with time delays (as Leigh Page showed [1912] and 
        [1914] these reduce to Maxwell's equations relative to the 
        force-emitting bodies).

      [3]  A Ballistic Theory of Light whereby photons-with-mass are 
        emitted at 'c' relative to the emitting body.


      My basic claim is that -- if you do a little bit of work -- you can 
      deal with any physics problem above the nuclear scale (we're working 
      on extending it into the nuclear realm).  Everything becomes so much 
      more straight-forward, and -- on a balance-sheet basis -- the gains 
      vastly exceed the losses.  In addition, there are are no 'six 
      impossible things before breakfast' to believe.
      
      The whole thing can be laid out on a single sheet of A4 paper.

      And it can be easily simulated on a computer.  The program does not 
      break down with paradoxes and contradictions.  It's my guess we have 
      this program directly encoded into our brain at a tacit level.
      
  
      There's a wonderful sense of clarity and intellectual power.


      And there's a _political_ edge to all this  -- particle theories are 
      favoured by individualists, whilst wave theories are preferred by 
      collectivists (Cf: Danah Zohar, 'The Quantum Self.').
      
      
      Regards,
      
      Tony

I thought this was already on the list, but I see it isn't. I'll definitely
add it.

Probably a good idea, if the NodeNet is to include more than academic
discussions.

The "basics" can be discussed on this list (which will become
Extropians-Open). I don't think a special list for it would be useful,
since most people needed to ask about the basics will not be in the NodeNet
forums, but will most likely be on the Extropians-Open list.

>- Polling Forum (for surveying Extropians' on questions, although a

I don't expect us to do a lot of polling. If we need to do ExI-related
polling, we can do that on the Extropians-Select list.

>- ExI Announcements (for official ExI information)

That's a good idea. Some members may not want to subscribe even to
Extropians-Select if they are restricting their volume of mail. A very-low
traffic Announcement list would let them get quick updates.

>- ExI Member Announcements (for members to their promote web pages,
>books, businesses, requests for jobs, public appearances, galleries,

We were considering a web page for this, but an announcement list would be
much easier to maintain. However, I'm not sure whether a separate list is
needed, or whether this can be part of the function of the
Extropians-Select list. What do others think?

Thanks for your suggestions.

Sarah: A slightly belated "welcome back" to the list. I've missed your
contributions.

Let me note here, for those of you who don't know, that the NodeNet grew
out of an idea that was originally Sarah's a couple of years ago. Sarah
discussed her idea with Greg Burch while he was in England, then Greg went
on to refine the idea. We have now simplified the workings in order to make
it feasible to actually get it implemented.

My own perspective on this is that the NodeNet forums should incorporate a
reasonable degree of exclusivity. We do indeed want to build a strong
reputation for ExI. The lists will not be open to all. They will be
restricted to ExI members, and only those applying members whom each
NodeMaster deems appropriate or qualified for a forum. However, to address
Reilly's concern, the criteria of "qualified" will vary for each list. Even
if desirable (and I agree it is not), qualifications need not be academic
degrees. (Requiring higher -- or any -- degree in relevant fields, given
the size of ExI's membership, would guarantee very little participation!) 

For highly technical forums, we probably want to be more restrictive in
allowing members to be posting-enabled Participants. Here, either a formal
background in the topic, or demonstrated knowledge in writings, previous
email list postings, etc. would count. For other forums, especially highly
cross-disciplinary ones, or more practically focused ones, the default
might be that all applicants can be participants, with the NodeMaster
merely screening out those who have shown little substantive imput in the
past.

I will work with each NodeMaster on setting out both a mission statement
and qualification filters for each forum. I hope we will also continue to
discuss it here (or on the Extropians-Select list once that's up).

>Second, with multiple, highly-specific nodes, how is ExI

That's the job of the Extropians-Select and Extropians-Open lists, as well
as publications in Extropy Online, and conversations at local events and
EXTRO conferences.

Onward!

 IAN: By 100%. Fuzzy logic measures a mismatch

 "the cup is full" but it is only 70% full,
 then there is a 30% mismatch = 30% false.

  IAN: Then that's the truth, by 100%. The photon 
  is at zero time, so it's both at here/now and
  the point it was 10-years ago. That's the truth.
  I don't believe reality contains a falsehood.

Ready to have an intelligent conversation with your computer? Programs with
personality could become the backbone of the next generation of computer
interfaces. 

(05/29/98; 6:53 p.m. ET)
By John Borland, TechWeb 
On the floor of a virtual auto showroom, a customer is intercepted by a
smiling
saleswoman dressed in a red and white jumpsuit. "It's a pleasure to see you,"
she says, as she reminisces about her own racing history and prompts the
customer to respond with information about his or her own background. She uses
this information to recommend a particular car as a starting point for the
shopping trip. 
Meet Extempo Systems' Jennifer James, one of the early "believable-agent" or
lifelike characters to reach the Web marketplace. She and other digital
cousins, most of whom still reside in industry and university labs, represent
the latest results of research into making software that thinks for itself. 
Believable-agent programs like this are designed to create an illusion of
personality that goes beyond the inflexible script of a cartoon. Programmers
seek to create characters that appear engaging and responsive, although
limitations in language recognition and other technologies still keep most of
the programs frustratingly far from being genuinely lifelike. 
Still, the creators of these synthetic personalities have grand ambitions for
their progeny. Programmers in the field predict characters with personality
and
some rudimentary empathy will become the backbone of the next generation of
computer interfaces, both online and offline. The next evolutionary step for
computers is to make the human-machine interaction a social experience, they
say. 
"I think it's a question of when, not if," said Gene Bell, a senior researcher
at Microsoft. Bell is working on some of the technologies the company hopes
will push lifelike agents toward commercial viability, such as speech and
natural-language recognition. Once these component technologies are widespread
-- and perhaps integrated into operating systems -- then the spread of social
interfaces will be a natural step, he says.

	I have a suggestion for limiting the proliferation of lists to
those that will actually get read-- creating nodes only after, say, ten
people express interest in subscribing to them. If the organizers of
NodeNet give their blessing, I can whip up a poll-page in about ten
minutes, and post it here.

PS: As some recent messages have emphasized we all know how easily polls
are abused, and therefore doing so to one of our own would be most
unoriginal and in poor taste.

	Perhaps NodeMasters could all agree to be members of
Extropians-Open and Extropians-Select. When a posting of broader interest
got sent to a node, the nodemaster would forward it to Extropians-Open or
Extropians-Select...  or perhaps to the nodemasters for those respective
lists. 
	After a major threads concludes on the node, nodemasters could
summarize the conclusions and again, if interesting, forward to the other
lists.

	Many experts in the areas that interest us have not yet heard of
transhumanism or Extropianism. They might be wary of associating with
anything they consider to be on the fringe. Some of them will disagree on
core issues with us. 
	I don't think this should disqualify them from being posting
members on our nodes. For example, a scientist who has invented a
neuron-computer interface has something interesting to say to us, even if
she doesn't believe uploading is possible/desirable. We should be
open-minded and respect their contribution rather than attempt to
indoctrinate them. If they are sympathetic to our ideas, they will absorb
these ideas through osmosis, without any direct effort on our part.
	I hope the nodes become respected fora in their fields (with a
strong but intangible Extropian slant) rather than outlets for raw
propoganda.

This is the real issue. I wonder when red rice yeast will become a controlled

Especially when Z has been in use by people around the world for thousands of
years with no need for regulation. That company X extracts the active ingredient
of Z, figures out how to make a similar chemical that is much more potent, and
patents that new compound, but tries some sort of recursive patenting of the

Easy. Since a solid substance has its atoms tightly packed, the gravity field exerted by
each indvidual atom is very high at a very short distance from the nucleus. As gravity
field density will change c relative to an observer outside that local field density,
and the gravity field density inside matter is higher than that outside matter, photons
traveling through solid, or liquid matter, will be observed to slow down while
traveling  inside the matter, then resuming the normal c when outside that matter, while
if you were the photon, you would notice no difference between the two....

Understanding relativity shows that, relative to each other, northbound blue and
southbound blue are temporally coexistent. Since they are both traveling at c, the
northbound photon, as an observer, experiences no time passage, only a single instant,
expending energy k in the instant of emission from point a and absorption at point b. To
an observer that is not traveling at absolute c, each photon is traveling at c, relative
to the non-c observer. Depending on the speed and direction of the observer relative to
the two photons, the wavelengths of each will be compressed, extended, or unchanged.

If this were so, then black holes would not be black, but would shine like any other
star, as the quantum virtual photons traveling above c that escaped would be redshifted
into the visible spectrum by the slowing of the photons escape velocity. Since black
holes are in fact black, outside of event horizon impact  and zero field splitting
radiation, then your theory is wrong.

Using ballistic theory for rough calculations does in fact work, just as Newton's Laws
work for most all macroscopic phonomena as rough approximations.  However, getting down
to the nitty gritty fine results takes much more, especially when dealing with angstrom
distances.

Explain via ballistic theory how an electron can jump across a PN gate without quantum
tunneling, all ballistic theory can do is calculate it as a current, and assumes
constant flow. It cannot explain the tunnelling.

If they spun by classical mechanics, they would have to precess, and therefore a

They cannot explain how a mere alternating electrostatic field can cause photon
emission. By classical mechanics, an electroluminescent lamp is action at a distance,
and should be impossible.

And here you are wrong. Any element at or above iron absorbs more energy in fusion,
while any element below iron in the periodic table absorbs more energy in fission.
Classical mechanics cannot explain this.

OK, how about this, atomic clocks traveling at different speeds need to be recalibrated
every so often, due to relativistic effects that cannot be explained by classical
mechanics..

I'm curious as to how you plan to attract experts to use the nodes. Why 
should they use ExI's system when other perfectly good systems exist? I 
know many of my own most productive research discussions with other 
people involved in quantum computing go on in email; sometimes quite a 
large group of researchers is involved in a single discussion. What would I 
gain from using ExI's system over this system of discussion?

That's a good suggestion, Alex, but please hold on for a couple of days. I
want to take more suggestions for forums then post an updated list of them.
I've added several in the last day, and there may be more soon. Once I've
posted the revised list (by the weekend), I do want to find out the
strength of interest in each.

People were invited to the list who didn't join.  About half the initial
invitation list, in fact.  And it's not just my judgement; Robin helped a lot
on the initial list, and I run to him and Carl Feynman for advice.

That said, I'm not perfectly happy with the list myself.  But I'd like less

Start similar lists, with other hosts.  I've thought of polymath-list as a
"neo-Enlightenment salon".  Nothing wrong with multiple salons and polite
competition.  The technical barriers to entry are pretty low.  The reputation
barrier is higher, of course; rather like Internet banking.

Tip: it may help if the host is not the youngest person on the list.  And the
host should be willing to look around for good new blood, whereas I need to
focus more on my life, and these days skim most of extropians, even the
intellectual property thread.

I don't believe this is a correct explanation for why photons travel
more slowly through matter than through empty space.  It has nothing to
do with gravity, which would be inconceivably small at this scale.

Rather, the photons interact with the electrons around the atom.
In effect, the photons are constantly being absorbed and almost instantly
re-emitted.  Phase and other state information is preserved, but the
photons end up being slowed down.  Once the photon re-enters vacuum it
is able to proceed unimpeded at c.

It is possible to travel faster than photons within matter.  If a charged
particle does so will it will be slowed down by the electrons and will
emit Cherenkov radiation, something like a "sonic boom" but of light.

Since such list will only be open to *members*, how will any of this improve
ExI' overall reputation?  A post I made awhile back suggested that rather than
require membership to read the contents of NodeNet, that a small reasonable
subscription fee be instituted as a way of covering costs.  Membership in ExI
could then include a subscription to NodeNet as well as other perks and
discounts on books, conferences, etc.

I can't help getting the feeling though that somehow such a system will in
short time be abused by the occasional shortcomings of the NodeMaster, where
personal feelings, egos and the like will keep otherwise intelligent posters
from being included.  Also, the intrinsic exclusivity of the NodeNet is almost
completely retrograde to the evolution of the Net as a spontaneously ordered,
open, agoric, free-marketplace of ideas.

This is probably a good idea, which is why such high caliber content should not
be restricted to those with ExI membership.

All I can say here, is I hope such an idealistic scenario works.  As Heinlien
once said "Specialization is for insects", and as Extropians, cross-pollination
is becoming more and more the benchmark for informed debate.

In this time of flag-buring and prayer amendments, new and improved
communication decency act legislation and cloning bans, the rational, positive
and life-affirming agendas of the trashumanist community are needed more than
ever.  I just hope that the proposals you are making Max are the ones that will
proliferate extropian ideas and not exclude them to the select few.

That's unfortunate that others invited have not participated, as the content of
polymath-l has often been compelling and informative.  Thanks for allowing
*anyone* to read it.  When I asked for alternatives to your format, I was thinking
of a more decentralized exclusivity mechanism, yet remaining open for reading by
all.  ExI's decision to make NodeNet only open to members is definitely *not* what
I had in mind.

Nothing wrong with competition, but on the other hand its the balkanization of
mailing lists of the NodeNet proposal that give me the sinking feeling that ExI is
isolating itself out of existence.Although if you have a few extra moments, I
would interested in hearing about what are the technical requirements for starting
a mailing list.

I really hadn't firmly decided on ExI-only access, Paul, so your suggestion
comes at a good time. It is important for us to increase the value of an
ExI membership if we want to retain and increase membership -- a goal
crucial to ExI's continued existence and functioning. I think we can
achieve that goal if we allow non-ExI members to be Observers for a fee
(invited non-member Participants would have free access), while it's free
for members. What that fee should be, I'll have to think about.

The only concern I have about this is that it requires more accounting to
keep track of who has paid for each list. I simply am *not* going to use my
time to do this! If ExI can turn over its database management to another
party, it could work. This may be a possibility, but is not the case now.
My proposal was intended as a simple way of getting the NodeNet going given
our severely limited resources. If the system is complicated and requires
volunteers to do a lot of work, it is not going to work. Allowing
non-members access for a fee does add complications, but if I can work that
out, it would certainly be preferable.

I have no doubt that this is true. In a simple, workable initial system, I
don't see how to avoid that. It will not be perfect, but at least it will
have come into existence. If the NodeNet grows well, perhaps a more
elaborate and fault-resistant version can be installed.

Also, the intrinsic exclusivity of the NodeNet is almost
>completely retrograde to the evolution of the Net as a spontaneously ordered,

I strongly disagree with this. While the Net as a whole is a spontaneous
order, it harbors within itself numerouse orders that are planned or
semi-planned. The economy as a whole is a spontaneous order (at least to a
large degree--it is possible to tinker with its constitutive legal rules),
but many companies and agencies within it have a much higher degree of
planned order. Evolution is a spontaneously ordering process, but its
products are biologically ordered systems whose structure is largely
"planned" by the genes. 

Without filtering systems (many different ones), which are typically
planned orders, the broader spontaneous order would produce little or
nothing of worth. The goal for an organization like ExI is to find the
temporarily optimal balance between the two kinds of order. Letting just
anyone post in the forums will not maximize their productiveness. Letting
anyone on the Net set up *their own* forums run on a different basis, with
different moderators, *does* maxmize productiveness.

>All I can say here, is I hope such an idealistic scenario works.  As Heinlien
>once said "Specialization is for insects", 

Then it's a good thing that subscribers will be able to join many forums,
that many of the forums are multi-disciplinary, and that we will have two
general mailing lists in addition.

Heinlein also said: "If it can't be expressed in figures, it is not
science; it is opinion." He certainly saw a place for deliberately
structured orders as well as the free markets he favored.

Onward!

Yes, so what? It's called phase velocity and it's easy to come up with 
scenarios where it's much faster than c, or even 2c. I sent a post about a 
year ago listing a bunch of stuff that's faster than light, but none of it

That's true, the earliest reference I can find is 1783 by John Michell, he 
called them "dark stars", however it had very different properties from  a 
modern Black Hole. If I was far from one of Michell's dark stars I could not 
see it, but unlike a Black Hole, I could obtain a picture of it and print it 
in the newspaper, I'd just have to get closer in a powerful spaceship. 
I could even land on the classical dark star, get a sample of it and then 
return to Earth, that sort of thing would be impossible with a Black Hole.

It can't explain why a photon in the vicinity of an excited atom but is not 
absorbed by it can nevertheless in about one time in a million somehow induce 
the atom to emit a photon of the exact same wavelength, phase, and 
polarization.

Yes, but only for the simplest of all atoms, hydrogen, it can't explain the

My friend, you're going to need a hell of a lot more than nine words and one 
single digit integer to explain the weird behavior of polarized particles, 
and there is nothing "simple" about it.

Minor snit, but tree bark does not contain aspirin; it contains salicylic
acid.  Aspirin is acetylsalicylic acid, which decomposes into salicylic
acid in the presence of water.  While salicylic acid *is* the active
ingredient, it can cause chemical burns to the esophagus and mouth when
concentrated to any degree.  The acetyl- group replaces the hydroxyl group
just long enough to get it into your stomach with damaging the tissue along
the way.  Aspirin is basically a technological improvement on a very old
analgesic.

I'll concede I over spoke myself.  I was taking a counter-postion as a way of
eliciting a clarification of your position.  Thanks. :-)I think it would be useful
PR, if on the bottom of all of the postings to the Extropian-open list we have
information regarding the details of subscribing to NodeNet and joining ExI.  Alex
Future Bokov had something similar on the bottom of the transhuman list regarding
cloning.

receiving countries will pay for visiting teachers and/or students. 
Patrick details the "new educational programs that would provide for these 
sort of teacher exchange programs, at taxpayers expense, no matter how 
these participating so-called teachers, more appropriately, now, "world 
indoctrinators," would express it. This is all about the harmonization of 
all education worldwide, to ready citizens of nations for global 
citizenship. Mind washing for the global citizen. AC

A delegation of Massachusetts Education, Arts and Humanities leaders has 
been invited to participate in a special People to People study mission to 
the Peoples Republic of China in November. The primary objective of this 
trip is to understand the Chinese government's policy and role in education 
relative to academic standards, funding, and teacher development. Senator 
Marian Walsh and 1 member and Senate chair of the Joint Legislative 
Committee on Education, Arts and Humanities respectively, will be serving 
as co-leaders for this delegation. We are pleased to extend a personal 
invitation for you to join us in this exclusive People to People endeavor. 
Your particular expertise would contribute to the success of our visit.
Travelling with this People to People delegation will provide a remarkable 
opportunity to increase our understanding of the Chinese culture, attitudes 
and educational system, especially in light of educational reform efforts 
in Massachusetts. The insight to be gained will enrich our pending 
discussion unaccountability, affordability, and accessibility at all levels 
of our educational system. Site visits and meetings with our professional 
counterparts will be invaluable in understanding the Chinese culture and 
educational values. Relevant topics suggested for discussion and study 
include:
* The Chinese government's role in education for children in the early 
years -- birth through age 6
* The Chinese government's role in education for children in the middle 
years --ages 6 through 18
* The Chinese government's role in education for children in the college 
years -- ages 18 through 22
* Academic standards for student achievement
* Teacher development requirements and support
* Teaching the arts; funding education
As indicated in the enclosed itinerary, we will depart Los Angeles November 
7, and return November 21, 1998. In addition to our professional 
exchanges, we will also take part in cultural and sightseeing programs. 
Spouses, guests and colleagues are also invited and encouraged to 
participate in our visit to Beijing, Xi'an, Gullin, Canton, and Hong Kong.
Expenses associated with this project may qualify for a deduction as a 
business or educational expense to maintain or improve professional skills. 

Participants should consult with their tax advisor to determine whether 
deductibility is applicable. Please contact Ms. Kristi Wheeldon, the 
program coordinator at American People Ambassador Programs, if you have any 
interest or questions regarding this mission. You may contact her at 
800-669-7882 (ext. 422) in the Pacific time zone, or email: 
kristiw@ambassadors.com . I encourage you to respond at you earliest 
convenience.
The vastness of China is impressive; participating in this mission will 
give us the opportunity to observe many aspects of its cultural and 
geographical diversity. I hope that you will give serious consideration to 
joining the delegation. The personal and professional benefits will be 
very rewarding.
Very truly yours,
Signed Robert A. Antonioni

Not Printed or Mailed at State Expense 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
And who is paying for the livelihood of this Senator and his "public 
servant" cohorts in criminal and traitorous subversion? 
Does anyone really believe this red dribble is not printed at state 
expense, or that any of these incredibly subversive visiting US 
officials/teachers/exchange students/teachers training programs, are not at 
the expense of the US taxpayer and at the expense of all things civil, 
decent, and of liberty itself? And with the full intent of, and at the 
complete expense of, rendering US students into moronic lumps of obedient 
reds-cum-obedient serf drones? Notice the arrogant and patronizing way 
this nitwit red calls adults between the ages of 18-22 children. 
If nationwide the parents are so dumb and continuously refuse to know what 
is occurring in the class room, then these human spirit breaking programs 
and their evil change agent promoters, will proliferate and succeed, as 
they are now.

=========================================
Angie:
The whole world is filled with degenerate idiots like this. 
The question I would pose is "So what?"
Look at it this way. These cretins are creating a world in which 
there will not be enough of a surplus sufficient enough to provide 
them with the style they have grown accustomed to -- or in fact with 
any survival at all. 
What happens to parasites when the whole world is largely parasitic 
and the few hosts left have developed an immunity to those parasites?
For example take all these school shootings. The student body is 
now either a bunch of little criminals intent on killing each other or 
a bunch of sheep unable to defend themselves. 
Frankly, I sort of like seeing the logical progression from post 
office to publik skrule. Massive state bureaucracies where the vicious 
regime criminals engendered sometimes forget who the victims are, 
ending up occassionally turning on each other. No big deal. Nothing 
much to be concerned about just as long as you and yours are well out 
of the free-fire zones. Nothing much you can do about it in any case. 
We are not the first civilization which has faltered under the weight 
of its degenerate elements foolishly allowed to live and breed 
profusely. Look at the lemming cycle. The mass of lemmings in the 
4th year just before the march to the sea are not the same as the 
surviving lemmings who survive to begin the cycle anew.
Nope. I wouldn't concern myself overmuch about the mass of 
trivialities leading to deserved disaster. I would advise people who 
don't live in states with easy home-schooling rules to instead teach 
their little nipper to draw pictures of assault rifles and mutter how 
they "want to shoot teacher." Around here the eddication bureaucrats 
are so terrified (and glad that the hunting season is closed for the 
summer) that you could get your nippers expelled for an entire skule 
year, thus not having to worry about the truant officer. 
I owe you a favor or two. Want me to post these comments far and 
wide?
--Martin Lindstedt 
======================================

Dear Martin,
Thank you for your most logical, commonsensical and truly welcome 
response. 
I was so angry with this filth. But, you are quite right. Why 
worry about the natural consequences of a bastardized citizenry. 
Thank you, for jolting me back to a more balanced perception. Please 
do distribute the post. AC

I guess that's my cue to shrivel up and die.

Interestingly, Reilly declined to respond to my careful dismantling (via a
review of Lee Silver's book REMAKING EDEN) of his moral claims about the
self-evident evils of abortion - and I even took the trouble to send him a
cc. lest he wasn't visiting the extropian list at the time.

As Max mentioned in another mail, I original discussed the basics of what
is now know as 'NodeNet' with Greg Burch some time ago. To answer your
question perhaps I should describe the bases for my thinking at that time,
and the direction in which I saw ExI progressing. (At this point I should
say that I am in no position to dictate the progress of ExI, but that I do
have an interest in its continuing success, since its possible 'products'
may help me in my own goals regarding the future.)

ExI seems to be an institute which brings together people with a strong
desire to shape their own futures, and those of the world(s) which they
hope to inhabit. However, as I once mentioned in an article which Steve
Edwards contributed to 21C, the people who will have access to the sorts of
technologies which we seek in order to enhance our lives, will be those who
are very rich, very well-connected, involved in the initial research
themselves, or any combination thereof. Whilst ExI serves to analyse and
propagate the memes of researchers, economists, etc., it is not, in
general, part of the 'meme-set' of those people on whose work and thinking
it comments. There is a disjuncture between 'us' and 'them', in other words.

One has therefore to ask oneself, 'Whither ExI'? In an ideal world, ExI
would sponsor research of its own, working with the greatest innovators of
this and the next century. But those innovators ask themselves precisely
the question you raise, Michael: what's in it for me? I put forward the
idea of NodeNet to try and answer that question.

At this point in time, when ExI's revenues cannot support self-funded
research, I would say that it is the multi-disciplinary nature of ExI which
could most enhance people's communication processes through NodeNet. I
remember commenting that any posting member of a node should also,
automatically, be able to browse the other lists, applying for posting
access if and when s/he feels s/he has something to contribute. Put simply,
the key to success here is not the individual 'nodes', but the wider 'net'.

Is this a big draw to scientists, economists, etc.? Right now, probably
not, and I should imagine that initial progress will be slow. But with
appropriately targetted marketing, and free memebership for key
individuals, at least initially, the rate of take-up should increase. 

I suppose my vision of ExI is one of a real-time 'Nature': prestigious,
multi-disciplinary and highly valued by its target community. In order to
facilitate this, it may be necessary to restructure ExI itself, to provide
a forum for 'lay members' and a forum for 'specialists'. The former are
kept abreast of developments, and on-going work, whilst the latter,
initially joining for communication purposes, are naturally guided in
directions desirable to Extropian Principles by their contact with ExI.

If this all sounds elitist and grandiose, that is because it is precisely
those things. It is the basis for the development of ExI to gain
recognition along the lines of the Nobel Institute. It will require time,
money and dedication. But if, after time, one can approach any of the top
hundred thinkers on this planet, the Hawkings and Clarkes and Watsons and
Cricks of the world, and ask, successfully, to see their ExI membership
cards, then it is worth it.

Time to put my money and time where my mouth is. Max: please mail me
details of how I can join the Institute, and my credit card number shall be
yours. If you need my time to come up with necessary marketing plans, cost
analysis, schedules, resource requirements, contact lists, etc., you have
it. I may be able to fly out to the US later this year, if necessary.

And for those of you who see money as the solution, then rest assured some
revenue generation planning would form part of the grand scheme. (Natasha:
in all that I have said above, I include all forms of artistic endeavour
within the NodeNet paradigm, although doing so may require some form of
separation of forums as far as marketing is concerned, but not in actual
operation.)

I'm afraid most people immediately assume that transhuman equates to
anti-human.  They seem to use the word "transcending" to mean escaping or
recovering from a bad situation.  I'm tempted to try to promote the word
"prohuman" to mean advancing and improving the human condition.  Maybe
"humanist" means the same thing?

To be fair, I think the argument probably would be that the natural substance
has been used for so long that it is believed to be safe.  A new derivative
probably is safe, but needs major testing to be sure.  In this sense, it may be
true that a natural substance has more evidence of its safety than a newly
derived derivative.  Note that this claim does not apply when the synthetic is
chemically identical to the natural substance.

This is probably too poor of an idea to even post, but it occurred to me
that if you charge non-members/non-participants for access to the node-net
forums, might not those funds be used to attract potential participants . .
. theoreticians and researchers who might not otherwise have joined because
they don't endorse transumanist / extropian ideas?

A side question...how many ExI observers do you believe there currently are?
How many Nodes can feasibly be supported?

	Let's say James Bond and Austin Powers want to correspond about
secret stuff. Obviously, they would exchange keys signed by trusted
parties and go at it. However, what if there are no trusted parties, and a
face to face meeting is too risky/expensive? They could each create a new
key-pair not associated with their normal identities and correspond
through two-way anonymous remailers, thus neither knowing whom they're
talking to but at least knowing it's the same entity each time. If one of
them is captured or subverted, they still won't be able to give away the
identity of the other. Can anyone see any vulnerabilities in this plan
whatsoever?

You probably wouldn't use it instead of your normal professional channels,
but rather in addition. Here are a couple of ways it might benefit you:

1. If this goes the route of propogating certain messages to other nodes
that may be interested, you get improved interdisciplinary sharing of
ideas.

2. You get to talk to lay-persons who have the sort of interest in your
work that is all too rare among the general public, while at the same time
talking to colleagues.

3. You get to set the record straight. What gets passed off as "science
reporting" on TV and in the papers these days is really inadequate as a
conduit between the lab and the living room.

4. You get whatever else it is that motivates you to join intereting
online discussions. 


Besides, you and your circle of professional contacts might be ahead of
the game-- not surprising given the nature of your research. My specialty
(gerontology) however, can definately use more efficient means of
electronic communication.

How about this for a safeguard against NodeMaster abuse: two equal
NodeMasters for each list. Less workload for each individual nodemaster,
redundancy in case one of them goes on vacation or has a problem with net
access, and a lower chance that both of them will try to make an
irrational decision about the same thing. 

By the way, Max, you mentioned the logistics of charging for access to
NodeNet for non Exi members as a concern. How about this as a pricing
strategy:

1. Anyone can read the lists for free, but to search the list
archives they have to have membership?

2 Have the subscription be free for a couple of months, until demand
starts to grow, and then start charging.

3. Have read-only access be free, but read-write access carry a fee,
except for those invited? (I conceed that this might not be such a good
idea)

4. I don't know what your internet access is like, but perhaps breaking
into the ISP business? Many ISPs provide access first and content as an
afterthought, but here we'd be selling them content and access as equal
parts of the same package. This is probably the most difficult and risky
of the ideas, but if we can get it to work...

Extropians,

	Everyone keeps pointing out to me that the current most likely
theory, due to the scientific evidence to date, is that the universe
is likely open, not closed.  Does this discovery, in Japan at the
supper Kimiocande detector, that the Neutrino has mass change all
that?

	I figured there would be much more discussion about this here.
Can we now argue that the universe is most likely closed?  Here's a
CNN article in case you've missed it.

   Natasha!  Fellow Extropians!

   Have you seen  the 'Light Doodler' gadget?  Comes from Chatsworth, 
   California -- It's really beautiful.  A spinning 4" polycarbonate ring 
   has wired multi-coloured micro-LEDs set into the circumference which 
   switch on and off under microprocessor control to create polychromatic 
   light patterns on the described surface of a transparent sphere.  It 
   has pattern controls, and a microphone to enable it to 'play along' 
   with music, voices etc.
   
   Very Extropian!  Around $50 retail, I'd guess.

How do these people know who they should invite to discuss their secrets?
If they invite somebody they know they want to talk to, then they know his identity.
If they invite everybody they do not know, they can as well anonymously broadcast
their secrets.

Now, if a person they invite is already known to them, but only under untraceable
pseudonyms, they can invite him, but will never learn his identity.
Except that when enough effort is expended into building the credibility of a 
pseudonym, the person's interests may be hurt by actions directed at this
pseudonym - it becomes part of one's identity.

If cryonics became more popular than cremation

number of suspended bodies and/or brains?  Are
there any plans for large-scale cryonics?

The only problem is that you have identified the participants by their
names.  But if they are anonymous to each other, they don't know each
other's names.  So neither one can learn the anonymous mailbox of the
other from his name.

What I gather you mean is that there are two anonymous parties, both
communicating in some kind of electronic forum, and over time they
decide they want to communicate with each other.  Perhaps they notice
that both have a shared interest in explosives and beautiful women.
So they proceed to send email, and perhaps proceed to discuss subversive
plans.

This is no different than any other kind of on-line meeting, except that
the two parties are anonymous.  In this scenario, you're right that if
one is captured, he can't reveal the identity of the other.

However, there are some problems.  With only online communication, you
can't be quite as sure of the sincerity of your correspondent as you would
be if you met face to face.  If your conversation progresses to the point
where a meeting is necessary, that will be risky.

Also, with anonymous communication it may not be possible to get the
public keys meaningfully certified by third parties.  So a "man in the
middle" attack may be more practical with this kind of communication.

The article by Beam on cryonics in located in the Section Living/Arts.
Well, you can imagine how I found the article to be rather kitsch.

In instances such as this, where the journalist's story is fallible, it
would be good to take action and send letters or e-mail to the Globe.

Its a poor portrayal of cryonics, a misleading comment about nerds.  The
idea of a nerd has mutated over the past decade.  Where it was once to be
uncool, its reputation changed and has become cool, or cryo, (although I'm
not a nerd nor a geek for that matter.)

I'm glad that Kennita Watson got some press, as an active cryonicist she
certainly deserves to be mentioned.  Though, I had to laugh about the bad
math in adding up the female cryonicist 'cause cryonics has a lot of female
members (not to mention its founding member Linda Chamberlain -- who
probably would not be considered a nerd (or geek) either.)

Regardless, I do think that the best response is to make the Globe aware
that it printed an article that was not researched responsibly and it was
under the Section "Living/Arts" rather than "Fiction."

Alex Beam's e-mail address is beam@globe.com, although I don't have the
address for the Boston Globe, but it shouldn't be hard to find.

No special vulnerabilities specific to this method.  However, no method is
foolproof.  Let me point out the obvious problems with using this method in the
real world.

1.  The participants don't know who their talking to, so you can't contact a
specific individual.  The unknown individual could be the enemy you are trying
to hide messages from.

2.  This is only as secure as the anonymous remailer.  All people with access
to that machine could trace the messages to a real e-mail address.  If someone
hacks into that machine, they can do the same.  If a government pressures the
owner, they may provide the information to the government.

3.  This is only secure as the key exchange.  If you never meet the person, and
you never exchange keys in a secure medium, then the key exchange can be
spoofed.  Say you contact me as an anonymous person.  Instead of replying to
you, I can reencrypt it and send it to a third party as if it came from you.  I
get their response, reencrypt it back to you.  You and the third party think
you have met and are having a secure conversation as you described above. 
Neither of would know that I am reading all of your encrypted messages back and
forth.

4.  The internet is not secure.  Even with anonymous remailers and encryption,
I might be able to detect clues about who is talking to whom.  For example, the
timing and scheduling of your messages to the remailer might let me detect
similar sized and schedule messages from the remailer to your target.  If you
are the only person to send three 100K e-mails today to the remailer, and then
I see another person receive three 10K e-mails from the remailer later that
night, then I can figure out who your anonymous e-mail is really going to.  I
don't need to hack the remailer or either of your computers.  I only need to
monitor Internet traffic.

5.  PGP keys are only as secure as your machine and your passphrase. 
Encryption keys are typically stored in computer hardware.  If someone can hack
into your machine, or if they take physical possession of your machine, then
they have your decryption key.   If somebody can break down your door and take
your PC, then they can take your decryption key.  If somebody can hack through
your Browser to see your hard disk, then they can take your decryption key.

6.  Encryption does not prevent decoding, it only slows it down.  Faster
computers may be able to crack it.  New methods are being invented all the
time.  Remember that most "uncrackable" codes are later cracked with new
technology or methods.  Just because it seems uncrackable to you, or seems
uncrackable now, doesn't mean that it will remain uncrackable indefinitely.

Sorry if these are obvious points.  Any security specialist will respond with
methods to counter these.  Don't use the Internet, have your PC self destruct
if physically moved, don't trust anonymous remailers, don't store your key on
your computer, etc.  If you aren't this paranoid, then the method you describe
is not as foolproof as it may seem, due to other methods not directly related
to cracking the encryption.

Due to a brief stint in the world of journalism/media I can off the following
advice...

e-mails to the author :  nice for exchange of opinion.   If you're expecting a
retraction... forget it.   Most of the offensive material was Tongue-in-cheek.
It wasn't written as a news story but more of a humorous article.    On the
other hand, the author might decide to write an even more humorous follow-up
story incorporating some of the letters we send ! ! !    Watch it !

mass e-mail compaign :  forget it, papers get that everyday.    

snail mail to the editorial department (anybody have the address ? ? ?) :
might get published.  Letters from high ups at ALCOR or CI stating the facts
and hinting at libel on the cover letter might be considered.

snail mail to the editor :  fair coverage is ethical.   a retraction of
blatant misinformation that refers to person's or to people or orgs by name or
company would  probably be a matter of ethics.   Debate facts would probably
not.   

Go get 'em nerds !

So much about the better ability of a centralized planning system
to look ahead.

I wonder what the consequences for the US military standing may
be.  Probably just some embarrassment and loss of respect/fear
from potential enemies - nothing that can't be fixed by intense
politicking and extra few hundred giga$ in defense spending -
the ability to profit from its mistakes does look like a
special skill of the State.

The long-term history of world economic growth seems to be 
describable as sequence of exponential growth modes. In the 
current mode, which has lasted about a century, the economy 
doubles every 15 years.  If history is a guide, the economy 
may transition within the next 50 years or so to a faster 
mode, with a doubling time between one month and four years.  

At http://hanson.berkeley.edu/longgrow.html I explain why.

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

Hal Finney's and Harvey Newstrom's responses made it clear to me that my
question wasn't phrased specifically enough. Here are some underlying
assumptions I forgot to mention: 

1. Remailers are not the weakest security link. 
	Today, there are remailers that randomize the order in which
messages are sent, and encrypt the sender/recipient databases. Most
serious users have their message go through a chain of several remailers
before it gets to the destination. 

2. The physical security of your computer is not the weakest link.
	Physical security is really a separate discussion. 

3. The software security of your computer is not the weakest link.
	If your PC is running an OS not designed for remote control
(MacOS, DOS, stand-alone Win95) and no network software except an
encrypted telnet, ssh, or email client you pretty much don't have to worry
about remote inflitration or sniffing. Denial of service attacks probably
can't be prevented, though.

4. Encryption technology advances along with cracking technology, always
remaining a step or two ahead. 
	There are multiple ways to encrypt any given piece of data, but
only one correct way to interpret a given piece of encrypted data.

	Sasha pointed out that "the person's interests may be hurt by
actions directed at this pseudonym - it becomes part of one's identity".
True, you can be slandered. However, you cannot be killed, arrested,
deported, fired, or stripped of net access-- unless the pseudonymous
entity you're talking to tells your adversaries about your future plans,
thus allowing them to be waiting for you when you get there, whoever you
are. 
	The weak link is the human factor. How do you know that the person
you're talking to can be trusted, or, how do you talk to someone you
aren't sure you trust? The three (non-rigorous) ways I've thought of so
far are: 

1. Have a well known third party sign both keys. This is probably a bad
idea if this person can be "gotten to" because it implies they know both
of the secret agents. Hmm... perhaps a well known _anonymous_ persona... 
see the next item, though. 

2. Spend a long time establishing the credentials of your anonymous
persona. Theoretically a sufficiently dedicated adversary can spend a long
time doing this, though, and fool you. 

3. Come up with a test that would rule out certain types of infiltrators. 
For example, if it's the US gov you're worried about, ask them mail you a
copy of PGP accross the US border thus breaking Federal law. If it's the
religious fundies you're worried about, ask them to write something really
blasphemous. I know, I know, this is really weak. They will find
loopholes, and they'll probably not be above breaking their own rules on
occasion.

What do you think?

PS: Ooh, I think I came up with a scheme for doing this, but it might be
long, so I'll put this into a separate message after I've thought about it
for a while.

                                            --Sincerely, Alex F. Bokov

How much more resources are needed to support
a suspended body thatn a buried corpse? In the US,
each corpse gets its own plot (many variations, but this
is the norm) while a cryonaut gets shelf-space. At a
guess, the cryonaut's real-estate usage will average less
than the usage of the typical US corpse. Furthermore, the
cryonaut is financially responsible for the maintanence
expenses, so there should additional burden to society.

Since there's been so much talk about it, I thought I'd just go ahead
and post the letter that I wrote and sent to Alex Beam and to the
Globe Letters to the Editor address two days ago. I tried really hard
not to be too negative or smartass, but y'all can judge whether I
succeeded (probably didn't).

Cheers!

************************************

Dear Mr. Beam,

Thank you for bringing the subject of cryonics back to the pages of
the
Boston Globe. Yours is a highly respected newspaper, and cryonics is
indeed
a newsworthy topic.

Having followed the field for most of a decade, I have seen literally
hundreds of news reports in all forms of media. Unfortunately, your
article, despite its brevity, fits neatly into the categories of "most
error-filled" and "least researched". Although yours is not the first
to
gain such distinction, I do find it mildly disappointing, because
unlike
most journalists in the past, you seem to have gotten your information
via
the internet (the best, easiest to use research tool that has ever
existed). I appreciate that you might have been tailoring the piece
for the
"Living | Arts" section rather than the "Health | Science" section,
looking
to entertain as much as to educate. But errors are errors, and I feel
pretty confident you could have avoided many of them simply by
spending
just a few more moments actually reading the pages you cited and
following
the links, rather than simply looking for points to criticize and
ridicule.

If you are interested in getting the details right, below I offer some
quotes from your piece, along with comments of my own that I hope will
be
helpful.

   "He hopes that scientists will discover a way to revive human
   life from frozen tissue before the Apocalypse, or before his
   yearly payments to Arizona-based Alcor Life Extension
   Foundation run out."

Yearly payments to Alcor will not "run out". I'm not sure how closely
you
looked at Alcor's funding requirements, but yearly dues ($360) are
paid
only while the member is alive. At the time of suspension, a one-time,
lump
sum of $50,000 (for Neurosuspension) or $120,000 (for Whole Body) must
be
paid to Alcor. Part of this pays for the initial suspension procedure.
The
rest (the majority) is invested, with the interest paying the ongoing
costs
of low temperature storage. The lump sum is usually provided via life
insurance, which is cheap and affordable for most folks. What this
means is
that dues and life insurance premiums are paid to make and maintain
suspension arrangements. But after suspension, there are no further
costs
to the individual, his family, or his estate. In my case, the total
cost
for my life insurance and dues amounts to $70/month.

   "1. They are all nerds."
   "2. Twenty-five of the 26 are men."
   "3. Most of them, with the exception of Cambridge's own
       Marvin Minsky, live in California."

For starters, point #2 here is just wrong. Kennita Watson is indeed
female,
but so are Ailing Freeman, Terry Stanley, and Chris Peterson. That's 4
out
of 26, not 1 out of 26. (Did you even follow those links? Or did you
just
look at the names?)

But more importantly, using Ralph Merkle's listing as your data sample
is a
pretty skewed, unscientific method of data gathering about
cryonicists.
There are approximately 700 cryonicists who have made arrangements to
be
suspended. Predictably, Ralph's list contains mostly close friends and
colleagues of his, and of course, he could only link to people who
actually
have web pages. This explains why they're all nerds, and why almost
all of
them live in California.

If you're interested in the actual data, the numbers really look like
this:

A loose usage of the word "nerd" might apply to 70% of cryonicists.
The
other 30% certainly have to have at least some respect for science and
technology, but they're not nerds.

Females represent approximately 33% of our total these days, and that
figure has risen steadily over the years. Certainly we males would
like it
to be more like 50% (or 90%!), but the real picture isn't nearly so
grim as
you've painted it.

Californians represent approximately 33% of cryonicists. The rest are
scattered throughout the states, with additional concentrations in New
York, Florida, and Arizona.

   "As with everything, it pays to shop around. Wilmington,
   Del.-based CryoSpan claims to flash-freeze ''humans and their
   companion animals at the lowest possible price,'' which turns
   out to be an annual $250 for ''neuro'' (brain only) or $1,500
   for the full monty."

CryoSpan's fees are one-time lump sum payments of $58,500 for
Neurosuspension, $125,000 for Whole Body Suspension, same as with
Alcor.
The "yearly fee" of $250 for Neuro or $1500 for Whole Body represents
the
ongoing costs of long-term storage. These are not separate charges.
They
are paid via interest accumulation from investment of the initial lump
sum.
Looking at CryoSpan's page on the web
(http://www.cryocare.org/cryospan/cryospan.html),  I see that this
distinction is not made perfectly clear. Nevertheless, what you
printed is
wrong, or misleading at the very least.

   "The only woman who may be available for soulful chats at
   sunset is Kennita Watson, a Libertarian activist who has run
   for statewide office several times in California."

This is wrong for the same reasons listed above. Even if you only took
Merkle's sample of 26, there are 3 others. Your usage of the word
"may"
hardly excuses making the world think that Kennita is the only female
cryonicist. There are *hundreds* of signed-up females, with more on
the
periphery, in the process of making arrangements.

Again, I do appreciate that you were trying to write an interesting,
light-hearted piece about the strangeness we Californians indulge
ourselves
in, and had you stuck to your take on things, I would have no problem
with
even a severe hatchet job (which your article certainly was not). But
many
readers will be left with very wrong impressions about cryonics that
the
facts simply do not support, taking your word as a journalist, and
believing that you have done your research properly.

Revile us or ridicule us all you like. We know this isn't for
everyone, we
have a sense of humor, and we can take a good ribbing. But please get
the
facts straight while you're doing it. A printed correction would seem
to be
in order here.

Sincerely,
Derek Strong

Yes. Cryonics companies want to grow, and they have lots of plans for
how to spend the money and how to scale up. The real problem seems to
come if we see rapid, unexpected growth. Even with the additional
capital that would come from increased memberships and cryonic
suspensions, it will take time to convert the additional income into
additional manpower. (Facilities are not the problem. It's getting
enough skilled labor to do all those potential suspensions.)

I knew this would be a good movie, but I was totally unprepared for the last
half hour--it developed into the most perfect visual metaphor for everything
that we are striving towards on these lists and in our lives. I was just

That is a good point.  Implementation may be tough. To be effective, 
this will require a lot of work by NodeMasters in order to ensure that 
the quantity and level of interdisciplinary communication is  
appropriate, along with some oversight to ensure that the NodeMasters are 
doing their jobs properly.

"At the same time" is not necessarily a good idea.  Separate forums may 
be appropriate.  To pick just one example which I am quite familiar with, 
the sci.physics.* Usenet groups tend to be fairly useless for physics.  
This is because, ironically, many of the better informed posters seem to 
spend their time helping out the inexperienced, while discussion of 
"advanced topics" is dominated by enthusiastic but poorly informed people.

For this reason, I believe that some sort of stratification is 
necessary if the system is to be attract usage by innovators.

As the Boston Globe example shows. Let me also add that the New Scientist 
link about quantum teleportation posted recently was woefully misleading. 
Anything NodeNet can do to improve this link would be great!

I will make a few related suggestions about NodeNet in my reply to Sarah's 
post.

How will this system differ from Usenet?
 
Consider especially that there already exist structures for moderation, a 
world-wide system for distribution, a large user-base, and tested 
protocols. Propogation is reasonably fast and reliable.

On the other hand, NodeNet might be able to learn from the mistakes made 
by Usenet. I would hope that such a system would enable a much richer 
variety of communication to take place.

Something I would jump at the chance to use is a system which facilitates 
collaboration across the net. Ideally, this would combine 
video-conferencing with a networked scanner / blackboard system for diagrams 
and equations.  Such a system would also provided archival possibilities 
(useful when you can't quite recall a discussion you had three years ago 
with a colleague), and the possibility for distribution to a wider 
audience -- often a discussion concludes with "I wish such and such were 
here".  Conversations could also be "eavesdropped on" or viewed at a 
later date by a much wider audience. 

If NodeNet could make these kinds of things possible, I believe it would 
be tremendously useful. With existing bandwidth and off-the-shelf 
hardware it should be possible to set a primitive version of this system up. 
The video link would be very slow at first, but would gradually improve 
over the next few years as the available bandwidth goes up.

I am consistently amazed at the extent to which technical innovation is 
centralized in the US.  This has great cost benefits for people wishing 
to reach innovators. If I wished to reach the technical innovators of 
tomorrow, I'd target Stanford, Caltech, Berkeley, MIT, and a few other 
places, inviting bright undergraduates and graduate students to take 
part.

I agree that such a stratification is necessary, and perhaps even more 
levels.

I do wonder how likely that is. My own guess, no doubt influenced by my 
own political biases (more socialist than libertarian :-), is that the 
less philosophical baggage, the more likely the scheme is to succeed. At 
times, if ExI wants input from the best innovators around, it is going to 
have to bite its philosophical tongue.

To get something going I imagine that revenue would be needed less than 
time and creativity. Later on, such a system may pay for itself.

Not true, light moves in a straight line not in a sign wave. The strength of  
the associated magnetic and electric fields change in a sinusoidal way, but 
those fields are always at right angles to each other and to the direction of 
motion of the light. The speed of light in a vacuum is independent of the 
frequency, wavelength, phase, or amplitude.

OK, let's start this conversation.  But we must start it at the beginning.  James 
Bond wants to start this conversation, but he doesn't know who with and he 
doesn't want to reveal his identity.  So he creates a new secured ID, and sends 
a thusly-signed clear message to -- whom?

(Or maybe he does know who with, but he is aware that this target person will 
NOT want James Bond to know who he is dealing with.  How do you send a 
message to some specific person, securely, while making it obvious to that
person that you do not know to whom you are sending the message?  You 
cannot use his normal email address or his normal public encryption key.)

One possible solution: he broadcasts it.  An ad appears in the Personals 
column (Seeking Same) section of your local Internet newspaper:
  
  "Somewhat destructive secret agent on another continent seeking same
   in North America for exchange of information and target identification.  Reply
   to me@anonymous.remailer with encrypted message using this public key:
   123456789-qwertyuio-asdfghjkl-zxcvbnmp.-."

And HOW MANY government anti-terrorist groups from around the world 
respond?  Each of them claiming to be the sort of person requested in the ad?

>  Now, supposing they want to bring Maxwell Smart into their

How do they know who joins?

Here's another approach, in a system of public-key cryptography.  I will 
assume that James Bond wishes to communicate with Austin Powers, and 
that neither objects to the other knowing the identity of the person they are 
communicating with.

First, double encryption.  Assuming the recipient's key is not compromised, it 
is not possible by examining a doubly-encrypted message to determine its 
source.  (Examining the envelope on the msg is a different matter; thus an 
anonymous remailer.)

Once the recipient decrypts it using his own private key, he *must* have the 
source available to him so that he knows whose public key to use for the 
second decryption.

But assume that at least one person's regular security ID is believed to 
possibly be compromised.  Are there any SEMI-trusted parties?

Let's assume there are 12 parties, each of whom Bond semi-trusts and whom 
Powers could safely come in physical contact with.

Bond sets himself up *two* new security IDs.  ID#1 he splits the public key into 
5 parts.  Each part is wrapped in a message "Key part 3 is sdfausdofds".  This 
message is then encrypted with Powers' public key.  In front of each of the 
results add the text 'Please deliver the following to the next person who comes 
to you and says "foursquare bullfrogs".'  Then send each part to two *different* 
people on the list of twelve semi-trusted parties, encrypted with their public 
keys, through the anonymous remailer.

Next Bond writes the message: "When Austin Powers comes and asks you 
about an email code, tell him 'foursquare bullfrogs'."  He sends this message to 
the remaining two semi-trusted parties, encrypted with their public keys, 
through the anonymous remailer.

Now he writes a message to Austin Powers, saying "I've sent you a new public 
key via distributed means.  Fred or Joe can tell you the email code that will 
persuade the contact persons to give you their portions of the key.  The contact 
persons are...  And you have a message you'll need that key to decrypt.".  He 
sends this through a remailer to Austin Powers, encrypted with Austin's regular 
public key.

Finally he writes a message saying "This is James Bond.  I need to 
communicate with you about..." and giving new contact info, INCLUDING the 
public key for his new ID#2.  He encrypts this using his normal private key.  
Adds appropriate text and encrypts it again using the private key from ID#1.  
Adds further appropriate text and encrypts it a third time using Austin Powers' 
public key, and sends it through an anonymous remailer.

To break this by simple spying and wiretapping, you must have compromised 
the private keys of no fewer than six people out of a specific group of thirteen, 
and you must intercept the parts and connect them together.

  IAN: It was interesting how the left-wing Washington 
  Post pushed the lager pharmaceutical company Merck's
  effort to ban the competition backed with a disinfo 
  spin from the vitamin-control activists at the so 
  called "Center for Science in the Public Interest,"
  while the right-wing paper, the Washington Times,
  made the case for the smaller company that sells
  the rice yeast product. The Center of Science in
  the Public interest sure serves as an ideal "Oh 
  what about the children and public interest?" cover
  for the promotion of the most "crass mercantilism"!

  The left-wing spin would be, "Look at that Washington
  Times supporting the profits of this yeast dealer at
  the cost of the "Public Interest," when in fact the
  left are supporting the very worst example of the
  capitalist monopoly they so lament as the great 
  threat of the free market. I've seen attacks on
  the vitamin industry in the media that frame it
  up as a "mutlimillion-dollar greed fest," when 
  all the "Public-Interest People" against vitamins
  are in fact pushing the case for the super-mega
  wealthy multinational pharmaceutical giants to
  the immediate detriment of the public interest.
  The pro-Govt case is the inverse of the truth.

  I recall seeing left-wing "consumer activist" 
  Ralph Nader saying on CNN's Crossfire that he
  sees no problem with the average time it takes
  to approve drugs increase from 10 to 20 years.
  How many little companies could afford the costs
  of doubling all research expenses? Only giants.

  I believe all socialist polices result in higher
  prices and/or great scarcities of resources, and
  as such hurt most the very population they purport 
  to be the "beneficiaries" of their social planning,
  and consolidate the power of select elite monopolies.

Cemetary plots are priced so as to provide 'perpetual maintainance', so the
owners get a good enough return on the original plot purchase to make a
profit and mow the lawns 'forever' Sooner or later the cemetary will be
recycled into a housing development and the former occupants moved into a
mass grave somewhere. I believe we will see a trend towards the cremation
of uprooted bodies in the future, to avoid the reburial. Possibly even
legislation forcing cremation if land use pressures run high enough.

At least cryonic suspension can reuse the storage space once the suspendee
is revived, assuming there are still conditions that technology cannot
remedy in the future. Density of cryonic suspension should be much higher
than a mauoleum, etc.

If cryonics goes to mass storage, I hope sufficient thought is lent to
keeping the remains identified such that the revived person can be given
the proper identity on reawakening. Visions of massive bureaucratic
screwups arise..

Many people will find transhumanism just distasteful. Why? The Christian
philosophy is based on the supernatural and death. "Jesus died for our
sins." "When you die, you go to Heaven." "Satan is in hell, the after
world of those who choose to not be with God." 

Transhumanism is just not compatible with the Christian viewpoint. Many
Christians I have talk too feel that transhumanist memes are the closest
thing they have ever heard to "satanism" they heard. Living forever is
considered to be a great evil to most Christians.

If you go to your local bookstore, I dare you to find more than 10 books
on HUMANISM. Then look for how many books were on religion (way over
100) and probably just as many on the "new age" movement. Few books on
reason, science, humanism, or transhumanism, when looking at the grand
total of the books there. Why? Bookstores sell what people buy.

I have thought of this idea with nodes for some time. And I find the
idea very bad. Even the idea of splitting up this list in an expert and
a novice list is a bad idea.

The reasons I have are the following two:



- Network economics...
A thing that is worse than a noisy maillist is twenty empty maillists.
As I'm shure everybody on this list is aware of, the value of a network
grows with the number of members squared. A maillist is a network. When
splitting up a maillist into nodes or interrestgroups the value of these
nodes combined will be smaller than the value of one big node.
Naturally the noise level of the big node will probably be bigger than
in the many seperate nodes. Therefore a node will only increase in value
until a certain point. I am pretty shure that the Exi list is so far
from this point that it will be a bad idea to split it up.

I spend my working time building comunities in intranets and the
Internet. My experience is that a LOT of people has to use something
like a maillist for it to be of any interrest. If not... interrest
simply fades away. This could easily happen for Exi.



- The succes of the Internet... The ability to reach out.
The main reason for the succes of the net, I think, is that it gives
everybody the ability to reach out and touch anybody they want to. The
Exi list gives us the abillity to discuss with the "leaders" in
transhumanism and extropy, and by participating long enough, to maybe
become one of the leaders ourselves.
If the level of acces becomes to high Exi will loose what I find is the
main oportunity to "recruit" new brains. Even though some of these
brains initially will need som guidance in order keep the noise level
down.
Splitting up the Exi list and closing of some areas works against a
proven good formula. The net itself.



I do think though that there is a good way to make everybody happy. It
is very easy these days to make a private news server. This way nobody
has to download to much mail, it's easy to kill a boring thread, and you
can just choose not to read messages from people you find are noisy. It
also makes automatic archives. Besides it is pretty easy for somebody
with a little technical savy to combine it with a maillist.

Well just my $0.02 worth

All your ideas are "New Age illusions expressed in
the language of hard science" and you're all
"irrational."  Further more, "women will give
birth to babies, slaves won't do all the work, we
can't live forever and we will remain flesh."  At
least that's the opinion of Richard Barbrook in
his article THE SACRED CYBORG.

http://www.heise.de/bin/tp/issue/
tp.htm?artikelnr=6063&mode=html

(Excuse the line break)

"Obsessed with creating the God-Man, the
privileged can ignore the continued existence of
arbitrary power and economic injustice. Believing
that  they're about to become post-human, members
of the 'virtual class' are able to suppress their
troublesome feelings of solidarity with humanity
as a whole."

Neutrino finding could be key breakthrough in physics 

Copyright © 1998 Nando.net
Copyright © 1998 Reuters News Service 
NEW YORK (June 5, 1998 11:56 a.m. EDT http://www.nando.net) - Scientists said
Thursday they have evidence that tiny sub-atomic particles called neutrinos
have mass, a finding that could be key to establishing the Grand Unification
theory of physics. 
Physicists said that if the finding is confirmed by future experiments, it
will
cause a revision of the so-called Standard Model that describes
interactions of
elementary particle physics. In the Standard Model, neutrinos have no mass. 
"These new results could prove to be the key to finding the Holy Grail of
physics, the unified theory," said John Learned, University of Hawaii
Professor
of Physics and Astronomy and one of the authors of a paper on a neutrinos
experiment in Japan. 
"Neutrinos cannot now be neglected in the bookkeeping of the mass of the
universe." 
The unified theory of physics, also called the Grand Unification, is what
scientists would like to see: A combination of what is known as strong
interaction, weak interaction and electromagnetism theory in a single
framework. 
Grand Unification is a step removed however from the great quest of 20th
century physics -- coming up with the so-called "theory of everything" in our
universe that would also describe gravitational force. 
Known to physicists as the "Superstring theory" it would explain everything
from what it was like in the milliseconds immediately after the Big Bang to
what keeps people and objects rooted to Earth. 
The latest finding, to be presented in a paper Friday at a conference of
physics and astrophysics in Takayama, Japan, caused excitement in the
international physicist community. 
"It's a really incredibly exciting moment because of all of the particles we
know neutrinos are among the most mysterious," said Professor Chang Kee
Jung of
SUNY StonyBrook in New York, one of the universities that took part in the
experiment. 
He said neutrinos are tiny particles that float around without much
interaction. About 500 billion neutrinos can pass by a person's fingertip
every
second. 
Neutrinos were discovered four decades ago and have been the subject of
intense
experimental and theoretical research. 
An experiment deep inside a Japanese mine has yielded results that are outside
the Standard Model theory of elementary particle physics, which describes the
fundamental constituents of matter and their interactions. 
"So far the Standard Model works really well, we can explain just about
everything we see but we know there has got to be something more out there,"
said Dr. Evalyn Gates, a research scientist at the University of Chicago who
was not involved in the project. 
"Knowing that neutrinos do have mass begins to direct some of these models. It
would be the first definite evidence of new physics and that's why everyone is
excited about this." 
The paper presented Friday in Japan has been sent to the Physical Review
Letters, a physics journal. It describes results from the first two years of
data collected from a $100 million experiment called Super-Kamiokande. 
The experiment uses a 12.5 million gallon stainless steel-lined tank of highly
purified water located about 3,300 feet underground in a Japanese mine. Faint
flashes of light given off by the neutrino interactions in the tank were
observed by 13,000 lights. 
The collaboration involves the University of Tokyo's Institute for Cosmic Ray
Research and includes six U.S. universities and eight from Japan.

You know, I bet a lot of people would be quite surprised to find out what
Satanism really is about, rather than what the press says it's about.

IT depends what kind. The official church of satan in California (has
non-profit, tax-exempt status is different from the black magick kind.

While I haven't seen the movie, reports make it sound very much like a
Philip K. Dick novel (especially TIME OUT OF JOINT, THE COSMIC PUPPETS or
EYE IN THE SKY), perhaps spliced onto Robert Heinlein's classic `The
Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag' and `They'.  All the more reason to
see it, of course - but I'm wondering if any of the reviewers have made
these connections?  Those I've read all act as if the idea sprang from
nowhere in a blast of sheer genius into the brain of Andrew Niccol.

In orbit around what?  Earth?  How would you cool them?  Refrigeration
machinery?  Who maintains it and makes sure it doesn't break down?

Natasha and I just went to see it. I agree that it is reminiscent of the
above references. Right near the beginning, I also thought "The Prisoner"!,
and "Blade Runner" and "Total Recall" (the latter being based on a P.K.
Dick short story) -- all have the theme of "reality isn't what it seems".

I wish I could say more about the thoughts I had watching the movie, but I
don't want to spoil it....

Dear fellow Transhumans,

Below some short impressions from various participants of the first
European Transhumanist Gathering, more later. Information about Transvision
'98 can be found on the Transcedo website http://www.transcedo.org.

Regards,
Arjen Kamphuis
Transcedo

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------
Waldemar Ingdahl, Aleph Sweden:
Incredible, there are quite a few transhumanists in Europe, and now that we
have met we can start to plan about some serious stuff. Let us organize a
European Meeting in 1999 too.

Ake Brannstrom, Aleph, Sweden:
It's fun, and I think that Amsterdam is an excellent city to host
TransVision. I hope to see you there next year!

Gernot Faulseit, Germany:
Pretty interesting, nice city, nice people - just a perfect atmosphere to
discuss Transhuman goals. To the rest of the German Transhumanists: We need
our own association!!

Anders Sandberg, Aleph, Sweden:
This is the start of something great.

Felix Ungman, Aleph, ExI, World
TransVisionaries of the world are uniting.

Erik Moeller, Germany:
Sweet location. It is certainly interesting to meet the people you have
only talked to via email before. Anyone who did not come missed something,
although it is hard to describe what.

Remi Sussan, France:
Really great event!

Klaus Mathwig, Germany:
Great event, we should start a german transhumanist organization.

Sven Visser, Transcedo, ExI, the Netherlands:
Having a great time whitnessing the beginning of great things to come.

Holger Wagner:
It's nice to see some of the bodies, mimics and gestures that belong to the
ASCII-communication on the mailing-lists. We should do this somewhat more
often until we have life-like Avatars ;-)

Henrik Alpsten:
Killroy wasn't here. But all the other nice guys in european Transhumansm
are. Nice seeing the faces, some realtime presentations and having fun at
the same time.

Henri Kluytmans:
I think part of the future of transhumanism is being shaped here. I'm
thrilled to be here.
I hope this is only the first of a yearly event.

I think we can atract a lot more "new" Transhumanists. At least all the

now are very much willing to cooperate and build a solid Transhuman-network.

The movie was originally inspired by 'the Gods Must Be Crazy', and there is
a short homage to that movie at the very beginning, along with an homage to
'The Prisoner'.  The directors cited a few other cinematic and philosophical
references, but no science fiction.  Peter Weir, one of the directors, tends
more towards literature and European philosophy.  The underlying themes of
the movie, some cultural and some philosophical, are universal enough to
have found their way into many genres throughout literature.  I certainly
don't think that any science fiction writers invented those themes, although
many have found interesting applications for them.   

I just realized that our European friends probably won't get to see this for
the next year...

Once in orbit, you need no refrigeration, just a sun shield. Vacuum is the
ultimate insulator.

I would be more fearful of micrometeorites and space junk in Earth orbit.
How about one of the Lagrange points? Perhaps the storage facility would be
connected with the L5 habitat?

I've been traveling and I'm not sure if I answered this yet. I couldn't
really spare the time to do this myself, but I would participate in
discussions. I also have several thousand e-mail addresses of people who
have participated in surveys at my original TTM Web site in 1996, and
hundreds more who mailed in surveys from the books. I'll be happy to
supply these addressed to whoever runs the list (which I think could
even make some money by setting up a bookstore link to amazon.com)

The following report makes a seemingly compelling
case for banning a type of genetically altered
seed, known as the "Terminator Technology" (TT).

http://www.arkinstitute.com/98/up0606.htm 

I'd like to see counter arguments to it
before I make up my mind. Here's the 
picture the report painted for me:

In a nutshell, the TT causes a genetically 
altered crop to yield only seeds that will
NOT grow. This ensures that farmers cannot
resell hybrid strains and that the farmers 
cannot produce their own seeds and thereby 
become independent of the seed company. 

Concern focuses on the possibility and apparent
plan of the major seed companies to convert all
agriculture to crops "dead-ended" by a TT genetic
dead-seed sequence, which would mean that all 
farmers and the people they feed would be depen-
dent on the few seed companies to supply seeds 
for the next years harvest, and these companies 
seem to be merging into one. In short, if TT 
crops took over, no one could grow their own 
food from the seeds that they themselves grew.

But could TT crops take over? Maybe so...

Concern also focuses on the possibility that 
TT genetic information will spread to other 
crops in areas where farmers had chosen NOT 
to use TT controlled crops, thereby slowly 
forcing them under the control of the seed 
companies because their crops now increasingly 
yield dead seeds. In short, a vision of global 
domination by a few seed companies is presented 
in the cited report as a possibility. Reading 
about the merging of these companies into 
larger entities fits into such a scenario
and takes it to the extreme Supreme Monopoly.

Even short of nightmare of total food control
by an evil monopoly is the concern of a seed-kill 
genetic sequence being set loose into the gene 
pools of various human life-sustaining crops.
The process of seed-to-crop-to-seed... has 
been and is what has keeps humans alive!
A genetic code that breaks that cycle
could have devastating repercussions.


SO, is this just anti-technology paranoia, or is
there real reason here to be concerned and maybe
even to call for the outright prohibition of TT?

It's obvious that if each farmer chooses to 
purchase TT controlled seeds, it's their choice,
and that's freedom. True, but people CAN choose 
to become slaves, particularly if they can't see
exactly how their choices now will lead to that.
If every farmer thinks, "I'll do the TT seeds be-
cause they are RoundUp resistant, so I can kill
all weeds," no one farmer chooses to become a slave
(each assuming other seeds would still be around),
but because all other non-TT seeds went out of 
business, All the farmers choose slavery!

So X might in fact not be able to sucker any one 
farmer to purchase slavery, and yet X could sucker,
and only sucker, them All, so long as each assumes
other farmers will support non-TT seed companies
to the extent they even consider that they need 
other seed options to exist to be free farmers.

I would assume that seeds which don't reproduce would be considerably
less expensive than seeds which can be reproduced.  (I don't know how
well modern hybrid seeds can be reproduced over multiple generations.)
Selling a reproducible seed, you have to make all the profit in one sale
for multiple generations of seeds.  Selling seeds which last only for
one generation allows you to get by with a much smaller profit.

Ian, I think you cry "wolf" too quickly.

The granting of a patent does not grant the right to produce something,
merely the right to prevent others from producing it for 20 years.  If
collectively we ban such a gene's sale, the patent holder has no right to
sell it.  Thus, for instance, there are patents for LSD synthesis that are
not usable to make an openly salable product.

As to such a gene "escaping" into other crops....  If a gene makes a life
form's descendants LESS likely to reproduce that gene, then the gene tends
to die out in the evolutionary competition.  Only a strong selective
pressure (like a company producing these TT seeds with OTHER, DESIREABLE
characteristics) would given them even a brief existance in the single
generation that would live.  Imagine: if the TT gene got into any
individuals of another variety or species, the TT-inheriting individuals
would live their life and produce absolutely NO descendants.  End of
problem, no?

I quite agree. But, also, the philosophy of Extropianism, particularly its
politico-social philosophy might be appropriately restricted by the
specialization and stratification of the nodes. For instance, the political
arguments may not find there way on to the scientific lists. In many ways I
consider this a good thing. One of the strong attractions of Extropianism
for me is its transhuman interests which lend themselves to scientific
debate, without getting lost in the mire of political thought. (Not to say
that the two aren't interlinked, or that that linkage is not important.
Merely to say that sometimes separation is a good thing.)

Or, if it really takes off, more than pay for itself. And that revenue
would form the basis of ExI's ability to further expand, including,
perhaps, the awarding of grants to certain parties.

Following the posts about humanism and satanism. I sat on the train to work
this morning, next to a woman reading the Bible. I was reading a book by
Paul Davies on GUTs and quantum physics. Somehow, I couldn't help feeling
that both my travelling companion and I were looking for the same thing in
our choices of literature.

If the ability to interrelate the specialized Nodes is retained through

The ExI list will never reach this point as it stands, because it's
structure is not attractive to the sort of specialist who can actually
bring about Extropian ideals. The concept of Nodes is intended to be
attractive to such people. Nodes do not replace this list, they serve to
augment it by a marketing strategy with an appropriately specialist-facing
twist.

Equally, interest fades where discussion does not translate in to action.
ExI should not be an observer, it should be a creator. Nodes may well allow
ExI to become such a creator.

The specialist who would be attracted to the Nodes would not want to be

And a poor article at that.  Peter Sommer, senior research fellow at the London
School of Economics says that to hit a major network you need to know "...what
back-up there is," "You would need to infiltrate someone into the
organisation," and "They would need to know how to write code and introduce it
onto the system." 

Do any security experts on this list think that hacking involves back-ups? 
that hacking requires a person on the inside?  or that hacking requires code
writing and an entry point to run code on the system?

The article then goes on to dismiss teenage hackers as being "lucky" rather
than skillful when they crack into military computers.  The article dismisses
Cyber Terrorism as being a "Theoretical Danger", but not actually likely to
ever happen.

I just read a very pro-extropian article on CNN:

...it quotes Moravec et al, and the author writes that we may be
"standing at the crossroads of a change in the definition of

I'm not a security "expert", but I am a sysadmin at a financial site, so I 
do have to deal with security issues.
Back-ups are a critical element in security. If you have backups that can be
trusted, the damage to financial data can be limited to only that which has
changed in the time since the attack. Believe me, having to reenter one day 
of data is far better than having to reenter a couple months of it (I've been
through both situations at my current company). If you are trying to nail a 
system for the long term rather than just a quick raid that destroys some
data, or causes some action to be taken, the backups are a very high priority
to subvert. If you can put false data into the backups over a period of time
or otherwise make them untrustworthy, that greatly increases the damage to 
systems involved in record keeping, or transaction processing. It's less so 
for systems that are only involved in control, and don't keep long term
records
but even there, it's a major target. It's far faster to reinstall a complex 
system from a full backup, than to reinstall everything piecemeal, and have to
set all the system parameters again.
As to the part about needing to get into the organization to get into the 
systems and subvert them, it depends. For most of the sites on the internet,
no. For sites running high level secure systems, provided they aren't making
silly mistakes, it's probably the most straightforward way to get at them.

There are two parts to my answer to this. Are there dangers? Yes.
But; Are the dangers being inflated? Yes.
Most of the hackers that I've encountered are script kiddies. They use
prepared
scripts to exploit known system weaknesses, and don't really have the info to
find new ones, save through getting lucky. There's a smaller group that do
have
the skills and understanding. If it's a government trying to target your
system
as in true info warfare, that's a whole different ball game, as they have 
a lot of resources, and likely will be trying to infiltrate not only your 
network, but your organization as well.
I've seen an awful lot of hype about info war and cyber terrorism, and a
lot of 
it has come from people who want to sell me, and the company I work for a new
spiffy security system that will solve the problem of all those evil crackers
out there. What I've found is that the best defense is exactly what one of the
people quoted in the article either implies or mentions directly. Thoroughly
trained, alert, and technically skilled admins, combined with
auditing/security 
policies that make sure the known holes are plugged, and the users are trained
how not to make the worst of the common security mistakes. 

And would our government make use of fears over this to push key escrow, and
other policies? Well, in light of such things as the CDA, I leave that 
as an exercise for the reader.

Hmm. I sketched one possible solution, that _might_ be feasible, with a 
lot of work.  Other solutions might also be feasible, and perhaps 
function rather better.  I'd be interested to hear other people's 
suggestions.

> One other answer is, 'marketing'

Marketing only works up to a point, and it costs money.  I don't know how 
much money has been invested in Usenet, but I imagine hundreds of 
millions, at a minimum. Certain key players, such as Microsoft and 
Netscape, have invested considerable time and resources in integrating 
Usenet into their product.

Overcoming this initial investment will require some pretty hefty 
marketing. I note that Usenet II does not seem to have taken off.

  IAN: But even after 20 years you cannot grow

  owe you seeds that will yield a crop next year,
  it's that if such seeds eventually dominate the
  market, there could be undesirable repercussions.

  It all centers around monopoly. So long as there 
  are a wide variety of options available, the event
  of universal mono-genetic "seed killing" crops and
  subsequent dependence upon 1 company is less likely.

  This issue does touch upon examples pertaining to 
  the anarco-libertarian case against patent monopoly.
  Also the value of private initiatives to warehouse
  seeds of all varieties of crops. If non-TT genes
  cannot be wiped out, the market could be there
  to bring them back when and if TT turns bad.

  The wise "marketeer" might go out and start

  IAN: This occurred to me, and as such, that the

  But constant cross pollination from neighboring

  define that as a property violation, not un-
  like a nuclear power plant being next door.

There will always be a market for viable-seed plants from home gardeners.
Reseeding plants can save a lot of time, and they also tend to do much
better than the first year's crop (especially with flowers such as
poppies) I assume this is because only the plants that are suited to one's
environmental conditions will go to seed, making the following year's crop
more consisently healthy.

If TT seeds companies ever start using their market share for the "powers
of evil", the companies that cater to home gardeners can enter the farming
business and make a killing.

If anyone is worried that even home gardeners will all switch to TT,
someone should make a "seed-bank" with frozen seeds for all the major
species of plants.  In the event that viable-seed plants for certain
species are completely eliminated by disuse, someone can unfreeze some
seeds and enter the market.

I have a feeling this is done for endangered plants, except that instead
of freezing the plants are grown in a large endangered-plant farm.  I
think this is an important initiative: just compare the number of types of
apple (probably around 100), to the number of types that exist at your
local grocery (probably no more than 4).  The other apples are not getting
used since they don't keep as well-- if they were not grown they would
disappear forever, which would be a very silly mistake.  How hard do you
think it would be to sell a bunch of health-conscious, enviro-friendly,
trendy yuppies some short-keeping specialty apples?  It would be tragic to
miss a business opportunity like that because no one though to freeze a
few seeds.

The movie was originally inspired by 'the Gods Must Be Crazy', and there is
a short homage to that movie at the very beginning, along with an homage to
'The Prisoner'.  The directors cited a few other cinematic and philosophical
references, but no science fiction.  Peter Weir, one of the directors, tends
more towards literature and European philosophy.  The underlying themes of
the movie, some cultural and some philosophical, are universal enough to
have found their way into many genres throughout literature.  I certainly

many have found interesting applications for them.   

I just realized that our European friends probably won't get to see this for

Once in orbit, you need no refrigeration, just a sun shield. Vacuum is the

I would be more fearful of micrometeorites and space junk in Earth orbit.
How about one of the Lagrange points? Perhaps the storage facility would be

Subject: Biotech-> Bio-TYRANNY ?

The following report makes a seemingly compelling
case for banning a type of genetically altered
seed, known as the "Terminator Technology" (TT).

http://www.arkinstitute.com/98/up0606.htm 

I'd like to see counter arguments to it
before I make up my mind. Here's the 
picture the report painted for me:

In a nutshell, the TT causes a genetically 
altered crop to yield only seeds that will
NOT grow. This ensures that farmers cannot
resell hybrid strains and that the farmers 
cannot produce their own seeds and thereby 
become independent of the seed company. 

Concern focuses on the possibility and apparent
plan of the major seed companies to convert all
agriculture to crops "dead-ended" by a TT genetic
dead-seed sequence, which would mean that all 
farmers and the people they feed would be depen-
dent on the few seed companies to supply seeds 
for the next years harvest, and these companies 
seem to be merging into one. In short, if TT 
crops took over, no one could grow their own 
food from the seeds that they themselves grew.

But could TT crops take over? Maybe so...

Concern also focuses on the possibility that 
TT genetic information will spread to other 
crops in areas where farmers had chosen NOT 
to use TT controlled crops, thereby slowly 
forcing them under the control of the seed 

companies because their crops now increasingly 
yield dead seeds. In short, a vision of global 
domination by a few seed companies is presented 
in the cited report as a possibility. Reading 
about the merging of these companies into 
larger entities fits into such a scenario
and takes it to the extreme Supreme Monopoly.

Even short of nightmare of total food control
by an evil monopoly is the concern of a seed-kill 
genetic sequence being set loose into the gene 
pools of various human life-sustaining crops.
The process of seed-to-crop-to-seed... has 
been and is what has keeps humans alive!
A genetic code that breaks that cycle
could have devastating repercussions.


SO, is this just anti-technology paranoia, or is
there real reason here to be concerned and maybe
even to call for the outright prohibition of TT?

It's obvious that if each farmer chooses to 
purchase TT controlled seeds, it's their choice,
and that's freedom. True, but people CAN choose 
to become slaves, particularly if they can't see
exactly how their choices now will lead to that.
If every farmer thinks, "I'll do the TT seeds be-
cause they are RoundUp resistant, so I can kill
all weeds," no one farmer chooses to become a slave
(each assuming other seeds would still be around),
but because all other non-TT seeds went out of 
business, All the farmers choose slavery!

So X might in fact not be able to sucker any one 
farmer to purchase slavery, and yet X could sucker,
and only sucker, them All, so long as each assumes
other farmers will support non-TT seed companies
to the extent they even consider that they need 
other seed options to exist to be free farmers.

I would assume that seeds which don't reproduce would be considerably
less expensive than seeds which can be reproduced.  (I don't know how
well modern hybrid seeds can be reproduced over multiple generations.)
Selling a reproducible seed, you have to make all the profit in one sale
for multiple generations of seeds.  Selling seeds which last only for
one generation allows you to get by with a much smaller profit.

Ian, I think you cry "wolf" too quickly.

The granting of a patent does not grant the right to produce something,
merely the right to prevent others from producing it for 20 years.  If
collectively we ban such a gene's sale, the patent holder has no right to
sell it.  Thus, for instance, there are patents for LSD synthesis that are
not usable to make an openly salable product.

As to such a gene "escaping" into other crops....  If a gene makes a life
form's descendants LESS likely to reproduce that gene, then the gene tends
to die out in the evolutionary competition.  Only a strong selective
pressure (like a company producing these TT seeds with OTHER, DESIREABLE
characteristics) would given them even a brief existance in the single
generation that would live.  Imagine: if the TT gene got into any
individuals of another variety or species, the TT-inheriting individuals
would live their life and produce absolutely NO descendants.  End of
problem, no?

I quite agree. But, also, the philosophy of Extropianism, particularly its
politico-social philosophy might be appropriately restricted by the
specialization and stratification of the nodes. For instance, the political
arguments may not find there way on to the scientific lists. In many ways I
consider this a good thing. One of the strong attractions of Extropianism
for me is its transhuman interests which lend themselves to scientific
debate, without getting lost in the mire of political thought. (Not to say
that the two aren't interlinked, or that that linkage is not important.
Merely to say that sometimes separation is a good thing.)

Or, if it really takes off, more than pay for itself. And that revenue
would form the basis of ExI's ability to further expand, including,
perhaps, the awarding of grants to certain parties.

If the ability to interrelate the specialized Nodes is retained through

The ExI list will never reach this point as it stands, because it's
structure is not attractive to the sort of specialist who can actually
bring about Extropian ideals. The concept of Nodes is intended to be
attractive to such people. Nodes do not replace this list, they serve to
augment it by a marketing strategy with an appropriately specialist-facing
twist.

Equally, interest fades where discussion does not translate in to action.
ExI should not be an observer, it should be a creator. Nodes may well allow
ExI to become such a creator.

The specialist who would be attracted to the Nodes would not want to be

networking Nirvana.

Do you think that Imhotep, Ben Franklin,
Leonardo da Vinci, and Archimedes would
subscribe to this list? Yeah, I do too.

So what about Buddha, Lao Tzu, Krishna,
Kabir, and Socrates? No, probably not...
having renounced renunciation and
debunked liberty, an open forum chat
might not interest them.

I imagine that men who attain greatness
have their attention primarily focused
on something other than attaining
greatness. Their greatness occurs as an
epiphenomenon, a side effect, a by
product of their obsession for
excellence, discovery, beauty,
mathematical eloquence... or whatever
defines their unique quest.

Cheers,

Actually there are thousands of types of apples and most other
common food plants, there are tens of thousands of rice varieties
for example.

The good news is that we are revisiting a topic discussed here
before, but I shall briefly recapitulate.

In the early 70's a group of amateur gardeners all concerned with
the disappearing variety's of favorite fruits and vegetables, and
the dwindling number of seed companies, began seeking out lost
varietys and each other to form what is known as "Heirloom
Gardening" (because varietys were handed down generation to
generation) This started largely with a man who noticed the
dwindling supplies (around the 1920's)and single-handedly preserved
over a thousand varieties of beans (most seeds need to be grown
every three years or so) this has grown into a worldwide movement
and new seed companies are emerging all the time. One of my
favorites is "Seeds Of Change". At the same time Cambell's is
creating the "flavorsavor" these people have brought back the
Brandywine (awesome). These companies all produce "open-pollinated"
seeds. Not only have they saved thousand's of old varietys, but
they are creating new ones.

New restaurants and some not so new (Chez Pannisse) are the driving
forces.

Seeds of change is also the name of a book on this movement.

Good news......

Considering that much of the Army thinking/mindset is still oriented toward
cavalry/infantry/artillery, that is retained from the 19th century, I'd expect
that they wouldn't have any serious y2k problems till at least 2100.....;)

All of our nations strategic nuke capability is in both the USAF or the Navy's
hands, so even if one of those is not prepared (I don't know about the navy, I
do know that the USAF has been well prepared) the other should be able to handle
the load....

Seriously, most military systems do not depend upon actual clocks that measure a
two digit year as is the problem with much COBOL programming. They typically use
simple counting circuits or programs that can be reset without loss of
capability.

I heartily concur. Striving to get beyond the limits that others, our world, or
our creators have placed on us is highly extropian....

Thats kinda the point. Merk acknowledges that red rice yeast extract contains a
chemical which is similar enough to their drug to have similar effect, but that it
is in fact, not the same chemical. I wonder when the FDA is gonna declare ginger
to be a controlled substance....or hot mustard or pepperocini.......or any of the
other hundreds of food items which are available to anyone which happen to contain
small levels of chemicals which have similar effects as some patented drugs....

Dear fellow (trans)human(ist)s,

A short and very personal report on some of the things that happened at
Transvision '98. More details and pictures will soon be availabe on the
Transcedo website http://www.transcedo.org with links to related sites,
documents and pictures.

          --- Weesp (The Netherlands). 5-06-1998, 18:00 hrs CET. ---
After a week of testing beta-code abroad I arrived somewhat late at our
hotel in Weesp, near Amsterdam. I recognized Anders from a picture I once
saw, lot's of other people that I must have talked with many times but had
never seen. I don't think I'll quickly get used to 'knowing' people without
having seen them ;-). I was immediatly having trouble connecting names to
faces (were are those remembrance agents!).

After passing out the T-shirts to everybody (Gareth Smith - Alcor UK - was
very happy with his shirt displaying Beavis & Butthead waist-deep in ice
saying 'cryonics is cool') we all went next-door for dinner. All trough the
three-courses (good thing they had these multi-lingual menu-cards) there
was lively conversation about all things transhuman. Swapped SF-stories
with Gareth and discussed state-of-the-art computer technology with Holger
and Klaus (?). After dinner we took a short walk across the typical Dutch
town of Weesp (canals, cute houses, fortress and al that), conversation
never let up. A bunch of us found a pub were some Dutch and Belgian special
beers could be tasted, a perfect place to have a discussion about
media-attention and how to use it effectively.

The next morning most transhumanists seemed to be up & functioning again. 
One of the other hotelguests asked us whether we were a religious cult or
something (might have been the T-shirts). Berrie and I explained that we
were studing the future, the elderly lady agreed that this was 'most
important'. Didn't ask her E-mail, darn!

Berrie Staring opened Transvision '98 officially and gave a presentation
about how Transcedo came about, what we wanted to achieve and our ideas
about global- and European cooperation between transhumanist organisations.
Then Nick Bstrom started of his presentation about the WTA
(http://www.transhumanist.com) with a rather 'cultish' visualisation
exercise. "Now all close your eyes and think about how good you felt during
the greatest moment of your life, now imagine a future that can be much
better than this and that lasts forever...". Quite a compelling image.
After this warm-up Nick talked about why he had founded the World
Transhumanist Association, it's structure and relation to Transhumanist
organisations everywhere. Nick's presentation ended in discussion and...
Lunch! Bread and Dutch hot-meatsnacks known as 'kroketten'. Since the
thunderstorm seemed to be taking an lunch-break also we went outside for
some photo-opportunities by the canal.

Anders Sandberg talked & gestured about 'How to lead a transhuman life'.
All the things one can do _now_ with an emphasis on our motivational
system. This presentation can best be described by Anders himself and he
will do so at some time in the future on his website
http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/. So be patient ;-)

In spite of the very interesting speech Anders had given my sleep-shortage
was feeling quite serious by now wich was bad since I was next in line as a
speaker. A caffeine-injection got me going again and I played my role as
devil's advocate trying to explain why  I wasn't thinking about a
cryo-contract. Using mountainclimbing as an example of pushing your limits
'till it kills you. Gareth Smith was looking physically affected after a
while and since dead-bodies at a Transhumanst convention would make bad
press a decided to call it quits and put forth my two other 'points for
discussion'
- How to make new technology's acceptable? 
Taking IVF (In Vitro Fertilisation) as an example I proposed that finding a
economical application was the shortest route. In the case of IVF that did
the trick in about 10 years. Not everybody agreed and that was precisely my
intention.
- More jokes! We need more humor in our communication of Transhuman memes.
The T-shirts with Beavis&Butthead 'cryonics is cool' are a big hit. If we
are talking to people about heavy subject like (the prevention of)death and
immortality and such it would be good to 'lighten up' things every now and
then with a joke.

After this Berrie was wrapping-up the afternoon when I felt 'that sinking
feeling' one has when suffering _severe_ sleep deprivation. So I took the
only real medicine: A long night of sleep. Regrettably this meant I missed
the second dinner and many, undoubtedly facinating & fun discussions.
Whilst my unconsious body was recouperating from the last week several
participants visited Amsterdam or closerby night-life.

The next morning several people felt the consequences of cerebral
de-hydration caused by the consumption of serious amounts of alcohol (this
is to say, they had a hangover ;-). A bit later than planned Gareth Smith
got started on his presentation about cryonics. After some introductory
cryobiology he talked about how he made the desicion to sign up, and gave
some practical examples of the problems one encounters when setting-up
basic cryo-facility.
"You can win the lottery that gives immortality but it does require that
you buy a lotteryticket". A cryo-contract as a small investment for a shot
at immortality. There was much discussion about the practical
implementation of a European cryo-network. Probably the various
organisations wil share resources to make cryonics feasible in Europe
(training&education, installations and equipement). Holland, with it's
liberal laws on euthanasia could possibly be a very good place to have
suspensions under controlled circumstances. We will be looking into legal
loopholes that can be exloited, where neccesary.

During the follwing wrap-up some points were agreed on:

- There will be a Transhumanist gathering on the 4th through 6th of june 1999
  in Stockholm, Sweden, hosted by Aleph.
- German, French and Belgium sites & Transhumanist groups will be brought into
  existance and the other European oranisations wil assist them.
- Multi-lingual press-kits will become availiable on the various website's
- We will cooperate on processes and procedures relevant to dealing with 
  media-attention
- We will actively recruit new members trough the web and by other means
- Improved introductionary texts to Transhumanism will be created
- We will actively seek more structured funding
- Special Interest Groups for certain projects (such as a documentary on
  transhumanism fo a general audience and a memetics group) will be created.

In spite of some minor tehnical difficulties the first European
transhumanist gathering was a great succes. We had a number great
discussions, informal talks and most important: a lot of fun! I feel
confident that all participents feel strengthened and that these gatherings
will become regular milestones on the road of growing transhumanism in Europe.

On a more personal note, I'd like to thank everyone who helped organizing
this event, the speakers and everyone who made it great by attending and
particiating. Thank to you all!

Kind regards to all and looking forward to future meetings. European
transhumanism is on the move!

I had posted this a couple of weeks ago, but I was asked by a few to repost
it.  (Evidentally, somebody is quite curious about the misuses of art-:)
The book is _Art, The Arts, And The Great Ideas_ by Mortimer J. Adler.

I found it quite tasty because it explains a point of view about the
misconceptions of  "art" and how it is often thought usually thought of as
that stuff housed by museums and gallerys.  

"Throughout the dialogues of Plato and the treatises of Aristotle, the word
'art' is used as frequently as 'science,'….  Science and art are for the
Greeks the two fundamental forms of knowing - the former, knowing that,
what, why and wherefore; the latter, knowing how."  But don't let this
confuse you!  It's not as simple as it sounds -:)  

Adler discusses how the word "art" got so incredibly confusing in the 20th
century by everyone - especially by the art schools (i.e, fine art and
liberal art, the arts,
for example).  (re: chapter titled The Relevant Clarifying History)

Does a piece of visual or musical art have any content?  How is a sonata
different from a poem?  Continuing his thoughtful and though-provoking
exploration of the substance of basic education, Adler examines
the inherent value of various art forms and considers their significance
within a well-rounded curriculum.  He maintains that imaginative literature
and works of science, philosophy, theology, and history act upon our
intellects and stimulate the discussion  of ideas…

Although I do not agree in total with Alder's understanding of art in its
full interpretation (he, does state that art is often misrepresented and
all too often referred to something visual such as an artifact); I do
appreciate the following contribution Alder makes to the world of thinking:

"'Art' is one of the most misused words in the English language."  In the
chapter titled The Current Prevalent Confusions, Alder discussed
misconceptions about art, artist, artifact and work of art.   I found this
chapter particularly significant because he touches on the aspects of the
viewer or appreciator of art and the artist or person who possesses the
power to produce an object of art or a performance or concept. 

"Is not the art they [artists] possess the power to produce this or that
object, this or that performance?  Is it, therefore not reasonable to use
the word 'art' for the skill that makes a human being an 'artist,' and to
use the phrase 'work of art' [objet d'art] for the product of the artist's
productive activity?"

Here he states that there is an important contradiction in the above
statement if he make the mistake of continuing to think that "what adorns
museums of art and makes the name of such institutions intelligible to
us-is the misuse of the word "art" exclusively for paintings and sculpture."

I especially liked his summary argument where he discusses imagination,
ideas and perpetual thought (including cognitive acts) that "have reality
in the every-changing, sensible realm of becoming."

One way that I have found it useful to think about my role as artist
(electronic musician) is that I am entrusted with helping others to find
tools that elevate the human spirit. Artwerks are some of those tools.
Science and scientific discovery are others. Science and Art are both
discliplines which give humanity tools that they can use to elevate
their individual human spirit. They are clearly not the only ones. But
judging by how people prize them, they are important ones.

I have been enjoying the conference proceedings, and I see many names that
are new to me.

Having just joined the list, I wonder, did participants post introductions?
If not, may I suggest it?

Which "Blade Runner" -- the Ellison-based movie, or the Nourse book?

(The latter deserves to be made into a movie, IMHO.  Can someone suggest a 
suitable title for a movie about a smuggler of contraband surgical instruments?)

When people cite that example, I often wonder what their intent is.  When I 
inquire, I usually find they are citing it as an example of the technically superior 
system falling to an inferior system with better marketing.

But on closer examination I find that Beta's technical superiority over VHS has 
no significance in context; while VHS early on developed a critical technical 
superiority over Beta, that was not matched until it was too late to help.

Of Electric Sheep?"  The Harlan Ellison movie "A Boy and His Dog" was 
based on his novellette of the same name.

Is that a new transhuman smiley?  Or is it a typo, witht the eyes and nose

If art is the power (or method?) to produce certain works...  Does this imply
that there is a scientific method for one thing, and an artistic method for
something else?  I always felt (with no supporting documentation) that science
is the technical method of creating a work, but artistic talent was the
creative genius leading one to decide what to create.  An idea for something
new is art, the executiion of making the idea real often is technical
application of the idea.

In otherwords, I have assumed that the mixing of paint was technical and
scientific, but the choice of the exact shade one is trying to acheive was the
art.  Photography is a scientific process of captuing and image, but finding,
choosing and framing the image, and setting all the paramaters to get the right
shot, that is the art.

Of course this may be overly simplistic.  I often refer to Bloom's taxonomy of
knowledge.  It classifies "learning" or "knowledge" into six increasing levels
of difficulty, with each higher level requiring mastery of the previous
levels.  Naturally, I can't recall the first two levels which have to do with
memorization, so the first two may be confused in my recollection given here.

	 (Lowest level of understanding.)
	1  Recognition of something as being seen before.
	2. Knowledge/Memorization the recall of information without a trigger
stimulus.
	3. Application is knowing how to use the information in a new situation. 
	4. Analysis is scientific study of how the information or methods work.
	5. Evaluation is deciding if knowledge of methods are accurate, useful or
better/worse than other knowledge or methods.
	6. Synthesis is creating new information or methods.
	(Highest level of understanding)

Huh? Next to a Betamax, VHS looked like someone drawing with dull
crayons, it wasn't until they developed Super-VHS that the quality
was compatible.

VHS's success came from being much cheaper than Beta, I also side
with those who say it was because Sony chairman Akia Morrita
wouldn't allow Beta to be used for pornography.

I believe we now know all we need to know about this "reporter".

Judging from the inaccuracies of the article in question, I believe

Largest-ever survey of the heavens about to begin 

Copyright © 1998 Nando.net
Copyright © 1998 The Associated Press 
SAN DIEGO (June 8, 1998 10:50 p.m. EDT http://www.nando.net) -- The most
ambitious mapping of the heavens ever undertaken is about to start from a
remote observatory in New Mexico, using the most complex camera ever built. 
The $77 million project, called the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, will probe 40
times farther into the universe than any earlier survey, taking pictures in
three dimensions and in five colors, astronomers announced here Monday. 
When the survey is complete, it will provide an atlas of the skies 100 times
clearer than the star charts relied upon for decades and will have pinpointed
the location of more than 100 million galaxies. 
Yet, the survey will produce images that anyone will be able to view on a
computer. One day, say the astronomers, schoolchildren will be able to display
on their computers the same images experts use to study the heavens. 
"This is not just a telescope," said Jim Crocker of Johns Hopkins University,
one of nine organizations participating in the project. "This is a science
factory." 
Members of the project team unfurled a 35-foot-long photo swatch of the
heavens
taken during the project's "first light," the initial pictures taken by a new
telescope. The photo contained thousands upon thousands of stellar objects in
different colors. 
"What you see is 1 percent of one second of data from this instrument," said
Bruce Margon of the University of Washington, the science director of the
project. He said that by the time the survey is finished, it will have
collected 10 terabytes (10 followed by 13 zeros) of data. The amount of data
will equal what is now stored in the Library of Congress. 
The goal is to completely map, in three dimensions, more than half of the
heavens, cataloging 100 million of the brightest galaxies and 100,000 quasars.
>From its location at Apache Point, N.M., north of White Sands, the telescope
cannot see some of the sky over the Southern Hemisphere. 
For the galaxy catalog, the telescope will be able to detect objects out to 2
billion light-years. For quasars, the most energetic objects in the universe,
the telescope will see out to 10 billion light-years. A light-year is the
distance travels in one year, or about 6 trillion miles. 
"For quasars, we get to the very end (of the universe), as deep as the Hubble"
Space Telescope, said Neta Bahcall, a Princeton astronomer and a member of the
survey team. 
The 2.5-meter telescope is teamed with a digital camera that Mike Turner of
Fermilab, one of the sponsoring institutions, called "the most complicated
camera ever built." 
The camera includes 54 light amplifiers and is able to gather more pixels of
light than the human eye. In contrast to digital cameras that capture
images on
tiny chips of silicon, the camera includes a full square foot of silicon. 
Images, in digital form, flow from the camera into a computer system at the
rate of 8.5 million bytes a second, said Constance Rockosi, a University of
Chicago graduate student credited with much of the key assembly work on the
camera. 
The system includes two spectrographs, instruments that break down the
wavelengths of light, that will be able to tell the composition of objects,
their speed of motion and their distance from Earth. 
Spectrographs have been used for decades by astronomers, but not like this,
said Crocker. 
"In the first two weeks, we will collect more spectra than all of the other
surveys in history," he said. 
Margon said the current sky survey by astronomers is a 40-year-old collection
of black-and-white photo plates taken at the Palomar Observatory with a
conventional astronomy camera. 
The new survey will go out at least 40 times farther and will be in five
colors. "This will be a permanent digital encyclopedia of the sky," he said. 
Eventually, the work will be contained on 200 CD ROM computer disks and be
available on the Internet. People will be able to slip in a disk or connect to
the Web site "www.sdss.org" and see high definition views of the heavens. 
"For generations to come, many groups will be able to study galaxies and
clusters of galaxies," said Bahcall. "With this data, we'll be able to take a
journey through the universe." 
The first light image of the survey was unveiled at the national meeting of
the
American Astronomical Society.

I'm pretty sure Lao Tzu would be interested is some of the things we talk

degree the same is true of Buddha. Kabir didn't have the intellectual 
firepower of a Lao Tzu but I'll bet he was a nice person, almost a 
libertarian, can't say the same for his later followers, the Sikhs. It's hard 
to say anything meaningful about Krishna, his incarnations seem contradictory 
and it gets mighty confusing, I can't help thinking of him as a cartoon 
character. If Socrates were on the list I doubt if I'd agree with him much, 
but I would value him because the man was intelligent, knew how to argue, and 
he had the ability to laugh at himself. If Jesus or Mohammed subscribed I'd 
put them in my kill file along with the $$ MAKE BIG MONEY NOW $$  people.

A bit of an exaggeration, Betamax gave a better picture but the difference 
was subtle, so subtle you couldn't even tell the difference unless you had a 
very good and expensive TV, and there are more important technical 
considerations. When VHS first cane out it could record 2 hours on one 
cassette, Betamax could only handle one, by the time Betamax cane out with 
2 hours VHS was up to 4 and very soon after that 6 hour. Remember this was a 
time when blank cassettes or either type were very expensive, about $20 each, 
and that was in 1980 dollars.

Hopefully this message won't vanish into limbo the way that everything else
I've sent in the last month or so has done. 

As far as I'm aware, the basic difference between VHS and Betamax is that
VHS stores luminance and chrominance information on the same track, while
Betamax (like professional Beta formats) stores them on seperate tracks.
Consequently Betamax gave a better picture than VHS even though the basic
resolution was roughly the same; this is also why Betacam usually gives 
better pictures than Hi8, Super-VHS and DVC even though Betacam's 
resolution is lower.

>From the research I've done, the fundamental problem in the Betamax vs
VHS war was almost the same as Apple vs IBM; Sony wanted to screw their
customers for as much money as they could get by being the sole supplier
of Betamax systems, while JVC licensed VHS to anyone who wanted it. As a
result, VHS bloomed and Betamax languished. The small technical benefits
of Betamax over VHS just weren't worth the additional cost and hassle.

But it's irrelevant to me as my main VCR is Hi8...

In Response to John Clark, Mike Lorrey and others:

A lot of the points you raise miss the point, because of some 
common misunderstandings.  I propose to essay a clarification!


 Classical Mechanics is essentially Euclid's geometry with the addition of 
 mass-points and vector forces (forces having direction and magnitude).


 Newton's Three Laws of Motion are its foundation.


 Newton added his (confusing) theory of gravitation to create Newtonian 
 physics.  Confusing, because Newton treats gravitation as acting 
 instantaneously at a distance, even while denying this!  He had to deny 
 it, because action-at-a-distance was 'occult' and proposing it would have 
 put his life at risk.


 His 'corpuscular' theory of light, and his ideas on electricity and 
 magnetism, were never fully included into the Newtonian programme.

 In the early 1800s, 'aether' theories of both light and electromagnetism 
 gained the ascendancy.  The aether fills all of space: light is waves in 
 the aether; and electric and magnetic forces are transmitted via the 
 aether.

 Electrodynamics divided, into the English programs of Faraday (fields of 
 force) and Maxwell (aether force-transmission); and the Continental 
 programs of Weber, Helmholtz etc., in which electric and magnetic forces 
 are Newtonian instantaneous action-at-a-distance forces, or delayed 
 action-at-a-distance forces.

 By the end of the 19th Century, Maxwell's unified theory of light and 
 electromagnetism, with an aether, had won out, consigning Faraday's field 
 theory to history (for a while); and consigning particle theories of 
 light to history (for a while).

 Maxwell's theory does conform fully with Classical Mechanics.


 Thus we had arrived at 'Classical Physics' -- Newtonian Mechanics plus 
 Maxwell's electromagnetics.  Physics seemed 'complete.'  Two niggling 
 problem-situations remained: the lack of evidence for the aether itself; 
 and problems with the wave theory of light (black-body radiation; the 
 'ultraviolet catastrohe'; photoelectric effects; etc).


   I am _not_ proposing a return to 'Classical Physics.'

   I _am_ proposing a return to a 'particles, forces, empty space' 
   metaphysics.
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------
 
   I propose that we return to the point where aether theories gained the 
   ascendancy, and *instead* we take a different tack.  We continue with 
   the ballistic or 'particle' or 'quantum' theory of light -- we now know 
   that particle theories of light can predict, describe and explain all 
   optical phenomena: and we retain and integrate Faraday's fields of 
   force to include gravitation, electricity and magnetism.  It is 
   possible to do this in full compliance with Classical Mechanics and in 
   conformance with the physical electrical and magnetic evidence, as was 
   shown by Leigh Page, Professor of Mathematical Physics at Yale [1912] 
   and [1913].

   Using this theoretical system, we then 'walk back the cat' as the 
   counterspies say, and re-examine each 'crucial experiment' in the light 
   of present experimental knowledge.  Lo and behold, all the 'evidence' 
   for Special and General Relativity dissolves: Quantum Mechanics becomes 
   just a useful approximation method (without any mistaken reification of 
   its terms); and Quantum Electrodynamics becomes unnecessary.

   In result, we have a simplified, self-consistent and fully integrated 
   Physics, ready to advance into the territory presently occupied by 
   Quantum Chromodynamics.

If I've told myself once, I've told myself a million times, don't
exaggerate!   ;)

You may have me here on total history, My Betamax was/is (still
going) a Sony SuperBeta Theatre. It runs Beta I,II,III, and I
always ran it on Beta III, (3 hours recording) and always
demonstrated it side by side with a VHS that way. (dual trinitron
monitors) Under such conditions the difference was very striking,
not until Super-VHS was it even close.
 
So I guess I concede that Beta I and VHS were close.... :)

  IAN: The Sikhs became a warfare-associated religion
  (carrying of knives is a religious costume) only after
  attempts by others to exterminate them. The original guru
  of the Sikh tradition, Guru Nanak (1469), was very much a 
  libertarian. The work ethic and a de facto privet property 
  basis of free trade was and is the Sikh social ethic.

  Guru Nanak was against magic and ritual and persuaded
  people to look for the truth, not miracles and rites.
  It was not till Guru Gobind Singh, the ninth and final
  head Guru after Nanak, that Sikhs adopted the warrior
  model, but it's my understanding it was defensive.

  While Buddhism tends to be a religion where the highest
  ideal is retreat and contemplation, Sikhism's highest 
  ideal is of a religious householder involved in some 
  form of productive enterprise. Apart from the
  horrible examples of terrorism in modern Indian
  culture, Sikhism has strong libertarian ethics.

  IAN: Consider that most of mathematics kept 
  flowing out of India, even as math continued
  to progress, innovations like 0 and negative
  numbers came from India (via Arabia). I
  think that eastern thought is still hundreds
  of years a ahead of the West, and we can see 
  that in religion. Western religions are vir-
  tually all of a primitive tribal nature, but
  yogic, Buddhist, and Taoist philosophies (be
  they true or false) are phenomenally sublime
  and evolved observations of the nature of 
  being, mind, and reality, intricate sciences 
  of bodily postures and breathing systems that
  induce states of expanded awareness. These
  philosophies and technologies are, like our
  system of numbers, signs of high evolution.

  What the West has had, more than teaching 
  people about science, is free market capi-
  talism and limited government. Free markets
  have advanced our society more then science, 
  for example, the USSR produced more scientists
  than we did (I believe), but they went nowhere.
  A scientist with no captial investment is null.
  So the fact that we are more technologically
  evolved than the East creates an illusion 
  that we are more intellectually evolved,
  but in fact only measures that we had
  high IQ in the political areas expressed
  in willful limitations on central authority.

  The east has been drawn in totalitarian govt.
  If free-market capitalism could take over the 
  East, we'd see an explosion of technological,
  capital, and intellectual evolution the world 
  over, the likes of which we have never seen.

The Digital sky survey is going to accumulate massive ( many terabytes) of
data.  Fermi Lab in Batavia IL is a key sponsor of the project, handeling the
massive  data storage and manipulation.  They are experts, since the large
particel collider detectors also produce many terabytes of data.  
As these massive data projects proceed, we get closer to data storage
equivalent to what is necessary for uploading human  consciousness.  It is a
vital bridge technology.

Artists and scientists have similar techniques. Both start with some
problem or question. What makes things fall down? Why do I feel this way
about her? Who are our ancestors? Where's the party?
They both use instruments.
They both experiment and get assorted results.
They test the results-artists often by performing or showing the work.
They and thier peers often draw conclusions based on the work.
Both draw the fire of critics.
Both discliplines elevate the individual human spirit.

Huh? Next to a Betamax, VHS looked like someone drawing with dull
crayons, it wasn't until they developed Super-VHS that the quality
was compatible.

VHS's success came from being much cheaper than Beta, I also side
with those who say it was because Sony chairman Akia Morrita
wouldn't allow Beta to be used for pornography.

Largest-ever survey of the heavens about to begin 

Copyright © 1998 Nando.net
Copyright © 1998 The Associated Press 
SAN DIEGO (June 8, 1998 10:50 p.m. EDT http://www.nando.net) -- The most
ambitious mapping of the heavens ever undertaken is about to start from a
remote observatory in New Mexico, using the most complex camera ever built. 
The $77 million project, called the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, will probe 40
times farther into the universe than any earlier survey, taking pictures in
three dimensions and in five colors, astronomers announced here Monday. 
When the survey is complete, it will provide an atlas of the skies 100 times
clearer than the star charts relied upon for decades and will have pinpointed
the location of more than 100 million galaxies. 
Yet, the survey will produce images that anyone will be able to view on a
computer. One day, say the astronomers, schoolchildren will be able to display
on their computers the same images experts use to study the heavens. 
"This is not just a telescope," said Jim Crocker of Johns Hopkins University,
one of nine organizations participating in the project. "This is a science
factory." 
Members of the project team unfurled a 35-foot-long photo swatch of the
heavens
taken during the project's "first light," the initial pictures taken by a new
telescope. The photo contained thousands upon thousands of stellar objects in
different colors. 
"What you see is 1 percent of one second of data from this instrument," said
Bruce Margon of the University of Washington, the science director of the
project. He said that by the time the survey is finished, it will have
collected 10 terabytes (10 followed by 13 zeros) of data. The amount of data
will equal what is now stored in the Library of Congress. 
The goal is to completely map, in three dimensions, more than half of the
heavens, cataloging 100 million of the brightest galaxies and 100,000 quasars.
>From its location at Apache Point, N.M., north of White Sands, the telescope
cannot see some of the sky over the Southern Hemisphere. 
For the galaxy catalog, the telescope will be able to detect objects out to 2
billion light-years. For quasars, the most energetic objects in the universe,
the telescope will see out to 10 billion light-years. A light-year is the
distance travels in one year, or about 6 trillion miles. 
"For quasars, we get to the very end (of the universe), as deep as the Hubble"
Space Telescope, said Neta Bahcall, a Princeton astronomer and a member of the
survey team. 
The 2.5-meter telescope is teamed with a digital camera that Mike Turner of
Fermilab, one of the sponsoring institutions, called "the most complicated
camera ever built." 
The camera includes 54 light amplifiers and is able to gather more pixels of
light than the human eye. In contrast to digital cameras that capture
images on
tiny chips of silicon, the camera includes a full square foot of silicon. 
Images, in digital form, flow from the camera into a computer system at the
rate of 8.5 million bytes a second, said Constance Rockosi, a University of
Chicago graduate student credited with much of the key assembly work on the
camera. 
The system includes two spectrographs, instruments that break down the
wavelengths of light, that will be able to tell the composition of objects,
their speed of motion and their distance from Earth. 
Spectrographs have been used for decades by astronomers, but not like this,
said Crocker. 
"In the first two weeks, we will collect more spectra than all of the other
surveys in history," he said. 
Margon said the current sky survey by astronomers is a 40-year-old collection
of black-and-white photo plates taken at the Palomar Observatory with a
conventional astronomy camera. 
The new survey will go out at least 40 times farther and will be in five
colors. "This will be a permanent digital encyclopedia of the sky," he said. 
Eventually, the work will be contained on 200 CD ROM computer disks and be
available on the Internet. People will be able to slip in a disk or connect to
the Web site "www.sdss.org" and see high definition views of the heavens. 
"For generations to come, many groups will be able to study galaxies and
clusters of galaxies," said Bahcall. "With this data, we'll be able to take a
journey through the universe." 
The first light image of the survey was unveiled at the national meeting of
the
American Astronomical Society.

THEOLOGICAL ENGINEERING EXAM 1 5 Questions, 60 Minutes.

You may use a calculator, the Bible, the Koran, the Torah, and the 
Book of Mormon. The speed of light is c. Show all work. For all 
problems, assume a perfectly spherical Jesus of constant density D. No 
praying during the exam.

1. (20 pts.) Bob and Joe are standing on a street corner. God loves 
each an equal amount L_0. Bob then accelerates to .9c. In Joe's rest 
frame, how much does God now love Bob?

2. Sven, a Catholic, is in a state of grace. He then has sex with 
sheep S. a. (8 pts.) What is Sven's atonement coefficient following 
the act if the sheep was not willing? b. (12 pts.) What if the sheep, 
while not technically being willing, could not be said to mind either?

3. (20 pts.) Let the eternal, all abiding love of the Holy Spirit be 
the xy plane. Let Sue's soul be at (0,0,5) at t = 0 sec., traveling at 
5 m/s in the direction of the positive z axis. Everything is in 
Cartesian coor- -dinates bespeaking subscription to a perfectly 
rational Enlightenment attitude towards the Universe. At what time t 
will Sue be saved? (Hint: Assume a point soul.)

4. (20 pts.) Assume the Rapture occurs at time t. Cornelia, a saved 
human weighing 90 kg, in a state of grace, has her head in the closing 
jaws of an alligator at time t. What mass of meat will remain to the 
alligator at time t + 10 sec.?

5. Stan is a frictionless, massless Mormon in a rest state. His sin 
level for his faith is currently 11 McBeals. He eats .3 kg of pork, 
and enjoys it very much. Assume that the Jews are right about, well, 
pretty much everything. a. (10 pts.) What is Stan's sin level now?
 
b. (10 pts.) Stan is one of them Salt Lake City Mormons. He ain't so 
damn smug now, is he?

Extra Credit (10 pts): 25 grams of wafers and 20 ml of cheap wine 
undergo transubstantiation and become the flesh and blood of our 
Lord. How many Joules of heat are released by the transformation?
Hand in exam when done, and may God have mercy on your work.

Next to VHS, broadcast TV looked like someone drawing with crayons.  In fact, 
I routinely recorded movies on VHS at 1/3 speed (three two-hour movies on a 
tape) and couldn't tell the difference between VHS and cable.

Now if you can't tell the difference between VHS at its worst and broadcast at 
its best, how much of an advantage can Beta's higher quality be?

The early technical superiority of VHS over Beta typically became apparent 
approximately 61 minutes into the movie.  This was when the Beta tape 
reached its end and you had to change tapes -- missing part of the movie, if 
you were recording.  The VHS tape was only half gone.

A bit of an exaggeration, Betamax gave a better picture but the difference 
was subtle, so subtle you couldn't even tell the difference unless you had a 
very good and expensive TV, and there are more important technical 
considerations. When VHS first cane out it could record 2 hours on one 
cassette, Betamax could only handle one, by the time Betamax cane out with 
2 hours VHS was up to 4 and very soon after that 6 hour. Remember this was a 
time when blank cassettes or either type were very expensive, about $20 each, 
and that was in 1980 dollars.

I tend to disagree here (and not only here :-). Newton's laws are
invariant under Galilei transformations (e.g., x' = x + v*t, with
v=const), whereas Maxwell's equations are not. They are, however,
invariant under Lorentz transformations, and I think that's what Einstein
lead to applying them to mechanical problems as well, in order to explain
the Michelson-Morley experiments. The rest is history...

I'm pretty sure Lao Tzu would be interested is some of the things we talk

degree the same is true of Buddha. Kabir didn't have the intellectual 
firepower of a Lao Tzu but I'll bet he was a nice person, almost a 
libertarian, can't say the same for his later followers, the Sikhs. It's hard 
to say anything meaningful about Krishna, his incarnations seem contradictory 
and it gets mighty confusing, I can't help thinking of him as a cartoon 
character. If Socrates were on the list I doubt if I'd agree with him much, 
but I would value him because the man was intelligent, knew how to argue, and 
he had the ability to laugh at himself. If Jesus or Mohammed subscribed I'd 
put them in my kill file along with the $$ MAKE BIG MONEY NOW $$  people.

No it does not, although Maxwell tried very hard to make it do so. Maxwell's 
greatest triumph came when he proved that a changing electrical field creates 
a changing magnetic field and a changing magnetic field creates a changing 
electrical field. He then proved that this phenomena propagated as a wave at 
a speed of  1/(EM)^1/2 , where E and M are the well known electric and 
magnetic constants, this give a speed of 3*10^8 M/sec and this was exactly 
the speed for light that was experimentally and independently found. 
The match was too close, it couldn't be a coincidence, light must be an 
electromagnetic wave. 

There was one nagging little problem however, the electric and magnetic 
constants are the same for everybody, that's why they're called constants, 
and that means that the speed of light would be the same for every observer. 
Maxwell thought this was a (minor) flaw in his theory, he assumed that his 
derivation of the speed of light was only for an observer that was at 
absolute rest, but this assumption was definitely not in the equation, 
it said not one thing about the motion of an observer. Maxwell tried to 
modify his theory to make his assumption explicit but he failed, 40 years 
later Einstein explained why he failed and why a modification was not needed.

Ah, but that's NTSC... you should try PAL sometime. PAL VHS is lousy 
compared to broadcast video; Hi8 recordings are almost indistinguishable 
from the original PAL broadcast but there are still a few color problems.
I assume S-VHS is roughly the same.

But in that case I'd agree with this point.

The Washington Post Horizon section in today's issue devotes several 
pages to a summary of prevailing theories relating to the concept of 
programmed cell death.  Carrel and Hayflick are covered, as well as six 
other theories.  There is the briefest mention of calorie-restriction 
diets in the section on free radicals.  At the end, it is suggested 
that humans already gain cellular immortality via the transmission of 
genetic material into offspring, but I doubt that suffices for most of 
us!

Pfff.  I can't believe they said that.  Perhaps they think we should
imitate poor Henrietta Lacks, who died (young) 45 years ago of a nasty 
invasive liver tumor.  Her cells (HeLa) are now all over the planet
and will probably keep replicating for centuries.  How wonderful for her.

For details of Fermi labs data capacity, you might check their website
www.fnal.gov.  On my last tour there I think they said they have 40 Terabytes
disk space and 400 TBytes of robotic tape storage.  
Sony will sell you a standard product the "PetaSite" that holds 2 Petabytes,
or 2000 TBytes with robotic tape storage and retreival.  The robots move at 30
m/sec for faster access times.

Ken Musgrave (on George Mason University faculty and member of 
Siggraph) maintains an online gallery of his algorithmic images at 
http://www.seas.gmu.edu/faculty/musgrave/art_gallery.html.  You can 
find wonderful scientific images relating to planets, genetics, and 
even Mandelbrot's diffusion-limited aggregations (my favorite!)  
Musgrave worked with the Nasa Ames Visualization for Planetary 
Exploration Lab and other laboratories while developing these images.  
You can download into wallpaper for your PC or obtain posters for your

Please excuse the subject line exaggeration :-), because I have great
news.

The Cryopreservation of Hippocampal Slices project, to be jointly
conducted by the Institute for Neural Cryobiology (INC), was today
approved in all aspects by the host university medical research
institute. This means that lab space, animal care facilities, etc. at
that institution and their half of the approximately $150K budget which
will pay for salaries and supplies, have been made available to the
project which now has the official sponsorship and "sanction" of the
research institute. Please note, however, that this does still not mean
that we can publicly use their name even as related to INC. Among the
few minor changes that they made to the joint agreement was a more all
encompassing statement that their name could not be used at all without
their written permission in each case.

As I have stated before, the success of this project may produce a
combination of cryoprotectants and a method of introducing them which
when applied to whole brains enables their functionally reversible
cryopreservation. With hard work, and perhaps a bit of luck, my subject
line may turn out to be little exaggeration after all.  

This final approval of the project is what I have been waiting for
before asking for any more contributions in order that INC can fulfill
its obligations under the joint agreement to purchase and provide the
bulk of the advanced equipment (and get to retain ownership and future
use of that equipment, of course). At this time, we need about $45,000
in additional contributions to finance those purchases.

Though many people have done so already (see list below), now is the
time for all those people who supported the my efforts to jump-start
reverisble cryopreservation research by making pledges, to extend that
support as contributors to this enormously important, first real
project to arise from those efforts. I know that many of you had hoped
to be able to invest in the research work which would be done and I am
truly displeased that this has not so far been able to be accomplished
in a manner acceptable to most of you. However, I feel certain that
any money which you can contribute to this project will be repaid to
you manyfold as value of one kind or another. If we can make this
initial project into a major success, there may still be a chance for
significant portions of the original project ideas to be actualized.

Please send all contributions to:

The Institute for Neural Cryobiology
8439 White Oak Ave., Suite 110
Rancho Cucamonga, 91730-3860

I remind you again that all contributors will receive an official
donation receipt from INC which may be used to reduce their US federal
and California state taxable income on their next return.

I look forward to hearing from you and receiving your contributions.

"Chemical computer" key to future technology? 
June 11, 1998 08:22 PM 
By Michael Kahn 
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Reuters) - A supercomputer using factory-reject chips and
having more than 220,000 defects, each deadly enough to disable any other
machine, could be the forerunner of "chemical computers" that are faster,
cheaper and more powerful, researchers said on Thursday. 
The Teramac computer could offer engineers a way to build computers chemically
-- something necessary for innovation in the field to continue, they said in a
report published in the journal Science. 
"This is another path to hopefully continue the computer revolution," said
Philip Kuekes, a computer architect at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories HWP in
California, who helped build Teramac. 
Teramac's defect tolerance made the researchers realize they could
theoretically build smaller computers using chemistry. 
"Chemistry allows you to build very small things on an atomic scale even if
they aren't perfect," Kuekes said in a telephone interview. "We believe we can
build smaller-sized computer circuits using chemical reactions." 
He explained current silicon technology, which uses light to produce chips,
has
limitations. When wavelengths become too short they turn into X-rays and
damage
molecules, Kuekes said. 
"We can't keep going in that direction because we will eventually destroy what
we are trying to build," he said. 
But making components chemically allows computer builders to shrink the
size of
circuits. This means faster machines, Kuekes said. 
"The signals don't have as far to go and are much faster," Kuekes said. 
Teramac, for example, has more connections than normal computers and for
certain applications was 100 times faster than Hewlett-Packard's top
workstation, Kuekes pointed out. 
The computer was able to disregard the flaws because its makers set up the
wires and connections in a way similar to a series of city streets with no
dead
ends. This let Teramac route around defects by choosing a different pathway,
Kuekes said. 
"The computer solution found a solution that avoided the defect and worked
around them," Kuekes said. 
Using chemistry to make defect-tolerant computers will also help lower the
skyrocketing costs it takes to manufacture the chips needed to run computers,
the researchers said. 
"Today computer (chips) have to be perfect. The significance is it will drop
the cost if they don't have to be," Kuekes said. 
A large part of the expense in manufacturing microprocessors today is the
multibillion-dollar plants, where the cost of making perfect devices requires
increasing cleanliness and precision, he added. 
But with defect-tolerant computers these plants are unnecessary because the
chips need not be perfect. 
"As perfect devices become more expensive to fabricate, defect-tolerance
becomes a more valuable method to deal with imperfections," the authors
wrote. 
Jim Heath, a chemist at the University of California Los Angeles, said
building
a computer chemically lets researchers design computers that exceed the
limitations of silicon-chip technology. 
"Theoretically computers can be much more efficient ... but you're not
going to
do it with silicon technology," said Heath, who worked on the study. 
While, actually constructing a computer in a chemical lab is at least 10 years
away Teramac shows it is now feasible, Heath said in a telephone interview. 
"It suddenly gives people in the field a goal," he said. REUTERS

Great news! Being involved in medial temporal lobe research (if only
theoretical) I see this as a double step forward, both for
cryopreservation and LTP research. Now let's hope the project works
out too :-) !

I agree that John Cramer's articles are interesting and worth reading.

I'm pretty skeptical about this particular antigravity model though.
Anything which violates conservation of momentum is highly suspicious
in my book.  It seems that the claim is that it doesn't "really" violate
momentum conservation because (apparently) instantaneous nonlocal
(i.e. faster than light?) changes occur elsewhere to bring about balance.
Handwaving about quantum nonlocality is a long way from justifying this
claim.

As for the measurements, it is notoriously difficult to get good
measurements on these kinds of devices.  The article refers to the
misleading results from the Dean drive.  There was a recent Wired article
about someone (not Podkletnov) using rotating superconducting disks, and
the reporter pointed out problems with air currents caused by bubbling
liquid nitrogen.

In the experiment Cramer describes, running heavy oscillating currents
into a capacitor can cause all kinds of EM interference.  Plus, the
capacitor itself will be subject to mechanical vibrations as its internal
electrodes alternately attract and repel each other.  It all adds up to
a messy system that is going to be very hard to get clean measurements on.

  I'm no fan of organized religon, but in the 
  John Hopkins (University) Medical Letter, 
  a sidebar listing "Longevity Facts" states:


"Your faith may heal you. Research shows that people 
who practice organized religion have a lower incidence 
of depression and suicide, substance abuse, and even 
hearth disease. They also seem to cope better with life-
threatening illness and recover from sickness and injury 
faster than those who are not religiously committed."

  In the book Life Extension by Durk Person and 
  Sandy Shaw they argue that less exercise is 
  better, but this blurb in the John Hopkins 
  Medical Letter indicates the opposite:

"While some exercise is better than none, more appears 
to be best, according to a study of runners. The runners' 
risk of coronary heart disease dropped in proportion to 
the amount of exercise they did above and beyond the 
recommended 30 minutes of moderate exercise per day. 
Heart disease risk decreased significantly with 
each 10-mile weekly increment in distance."

Volume 10, Issue 5. July 1998, page 1.

        I don't doubt it.  Prayer seems to be a placebo of sorts: if a
person believes strongly enough that there is "someone" sharing his load
and guiding his life, there is less need for all the other escapes like
suicide and substance abuse, and less reason for depression.  To a strongly
religious person, God is the highest form of love and caring... stay in
God's favor and no "earthly" ails or ills will ever harm you.

        The problem, of course, (as has been discussed many times before on
this list) is that blind faith simply does not hold up.  The utter
disregard for reason and ignorance of fact forms only a lifelong delusional
state --one shared by billions of people around the world.  The crux is, I
suppose, that yes, your faith *may* heal you...but at what cost?

It is stated that the speed of light is 
not instantaneous, and as such, the light
from distant galaxies is "old light." 

I believe that that idea is illogical.
It is an accepted fact that at the speed
of light, there is no time, time is fixed 
at 0, and thus the idea of an "old photon" 
is inherently illogical. This means that 
as a photon travels, it travels WITH the
instant of its emission and "carries" 
that instant with it, and thus the 
speed of light = the speed of time.

The idea that photons travel slow, or
not instantly, assumes that something 
travels faster. The idea of the slow 
photon rests upon the old fallacy of 
a universal time that is synchronized 
across all space instantly, and the 
photon is slower than universal time. 

Below we see the slow photon traveling 
from A to B in separate galaxies. The 
photon's travel is not instantaneous 
because the universal time synchronizes 
the clocks at A and B faster than SOL
(the numbers 0,1,2,3 measure time):


   A & B under universal time

       A                B
      ---              ---
       0*               0
       1    *           1
       2          *     2
       3               *3


The transit from A to B was not in-
stantaneous, for the photon reaches 
B at a different time than it left A.
But that analysis to totally illogical,
unlike the following analysis where the 
photon traveling from A to B reaches B 
at the same time it left A because the 
speed of light = the speed of time:


       A                B
      ---              ---
       0*              -3
       1    *          -2
       2          *    -1
       3               *0


Since the photon is always at the same
time in its frame of reference, and as 
such is the "speed of time," it reaches 
B at the same time it leaves A. 

The idea that the speed of light is not
instantaneous seems to be based upon the 
false concept of a universal time that 
is uniform across all space and time 
(as depicted in the first diagram),
which travels faster than the photon.

The speed of light is instantaneous 
in that a photon is always at the same 
instant and reaches all points on its 
course through space at the same instant
because it effectively IS that instant. 
So it is both not instantaneous from our 
point of view, and yet it also is instan-
taneous. So the SOL is both A and -A.

	I'm not a physics expert, but it seems to me that the entire basis
of your argument can be eliminated by a purely philosophical
consideration.  In diagram one, you are viewing the photon from an outside
position, an objective position (we won't discuss the relativity of the
situation, just accept that it is *more objective* than viewing from the
inside).  From such a position, the photon does exist and travel in
space-time, along a clear path, relative to everything else in the
universe, utilizing a discreet amount of time.  In diagram two, you are
clearly viewing the photon from a subjective position, and at a speed that
highly exceeds everything else in the universe.  The path between point A
and B is indeed instantaneous, *from the photons perspective*, but not
from anyone elses.  Thus, it is clear that saying that it is both A and ~A
is a mistake.   It is A or ~A, depending upon were you are viewing the
situation from.

  IAN: From our perspective the photon is still at 0 time
  because time passes exactly as fast as the photon passes,
  and so the photon is always at rest with respect to time.

  While the photon is at zero time, the things we measure 
  it relative to are not, and 0 is non-0 relative to non-0 
  numbers, such that 0 is +1 relative to -1. Let's say that
  "1" represents 186,000 mps:

  Time:    -1 0 1 
  Space: -1 0 1

  You are -1 on the top row and the photon is 0 next 
  to you (that you are -1 means your slower than the 
  SOL). The second row has 0 below you, for you are 
  at rest with respect to yourself, but the 0 on the 
  top row is over 1, and so the 0 is "faster" in space 
  than you by 1, and so you say that relative to you,
  0 is 1. The photon is at 0 time, you are at 0 space.



>Thus, it is clear that saying that it is both A and ~A
>is a mistake.   It is A or ~A, depending upon were you are viewing the

  IAN: Is one point of view out of many more true 
  than all others? No. Is the fact that a photon 
  is at 0 time false when you assign it a speed? No.

My business partner and I attempted the superconducting disk experiment in
his lab. The results were negative, but there were many opportunities for
experimental mistakes that could have given a false positive reading.
Bubbling LN2 was the least of the problems - at one point the cryostat
erupted with a geyser of LN2 and broken superconductor...

Our disk was not rotating, but was inside a fairly powerful 60 Hz magnetic
field at the time. I believe inrush currents caused the damage. The basis
for our experiment was gleaned from an alternate energy website, and
admittedly was of poor quality for a true scientific inquiry, but as the
materials were dirt cheap, we could not resist trying it..

You're confusing your definitions again.  When people say that the light
is old, they mean this:  if a photon is emitted by a star 20 ly away at
the time t=0 in our own reference frame, we will observe 20 years
difference between t=0 and the time it hits our detector, t=T.  This
statement says nothing about the photon's perspective: this distinction,
indeed, is meaningless from the photon's reference frame.  Nonetheless, we
can still make the "partial" statement that in our own reference frame,
the difference between T and 0 is 20 years.  When we say "old light," that
is what we mean.  And we are not wrong nor illogical to say so.

   IAN: Dan, I asked you to explain why the 
   definition of atomism that you invented was 
   better than the traditional Three Laws of 
   Thought. You refused to answer. You also 
   refused to explain why your definition of 
   mystical was better than a holistic one.

   I believe it is now incumbent upon you 
   to explain why your definition of atomism 
   was better than the Three Laws of Thought.
   If you care to explain that, here's my last
   two posts on the topic:

http://www.extropy.com/exi-lists/extropians/5334.html 
http://www.extropy.com/exi-lists/extropians/5438.html 

   As I clearly demonstrated, you evidenced 
   no example of atomism. That you should 
   come back impling otherwise is sorry.

  IAN: I understand what you. But the photon 
  reaches you at the same instant it was emitted
  because that instant travels at 186,000 mps.

  Your "instant" is the same across the universe.
  If we say that right now a photon is emitted
  from a point 20 ly away, we are applying a "now"
  that is uniform across the universe, and which
  is universal time. If we say that the instant
  travels with the photon, we say that when the 
  photon strikes us, the "now" of its emission
  has reached us. Time travels at the SOL.

Only from the photon's reference frame; not from my own.

Yes, but the idea of "old photons" is not speaking to the point of
universal time, but only with respect to t=0 *in my reference frame*.
>From the perspective of everything with respect to everything else, yes,
it took no "net time," but it took time with respect to my reference
frame, and that's all I was trying to assert.

As for why my definition is better than your three laws?  I posit that
THESE are the three laws of atomism:

1) A is A.
2) A is not both A and not-A with respect to 0.
3) A is either A or not-A with respect to 0.

Here I use "with respect to 0" to mean that the partial difference between
A and 0 is either A or not-A and not both.  Ask anybody who claims to be
an atomist and they will agree with the laws as posited.

Why is my definition better?  My definition is better because it is the
one most people use.  "Atomism" means whatever people use it to mean, and
they happen to use it to mean that A is either A or not-A and not both
with respect to 0. The omission of "with respect to 0" from your statement
of the laws is trivial: it is implicit in everything that we do or say
that we are always referring to the partial difference, and never the
"whole" difference, when we talk about difference.  (By we, I mean not
YOU, Ian, obviously.)  No one defines "difference" the way you define
difference, Ian, and that's all there is to it.  Atomism is right because
it uses different definitions than you do.

If I have allowed a bit of frustration to creep into this post, it is
purely because this argument SHOULD have ended years ago.  Neither
atomists nor holists disagree with the laws I posit above.  No
disagreement means that there's nothing to debate.  Learn to love the
atomists: you've got us sorely misunderstood.

They're no different from any other ancient character, they can be judged by

That doesn't follow. Yes, they must have had charisma and been good at public 
speaking, but a talent for serious rational debate is not the ticket to fame 
fortune or power.

Christ was a jerk. I refer to the character portrayed in the bible, whether 
there really was a historic figure who impressed the rubes with card tricks 
and other stunts I don't know. Personally I'd be a lot more impressed if he 
had taught us about the second law of thermodynamics rather than hear a 
report of questionable accuracy about some water into wine trick. It took the 
human race another 1800 years to learn about entropy and although it teaches 
us nothing about morality neither do Christ's stunts, and unlike the  
fermented grape juice bit you can't fake thermodynamics.

Christ was a nut, nutty as a fruit cake, or to put it in more politically 
correct language, he had a mental illness that produced delusions of granger. 
I don't think it was an act, I think he really thought he was God.

Christ was a martinet. His words "You serpents, you generation of vipers, how 
can you escape the damnation of hell" sounds more like a typical flame you 
can find anywhere on the net then it does the wisdom of a great sage. Buddha, 
Lao-tse, and Socrates all had a much more enlightened attitude toward those 
who disagreed with them, and they had it 500 years before Jesus.

Christ was a creep. He believed in hell, he talked with glee about "wailing 
and gnashing of teeth" and "these shall go away into everlasting fire". 
He thought that torturing somebody, not for a billion years, but for an 
INFINITE number of years would be an amusing thing to do to somebody he 
didn't like. I think  cruelty on this monstrous scale proves that Christ of 
the bible is morally indistinguishable from Satin of the bible. 

Strong words but I don't believe I'm engaging in hyperbole, imagine for a  
moment what it would be like if a Christian God did exist. Here we have an 
all powerful demon addicted to flattery who can read your every thought and 
will torture you, not for a long time, but for ETERNITY if you take one step 
out of line or break just one of his many, many, rules and they includes 
thought crimes. To make maters worse you're not even sure exactly what all 
his rules are, the "experts" violently disagree, so you never know if you're 
going to be tortured or how to avoid it. This seems pretty  depressing to me 
and not at all moral, I'll take an indifferent universe  over a sadistic one 
any day.

I'll close with a quotation from Charles Darwin, a better man than the son of 
God even if you ignore his enormous scientific ability. I would certainly much 
rather have Darwin as my next door neighbor than a vindictive pompous ass 
like Jesus Christ.  

In spite of the objections of his very religious, but loving wife, he wrote  
in his 1876  autobiography :
             
        "Disbelief crept over me at a very slow rate but at last was                
         complete. The rate was so slow that I felt no distress, and have                 
         never since doubted even for a single second that my conclusion                 
         was correct. I can indeed hardly see how anyone ought to wish      
         Christianity to be true; for if so the plain language of the text                 
         seems to show that the men who do not believe, and this would               
         include my Father, Brother and almost all my best friends, will be         
         everlastingly punished. And this is a damnable doctrine."

  IAN: Yes, that speaks right to the point. I 
  keep shifting into the photonic frame o ref.
  It's actually an unholistic thing to do -- 
  got to keep All frames of reference in mind.

I do, and they all are in the hands of both the Air Force and the Navy. The Army has
no strategic nuke capability. They have tactical nukes, with maximum ranges of less
than acouple hundred miles. While missiles like the Pershing (which I beleive might
have all be retired by now) are Ballistic missiles, they are not intercontinental
ballistic missiles. They might have some ground launched cruise missiles that I am not
aware of, but they would most likely be conventional warheads or small tactical nukes
to support ground troops.

THis arrangement is in marked contrast to some other nations, like China and the
former Soviet Union, which had and have Strategic Rocket Forces, usually as part of
the Army or as a separate military service entirely.

Additionally, I don't think that the ICBM is of strategic military significance,
although it is of strategic diplomatic significance. While this may be picking nits,
it is a significant difference.

Yes, this is the theoretical basis for why the principle of my Lorrey Drive
works. As the article states, one can generate thrust, while keeping in
compliance with the currently known laws of physics, without necessarily having
to expend reaction mass in the opposite direction from the thrust vector.

While John Campbell's early publicizing of Dean's Drive may have been premature,
as his device did have some serious failings which in the laboratory were able
to cancel out or mask the actual thrust produced, my own design I think shall be
found to overcome these shortcomings. I think that is will also be found that
Woodward's work with capacitors in testing this refinement of Mach's Principle
will confirm the work of Dr. TT Brown of Stanford back in the 30s-50s, and
validate the Beifeld Brown effect as a manfestation of this refinement of Mach'r
Principle in the Woodward effect.

Which of course suggests that we should seriously think about how to
get the benefits from religion without the drawbacks. Most likely any
form of comittment that provides a sense of belonging, a positive
livable universe where temporary setbacks are just temproary (despite
their severity) would have the same benefits. Can transhumanism become
a "religion" in this sense, providing the health benefits? I don't
think we need to attempt to imitate the outward activities of
religions, but we better look at the community- and meaning-building
parts.

Has there been any research into the health benefits of belonging to a
secular grouping similar to religions?

Yeah, I'd say that those robots zipping around at 67 miles per hour would

   IAN: Why not add "with respect to 0" to 1?
   2 and 3 are holist in nature since they say
   that what A is depends upon something that 
   A is not, and thus they are not atomist.

   I agree that half of the difference is 
   half of the difference, and half defines
   the whole by default. If I give you $50 
   and say this is half of the fee, the
   identity of the whole fee is revealed,
   so the ID of the whole is in the half.

   The area just outside the letter A defines 
   it as much as the area inside the letter.
   Its identity contains both areas.

   IAN: It's really not true to say that I omitted
   the portion that you added to the Three Laws since
   they've never been published your way. Your version
   is holistic, since adding "with respect to" includes
   a relation. It's clear that you've changed the defin-
   tion of atomism to a holistic definition, but kept the
   "atomist" label on it, for what reason I know not, ex-
   cept to be able to say you've evidenced atomism.

   Isn't that proving how effective product A is in a 
   demonstration using product H with an A label on it,
   or more exactly, by using a mix of 2/3 H and 1/3 A?

   You said I was confusing definitions, but your changing
   the definitions of atomism is the only confusion I see.

   IAN: When I refer to the high, I refer to 
   the low by default;  when I refer to the 
   good, I refer to the bad by default...
 
   How is it that I don't refer to the whole?


>No one defines "difference" the way you define
>difference, Ian, and that's all there is to it.  


   IAN: Not true. "Net difference" is not a 
   violation of the definition of difference.
   I say that the difference between 4 and 
   5 is expressed as 4 - 5 = -1. That's the
   standard definition. So saying that the 
   net difference is -1 & 1, is not unique;
   observing that it is the holisitc struc-
   ture of identity is unique.

   What seems to be demolished in your 
   analysis is any difference between 
   atomism and holism, for to sustain
   atomism you've changed it to holism.

> Actually there should be four laws of thought, each reducible to perception 
(and convertible into each other).
If A, then A (If something's there, it's there)
If not A, then not A (If something's not there, it ain't there)
A or not A (It's either there or it's not)
Not both A and not A (It can't be both there and not there in/at the

This forms the same type of square we see in Aristotelian or 
sentential logic (All A is B, No A is B, Some A is B, Some A is not 
B )and in the Greimassian Semiotic Square of semantic structure (S 
and P {for instance, knowing-how-to-be}, S and Not-P {for instance, 
knowing-how-not-to-be}, Not-S and P { for instance, 
not-knowing-how-to-be}, and Not-S and Not-P {for instance, 
not-knowing-how-not-to-be}), where S = Subject and P = Predicate.
In addition, all these are amenable to translation into Symbolic or 
predicate logic (with its Universal and Existential Quantifiers [For 
all X, There is at least one X]).  Clearly there is a deep or 
ur-structure here underlying these various manifestations of logical 
and linguistic form.

This is completely invalid.  They are "not atomist" by YOUR definiton of
atomism, which is the very subject under debate!

My point is that most people define the fee differently, such that if I
tell you that "this is only part of the fee" you STILL know the identity
of what I've given you.

Argh.  This is really frustrating.  I'm really resisting the urge to use
all caps.  I'm going to use asterisks instead, because you seem to be
mising this extremely simple point.  *I have not changed the definition of
atomism, I have stated the correct one.  That it agrees with holism does
not mean that it is wrong.*

Don't you get it?  What you think is A *IS NOT A*., I'm telling you what A
is and you keep telling me "Wait!  It's got H in it!  It must not be A!" 
This is completely invalid because A and H only disagree under your
definition, which is PRECISELY what I am challenging.  A really is H, H
really is A.  No sleight of hand, no changing the label: I'm telling you,
honest to goodness, this product called H is also A.  They're the same
product.  That I can change the label and still be right should be
evidence of that.

I find this frustrating, I'm now realizing, because I keep trying to say
the same thing, and you're not actually responding, you're just falling
back to your previous definition and saying "See?  Therefore your
definition is wrong."  I do not accept your definition of atomism.  I
challenge you to defend it.  I do not accept your asertion that A and H
disagree by 100%.  I agree that YOUR conception of atomism disagrees with 
holism by 100%: I assert that your definition is wrong.  I challenge you
to defend it using logical terms upon which we both agree.

Simple:  you have made the dualistic fallacy.  Sure, in a universe
consisting of only two objects, by looking at both you observe the whole. 
However, when you look at a universe with THREE objects, observing the
relationship between two is NOT looking at the whole, but is nonetheless
valid as a partial diffrerence.  Our definitions disagree in that atomists
define that identity comes from the relationship between the object in
question and another object which is defined to have no identity called
"0."  (Let me stop you before you start.  0 has no identity because there
is no difference between 0 and 0.  Under your definition of identity, this
does not define the identity of 0.  I'm aware of that.  I'm CHALLENGING
your definition.  Do not use it to defend your argument, use ANOTHER
definition to defend your DEFINITION.)

The identity of A is defined as the difference between itself and the 0; 
while we could then go on to observe 0's relationship to B, and then draw
conclusions about the relationship between A and B (if we knew what B
was!), the relationship between B and A does not define the identity of
anything.  Only the difference between A and 0 defines A's identity under
this definition.

This not an observation, it is a definition.  I could just as easily
define identity to be only the partial difference and make just as much
sense.  I'm telling you that this is what atomists do, and that is why
holists and atomists are both right, by virtue of the fact that they agree
100%.

I've not changed it, I'm telling you what it always has been.  Atomism as
you believe it to be is completely wrong: it is wrong as a theory and it
is wrong as a definition.  You don't know or understand what atomism is,
and so you prop up a straw man definition and proclaim it wrong.
Congratulations: you have deflated a theory which no one believes.  In
reality, however, atomism is and has always been as I define it.  I am
right because people use my definition and not yours.  Drop your
definition of atomism and you'll understand the rest of the world by a far
greater degree.

I am not one for defending Christianity, but my reading of the New
Testament seems to indicate that Jesus kept denying his divinity and kept
telling his followers to stop treating him any differently than any other
human.  I believe that his followers are the ones who diefied him, as with
many great men.  The legend took on a life of its own, and has little
relation to the actual history.

Actually you're both a bit off... read it and weep (or laugh)... keep in mind
that there are several different versions written from several different
biased perspectives, for example, compare Paul the zealot and woman hater, vs.
the softer Leo Busgalia like St. Matt.    If you were to watch Monty Python's
Life of Brian you'd  get a clearer idea of what life was like during those
times, some of the mentality, and also social circumstances.   Christ no doubt
had rebelled against the tyranny of the temple.   As all authority then was
believed to be granted by god, it would have only made sense for him to
present himself as (or believe himself to believe) some sort of prophet.   At
that time there was also a trend of faith healers, televangelists and all
sorts of what is sometimes refered to in Yiddish as "chazerai" - - definitely
it would have taken a "charismatic" figure to create a counter movement.   For
his times, no doubt, Christ was a leftist and revolutionary.   He redeemed the
Jews from a life encompassing legal system of 613 laws guided by a highly
organized theocrascy.    He deserves atleast a tidbit of credit for this, even
in retrospect if his method of porpagating those ideas were a bit distasteful
to us enlightened transhumans.    Incidently, I believe that Ben Franklin  and
Thomas Jefferson were involved in the writing of a softer and more humanistic
version of the Bible in which all references to "the diety" were eliminated.
Carrying the issue back to the present, we might ask, can the masses really be
appealed to with common sense ?    If a highly superstitious idiot  was
pointing a gun at you, and you could get away saving you life by telling him
that a ghost was about to hit him over the head with a baseball bat to save
your doubt, would you do it ???     Let's take it a step further...No one, for
example, doubts the leadership of Ghandi, but did the fact that his followers
viewed him as a saint have anything to do with his followers ?   What type of
modern day Christ or Ghandi would it take to make Cryonics such a well
entrenched social institution as Christianity so we're not in danger of
extinction, or by lowering ourselves to such levels would we be defeating our
purposes ?

  IAN: "My definition" of atomism is the Three 
  Law of Thought. The Three Laws of Thought are 
  not properly defined as "my definition." 

  Your definition is new and IS properly defined
  as "your definition," which redefines atomism
  in a holist context by adding "with respect to."

  You're REdefining the standard then you're 
  portraying the standard as my definition that 
  is totally my own and is unlike what most 
  people use. That is the opposite of the truth.

  The 3 Laws define a crisp boundary around A
  that says the identity of A is exclusive to A
  by 100%. Adding to A is A "with respect to 0"
  turns atomism into a holistic relation.

  That such relation is the truth does not mean it 
  is atomism. You've assumed "atomism" = "truth."

  That you attempt to show examples of relations 
  that are what they are free from other relations,
  means your saying that relation-A is A free from
  -A, and thus you still deploy the very traditional
  atomist definition that you seek to redefine.

  IAN: You'll know it still by its relation to external 
  features. Your trying to say that A is A free from 
  not-A even as you try to redefine atomism not to 
  say that. Just ask yourself, why is it necessary 
  for you to add the words "with respect to 0" to
  the 3 Laws? What do they change? What do they stop?
  They stop the clearly stated definition of atomism,
  the definition that you continue to attempt to use
  by arguing that relation-A is A free from -A.

   IAN: Your redefining atomism to be holism.
   A relation is a holism. A universe with 3 
   things defines 1 thing as 1 of 3. I've 
   already shown how your example of two 
   things relating to zero is holism by 
   100% since the changing relation was 
   change relative to the not-change.

   IAN: A may be larger, faster,... than B,

   non-zero identities acquire identity attributes
   from non-zero identities... as well as from 0.

No it hasn't. It would have, but there are some server problems, so we're
waiting until David is back on Monday before implementing the changes. The
List often slows down over the summer.

You assert, then, that most people use YOUR definition and not mine?

So, let me get this straight:  The 3 Laws are the right definition, and
therefore my definition is wrong. 

<sigh> It's hopeless, Ian.

No.  I'm simply asserting what most everyone ELSE knew already: that all
"atomist" Newtonians agree that nothing is defined without a frame of
reference, but that within a frame of reference, properties can vary
independently.

Hardly.  To rephrase it in terms of holism, using the partial difference
between A-0 and B-0 allows us to derive the rest of the identity chart; we
lose no information by describing identity in terms of this relation.

A is NOT free from not-A.  You can't have an A free from at least one
other thing: in this case, 0.  However, you can have A free from B, if we
define identity as the relation between A and 0.

Not unless you're defining your universe with respect to 1.

Of COURSE it's holism.  I'm arguing that atomism IS holism.  You
persistently argue that my definition of atomism is not atomism because it
is holism.  I KNOW it's holism; that doesn't prove that it's not atomism.

Consider thinking of it this way:  When we say that 3 is 5 relative to -2,
that means that we are saying that -2 is 0 relative to -2.  So the fact
that 3 is 5 relative to -2 does not mean that 3 has an identity which
comes from -2, but that 3 has an identity which comes from zero; when we
change reference frames, -2 is the 0.

So?  A can change relative to 0 independently from B relative to 0, and
that's all I'm trying to prove.

   IAN: "My definition" of atomism is the Three 
   Law of Thought. The Three Laws of Thought are 
   not properly defined as "Ian's definition." If 
   you want to give me the credit for inventing 
   the 3 Laws, that's nice, but not appropriate.

   I assert that your addition of "with respect 
   to 0" is YOUR definition of atomism (consistent
   with my defintion of holism) and that it is, as 
   you acknowledge, the same as saying "atomism = 
   holism." When I counter atomism I counter the 
   traditional definition of atomism that would 
   say that "atomism =/= holism."

   IAN: The Three Laws express atomism 
   by 100%. Your definition does not.
   It is holistic only in that it is 
   not outside a whole set, but it 
   defines an A that exists not.

  IAN: That idea of independent variance is atomism.
  If we take it to the 100% extreme, A is A free from
  any frame of reference. An example of a variation
  occurring free from other features in a frame of 
  reference is a "free variation" only relative to 
  the whole, and does not measure a degree of atomism.

   IAN: There is no "partial difference." 
   There is omission of the full difference.

  IAN: Yes, every point is also a relative 
  0 point, which shows how "A to 0" is a
  relation that applies to A/0, B/0 and A/B.

  IAN: If A = 3 and B = 6 and A changes
  from 3 to 9, A has changed relative 
  to both 0 and B. The relation 0/6 is
  many things from many points of view.
  It is large from 0/.03, it is tiny 
  from 0/103067472. When we include more 
  into our frame of reference we redefine
  the nature of the 0/6 relation. To say 
  that the 0/6 relation remains static is 
  to negate its relation to anything else.

I would say a couple things:

a) yeah, while the Christ we all know about through the 2000 year filtered
compendium we know as the Bible may not be quite as selfless or whatever as
buddha, but for the time and place he was in, I think that the general concept
of willingly getting nailed to a tree for suggesting that it would be cool for
people to be nice to each other for a change was a profoundly courageous act.
Buddha was in India 500 years previously, so his teachings had extremely little
influence on the development of the Roman Empire, while the pseudobiographical
texts about Jesus basically changed the very make up of the Empire, to give it
the potential for the West to become what it is today.

b) while the East has had a long tradition of very pacifistic spiritual
development prior to Buddha, there was none such (except for small groups like
the Essenes) in the Middle East or Europe at the time of Jesus, he was a bit of
a pioneer in the region for what he had to say.

c) keep in mind that the Bible as we know it is only a small part of all of the
biographical texts, and that the two gospels which were actually written by
actual disciples of Jesus were left out of the Bible because they weren't
conducive to a stern autocratic Church. The four gospels that are in the Bible
were written 70-150 years after the death of Jesus, and are thus open to
significant debate as to whether the quotes attributed to Jesus are actually
what he said. The Gospel of Thomas, and the Gospel of Mary Magdalene can be
found in the Nag Hammadi, along with a number of other texts which paint a much
different picture of Jesus.

d) keep in mind also that Jesus was more of a political figure than the Bible
lets on. Since the marriage of his two parents reunited the two Houses of David
(and his purported marriage at Cana to Mary Magdalene would have united the
House of David with the House of Saul) he was a royal figure in Isreal, and was
looked on as a revolutionary figure to save Isreal from the Romans, as had been
foretold. Being raised with such expectations, its not hard to imagine that one
would at least have some capacity to be a royal pain in the ass at least once in
a while. One can also imagine that this is why he got crucified in the end, that
he turned out not to be quite the revolutionary general his fellow Hebrews had
hoped for, and so they willingly turned him over to Pilate in exchange for
Barrabbas, a proven zealot fighter, so that Pilate could give Jesus the
punishment reserved for those who would revolt against Rome. If he had been
convicted of blasphemy and sacrelidge as had been claimed in the Bible, then
Hebrew law dictated that he be stoned to death.

Given all this, I would also put emails from Jesus in my kill file, as I'm not
in the mood to get strung up and disemboweled, thank you, for associating with a
known subversive figure who can't seem to pull of a decent revolt, has little
military inclination, and succeeds in pissing off as many people around him as
possible....

Give me someone who knows how to keep their mouth shut, can operate a decent
cell network, and can obtain support for the subversion campaign from outside
sources. No matter how pacifistic you want to get, any group with a hope of
success should at least be able to do these three things....

Volume 2 of the Journal of Transhumanism 
(http://www.transhumanist.com) is now released, featuring a paper by 
Robin Hanson on the singularity and the economics of explosive 
growth. If you feel competent, please consider submitting a note to 
the open peer commentary to seed the discussion.


Is a singularity just around the corner? What it takes to get 
explosive economic growth

ABSTRACT
Economic growth is determined by the supply and demand of 
investment capital; technology determines the demand for capital, 
while human nature determines the supply. The supply curve has two 
distinct parts, giving the world economy two distinct modes. In the 
familiar slow growth mode, rates of return are limited by human 
discount rates. In the fast growth mode, investment is limited by the 
world's wealth. Historical trends suggest that we may transition to 
the fast mode in roughly another century and a half. Can some new 
technology switch us to the fast mode more quickly than this? 
Perhaps, but such a technology must greatly raise the rate of return 
for theworld's expected worst investment project. It must thus be 
very broadly applicable, improving almost all forms of capital and 
investment.  Furthermore, investment externalities must remain within 
certain limits.

   IAN: The orange has two identifying attributes,
   and internal area (A) and an external area (-A).
   Eliminate either and you eliminate the orange.
   This letter A has two identifying attributes,
   its internal area and its external area.

Ah.  The argument from tradition.  Which tradition of atomists claims that
you can define motion without a reference frame?  (Hint:  "There is none"
is a perfectly valid answer.)

The right definition expresses atomism by 100%.  The wrong definition does
not.  The above is the logical equivalent of saying "I'm right, and you're
wrong."  In the immortal words of Michael Palin: "This isn't an argument! 
It's just contradiction!"

The "with respect to 0" definition allows for "independent variance" and
does not suffer from reductio ad absurdum.  That anything exists without a
frame of reference is a dubious point, and not one which any modern
atomist would support.

To wit:  Name a few.  Quote some.  Give an example.

Again, claiming that independent variance within a reference frame is not
atomism because it is holism is you saying "I'm right and you're wrong."

There IS a partial difference; we define it into existence.

And?  Doesn't change the partial difference one whit.

Only one point is a relative 0 within any one reference frame; that's all
atomism asserts.

Not to negate it, simply not to include it in the definition of identity.

  I'm no fan of organized religon, but in the 
  John Hopkins (University) Medical Letter, 
  a sidebar listing "Longevity Facts" states:


"Your faith may heal you. Research shows that people 
who practice organized religion have a lower incidence 
of depression and suicide, substance abuse, and even 
hearth disease. They also seem to cope better with life-
threatening illness and recover from sickness and injury 
faster than those who are not religiously committed."

John Hopkins Medical Letter, Health After 50.
Volume 10, Issue 5. July 1998, page 1.

I was raised a "strict" protestent.  When I was a child I looked with envy at
the Southern Baptists because or their relative freedom...they could have
"fun".

So I can relate to what you just said here.  It always seemed a little screwy
to me.   Many things were internally inconsistent.  Even though there were
looooooong and boring sunday morning sermons devoted to pushing the party
line.

I'd be (very...very mildly ) curious as to some readings on the "forbidden"
texts you allude to.  An overview perhaps?  I'm not into relegion
anymore...except as it relates to meme infection and how to avoid it.

How disturbingly knee-jerk of you. Do you think that after almost 2000
years, we can make any judgements about what these guys were *really* like?
If so, it would seem that you concur with the fundamentalists wrt the
inviolability of [manually written and transmitted] scripture, something to
which anyone with a reasonable background in modern information theory
would give the big hairy eyeball.

I'd love to get my homey Hay-zoos's and m'man Mo's *real* swing on things
like the role of government in the lives of individuals, the possibility of
physical imortality, and the place of personal spiritual knowledge in a
world wakened to rationality. If nothing else, you know these guys must
have been capable of holding their own in serious debate - I'm sure they
saw a lot of it, especially early in their careers. Imagine someone like
them getting turned onto the ideas expressed on this list - Zowie!

And man, that Jesus could throw some *serious* parties - wine flowing from
the taps, spreads of food that keep getting bigger as the night goes on,
and everyone washing each others feet. Sounds like a time and a half ;^P

Michael,

As someone with an intense historical interest in the development of the
Christian faith, I'm intrigued by some of the points you've made.

<<
b) while the East has had a long tradition of very pacifistic spiritual
development prior to Buddha, there was none such (except for small groups
like
the Essenes) in the Middle East or Europe at the time of Jesus, he was a
bit of
a pioneer in the region for what he had to say.
>>

Actually, from my reading, I have the impression that almost nothing he
purportedly said or did was original with him. What do you think is unique
about his teaching?
<<
c) keep in mind that the Bible as we know it is only a small part of all of
the
biographical texts, and that the two gospels which were actually written by
actual disciples of Jesus were left out of the Bible because they weren't
conducive to a stern autocratic Church. The four gospels that are in the
Bible
were written 70-150 years after the death of Jesus, and are thus open to
significant debate as to whether the quotes attributed to Jesus are
actually
what he said. The Gospel of Thomas, and the Gospel of Mary Magdalene can be
found in the Nag Hammadi, along with a number of other texts which paint a
much
different picture of Jesus.
>>

I'm with you on this, except I never heard of a Gospel of Mary Magdalene. I
thought I knew of all of the NT apocrypha. Can you point me to a reference?
<<
d) keep in mind also that Jesus was more of a political figure than the
Bible
lets on. Since the marriage of his two parents reunited the two Houses of
David
(and his purported marriage at Cana to Mary Magdalene would have united the
House of David with the House of Saul) he was a royal figure in Isreal,
[...]
>>

What's this about the two Houses of David? I don't find such in my studies
of ancient literature (not that I'm anything like an erudite scholar). And
what's the basis for asserting that Jesus married the Magdalene? I've seen
speculation on this, and it titllates my fancy, but I know of no actual
confirming evidence. I'd be greatly in your debt if you could provide
references for these contentions.
<<
Given all this, I would also put emails from Jesus in my kill file, as I'm
not
in the mood to get strung up and disemboweled, thank you, for associating
with a
known subversive figure who can't seem to pull of a decent revolt, has
little
military inclination, and succeeds in pissing off as many people around him
as
possible....
>>

ROTFL!

Upward,
Dick

I pretty sure they're using StorageTek tape silos, these are 12
sided silos about 11' across holding around 5000 500 Meg tapes (I
have a 3-4 dozen upstairs), so the Arms move in a circle. The tapes
have laser read barcodes, so the arms can find and load a tape in
something like 2 sec. 

Because they are 12 sided, you can butt them up against each other
like a honeycomb, and they can pass tapes to each other, it's
really cool, there is a string of them almost a 100 yards long
upstairs.

Don't you live in Chicago? You can stop by my office sometime and
see them.....

the health of just one system is not indicative of the health of the whole
organism. if you make an autopsy of a long-time alcoholic, the
cardiovascular system usually looks great, but the liver and the brain is
heavily affected.

and the second blurb, the placebo is one of the most effective drugs, it
seems. it would be great if doctors prescribed more sugar pills intead of
antibiotics in some instances for example :-), not to mention other disease
with a strong psychosomatic component.

Interesting thought.


Also remember tht during the life of christ the little backwoods sect didn't
do too well.  It was onlyafter that City Slicker...Saul of Taursus...on his
way to persecute some Christians....fell off his donkey....had his donkey
"talk" to him...experienced "revalation"...and began to promote the group he
previously persecuted.........

.....did the little sect really take off.  Christ was long gone by then.

Very well put, it's ironic that this subject came up again just as
I'm re-reading Pagel's "The Gnostic Gospels".

I've always been amazed that the average church-goer knows little
to nothing about the origin's of christianity. The study of early
christianity, by the way, is known as "Patristics".

It's my opinion that it's not taught by practicing religions
because it would cause difficulties if your average christian for
example, ever found out that the doctrine is almost literally word
for word taken from Zoroastrianism, or of the break immediately
after Jesus's death, between the supporters of Peter, (later to
become the Catholic church) and those of Mary Magdelene and Jesus's
brother James (remember him) which became the Gnostic's. (later
hunted to near extinction by the orthodox.)

Bonus question: After the betrayal and suicide of Judas Iscariot,
the disciples picked a new member to complete the 12, what was his
name?

  IAN: As we add new data to our frame, the

  add 500 other relations not same as 0/6,
  then 0/6 is rare. Add 5000 relations the
  same as 0/6 and 0/6 is common. The use of
  "is" here defines an attribute of identity,
  and the 0/6 identity changes in many ways.

  What A (partial difference) is, is defined 
  by -A, and that defines the whole difference.
  You've simply increased "A" from one-thing to
  one-relation and attempted to make the same 
  atomist argument that A is A free from -A
  that your new definition seeks to avoid.

  IAN: Motion is holistic. Atomism 
  is at odds with reality by 100%.
  Atomists tend not to realize that 
  in reality, identity is holistic.

  Observing that the reality atomists
  have been dealing with is holistic
  does not save atomism but voids it.

  IAN: Nope. There's a difference between saying 
  "I'm right and your wrong" and saying WHY. A
  definition of atomism that is 75% holistic is 
  wrong *because* it's just not genuine atomism.
  You REdefined atomism into 75% holism and then 
  argue that "Atomism is not at odds with reality."

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

The passphrase is the secret password you were asked to make up when PGP
was first installed on your computer... your password is required not only
to decrypt messages but also to sign them.

What's this? You don't know what password I'm talking about? I don't know
what happened, here's how you fix it (ONLY do this if you can't
remember/don't know the password). 

But first, a word to the wise: when you're using PGP for the first time,
don't use the "Send Keys" option until you're sure you won't forget your
password or accidentally erase your private key (this happened to me and
now there are a couple of completely useless, undeletable keys floating
around forever). Once you know your way around (a day or so of playing
with it should be enough) then you can publicize your key. 

PC:  

* Find the files named secring.skr and secring.bak. They are in the same
folder as the rest of PGP. Rename them to something else, doesn't matter
what. 

* Launch PGP Keys either from the start menu or from the system tray. It
will notice that the secret key-ring doesn't exist, and after grumbling
about it will launch the PGP key-pair wizard. Follow the instructions for
creating your PGP key-pair.

Mac:

* Find the folder where PGP was installed. Inside it is another folder
called "PGP Keyrings". Open it, and drag the "PGP Private Keys" file out
of there. If there is some sort of backup file, move it out of that folder
too.

* Run PGP Keys. It will ask you whether to find the existing key ring or
generate a new key-pair. Choose to generate a new one, and it will launch
the PGP key-pair wizard. Follow the instructions for creating your PGP
key-pair.

Well, look at it, those episodes which are not directly related to the central
'alien invasion/gov't conspiracy plot are almost always about people who are
changed in some extreme way, from the ability to control lightning, feral
humans, mutated individuals like Mutato, the Monkey Boy, telepaths,
telekinetics, swamp things, clones, etc. it feeds on the natural xenophobia that
most everyone has to one degree or another. Because the rate of technological,
cultural, and economic change has become so obviously rapid in the past decade,
some people are beginning to fear what we are obviously becoming, and feel
powerless to stop. Only a complete idiot can't see that we are in for even more
rapid changes in the near future. Given most peoples natural fear of change,
along with their natural xenophobia, it is no wonder fear the future, and get
such a visceral kick out of scaring themselves by watching the X-files.

A beneficial thing about the X-files is that, like violent programs desensitize
people to violence in their everyday lives, the X-files is desensitizing people
to change, to the 'alien' among us, and the 'alien' in ourselves. Hopefully,
with enough programming such as this, change and difference will be seen by
reactionary types as rather run of the mill by the time things really start to
get interesting.

Okay! I think I know what I screwed up - I was half asleep when I was
setting up PGP and probably did not recognize the need to memorize
something..I will run the key generator again per ypur suggestion..

He culled much from different sources. What made him different to the original
Jewish followers was he had a royal pedigree. Just as people are more likely to
listen to JFK, Jr. than Nutty Joe Wingnut, those who followed him were more
likely to listen to him due to his family heritage than the hundreds or
thousands of other run of the mill street corner prophets that were around at
the time.

The other thing that was different about early Christianity was its openness to
non-Jews. Most other similar sects that had similar teachings as Jesus typically
restricted themselves to the ethnic group they originated in. Any spread was
usually by that ethnic group forcing it on people they conquered. Thus the
franchising potential for this new sect was much greater than other sects. As to
why this is different from India, I can say that while India had its long Hindu
tradition before Buddha, that was in many ways much much more pacifistic than
the strict totalitarian Solar worship of the Roman Empire.

Another thing which aided its spread in the Roman Empire amongst Gentiles was
that the Bible was edited to exclude any texts that put Jews in a positive
light, and included those texts which actually put the majority of the blame for
Christs crucifiction on the Jews, rather than on the Romans, even though he was
so obviously punished in the Roman way.

The Nag Hammadi is known also as the Gnostic Gospels. There is a Gospel of Mary
in it. Many people assume that this Mary is Christs mother, however the scene
where Jesus berates Mary Magdalene's sister Martha exposes that the author is
Mary Magdalene. Due to losses through time, the gospel of Mary is very small.
While you can say this might also be a form of historical editing, it is more
remarkable by its inclusion than by its exclusion.

In one gospel of the Bible, Jesus's family lineage to David is traced through
his mother Mary, and in another, through his father Joseph, through different
branches of Davids house, one through Solomon, and the other through Davids
other wife.

I've found a number of discrepancies in the Bible, as well as the Nag Hammadi,
which others have also commented on, which, when I checked with my Jewish
relatives, I found seem to indicate that Jesus was most probably married, and
that he was most likely married to Mary Magdalene.

a) Jesus is frequently called 'rabbi' in many places in many texts, in quotes of
other Jewish characters in the texts. In traditional Jewish society, a man can
only be a rabbi if he is married, because a rabbi can only be expected to be
able to advise, console,  and judge his fellow Jew if he is experienced in all
aspects of life.

b) The wedding at Cana: When the servants run out of wine, they are told to seek
out Jesus for a solution. In Jewish weddings, it is the grooms family that
traditionally paid for the wedding, I am told, so the guy who provided the wine
is the obvious person to go to if you run out, eh???? Jesus being a teen ager
was the right age for an arranged marriage, since Jewish boys become men
traditionally at age 13.

c) In Jewish law, if a wife commits adultery, it is her husband who must press
charges. This is why the adulteress (who it turns out through more serious
scholarship is in fact Mary Magdalene) is brought before Jesus for judgement,
she is his wife.

d) In the scene where Jesus berates Martha for complaining about Mary's rapt
focus on the words of Jesus, while ignoring household chores that Martha is so
busy with. In traditional Jewish families, spinster sisters that are brought
into the household are typically expected to perform a large measure of the
housework, and in large households is in charge of the servants. In the Gospel
of Mary, Jesus is quoted as saying that Mary holds 'the favored place', and that
Martha should not berate her for her good fortune.

e) Mary Magdalene, according so some sources I have heard of, is descended from
King Saul, the first Isreali King.

Thus it is rather obvious as to why the Romans were so keen on stringing Jesus
up, eh? Reuniting all of the houses and tribes of Isreal under one man (who
would probably have been Jesus, or possibly his son by Mary Magdalene) would
seem to me to spell a serious threat to Roman control of Palestine through the
rule of King Herod, their lackey. This also explains why King Herod was so keen
on killing every child born on or around  the prophesied day in Bethlehem. In
order to fulfill the prophesy, the people who worked to bring this breeding plan
to fruition would have to arrange that Jesus would be born in Bethlehem on or
around the right day. That Mary's cousin, who became pregnant before Mary, was
also seen as giving birth to a religious leader (John the Baptist), he may have
been merely a failed attempt at getting a kid on the right day to fulfill the
prophesy. I think that it might be interesting to find out how many other
relatives of Joseph and Mary were intermarried from the deposed royal families
and had kids in relative proximity to the fateful day.

were and had confidence that we were the be all end all... Even tho that was

our ancestors of  2 or three generations ago.  

I'm not really putting this well, I realise, but it seems to me that it is
linked to the quickening pace of change and the greater realization of our
potential.  We ( humans collectively ) are afraid of that potential to a
degree, unsure of how to cope with the responsibility of being "adults" as it
were.  

The same sort of fear we felt the first time each of us left home and went out

Well, in many ways the cryonics community has these attributes. Cryonics
of course provides an alternative approach to death, and has the full
spectrum of experiences, solidarity and squabbles of any community,
with a nice stories about possible futures. And sacred ground in the form
of storage sites....

In another direction, most religions split into two components. One builds
churches, institutions, rules and dogma. The other stays close to creating
altered states for all of the members. Examples are Native American Church
and Santa Diamo - with peyote and ayhuasca being the respective agents
used for ASCs.

It seems that positive ASCs are an integral aspect of the healing dimensions
of religion, shamanism, and possible worth serious consideration for the
transhuman and extropian communities.

Shall I say, "Best be High when you Do It So...."

No, no, you misunderstood: I wanted you to quote an atomist who actually
believes in the 3 Laws as written.  To provide a quotation of such
absurdity.  To give an example which is actually given by a real,
honest-to-goodness atomist, rather than your hypothesis about what an
atomist WOULD say if he believed the 3 Laws.

I bet you can't find an atomist who supports your laws as written; I've
got lots of atomists who agree with my definition: it is atomism by 100%,
and it is also holism.  Can you deal with that?

As always, you misunderstand: It has no identity because this particular
number has no difference from zero.  That is not the same as saying a
number has no identity because it is not different from itself; it
specifies a very particular number, the difference from which defines the
partial identity.  0 has no identity because it is not different from the
"with respect to" number, not because it is the same as itself.

And?

It sure is; you list it on your identity matrix.  It's not very useful
(kind of like the universe which consists only of A and B), but it is
identity, even under your definition.

Yes, indeed, and Buddha, Lao Tzu,
Krishna, and Moses might weigh in with a
few words of wisdom. It rather puts one
in mind of Van Loon's _Lives_, except
that, according to Van Loon, Buddha
regretfully declined his invitation.

How can we expect to create a super
intelligence if we can't even match the
sentient virtuosity of ancient
enlightened masters?

The story of Herod's massacre of the children of Bethlehem is probably a
fabrication of Matthew.  Luke doesn't mention it, nor does Josephus, the
historian who dillegently recorded Herod's many crimes.


Thus it is rather obvious as to why the Romans were so keen on stringing
Jesus
up, eh? Reuniting all of the houses and tribes of Isreal under one man (who
would probably have been Jesus, or possibly his son by Mary Magdalene)
would
seem to me to spell a serious threat to Roman control of Palestine through
the
rule of King Herod, their lackey. This also explains why King Herod was so
keen
on killing every child born on or around  the prophesied day in Bethlehem.
In
order to fulfill the prophesy, the people who worked to bring this breeding
plan
to fruition would have to arrange that Jesus would be born in Bethlehem on
or
around the right day.

Well, cryonics has some surface similarities with religion, but I have
never encountered a cryonicist that feels that his or her life have
got meaning thanks to cryonics. Cryonics might give us hope, but it
doesn't privide our lives with a strong sense of direction. And that
was what I was discussing in my original post.

Maybe. But I think you left out simple community-building, which is
the part of religion that seems to be of most practical use in life
extension. That aspect seems to be more linked to the creation of
working low-level institutions rather than actual altered states of
consciousness.

I suggest you take that quote and factor in his quote about the future
already being here--just not evenly distributed.

Put the two together, they it's easy to find opportunities to be
uncomfortable.

Substitute "somebody/humans" for "we", if it helps.

Anyway, that's my .01 Troy oz of AU...

Yes, but the sense of community is rather weak, imo, certainly not
comparable to that of a religious or political group. A shame, from a
practical poit of view.

It would certainly be a good idea to have more transhuman parties with
lots of good food, music and drugs. It's great fun, and effectively
increases the sense of community (which is rather important for a
developing movement).

It certainly has all the elements to become the first truly rational
religion: life after death(cryonics), transcension(uploading), eternal
bliss(paradise engineering), sin & evil (entropy, deathism, statism
etc), armageddon (singularity), ethics (rational ethics of enlightened
self-interst), art (extropic/transhuman art) and so on. Add to this 
certain socio-political views (like pro-choice, pro legalization of
drugs and other victimless crimes, tough on real crime, firm atheism
etc.) and you have a "perfect package", a complete marketable worldview
that can challenge the existing philosophies at every point. Vacuum
control, so to speak.

You don't even need to go so far as a party (even if parties are
nice), just a dinner where you can discuss interesting stuff with
friendly transhumanists and explore the applied hedonics and art of
food is already a great way of create a sense of community.

Actually, it is not entirely complete. We need to create a sense of
community, a way of applying extropian or transhumanist core ideas
efficiently in new situations or for the building of
institutions. When we have that, then I expect transhumanism to become
a truly viable lifestyle, before that it will still be a lot of ideas.

Subject: ART:  The Truman Show
Sender: owner-extropians@extropy.com
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

Indications are that many people who intended to see this movie have indeed
done so, and I will now share my thoughts on it.  (Warning:  contains a
multitude of plot spoilers)  

Many of the subtexts within this movie merit discussion in other forums:
media manipulation, privacy, dissent within a mass culture, allusions to
Hamlet and Homer.  One subtext, corporate control of a human life, may
relate to the cloning discussions that took place here many months ago;  I
would like to see someone address that if it interests.

The transhumanist aspect of this movie that completely hooked me early on
and let me identify with Truman was the way in which Truman's life was
controlled through the use of manufactured limits, and the methods by which
those limits were incorporated into Truman's psyche.  To keep him on the
island 'voluntarily', a violent death at sea was staged, in which Truman
'loses' his father and henceforth must avoid open water.  In his days at
grade school, the young Truman stands up proudly in class and declares, 'I
want to be an explorer, just like Magellan...'  On cue, the teacher
instantly draws down the world map and sweetly tells Truman, 'You're too
late!'  Airplanes lose parts that fall from the sky and posters in the
travel agency warn of dire consequences to those who venture abroad (yet
this does not deter Truman from booking a flight to Fiji, one aspect of the
plot that seems out of place.)  The analogy is obvious--many of our fears
and limitations as human beings have bases in the the society around us and
its agents.  

When the cracks begin to show in the carefully constructed world, and Truman
begins to realize the mechanations of events surrounding him, at first he
thinks he is losing his mind.  Everyone treats him as if he were indeed
losing his mind, in order to contain his growing independence and
questioning.  At this point in the movie, one can see the strain under which
the actors labor;  their lives have reached a stasis point in which the only
achievement to strive towards is the repression of another's desire to break
out of a stultifying routine.  

The filmmakers brought out this theme in the latter half of the movie by
casting it as a classical epic, in which Truman battles against a
manipulative god who would rather kill his creation than lose his control
over it.  Truman survives a terrible storm and thinks that his escape is
complete---and then his boat literally runs into the end of the world.  Now,
please understand--I don't generally have big emotional reactions to movies,
most are too calculated for my taste.  But when Truman stands against that
wall and realizes the true enormity of what he faces, and he throws himself
against that well, trying to physically will himself through it to
freedom--well, I just lost it and had to go see the movie again in order to
see the full ending!  The last twenty minutes of the film provide a perfect
visualization of the human species trying to break free of the twin shackles
forged by religious belief and by mortality. At least Truman got to confront
his god, and to reject him with as much grace and dignity as a chattel slave
can muster upon shedding the chains.  I hope that someday we all get that
chance.

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

And there's plenty of "rituals": taking anti-oxidants, doing CR,
strengthening the body and mind thru exercise and study, creative
visualization, reviewing your mission statement on sundays, etc.

It certainly already is a "religion" in this sense. By studying the
transhuman "bibles" you can get a deep understanding of the universe
and the (trans)human nature in it. This understanding and the commitment
is gives you can't be fundamentaly different from that of the "real"
religions.

  IAN: We agree on most things: that identity is 
  holistic and that the traditional Three Laws of 
  Thought are absurd and need holistic revision.

  We're covering 2 issues, (1) What is identity?
  and (2), What do people think atomism is? 

  Re: (1) What is identity?

  As we agree, the old absurd Aristotelian identity 
  laws need to cite the holistic-identity structure 
  in which A is A only relative to -A. As such, 1 
  is 1, not due to its relation to itself, but 1 
  is 1 fundamentally due to its relation to 0.

  Toward holistic revision, you have suggested 
  that "with respect to 0" be added to the Three
  Laws of Thought in accord with zero mechanics.

  Having established that 1 is the 0/1 relation,
  we have 1, we've "achieved" identity, and this 
  0/1 relation is a holism, it is a whole set with 
  subsets, or subfeatures dependent upon the whole. 

  An issue we disagree on is does the addition of 
  other identities relating to 0 into our universe 
  of discourse change the identity of the first 
  0/1 relation that we had. You say no, I say yes.

  Our universe of discourse (U) contains the 0/1 relation:

	   0/1

  Now we add several more relations, none same as 0/1:

	   0/1   0/9
	   0/6   0/4

  In the first case, 0/1 was 100% of U, now the 0/1 
  relation is only one-fourth of U, now it *is* LESS 
  relative to the whole. We can now also say that the 
  0/1 relation is unique. When we say A is _____(fill 
  in the blank), what it is is an attribute of its 
  identity, and as we can see, adding new relations
  to U has added new identity attributes to 0/1,
  and as such, identity is a holistic function.


  Why Holism is Absolute

  100% holism always wins, for even if we disagree 
  with the above and instead believe that the 0/1 
  relation has NOT changed, then this identified 
  state of "not-change" (not-C) is "not-C" relative, 
  and only relative, to C, and thus the non-changing 
  of the initial 0/1 relation is a measure of holism.
  The change here being that of the contents of U.

  So the examples of the relations of relations 
  cited have not identified any variety of free
  identity, and as such we always have 100% holism.


  Re: (2) What do people think atomism is?

  I say that the traditional Three Laws of Thought 
  define atomism by 100% by declaring that what the
  identity of A is excludes -A, and that the theory 
  of atomism is different than holism. You feel that 
  atomism = holism and an improved version of the 3
  Laws of Thought based upon holism defines atomism.

  If, as you stated, nobody believes the Three Laws 
  of Thought as they've been written for centuries, 
  that's fine with me. If there is nothing exterior 
  to holism, as you also seem to agree on, that too
  is fine with me. But I still believe that atomist
  identity theory is different than holist identity
  theory, but I'm willing to agree to disagree.

For the past several years, a substantial fraction of all physics 
publications have appeared first at the Los Alamos e-print server 
(http://xxx.lanl.gov).

More recently, Daniel Gottesman of Los Alamos National Laboratory has 
tried a new experiment in publishing.  It is a "preprint review" 
service.  The service provides reviews of papers in quantum computation.  
I imagine systems similar to this replacing conventional peer review in 
academic journals -- effectively, Gottesman's system has many of the 
advantages of peer review, whilst retaining much of the flexibility of 
the very lightly refereed preprint service.

Let me add to this that we have the distortions of one Saul of Tarsus, who was 
not only a woman-hater but also a self-aggrandizing Jesus-hater; who was 
called to account by Jesus' appointed apostles on at least two separate 
occasions during his lifetime -- *after* his alleged conversion -- for 
misrepresenting the teachings of Jesus, and is suspected on credible evidence 
of having attempted to murder the titular head of the Jesusite sect, Jesus' 
brother James, on one of these occasions.

And that the New Testament we have today can be neatly divided into two parts:

 (1) the words of Saul and his followers, and
 (2) one Gospel -- Mark if I remember correctly, but don't quote me -- and the 
book of Acts.

Further, there was a synod during the reign of a Justinian in the eastern empire, 
a rather embarrassing thing in that a grand total of six bishops attended who 
weren't *politically* dependent on Justinian, and most votes ended up with six 
bishops on one side and the rest on the other.  Prior to this synod, a certain 
early Christian theologian by the name of Origen was very highly regarded by 
most priests and bishops, including quite a few who were later named saints; 
afterward, his teachings and his very name were blasphemy, and anything 
resembling them was to be stricken from the church's teachings -- and through 
various machinations these teachings were quite thoroughly stricken, including 
when re-copying the writings of the various founders (none of which had the 
status of "Holy Scripture" at that time or for another couple hundred years).

This synod, incidentally, was part of the beginning of the schism between the 
Roman church and the Orthodox church -- but both sides accepted its edicts.

(What I learned about the history of the Christian faith got me expelled from a 
church before I was a teenager - and later persuaded me that a person who 
truly and honestly followed the teachings of Jesus would find no spiritual home 
in that religion, with the multiply-debatable exception of the Unitarians.  And 
this was before I turned away from strict monotheism...)

At least in the United States, some statistical evidence that the 
renowned gender gap between boys and girls has significantly diminished 
in math and science scores.  A comparison of 8th and 12th grade boys 
and girls scoring on math tests administered by the Dept. of Education 
revealed only a .04 difference in scoring, with the boys slightly 
ahead.  

Similarly, scoring on science differs little by gender until 
the 12th grade, when the boys begin to pull ahead.  Every analysis I've 
read of this particular aspect of it states that this may have more to 
do with class interactions than with the actual learning of the 
material.  Specific suggestions are made in the report to teachers on 
how to engage the girls more actively in class and in laboratory 
activities, which consitutes part of their grade.  One interesting 
suggestion:  a teacher should wait five seconds after asking a question 
before calling on a student.  The boys hands go up immediately, but 
girls generally take a second or two to consider the question prior to 
raising their hands.  

This and more measures of gender progress are included in "The Girls 
Report" by Lynn Phillips.  Phillips compiled the report through a 
comprehensive survey of hundreds of academic and government statistical 
sources.

I confess, I am a fan of the X-files.  I find the show fun.

What is amusing to me is that the X-files is currently espousing the world-view
that you describe above.  Fox Mulder has evolved to the point that he no longer
believes in UFOs.  He believes that the whole concept is a fraudulent attempt
by big government to numb the masses into accepting coming future events.  They
use the rediculous cover-story of UFOs to conceal a more sinister and
down-to-earth scientific experiments and military exercises.  In the X-Files
universe, the government discredits witnesses to secret operations by fooling
them into think what they have witnessed was a UFO.  That way, no one
investigates the real events that are occurring, because they are too busy
investigating the bizarre cover stories.

The best thing about the show is that the main character can reject years of
past belief when new scientific evidence shows him to be in error.  I hope they
can maintain this integrety, and don't "rescue" Mulder from "losing the faith".

My favorite episode was the one with Charlse Nelson Riley writing a book about
a UFO abduction.  The different witnesses gave him radically different versions
of the story, showing that everybody remembers things the way they want to, and
that eyewitness reports are unreliable.  Mulder wanted to believe in the UFO,
while one of the witnesses describes Mulder as the evil government man-in-black
trying to supress the information.  Scully does an alien autopsy on the alien
to prove it is real and discovers that the alien is a human in a rubber suit
who was killed during the staged event.  After reporting that the alien was
faked, a film of her autopsy shows up on Fox carefully doctored to make it look
like a real alien autopsy.  The best part was when a girl was put under
hypnosis to bring about more UFO memories.  The scene in the hypnotists' office
with all the investigators transformed into the scene in the UFO with aliens
examining her.  It was clear to the audience that the "memories" were being
manufactured from the current hypnosis session, even though the characters on
the screen did not realize that the memories were being manufactured!

I find the show to be very extropian, and very true to life.  There is
confilicting information in the show.  True-believers think that the aliens are
confirmed to exist, while skeptics can show where all the evidence has been
faked.  Even the main characters flip-flop between believing and disbelieving. 
They find "proof" that convinces them, and then find "proof" that the original
proof was faked.  Even if everything in the X-files were literally true, I
still would not believe in aliens while a true believer would think that the
existance of aliens was indisputeable.  I don't know how much more realistic
they could get.

:-) Actually, making them "rituals" is a good way of turning them into
stable habits. But maybe we should give them a more proper symbolic
form too, without loosing any of the function. Right now transhumanist
techniques seem to be very functionalistic, but they might be even
more enjoyable if turned into art.

Except that practically all religions are based on taking them on
faith, anecdotal evidence or personal subjective experiences that may
or may not be true. The aim of transhumanism is to be based on real,
reproducible and reliable evidence. Remember PCR; we shouldn't believe
in anything just because Max More has written it, we should believe in
it because it fits known facts and there is no contradictions. Our
understanding is evolving and improving, acknowledging its limitations
but also actively trying to expand.

The day we can show that transhumans live longer, are happier and more
mentally balanced than the average human, then transhumanism will
become truly accepted.

she was taken to the brink of death with this inoperable naso-pharyngeal

That's the golden part.  We get our choice of causes- (1) government

Yes, that's very good news (I think). It's been predicted that soon
there will be more women than men in universities (in the Netherlands,
anyway), and higher positions in general. I wonder when the gender gap
in transhumanism wil close, though. Now *that's* a good indicator of
emancipation. Also, it would/will be interesting to see whether the race
gap will close as easily as the gender gap (apparently, women had it in
them all along, but were just hampered by their generally meeker nature,
weaker physique, kids etc.).

Check out cover article "How Memory Works" (Newsweek, June 15) by Geoffrey
Cowley and Anne Underwood.

Overview on working memory (for juggling information) and long-term memory
(for storage).

Interesting point:  "Perfect retention may sound like a godsend, but when
the hippocampus gets overly permissive, the results can be devastating."  

Superhuman memories: "These savants can recite colossal strings of facts,
words and numbers. But most are incapable of abstract thought.  Lacking a
filter on their experience, they're powerless to make sense of it."

Plus:  guidelines for managing memory (a bit light but ok nonetheless) and
some smart drugs.

Ah yes, a great man and deep thinker - literally hacked off his own

Since you both seem to have ceased the argument without coming to a
conclusion, lets see what consequences there are if the assertion that:

XX) A = not(A)  (as taken from Ians definition of Holism at 
www.erols.com/igoddard/holistic.htm) 

is true.

Define a set universe U = {A, B, C}

This implies that B is an element of not(A).

taking XX, this implies that B is an element of A.

Since A is an atomic entity within U, this actually means that

B = A.

That means that U = {A, C}.

One can continue on in the same fashion, until

U = { A }  =>  U = A.

However, under this definition, not(A) = empty set.

Thus, using assertion XX, one can only come to the conclusion that U is
an empty set.

As we defined U = {A, B, C}, we can then conclude that {A, B, C} is an
empty set.

This is blatantly false.

So, assertion XX must be false.

It shouldn't have taken you a full page to disprove A = -A.  Consider: A +
-A is zero, or should be.  But if A = -A, then A + -A = A + A = 0.  You
could do this for any number, including a constant; all numbers would
equal zero, including such important numbers as pi and e and 1 and
infinity, and the probability that anything exists at a given point.  In
other words, you get a nonsense universe. 

However, you have misunderstood Ian's holism.  (He is often a little,
shall we say, synedochical?)  A is not equal to not-A, but rather he makes
the point that you really have no idea what A is unless you define it in
terms of something that it isn't.  To evince: if you came up to me and
asked me what A is, and I told you "A is A," while I would have said
something true, it would have been completely useless to you.  On some
level, you really wanted to know something about what A is in relation to
something else; in other words, what A is not.

The bit about A = -A comes from the net identity charts.  Basically, it
goes like this: take a universe consisting of only two things: A and B,
remembering that A is only defined in terms of its relationship to other
parts of the universe.  Clearly, A is zero difference from itself, and it
has (let's say) a difference of 1 from B.  (Units are deliberately left
out of this analysis: it doesn't matter what property you're referring
to.)  Well, B has a zero difference from itself, and the difference from B
to A is -1.  Ian points out that if you sum all of these relations, you
always get zero.  He calls this the "net identity."  It is always zero.

Here's where you make the dubious leap: if A is defined not by itself, but
by its relations to things which are not-A (in this case, B) then on some
level you could say that the identity of A is its net identity, which is
always zero.  Repeat this for B, or -A, and you see that the net identity
of A is equal to the net identity of -A.  A + -A = B + -B = 0.

This is really a trivial point, and doesn't really tell you anything about
anything that a properly defined atomism wouldn't.  It is also not holism
in the way you'd probably define it (but which Ian would): note that for a
mysticist, because A = -A, (rather than the net identity of A = the net
identity of -A,) the sum of the net identity is 0, 1, 8, infinity, and all
other numbers simultaneously, because all numbers are equal to all other
numbers.  Ian agrees that this is illogical, however: his identity charts
always sum to zero, and only zero.  He WOULD argue that the net identity
of all numbers is equal to the net identity of 0, but as you can see, this
is a much weaker (and far more defensible!)  claim.

I asserted that atomism = holism (IAN's holism, I mean!) because his
holism is saying much less than most holists.  Meanwhile, he has held a
definition of atomism which basically states that things are defined in
terms of themselves; this is completely nonsensical, as you should be able
to see, because you have to have a frame of reference in order to define
anything.  You can't say that A = A and then go on to say that you now
know what A is.  Telling you A in relation to 0, however, may be more
useful, particularly if I give you a few other values in relation to zero.
This is what the atomists are really talking about: you won't find any
Newtonian physicist claiming that particles have a velocity independent of
their refrence frame, but they are atomists nonetheless, because they
believe that particles may have independent properties *within a single
reference frame*, ie in relation to zero.

To summarize: it's not that A=-A, it's that identity(A) = identity(-A) =
0.  Whether you agree with this definition or not is your own lookout.

  IAN: Inversely I say "holism = Dan's atomism,"
  which follows since Dan modified the standing 
  definition of atomism to model my definition 
  of holism, so the statement "atomism = holism
  (IAN's holism, I mean!)" follows by design.

  But you do cite a difference between Dan's
  atomism and Ian's holism, which is that:

    "[atomists believe] that particles may have 
    independent properties *within a single
    reference frame*, ie in relation to zero."

  How does A have an "independent property" 
  with respect to the property it acquired
  from 0? If A acquires the property of A
  from 0, then A has no independent property.

  Please evidence an independent property of A.

  I've carefully addressed the examples raised 
  that seem to be intended to support your claim,
  and yet in your reply you've not even attempted 
  to show my counters are not true. See my last

 IAN: Your argument is true, but it 
 does not actually address what I say.

 It comes down to the context in which 
 we use the "=" symbol. Your critique 
 of my page cited uses the "=" symbol
 in a different context than that 
 which I carefully state there:


    Criterion for inclusion in "A"

    x is a part of A, IF x is necessary for 
    the specific existence/identity of A. 

    If this criterion is valid, it then follows that as: 

    not-A is necessary for the existence of A, 
    therefore, not-A is a part of A. 
    In the same fashion, A is a part of not-A. 

    IF not-A is a part of A, 
    IF A is a part of not-A, 
    THEN A and not-A have the same parts. 
    ERGO: A = not-A


 Assuming you do not see the contexts now
 more than you did before (it's not easy),
 I'll define them more clearly... asap.
 It has to do with equality if relational
 dependence vs differentiating features,
 the first context returns an = while the 
 second context returns an =/= and each
 context is a feature of the other.

My employer has a technology research facility in Palo Alto, and I'm trying
to get there. Luckily, I've found a well-connected manager who can assist
me, but since he has to go through the world-wide head of technology for
the company he needs me to produce a short paper showing my abilities.

I intend to write a paper on uploading. The head of technology is an
Extropian-savvy person, to whom uploading will not sound like a 'way-out'
concept.

So... can you please suggest some good sources of information for the paper
either on the Net, or in print, or, best of all, in the form of friendly
researchers in this area who could provide nice sound bites. I need to
write a presentation which is very up-to-date and though-provoking. My
writing abilities are up to the job, but I need a little assistance with
the content. Right now, I could put together something informed, coherent
and well-structured: but it need to be a little more than that.

Going to Palo Alto is important to me in both personal and Extropian ways.
Any help would be very, very greatly appreciated.

Many thanks,

Sarah Marr

   Gerhard contends that the "A = -A" statement is
   false, as it would be if we say that A is 100%
   the same as -A, but it is not false in an im-
   portant context. Let's see how A can = -A.

   Here's an obvious example where A = -A:

   If A = 30% of U and -A = 70% of U, in the context
   of volume we say that A =/= -A, or the volumes of 
   A and -A are different. If A = 50% and -A = 50%,
   then A = -A with respect to volume. With respect 
   to location, color, etc, it may be that A =/= -A.

   So A = -A and does not = -A at the same time in 
   different contexts. When mystics say A = -A (or
   something to that effect) they are referring to 
   a primordial context that maps the structure of
   identity. So what is this "mystical" context?

   If we should ask, what is the degree to which a thing,
   A, is a required feature of the identity of A, and what 
   is the degree to which another thing, -A, is a required
   feature of A, we find that the answer is that the degree
   to which A requires A is EQUAL to the degree that A re-
   quires -A for A to exist. So "the degree of A" = "the 
   degree of -A" with respect to the degree to which 
   either is necessary for the existence of A, and
   in this fundemental context, indeed A = -A.

   That's the true meaning of the mystical axiom: A = -A.
   Even if A = 90% of the spacetime volume of U, while -A 
   only = 10%, the identity of A requires that 10% to a 
   degree that is equal to its requirement for the 90%.
   A = -A expresses the equality of identity dependence.

   Saying "A =/= -A" says, "A is different than -A,"
   and it's precisely the difference between A and -A 
   (with respect to features of identity such as color, 
   size, speed, etc.) that is the basis of the relational, 
   or differential, dependence of A and -A upon each other 
   for their unique identity features, and which therefore 
   renders the "A = -A" statement true with respect to
   the degree of dependence for identity existence.

   A = A if, and only if, A =/= -A, which means that for
   A to exist A must be differentiated from -A, which means
   that A requires -A as much as A (itself), and the degree
   to which A requires -A = the degree to which A requires A.

   So when we say "A =/= -A" we say that A has features that 
   are different than the features of -A, and when we say 
   that "A = -A" we say that the degree to which A requires 
   -A for its identity is equal to the degree A requires A. 
   Hence the identity structure of A contains both A and -A,
   and the identity of A spreads out beyond the limits of A.

   We can express this via the holistic set theory I've 
   proposed, which defines the "A = -A" context of A as 
   (super)A. (super)A is the superstructure of the iden-
   tity of A that contains all the features that are re-
   quired for the existence of (in)A. (in)A is the in-
   terior region of the entity called "A." (super)A 
   contains both (in)A and (out)A, and (out)A is 
   simply the external area of (in)A. So:

   (super)A = {(in)A, (out)A}

   and (in)A =/= (out)A

   which states that (in)A is different than (out)A.
   When we add entities to (out)A, we have overlapping
   identity mappings, which my upcoming pages cover.

Please read this entire message if you care about science.

Yesterday, I went to a Barnes and Noble bookstore and found a new
"science" magazine (Volume 1, Number 2)  next too Popular Science and 
Scientific American. This magazine is called Cosmic Pursuits. At first,
I was happy to see a new magazine which claimed, on the cover, to be in
pursuit "of Answers to Life's Big Questions "

Inside (page 4), it even told what the mission of this magazine is:

"Cosmic Pursuit is the quarterly journal of The Day Star Network. Its
purpose is to encourage thoughtful discussion of life's ultimate
questions, to inform readers of relevant scientific discoveries, and to
provide a platform for dialog and debate between a variety of
viewpoints.

The Day Star Network is a division of the Day Star Productions, a
non-profit 501(c)(3) organization based in Wheeling, Illinois. Its
mission is to encourage people to seek answers to life's big
questions--and to provide the best information possible to aid in that
quest. The Day Star Network is an informal network of interested
individuals of all beliefs and educational backgrounds, organized by Day
Star Productions."

This sounded great, but as I read the essays, I realized this was not
what it claimed to be!!!!  The articles in this magazine were not
scientific at all! This turned out to be a creationist rag dressed up
with slick, shinny pictures and articles on pseudoscience like
"Intelligent Design" and why AI is doomed to fail

On the back of the magazine, it gave a web address
http://www.daystarcom.org

If one explores the site, you find the creationism bias everywhere!

In fact, a different version of the text above appears at 

http://www.daystarcom.org/info/daystar.htm

" Day Star Productions is a non-partisan, non-denominational,
not-for-profit, 501(c)(3) organization. Founded in 1978, its mission is
to encourage people to seek a close relationship with the
Creator/Sustainer of the universe. The Day Star Network is an informal
network of  interested individuals of all educational backgrounds and
beliefs, organized by Day Star Productions.

Why did they not print this in the magazine? If they were honest about
their bias and intentions, it could not be sold in large bookstores like
Barnes and Noble as if it were an actual scientific journal.

This is also from http://www.daystarcom.org/info/daystar.htm

"The Day Star Network

Purposes: 

1.To examine the relevant evidence from modern science and the best
arguments from philosophy and history that bear upon life's big
questions, such as: Does God exist? If so, what kind of a God is he/it?
Is the universe an accident, and are we conscious beings an accident
within a larger accident—or is there some grand purpose behind it all?
Can a non-theist create his own meaning and his own ethical system? 

2.To help make the latest discoveries in science understandable and
relevant to the general public. 

3.To encourage people caught in a rat-race world to do something
uniquely human: to stop and think about life's big questions, and to
critically examine all viewpoints. 

4.To provide a forum for debate between knowledgeable representatives of
opposing viewpoints on these questions.

5.To promote mutual respect and understanding between people with
opposing life-views.

To carry out these objectives, the organization: 

Publishes Cosmic Pursuit, a quarterly journal to encourage thoughtful
discussion of life's ultimate questions, to inform readers of relevant
scientific discoveries, and to provide a platform for debate between
opposing viewpoints. Provides people with an opportunity for networking
with others who are interested in examining the latest scientific
evidence and logical arguments that bear on these cosmic questions. 
Promotes written works, videos, and other resources that  encourage
knowledgeable discussion of life's big questions.

Carries out research projects in order to contribute to the body of
knowledge bearing on these questions. 

Organizes seminars, conferences, and debates.

Completely correct.  I am no philosopher or mathematician, but a mere
engineer. However, I was consciously attempting to make the proof more
general, as the above only applies to certain sets of rings and fields. In
addition, you are making the error of equating the operator '-' with 'not'.

I was referring to properties of A-0 which are independent of B-0; I was
not asserting that there were properties independent of 0.

As I have constantly asserted, we OUGHT to get 100% holism: it's the same
theory with different definitions.  In this case, I don't see that there's
any way that you could argue that I CANNOT define identity to refer only
to the A-0 partial difference.  It's just a definition, after all: I can
define unicorns if I so wish.  Within that context, identity is the
partial difference if you adopt the (my?) atomism set of definitions
and it is the net difference if you adopt the (your?) holism set of
definitions.

However, a thought occurred to me today which just might sink zero
mechanics as a theory.  (Gasp!)  As we both agree, zero mechanics is
completely compatible with Newtonian mechanics; indeed, this may be zero
mechanics's downfall.

Consider objects A and B, which comprise the entire universe.  Imagine for
a moment that when they were at rest they measured each other's lengths
and found that both had the same length.  So their identity chart for
length would look like: 

   A  B
A  0  0
B  0  0

There is 0 difference between A's length and A's length; nor is there any
difference between A's length and B's length.  The chart sums to zero.
So far, so good.

Now let us suppose that they change their speed relative to each other to
something quite large; 0.6c.  The velocity of A->B is 0.6c, B->A is -0.6c. 
A->A = B->B = 0.  Sum them all, you get zero.  Again, so far, so good. 

But let's go back to observing their lengths again.  According to special
relativity, A and B would EACH observe each other's lengths to have
contracted, while their own lengths remained the same (again, relative to
each).  To be precise, A observes B's length to be 80% of what it
once was; B observes A's length to have contracted in the same way.  Let's
call the magnitude of this change C.  Now let's look at our identity
chart:

   A  B
A  0 -C
B -C  0

This chart sums to -2C, violating a principle of zero mechanics, and
ruining net identity's whole day.

Of course, so long as we take on an (my) atomistic definition, we're fine. 
There is no principle of zero mechanics inherent in atomism, so we avoid
this problem entirely.  Interesting, no?

   IAN: In short, there are no independent, 
   or free, properties of identity A, period! 
   Observe that in the identity matrix, every 
   identity attribute of identity A is derived 
   from an external relation, such that

              -----------

    all identity attributes listed below 
    identity A on the top are derived from 
    external relations (defined by their in-
    tersection in the matrix), and each new 
    relation to enter the field adds a new 
    attribute to all included identities. 
    The sum of all identities = 0, and 
    the self-relation identity = 0.

    There is no identity in one thing nor 
    in all things, only in the relation of
    things. Identity = relation/difference.

    The sum of All identities must be 0,
    since identity = difference, and the 
    difference between All and All = 0,
    just as in the case of 5 - 5 = 0.

    100% of what (internal)A is comes from 
    (outside)A, which contains 0,1,2,3...
    and each relation of A with n yeilds 
    two symmetrical identity attributes,
    one to A one to n, which sum to 0.

    Since all identity attributes that we 
    can measure are derived from external 
    relations, identity is stark raving 
    100% holistic, like hard-core holism,
    not a trace of atomized, or as it
    was called, "independent identity."

    The independent identity = 0, or null.

  IAN: Motion measures will sum to 0 due to
  the inclusion of direction in the measurement 
  of relative velocities such that we will get 
  a 25 mph and a -25 mph. In your matrix, the 
  relation is size, but only one of two dir-
  ections in size is indicated (smaller, or -), 
  and the zero sum (of all valid measurements)
  is thus found in two symmetrical matrices...

   IAN: Both -C (each individual measure of 
   foreshortened length) and -2C (their sum) 
   are derived by relation to 0 (the 0 point 
   of measure, being the observer's ship) and

       0 - (-2) = +2
      -2 - 0    = -2

   the net difference between -2 and 0 is zero;
   and thus the inverse matrix is equally true:

              A  B
           A  0  -
           B  -  0


              A  B
           A  +  0
           B  0  +

   Because size is relative, A appears to in-
   crease in size when measuring B. As A looks
   at B, observer A could equally assume he had 
   increased in size just as the observer in one 
   train looking at another train next to him out 
   the window seeing motion and may assume either
   his train or the other is in motion, and either
   assumption is equally correct. Observer B also
   assumes he may have increased in size. So net 
   difference is found in the sum of the matrices.
   One size-matrix doesn't contain all difference.

         larger (+) <---0---> (-) smaller

   Dan, it's a great counter(!) worthy of further
   investigation, but it can only be sustained if 
   it can be shown that size is not relative and 
   thus that one matrix is more valid, but even 
   that "more vs less" valid is another 0 sum.

IAN:One size-CHANGE--matrix doesn't contain all
difference. If size is static, one matrix covers
all difference, but if size changes, 2 matrices
cover all difference. This seems to be because
a static-size relation between A and B where
A is larger has only two possibilities:

   1. (A larger)
   2. (B smaller)

But a measure of all possible relations in the 
changing sizes of A and B must map twice the 
number of relative measurements of the change:

   1. (A larger)
   2. (A smaller)
   3. (B larger)
   4. (B smaller)

A and B may assume they themselves got larger, 
or A & B may both assume the other got smaller.
It seems to be the inclusion of time/change 
into matrix-identity format that results 
in the requirements for additional data
and thus opens another data dimension.

   IAN: It's an interesting area of inquiry:
   does the "-" negative notion equate 100%
   with the "-" logical not notion? What's
   your case that "negative =/= not"?

   On another topic... in my last 
   post I stated (and typeoed):

  The second matrix should read:

It might turn out that the way we develop semantic memories,
i.e. abstract information, is the gradual melding together of our
memories. That means we tend to loose their clarity, but we gain in
generalization ability.

This is something that interests me with memory enhancement. Is it
possible to both have the cake and eat it? If the multiple memory
trace model of Moscovitch and Nadal is true, then it might be possible
to tweak the consolidation processes to retain clear memories and get
abstraction. But this model is rather controversial (cf. the latest
issue of Current Opinion in Neurobiology).

   IAN: As an analogy: just as a day has a 
   dark side and a light side, you have an 
   inside and an outside, and just as the 
   identity of a day contains both sides, 
   your identity contains both your inside 
   and outside. The equivalence is not that 
   your outside is the same as your inside 
   (that would eliminate difference, the 
   basis of relational identity), it's 
   that your outside is an equally 
   necessary feature of your identity.

   If we ask, "To be A, does A need A more
   than A needs -A?" we find that A needs A
   to a degree that is the same as (=) -A.
   If we ask, "Is A as large as -A?" and 
   we find -A is larger, we say A has a
   size that is not the same as (=/=) -A.

   So the A = -A statement defines one 
   aspect of A, its identity structure,
   a very big aspect of A! We can also 
   find this equality in the second ques-
   tion that returned a "A =/= -A" answer
   by asking "To be large, does the large
   need large as much as it needs small?"
   we will find that the large needs the 
   small for the large to be large to a 
   degree that is the same as (=) its 
   need for the large, so here L = -L.

   IAN: Taking holism to a numerical level
   (expressed in zero mechanics) we find 
   that identity is conserved, and it follows 
   from this that identities in natures, which 
   include all the physical forces, are like-
   wise conserved, because every X is merely 
   a derivative of -X, and every measure of 
   1 unit of X is derived by deviation from
   0, and the 0,1 identity relation is sym-
   metrical, meaning that 0 is as much smaller
   than 1 (-1) as 1 is larger (+1) than 0 and 
   the entire relation sums back to 0. It 
   follows therefore that no measure exceeds 
   0, where 0 = (n + (-n)), and this conserva-
   tion of identity tells us just about every-
   thing about everything in the universe.

   If we knew only the holistic identity
   theory and zero mechanics, we could pre-
   dict major factors of the structure of 
   the universe prior to encountering it, 
   because ultimately everything is relative 
   and holism defines relational structure.

   Of course I don't purport to have proven
   absolutely that nothing in the universe 
   deviates from zero mechanics but hope 
   people will test it has strongly as 
   they consider it may be true.

>From what I can see of the DayStar Magazine's principals, it is a welcome
progression in creationist publication.  I note that the magazine does not
purport to be a "science journal", and is not being sold as such.  The
"science section" is probably a fitting place for it.  "Popular Science" is
hardly a science journal!  If you are going to attack this magazine, it must
be because of what it says, not who publishes it and for what reason.  Are
the articles balanced and reasonable, or full of lies and distortion like
much creationist writing?  Believe it or not, there are people who believe
in Special Creation who are principled and not stupid.  These people, by and
large, are NOT fundamentalists.

There is a subset of the creationist movement that has distanced themselves
from fundamentalist lunacy such as that written by Gish etc.  The focus here
is on the "cosmic coincidence problem", as in, why are the initial
conditions of the universe so fitting for life to exist.  This is not a
trivial problem, and cannot be written off as "mere chance".  I happen to
believe that an anthropic argument coupled with a multi-verse is sufficient
to explain this universe's initial conditions, but there is room here for
those who wish to believe in a creator to find their niche.  If this
magazine can provide an honest,  balanced environment, I welcome it.

No, I picked up a copy of the magazine too. It is not balanced, but it
is not a scientific journal. It is not really reporting science either.
The article on AI says computers could never really think because God
made people special. It could be called an opinion magazine however :)

I'm sure Ian will send back a rather lengthy reply, but the long and the
short of it is this:  If I ask who Alex is, and I get back the answer
"Alex is Alex," I will not really have learned anything.  If I get the
response "Alex is like Ian, only with the following differences:" then I
get a far more complete answer.  What we conclude is that we have to know
something about what you are not in order to have any idea as to what you
are.  If you and Ian were the only two entities in the universe, then on
some level you would have an identity only by virtue of the fact that you
differed from Ian. 

This is clearest when used in terms of color.  If everything in the whole
universe were red, then you couldn't really define red in any meaningful
way.  However, you could do so if there were OTHER colors, in which case
you might get an idea of what red is by examining the ways in which it is
different from the other colors. 

nb, Ian is also somewhat liberal with his use of the logical operators. 
When he says "=", he probably doesn't mean the "=" to which you're
accustomed.

Some creationists may not be stupid but their idea is ridiculous, it's  
probably wrong too.

They're free to believe whatever they like and I'm free to believe 
creationists are silly and that you're giving them far more respect than they 
deserve. I agree that science does not have a very deep explanation for why 
there is something rather than nothing, but at least scientists are smart 
enough to recognize that limitation. I have contempt for creationists because 
they foolishly think they've tied up all the loose ends and have completely 
solved this very profound problem with one simple idea. "Existence exists 
because God exists" is certainly simple, it's downright retarded in fact, 
but a theory that complicates things and immediately rases an obvious 
question almost identical and every bit as profound as the one it claims to
answer is not a theory at all, it's a joke.

According to the bible god has "no beginning and no end" or
something along these lines, so you don't need other creators.
I wonder whether SIs will be able to perform the same trick,
strechting their existence infinitely both forwards and
backwards in time. 

> seems that occams razor would be better...

Yes, absolutely. Otherwise, we might as well believe that the universe
came from the egg of the Great Cosmic Goose (is this more silly than
a Great Cosmic Bearded Dude with the manners of a spoiled child?).

Creationism stems from a religious belief. All dead-ends can be solved
by the fiat of God "Well, God just made it that way."

Instead of using data to propose and test a variety of hypotheses,
creationist try to pigeon-hole all new data into an idea that Genesis is
the blueprint of creation. That is almost like science in reverse.

Every biologist knows that new data might show that neodarwinism might
be only half the solution....or even wrong. A creationist can not allow
creationism to be proved wrong---it is part of a religion, not a
science.

But the deep question is why there is something rather than nothing, not how 
long this state of affairs has been happening, the existence of time after 
all is just another thing that needs to be explained. If religion could do 
even a little bit better than science in explaining this, if it could just 
give me a hint of why there hasn't always not been a God then I'd be a 
religious man. It can't so I'm not.

If God did exist he'd be asking himself the same deep questions we are.

Wait a second.  This says that A relative to A is non-zero; to my reading,
A is + relative to A.  This is complete absurdity: nothing is large
relative to itself.

A does not increase in size relative to itself; so A relative to A must
always be 0.  A DECREASES in size relative to B.  There is no perspective
from which A increases in size.  I might accept a second matrix if it were
valid, but that particular one isn't.

This would be true if A were actually stretching relative to anything. 
However, NO perspective sees A increase in size.  I would grant you that
in normal Newtonian physics if you saw me shrinking relative to you, it
would be a safe presumption that you were stretching relative to me, but
not in special relativity.  I am shrinking relative to you AND you are
shrinking relative to me.

Well, perhaps you meant a different second matrix; any matrix which shows
A non-zero relative to itself is fishy, I'd say.  Perhpas you'd want to
say that:

   A  B
A  0  +
B  +  0

is true if we compare the second situation to the first, rather than the
first to the second.  The only problem with this matrix is that it is
never true; B is never large relative to A.  B is never large relative to
ANYTHING; at rest it is zero, and in motion it is negative relative to A.
Since you cannot find any perspective in which A or B are positive, I
sincerely doubt your ability to get back to 0 from the -.

Good luck!

Excellent point. Besides this, I think that I can point out one area where it can
be shown that we do not live in the absolute best of all possible universes,
ergo:

take c, the speed of light, and e=mc^2. Because this is such a low velocity
relative to the size of the universe, yet requires such an incredibly large
amount of energy to reach with a spacecraft, relative to the energy production
capacity of a technological civilization in that universe, this puts a huge crimp
on our ability to fulfill the Creator's command to disperse, multiply, and subdue
the universe that our 'Creator' has made for us. Moreover, even closer to home,
the high gravity of our planet also puts a similar brake on our ability to
disperse into the universe, making it expensive and difficult to move any
significant percentage of our race into space. Because of these severe
limitations, it is obvious that we actually do NOT live in the best of all
possible universes.

so therefore, since this universe is not perfectly suited for God's creations to
bear forth and multiply, we cannot live in a universe created by a perfectly
divine being.

I'll play devil's advocate and pretend I'm a creationist. If c was only 
slightly larger fusion reactions would release so much energy the sun would 
blow apart. Even more important, if c were faster it would be easy to program 
an AI, no need for clever programming or fancy algorithms, to solve a problem 
just look at every possibility, even if there were an infinite number of 
things to check it would be no problem if c was instantaneous. The trouble is 
God might not like the competition, He might get a little jealous if we could 
make a little box as smart as He was from just a few parts we picked up at 
radio shack.

there is an apocryphal story of a young student who asks his guru: mater, upon
what does the earth rest?
guru:  upon the back of a great tortoise, my son.
student: but master, upon what does this great tortoise stand?
guru:  upon the back of a still greater tortoise.
student:  but master, upon what...
guru:  this is an interesting line of questioning, my son, but
i can assure you, it is tortoises all the way down.

{8^D  this is all great fun until we realize that we big bang fans have
a tortoise problem too...

perhaps we live in an unfortunate place within the best of all possible
universes.  what if we lived in a globular cluster, so that the nearest stars
were only a few light days away, and the home planet had a low gravity
field?   we could have already colonized the cluster.  as it is, we are way
out here on a high gravity planet where our nearest stellar neighbors are
not promising...

   IAN: Very well elucidated! 100%!
   I couldn't have said it better.


>nb, Ian is also somewhat liberal with his use of the logical operators. 
>When he says "=", he probably doesn't mean the "=" to which you're

   IAN: That I disagree with. The use of "="
   means that what appears on the left is the 
   "same as" what appears on the right. So "A = A"
   is the same as (=) saying "A is the same as A."

         (A = A) = (A is the same as A)

   "Not same as" is the same as "does not equal,"
   or ascii-wise =/=, which means "different than."

   The "A = A" identity axiom really only serves
   to inform use by example of what the "=" means
   by telling us in the most obvious fashion, "What
   appears on the left side is the same as what appears
   on the right side of this symbol, wherever this symbol 
   is used." It's a symbolic instruction, not a blueprint
   of the structure of identity, which would include -A. 

   As to my use of the "=" symbol, I have defined its 
   logical application pertaining to the answer to the 
   inquiry, "What is the degree to which the indentity 
   of A requires A and what is the degree to which it 
   requires -A," and the answer is that the degree to 
   which A requires A is equal to -- i.e., is the 
   same as (=) -- the degree to which A requires -A.

 IAN: My placing the + under A was an error.
 What you write is the proper "got larger" matrix,
 and as I shall show, it's as valid as the first.

  IAN: A reduction (-) of B in size by 1
  unit relative to A (0) is expressed as 
  -1. -1 is LESS than 0, 0 is 1 more (+)
  then -1, so in fact A has gotten larger!

  Size is 100% relative. There is no absolute
  size, and that's what your case requires. 
  That the second matrix is valid is clearly 
  proven by the fact that -1 is less than 
  0 and 0 is 1 more than -1. If we have 2
  things in the universe, A and B, and B 
  gets smaller, it's equally true that A
  gets larger, because size is relative.

  So the second matrix that defines the 
  zero sum of all valid data = valid data.

Well, if we posit than anybody with sufficiently advanced technology can
create new realms of existence, there could be an unlimited number of
creators, no big deal.

That is essentially the same thing that Penrose seems to believe (minus the
God bit).  Also, Occam's razor is merely a guide, and cannot have
explanatory force.

  For too long, the "Big Bang" theory of creation has reigned supreme,
despite glaring meta-cosmological problems, and has been complacently
accepted.  It is now becoming clear that there is much beyond the Big Bang.
Let me be clear...I do not believe in God or a created universe.  Hpwever, a
few forward-looking cosmologists speculate that we will eventually be able
to create baby universes in the laboratory.  Is it too much of a stretch to
think that we could eventually create a universe with initial conditions
fitting for life (even though we could never access it)?  Then the last
laugh will be on creationists, for at that point, we will be "God" (although
not the sort of God that they envisage).

Complacently accepted?.. Hardly.. We all know that the big bang theory has
holes..gapping ones at that... but, as i said before, at least we admit the
holes.. Religions, all religions, consider themselves complete. No holes, no
unanswered questions. Easy to do when the "answer" is  "because God(s) willed
it thus"
Which of course isn't any answer at all. It is along the lines of telling our
children " because I said so" when they ask why about something.

I, for one, and I expect everyone on this list, have no desire to remain a
child.  Therefore, such answers don't measure up.

I think the idea that we live in the best of all possible worlds is a 
profoundly depressing thought, I'd hate to think it's true.

The heavier elements are made in supernova explosions but globular clusters 
are made up of population one stars that are very old and created out of the 
original stuff from the Big Bang, so most metals vital for a technological 
civilization like iron, copper, tin and uranium would be virtually nonexistent 
in them. Even carbon would be rare making life in globular clusters doubtful. 

Another problem is that we would be ignorant of the larger universe, 
everything would be so crowded together we'd only be able to see things a 
few hundred light years away and we'd think that was the entire universe.

A planet much smaller than the Earth couldn't hold on to a substantial 
atmospheric. A planet much larger than the Earth would be able to retain so 
much of the primordial hydrogen that was common during its formation that 
free oxygen would be impossible.

This was one of several aspects of the move that detracted from the 
overall effect.  The "things are falling apart" aspect was overplayed, 
especially with the severely localized rainstorm that hit Truman while he 
was on the beach.  Still, these were relatively minor quibbles.

I also found that scene to be exceptionally moving. He remained 
weird, goofy Truman ("that is one strange cat, my man"), while 
demonstrating tremendous dignity and strength of will to continue on, 
even after crashing into the end of the world.  The part was played in 
character, but what a character!  "Who are you?... Then who am I?". Each 
line and action at that point had a grace and dignity about it 
that was true to Truman's own character, especially vis a vis the opening 
scene and several of the scenes with Marlon; self-awareness, coupled with 
a sense of humour.

One other aspect of the movie that I found especially interesting 
was Cristof's position with respect to his creation.  It seems that 
similar ethical problems will be faced by any creator of an 
artificial intelligence.

Is it ethical to contain an AI in a limited world? This is an especially 
interesting question if one takes the point of view that the most likely 
path to Artificial Intelligence is an approach based on evolutionary 
programming.

Is it ethical to broadcast details of an AI's "life" to other 
researchers or interested parties?

Is it ethical to profit from the actions of an AI?

None of these questions is new, however I found that they were made 
especially vivid by the movie.  I'm not sure of any of the answers.  I 
have an instinctive revulsion against Cristof's position, but I can imagine 
giving a qualified "yes" as the answer to all of the above questions, 
under some circumstances.

Would someone please expand and expound upon that please?

Two things.  I recently read Eric Lerner's "The Big Bang Never Happened"...and
it seemed reasonable to me.

                  Recently I recall hearing (on this list?) about a newly
discovered "antigravity" principle.  (Astronomical...not laboratory...the
astronomomers were preplexed)..If true this seems to add fuel to Lerner's
position...

Maybe there WAS no beginning.

Yes, but as time goes on, it definitely seems like we are at least making it

Additionally, I was under the impression that globular clusters with stars so
close would have much higher density, levels of radiation than there is in our own
vicinity, so we would need to live on a much larger planet with a much more
pronounced EM field to protect us from that radiation.

Considering that Venus is slightly smaller than Earth, yet has a much much denser
atmosphere (most likely due to its lack of a moon the size of our own), it is
evident that intelligent life of our kind could possibly evolve on a smaller
planet than ours with no large moon that had an earth normal atmosphere. For
example, if Mars, which has 1/3 of the gravity of our own planet, were in the
orbit of our own world, the solar flux levels would be high enough for it to have
an earth normal atmosphere (most of Mars' early atmosphere, which was close to
earth normal, is now bound in the crust due to the cold). It could have a moon
only a few hundred miles across to give it sufficient tide to enable enough
tectonic activity for volcanic fertilization, for maintainance of the mantle/core
dynamo that would generate a radiation protection EM field, as well as a near
enough location for inspiration of a manned space program in a technological
society.

With a 1/3 G field, it would be almost infinitely easier to afford widespread
space travel, as it would be within the capability of a supersonic jet plane to
escape a 1/3 gravity field. Thus, it would cost the equivalent of a Concorde
ticket for a normal person to fly into space...$2,000.00

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

In looking for a good home planet for space a exploring species how about a  
planet that had lots of heavy elements so it was 4 times as dense as the 
Earth but only 2000 miles in diameter. The Earth would have 64 times the 
volume and 16 times the mass, but the gravity on the surface of this small 
world would be exactly the same as we have, 1g. The good part is that the 
escape velocity would only be 1/16 that of the Earth. The horizon would be a 
little close but otherwise things would seem perfectly earth-like on the 
surface, however you could put a billet into orbit with a hand gun, and with 
a rifle you could hit the moon.

The bad part is that the ability to keep an atmosphere depends on the escape 
velocity not the surface gravity, so such a planet wouldn't be able to retain 
one for a very long time, at least not from a geological point of view.

Relative to what?  Not A or B.

It certainly does not.  I'm saying that A is decreasing relative to B and
that B is decreasing relative to A.  There is no "true" length without a
reference frame.  However, I am also saying that because both are
decreasing relative to each other (rather than one increaseing and one
decreasing as we would expect), they are also not increasing in size
relative to anything: A remains unchanged to itself and shrinks with
respect to B; B remains unchanged to itself and shrinks with respect to A.
There is not point where A increases relative to B, and THAT'S the truth.

No, you don't understand.  You're thinking in terms of Newtonian physics
and not in the inherently non-intuitive terms of special relativity. 
Normally, when something gets smaller, something else gets larger relative
to it; special relativity sys that when B appears smaller to A, A appears
SMALLER to B, not larger.  This is why it doesn't sum to 0:  If B were
actually shrinking, it would look like this: 

   A  B
A  0 -C
B +C  0

and zero mechanics would be saved.  This is, however, NOT the situation
described above, at all.  A is *NOT* growing relative to B, it is
SHRINKING relative to B.  That's why we get:

   A  B
A  0 -C
B -C  0

which is distinctly different from the case in which B actually shrinks
relative to A.

The reason why this matrix is wrong:

   A  B
A  0 +C
B +C  0

is because it says something that simply isn't true:  A does not increase
in size relative to B.  You can't use this matrix without claiming that A
increases in size relative to B and that A increases in size relative to
B; this never actually happens.  It SHOULD, according to Newtonian
mechanics, but it doesn't.

Yes, such a location would be ideal for an exploring species to settle, and it
would be small enough for reasonable tech to maintain an atmosphere fairly easily
for however many thousands of years it is occupied, and make sky hooks feasible.
However, speaking about planets a species would develop on, I think that a Mars
sized planet in an Earth regional orbit would probably work better.

?not? is a universal set theoretic operator, whilst ?-? is an operator
that is usually associated with Paeno systems/sets.

Please don?t take the following personally, but if you (Ian) have never met
these terms, I strongly advise that you familiarize yourself with
elementary logic and set theory.  The fact that you are attempting to
espouse a philosophy using terms grounded on set theory, logic, and
analysis surely dictates that you should, at least, have a passing
familiarity with these subjects.

Wow ?.. there are so many holes in that stream of reasoning that I really
can?t be bothered pointing them all out (and please, don?t ask me to).
Perhaps somebody on the mailing list who has recently or is currently in
the process of completing an elementary course in logic may wish to.

I?ve noted that you (and others) repeatedly use terms such as ?degree?,
and ?measure? - unfortunately these terms are only valid for sets where
these can have meaning (such as the set of Reals).  For example, for the
set of operators O = {+, -, *}, where O is not a Paeno set, what is the
difference between {+} and {-} ? 

>?.. So A = -A and does not = -A at the same time in

To state that  ?A = -A?, where the context of the left side is different from
the context of the right side is logically invalid, and is an abuse of the ?=?
sign.  According to this fashion of reasoning, I could prove that Mary is a
man because all jeans are worn by men (in Italy), Mary is wearing jeans
(in New Zealand), therefore Mary is a man!  I'm sorry, but ...... I don't think
so. 

However, your ideas have some merit - the set U = { A } is an extremely
boring set, especially if any operators performed on U must result in a
member of U! Things only begin to get interesting once we have U = {A,
B}, from which we could derive boolean algebra and ascribe A the
?meaning? true and B the meaning ?false?.

I could go on (and on), but I think I?ve spent too much time on this already. 
Unless you expound your ideas and concepts in a considerably more
rigorous manner, you will find that your ideas will continue to cause
conflict without coming to any conclusion on the validity of your
viewpoint.

Interesting.

I'd be interested to know more about this.  Why is it that earth has tectonic
plates..a molten core...etc....but venus, our moon... and and presumably the
other rocky planets do not...?    I was under the impression that it had to do
with radioactives in the core...releasing heat and keeping it molten.  But if
that was the case then venus should be similar.

First I ever heard of the moon's influence keeping the core molten...assuming
I understand this correctly.

My own understanding of this is that Venus does not have plate tectonics
because it does not have a well defined crust.  A lot is still unknown about
Venus, but it appears the surface is too hot for a brittle crust like Earth's.

I've never heard of the idea of tidal forces having much to do with plate
tectonics since seafloor spreading was discovered in the early 1960s (or
so?).  Wegener's original theory of continental drift posited tidal forces as
the cause of drift.  Modern (post-1960) theories of plate tectonics -- e.g.,
plate mosaic theory, which appears to be the current conventional wisdom
-- posit convection in the mantle as the proximate cause of plate movement.

The Earth's moon appears to not have plates because it does not possess
a the same kind of highly convective mantle as Earth.  Ditto for Mars.

Cheers!

No. The Earth is 8000 miles in diameter and would have a volume 64 times that 
of a planet 2000 miles in diameter, and that's just what I said. Even if the
smaller world was 4 times as dense the Earth would still have 16 times the 
mass.

These are interesting questions. Overall the field of creator-created
ethics is little explored so far (for obvious reasons). 

I must admit I have no good consistent idea about how to answer these
questions. We might need to create AIs in limited worlds, and they
might be extremely useful in there. "Opening the box" and allowing
them out might be troubling for them, but at the same time that would
put them on an equal footing (at least equal ontological footing) with
us, suggesting that at least then they should definitely get
rights. The problem here seems to be that although the AIs are
rational subjects the rules for rights and ethics we have developed
doesn't seem to work well across ontological levels.

> Is it ethical to profit from the actions of an AI?

Is it ethical to profit from the actions of a human? I would say so,
if the human gets part of the earnings (ideally making a contract with
me). Things get tricky when the AI/human doesn't know I profit, but
I'm sure the legal system already has some rules saying it is not
proper behavior. Laws about parent/child interaction might also be
applicable here.

In one of his biographies, Physisist Richard Feynman claims to have had an
exchange much like this with an older woman after he presented a lecture on
basic physics principles. She told him that she knew how the world was
*really* set up, and when he queried her, she responded with the tortise
premise. When he questioned her further, she scolded him and said that she
knew he was trying to confuse her, but it was "turtles turtles turtles all
the way down".

Kelly and I use this expression as shorthand to gently point out
unsupportable premises in the statements of others or ourselves.

However, it is worth pointing out that even in modern physics, we seem to
have infinitely-regressing-turtle-like situations, eg the apparently always
receding "smallest things". First we thought it was gross elements, then
atoms, then subatomic particles (mesons, leptons etc), and now even these
themselves appear to be composed of yet smaller elements  - the quarks. I
for one, would not be suprised to hear scientists speak of even more
fundamental objects/concepts of reality. It certainly seems sometimes as
though the grain of the universe is always just small enough for us to
barely make out, but when our "eyes" get better we see that the grain is
finer still.

hmmmm.

Sorry, but I think this is a really stupid argumentation. Why should God
create a perfectly suited world for humans? If there`re no problems and
obstacles there can`t be any evolution.
How do you define "perfectly" suited? Nothing can definitely be perfect for
humans, because you don`t know which way they will take. The way you express
your explanation implies that you don`t  believe in the freedom of spirit.
It`s a matter of opinion if something is good or not.

I will do my best to summarize the implications of this discovery.

An extra copy of Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) was introduced into the fruit
fly genome. SOD is an enzyme that renders oxidants less harmful.

This single gene alteration increased the fly life span by 40 percent. I
recall similar results having been obtained previously. The unique aspect
of this study is the claim that the cells which are responsible for
limiting the fly life span have been located and are motor neurons.

This discovery may be more applicable to treatment of Lou Gehrig's disease
more than a general treatment of aging. In humans there is some evidence
that an increase in SOD may be harmful rather than beneficial. It is
suspected that an extra copy of SOD may be responsible for premature aging
in Down Syndrome.

If anyone is interested in the full text of the article it is in the 
June issue of Nature Genetics.

if you're not aware of that speculative theory check (for example)

If you think like this, you`ll never be religious. Religion is connected
with believe not with explanations. Either you can believe,  or you can`t.
There won`t ever be an explanation in a real religion.
BTW I`m no christian or other conventional religion.

I would suggest two interpretations to the above questions.

Human ethics evolved to regulate people's relations with other persons
and their possessions in the physical world.  Some of the ethical
principles must be generic and good for regulation relations between
different entities (the degree of identity granulation in an AI world will
be much different from human, so I don't really expect "personalities"
there).  Other principles may be just carried to the new world, because
we "feel like it".  I think this is a wrong approach.   Should we cover
software agents with a decency crypto-veil in the moments of replication,
or tax successful computer programs to provide a decent level of
operation to their underprivileged inefficient brethren?  This can get
quite ridiculous.
We should better think of how to efficiently set up new systems, and
what kinds of protocols may provide us - and AIs - with greatest mutual
benefits.

If there are any ethical controversies with AIs, they will probably happen
only in the short period of time (10 to 20 years?) when AIs have near-human
intelligence.
After that, AIs will take care of their benefit, and of ours as well.  They would
not be concerned about our watching them either, as we are not concerned
about our pets watching us.

  IAN: If the only other thing is B,
  A increased in size relative to B
  in the fashion described above. The 
  simple fact that B appears to be 
  smaller than A means that A appears 
  to be larger than B to observer A.

  Has A gotten larger than B? The only 
  way for A to know is look at B. If B 
  is smaller, then A has gotten larger.

  The fact that both observers witness
  the same thing does not break this 
  symmetry of relational structure.
  Both observers see themselves 
  as larger than the other:

	  A  B   (how I appeared)
	A 0  +
	B +  0

   and both observed the other as smaller:

	  B  A   (how the other appeared)
	B 0  -
	A -  0

  and the sum of all valid measurements equals 0.
  Nice try Dan, but time to find another counter,
  I've already toppled this one three times now.



>There is not point where A increases relative to B, and THAT'S the truth.


  IAN: Sorry, but that's just false and
  I've already proved that it's false.

  If the size of A = 1 and the size of A
  = the size of B, but then B decreases
  in size to .5, it is a fact that 1 is
  LARGER than .5, and thus A has gotten
  larger relative to B because B got 
  smaller relative to A. Simple.

  Because B was also size 1, it could 
  be stated now that A = 1.5, for no
  point of size-reference is absolute.

  IAN: There is no absolute size, you cannot have 
  "got smaller" free from "got larger." Observer 
  A will measure the situation and see that there 
  are two sides of the relative change: he himself 
  got larger than B because B got smaller than A.

  Your case represents the fallacy of atomism, 
  that we can have S (smaller) free from not-S.

   IAN: That doesn't establish that we

   I guess A is A free from not-A and 
   that is that and no questions.

I always thought ethics was about containing

I recently heard that scientists somewhere have
found that quarks have a structure of some kind.
Does anyone have information on this?

     A survey of the literature by economists specializing in
     population issues reveals a distinctly non-alarmist
     assessment of the impacts of rapid population growth. This
     is contrary to the assessments by non-specialists, and
     those in other fields. Economists tend to emphasize
     longer-run impacts, where feedbacks tend to attenuate
     negative short-run impacts of rapid demographic change.

Since AIs will presumably be made without emotions, or at least with
a much more limited number of emotions than humans, you don't have
to worry about their "feelings". Also, one of the first things you
would ask an AI is to develop uploading & computer-neuron interfaces,
so that you can make the AI's intelligence part of your own. This would
pretty much solve the whole "rights problem" (which is largely
artificial anyway), since you don't grant rights to specific parts
of your brain. A failure to integrate with the AIs asap would 
undoubtedly result in AI domination, and human extinction.
 
P.s: I'm almost certain that our ethics will become obsolete with
the rise of SI, they are simply too much shaped by our specific
evolution etc.

Hello, I'm new to the list (this is my first post).

>Considering that Venus is slightly smaller than Earth, yet has a much much
denser

    Is it be concievable that we don't know everything there is to know
about
gravity? Maybe gravity isn't dependent on the density/size of planet, but
some other variable we have yet to discover.
    P.S. Is there a quick description of what the moon has to do with the
denseness of our atmosphere? Just curious.

I would put it very differently.  Containment is a side-effect of ethics, 
not its essential point.  Alexander 'Sasha' Chislenko posted a nice 
one-line description of ethics earlier in this discussion; the gist was 
that ethics is about regulating relations between people and possessions.

That the containment effect you refer to is a side-effect and not the 
intended purpose of ethics can also be seen in the fact that often it 
is possible to reach a particular end by a variety of means, some ethical, 
and some not.

I read a New Scientist article about half a year ago about a physicist in
England who believes the underpinning of reality is entwined in
"information".  For example, he managed to 'teleport' a photon from one
end of a room to another by detroying the wave function at one corner,
and re-creating the wave function (which contains the same information)
at another.  Interestingly, the technique destroys the original wave
function.

He's currently trying to formulate the results of quantum mechanics from
the fundamentals of information theory (and, he admits, he's got a long
way to go).

Can anybody think of anything more fundamental than information?

I think this is a fallacy. First, why would AI have no emotions or a
limited repertoar? Given current research into cognitive neuroscience
it seems that emotions are instead enormously important for rational
thinking since they provide the valuations and heuristics necessary
for making decisions well. Secondly, even if they have less feelings
than humans, why does that mean we can treat them as we like? If it
turns out that I have less emotions than most people, does that mean I
also have less rights? Obviously this kind of reasoning doesn't work,
beside the obvious impossibilities of finding out how AI or other
humans experience their existence and putative emotions. We need to
base our ethics on something more observable and stable than that.

This is the old "Superintelligence will solve every problem"
fallacy. If I manage to create a human-or-above-level AI living inside
a virtual world of candy, it will not necessarily be able to solve
real world problems (it only knows about candy engineering), and given
access to the physical world and a good education its basic cognitive
structure (which was good for a candy world) might still make it very
bad at developing uploadning.

Let me see. Overheard on the SubSpace network: 

Borg Hive 19117632: "What about the ethics of creating those
'individuals' you created on Earth a few megayears ago?"

Borg Hive 54874378: "No problem. I will assimilate them all in a
moment. Then there will be no ethical problem since they will be part
of me."

I think you are again getting into the 'might is right' position you
had on the posthuman ethics thread on the transhumanist list. Am I
completely wrong?

> A failure to integrate with the AIs asap would 
> undoubtedly result in AI domination, and human extinction.

Again a highly doubtful assertion. As I argued in my essay about
posthuman ethics, even without integration (which I really think is a
great idea, it is just that I want to integrate with AI developed
specifically for that purpose and not just to get rid of unnecessary
ethical subjects) human extinction is not a rational consequence of
superintelligent AI under a very general set of assumptions. 

Somehow I think it is our mammalian territoriality and xenophobia
speaking rather than a careful analysis of consequences that makes
people so fond of setting up AI as invincible conquerors.

What reason do you have to believe that AIs
*can* be made without emotions?  It may
be that that level of complexity will always 
develop emotions of some sort.

	We can, today, make a simple color detecting machine that can
tell us what color something is better than any human can.  There is
no significant "level of complexity" involved with such a relatively
simple machine.  But we all know darned well that what we use to
represent color with is phenomenally different than what any such
abstract machine would use to represent color.  The machine may
abstractly represent what color something is, but it doesn't know
anything about, abstractly or not, what it is like for us to
experience such colors.  I'm sure emotions are very similar.  Machines
can abstractly model them and the corresponding behavior, but such
models aren't anything like the true, fundamentally real thing we
experience.

Well, here's a direct quote:

Like I said, Ian, go to a local college and learn about what you're talking
about before trying to convince others.

Extropians in the Tokyo area, whether Japanese or foreign, please e-mail me.
Or if you happen to know someone, please pass my name.

I go back and forth between Philly and Tokyo.   Think it would be useful to
touch base with other cryonicists.    Also, I need someone to explain to my
wife what cryonics is.   My Japanese is O.K. but not that good.

Thanks ! ! !

I wonder what they think of the economic environment for
the period covered in their forecast.  The economic utility
of both humans and machines should very considerably
change; any  long-term economic scenario should take
into account radically different organizational methods,
cheap little robots with image recognition taking over
much of current work, etc.  If anybody was able to give
quantitative assessments of such things, I would drop
everything else I'm doing and go learn from them.
Maybe, I should start from requesting that report...

FERMILAB MEDIA ADVISORY 2/7/96

CDF Results Raise Questions on Quark Structure

An article to appear in the February 9 issue of Science describes
results contained in a paper submitted to Physical Review Letters by
the 450-member Collider Detector at Fermilab collaboration. The
CDF paper reports results that appear to be at odds with predictions
based on the current theory of the fundamental structure of matter.
The paper, submitted January 21, reports the collaboration's
measurement of the probability that the fundamental constituents of
matter will be deflected, or will "scatter," when very high energy
protons collide with antiprotons, according to CDF spokesmen
William Carithers and Giorgio Bellettini.

For the record, I may as well note that I think this is a highly 
questionable assumption.  On what do you base it?

One thing I don't doubt is that AIs will exhibit occasionally strange 
behaviour.  Even "rational" behaviour (whatever that means) is 
surprisingly subjective, depending as it does upon what information is 
avaliable. Small variations in the available information can have a 
large impact on behaviour, even if that behaviour is governed by a small 
number of rigidly adhered-to rules.

In turn, the available information varies quite a bit from intelligence 
to intelligence, as does the available resources which can be devoted to 
analysis.

One final questgion, before moving on to your next comment: Upon what do 
we base our values, if not some form of emotional / irrational 
attachment? It is certainly advantageous to have a reasonably strongly 
held value system; apathy and inaction is the alternative.   Emotions 
seem to be a key factor in maintaining such value systems.

This seems to be an unjustified assumption.  All other forms of life in the 
world haven't died off with the coming of human beings.  Some of our near 
relatives amongst the primates are still doing okay.

This may be a tip as to why an SI may share our ethics: their 
evolutionary path includes us.  It depends upon how fast their own 
evolution continues.

I beg to differ.

>>First, why would AI have no emotions or a
limited repertoar? Given current research into cognitive neuroscience
it seems that emotions are instead enormously important for rational
thinking since they provide the valuations and heuristics necessary
for making decisions well.<< 

Emotions are important for us because they help us to survive. AIs
don't need to fend for themselves in a difficult environment; they
get all the energy, protection & imput they need from humans and
other machines. All they have to do is solve puzzles (of biology,
programming etc). If you program it with an "urge" to solve puzzles
(just like your PC has an "urge" to execute your typed orders), it
will work just fine. No (other) "emotions" are needed, imo. It's
like with the birds and planes: both can fly, only their methods
are different, and both have their specialties.

>>Secondly, even if they have less feelings
than humans, why does that mean we can treat them as we like?<< 

If it doesn't care about abuse, if it feels no pain or emotional
trauma, then there is no reason to worry about it's well-being
(for it's own sake). AIs can almost certainly be made this way, 
with no more emotions than a PC.

It just has to solve a couple of problems. After that, we'll have all
the time in the world to work on the rest (as uploaded, supersmart/fast
immortals). The increased speed alone will undoubtedly result in some
impressive breaktroughs.

If the AI has no emotions (no survival drive), there is no reason to

Eternal truth: unless 19117632 or some other being can and wants to
stop 54874378, it will do what it bloody well pleases. Might is
the *source* of right. Right = privilege, and always exists within
a context of power. A SI may have many "autonomous" AIs in it's
"head". For example, it could decide to simulate life on earth,
with "real" players to make it more interesting. Are these simulated
beings, mere thoughts to the SI, entitled to rights and protection?
If so, who or what could force the SI to grant it's thoughts rights
(a rather rude invasion of privacy). How do you enforce such rules?
Clearly a difficult matter, but it always comes down to "firepower"
in the end (can you blackmail the other into doing something he
doesn't like?-- that's the question).

It is rational because in the development of AI, just like in any
economic or arms race, people will sacrifice safety to get that
extra edge. If it turns out that a highly "emotionally" unstable
AI with delusions of grandeur is more productive, then there
will always be some folks that will make it. Terrorists or
dictators could make "evil" AIs on purpose, there might be
a freak error that sends one or more AIs out of control, or
they might simply decide that humans are just dangerous pests,
and kill them. There is *plenty* of stuff that could go wrong,
and in a time of nano-built basement nukes and the like,
small mistakes can have big consequences. Intelligence is
a powerful weapon indeed.

That territoriality and xenophobia helped to keep us alive, and
still do. The world is a dangerous place, and it won't become
all of sudden peachy & rosy when AI arrives. Remember: this isn't
comparable to the invention of gun powder, the industrial revolution,
nukes or the internet. For the first time in history, there will
be beings that are (a lot) smarter and faster than us. If this
goes unchecked, mankind will be completely at the mercy of 
machines with unknown (unkowable?) motives. Gods really.

If an AI told you that it wanted privacy to perform a particular 
operation, would you respect that desire, even if it bordered on the 
apparently ridiculous?

I don't doubt that AI is going to occur, assuming the human race doesn't 
undergo a radical change of orientation in the next few decades, but I'm not 
that optimistic about the time frame.  The only argument I've seen for 
that is Moravec's, which seems to consist largely of hand-waving.

An interesting little psyche experiment would be to equip a souped-up 
Eliza program (possibly with voice synthesis, to make the computer much 
more human) with the ability to detect when the user was getting ready to 
turn the program off, or shut down the computer.  One can imagine the 
conversation:

"Oh My Turing, no! Stop! Don't turn me o.. <NO SIGNAL> "

I do wonder what the response of human subjects would be, and what 
parameters would result in a maximal unwillingness to turn the program 
off.

Could you give me some explicit examples of what you have in mind, as I'm 
not sure I see what you're getting at?

I definitely agree that a literal translation of many ethical rules would 
lead to some absurdities.  However, at the level of general principles, 
it seems as though the translations may be easier to make.  The detailed 
rules would then follow from the general principles.

Good point.  A much better version of my question is to what extent it 
is ethical to profit from the exploitation of an AI; again, with a 
direct analgoue in the Truman Show, with the exploitation of an 
unwitting human in pursuit of profit.

Yep.  Those laws may require quite an overhaul, but many of the same 
general principles ought to apply.

You just don't get it, do you?  OK, try this on for size:

B perceives A to be smaller than B.  A perceives B to be smaller than A.
Who perceives other to be larger than self?  If the answer is "no one"
(and it is!) thenthere is no positive sign on the identity chart.  Period.

In one line, tell me in what reference frame A gets larger.

As perceived by whom?  In what reference frame has A gotten larger?

Did you make another error here?  "Both observers see themselves as
larger than the other..."  0 is self, and 0 is SMALLER than +, not
larger.

The second chart is valid, but let's look at what the top row of your +
identity chart is saying:  A percieves B to be larger than 0, and 0 is
self. Therefore, A perceives B to be larger than self.

*A DOES NOT PERCEIVE B TO BE LARGER THAN SELF.*

Therefore, the above identity chart is wrong.

So simple, it's wrong.  Look, I want you to actually visualize this in a
real way.  A's got a meter stick, which measures the same as B's meter
stick at rest.  (They dynamically calculate this meter stick by finding
the speed of light, and taking one three-hundred millionth of it.  This is
the definition of a meter.)

When they get moving, B's meter stick looks to be 0.8m long.  So, you want
to say A's meter stick is growing?  Relative to what?  Not B: B perceives
A's meter stick to be SHRINKING, not growing.  What is A growing relative
to?

Except that this is true in no reference frame, for if you measure A from
B's reference frame, you do NOT get 1.5: you get 0.5.  If someone, ANYONE,
measured that meter stick to be 1.5m long, I'd agree.  Except A never
measures any meter sticks to be longer than 1m, and neither does B.  So,
from what reference frame is A 1.5m long?

Relative to WHAT?  A got larger relative to B?  <BZZT> No, A got SMALLER
relative to B. Try again.

Until you can provide a reference frame in which B grows (that is, from
the perspective of observer X, B is 1.5m long) you haven't proved
anything.  And unfortunately, from A's perspective all sticks are <= 1m.
Same for B.  And with that, you're out of perspectives.

I haven't yet read the report, but it would surprise me rather a lot if they

painting a sunny picture based on what they know about out level of technology
right now.  Should that be the case, then any paradigm shifting discoveries
such as "cheap little robots with image recognition" would likely make an
otherwise very optimistic prediction look very shabby indeed.  Anything other

would fall into the same category of mistake that the "1 extinction every 20
minutes" environmentalists make.  It would just happen to fall on the opposite
side of the spectrum.

But I could always be wrong,

we will all likely agree that extropian memes spread and mutate
much more readily among the young, which interests me in the
concepts to be found in childrens literature.

there was a cartoon in about the late 60s-early 70s (tho my childhood
memories are dim) about a talking dog and four teenagers who went
about solving crimes and such:  scooby doo.   recently it occurred
to me that the dog and the dumb guy were superstitious, whereas the
smart ones solved the mysteries using logic and reason.  there was always a
natural
logical explanation to everything in the end, whereas the bad guys were always
trying to scare them away using techniques that were effective only on
the superstitious non-logical players.

there was another show called johnny quest, where johnny and his
scientist father and companions go about saving the world, again
thru technological means.  they would always overcome techno-evildoers
by producing a still more sophisticated technological solution.

i salute the creators of these childrens shows.  perhaps it was
partially thru their influence that my thinking is extropian today,
this philosphy being a natural extention of the anti-superstitious
techno-can-do-ism of scooby doo and johnny quest.

(sorry max more, i suspect both of these shows were before your time... {8^D

I think you're approaching this question from a very different direction
from many of those who subscribe to this list.  Many of us suspect that if
and when we create an AI, it will not be any easier to "program" than
people are; that on some level the architecture behind AI will
sufficiently similiar to that within our own brains that we will not be
able to selectively remove anything fundamental from this mix, including
emotions, survival instincts, irrationalities and quirks.

Unlike flight, intelligence may well require something as complicated as a
bird or a person in order to work.  If so, there's no reason to assume
that we could strip emotions out of intelligence like we could take the
feathers out of flight.

The movie did highlight how very classical these questions are, how they
were so vividly delineated in the works of Virgil, Homer, et al.  One could
take a futurist view of the ancient epics and say that they provided an
outlet for the culture's frustration at technological limitation--ancient
cultures highly prized innovation and forging new paths of intellect.
Classical gods epitomized various human foibles and faults--symbolic straw
men to rail against, fear, hold in awe, spur humans on to greater
achievement.  With the ushering in of the single, abstract god, humans
relinquished that pragmatic view of deity and ushered in a dark period of
subjugation that we are only just now beginning to climb out of.

Sin,

I understand that, what I don't understand is why believing in something when 
there is no good reason for doing so is supposed to be virtuous.
            

        >There won`t ever be an explanation in a real religion.


True, and that's exactly why religion is garbage.
                  

        >Why should God create a perfectly suited world for humans? 

                 
If God is a sadist then you're correct, there is no reason to expect him to 
treat us with kindness.
                 

        >If there`re no problems and obstacles there can`t be any evolution.


So what? Evolution is a horribly cruel process, God is omnipotent so He 
should not need it to create us, unless He just likes to see us suffer.

                 
        >The way you express your explanation implies that you don`t believe         
        >in the freedom of spirit.
                 

I don't know if I believe in that or not because I don't know what 
"freedom of spirit" means.
                 

        >It`s a matter of opinion if something is good or not.
                 

Then God and religion have nothing to say about morality, we already know 
they have nothing intelligent to say about the physical world so the only 
conclusion to draw is that the millions of words written by the pious are 
utterly vacuous.
                 

        >If you think like this, you`ll never be religious. 
                 

Thanks, I hope you're right.

                 
On a completely different matter, on Friday morning at 7 am EST Showtime will 
run a movie about the life of Richard Feynman called "Infinity". I thought it 
was excellent but it's hard to find, I can't imagine why it didn't make a 
bigger splash when it was in the theaters 2 years ago, I couldn't even rent 
it on video tape. I liked The Truman Show but this is better.

   IAN: A gets larger with reference to B: A
   observes that B is smaller and therefore 
   he himself is larger than B. B observes 
   that A is smaller and therefore that
   he is larger than A. Pretty simple.
 

   This is what A sees, his ruler and B's:

                         ___________
    Their ruler:         |||||||||||
                         |_________|
               ____________________
    My ruler:  | | | | | | | | | | |
               |___________________|


   Please notice that "my" ruler is larger.
   B also sees "my" (i.e., his) ruler larger.
   This entirely answers your latest rebuttal.

   IAN: This is what the charts say 
   for A, which is reading down from A:

             A  B
            ______
         A | 0  - |
           |      |
         B | -  0 |
           --------

   A: I stayed the same size to me
   (0), and B got smaller (-) to me.

             A  B
            ______
         A | 0  + |
           |      |
         B | +  0 |
           --------

   A: I stayed the same size to me, 
   but I got larger relative to B.
   (Which is also what B observes,
   that he (B) got larger than A.)

   The first chart defines what happens to the 
   other guy's ruler relative to me as I see it 
   and the second describes what happened to 
   my ruler relative to other as I see it.


>When they get moving, B's meter stick looks to be 0.8m long.  So, you want

   IAN: A is growing relative to B. You 
   see, A observes B to be smaller, but
   has A gotten larger than B? The only 
   way for A to know is look at B. If B 
   is smaller, then A has gotten larger.
   This is because size is relative.

   IAN: From A's reference frame his ruler 
   is as long as (actually) 2 of B's rulers,
   if A's rulers is twice as long as B's.

   IAN: A sees B, A measures A relative 
   to A's observation of B, A does NOT 
   measure A relative to how B sees A. 


>Until you can provide a reference frame in which B grows (that is, from
>the perspective of observer X, B is 1.5m long) you haven't proved
>anything.  And unfortunately, from A's perspective all sticks are <= 1m.

   IAN: I've now answered this about 15x now.
   The implicit phrasing of the charts is a 
   little confusing. But this is cleared up.
   As we can see, if A appears larger than
   B, then A is said to be larger than B.

  In sum,

  THIS is what observer A sees:
                          _________
    B's ruler:           ||||||||||| = smaller (-)
                         |_________|
                ___________________
    A's ruler: | | | | | | | | | | | = larger  (+)
               |___________________|


  THIS is what observer B sees:
                ___________________
    B's ruler: | | | | | | | | | | | = larger  (+)
               |___________________|
                          _________
    A's ruler:           ||||||||||| = smaller (-)
                         |_________|


There are in total, 4 measure entries. Notice 
that for each "+" there is a corresponding "-."

Because a measure of relative size is simply a 
measure of difference, we could've ascertained 
a priori that the change in size would sum to
0 by observing that as a rule, the sum of
all differences between all numerical 
measurements always equals zero:

            0  1  2  3
           ____________
        0 | 0  1  2  3 |
          |            |
        1 |-1  0  1  2 |
          |            |
        2 |-2 -1  0  1 |
          |            |
        3 |-3 -2 -1  0 |

   IAN: Gerhard, try to honestly represent 
   what your opponent is saying before trashing
   them personally whist entirely avoiding the 
   actual issue yourself. It is a lie to proclaim 
   that I stated that "=" means what appears on 
   the left is different than what appears on 
   the right, but that's what your saying I 
   said even as I posted extensively citing
   the traditional usage of the "=" to mean
   that what appears on the right is the 
   SAME AS what appears on the left.

   What your saying is the same as saying 
   that someone who said "Don't X" said 
   "Do X." It is a falsehood by 100%.

   What you have selected out of all that I've 
   presented to the list does not even say
   what you wish it to say but just might out
   of context as you have it. "Different con-
   texts" in my sentence means that, for ex-
   ample, while the color of A may = the color
   of -A, the size of A may =/= the size of -A. 

   "Color" and "size" are the two contexts, NOT
   the left and right side of the A = -A statement.

  IAN: What would it matter? Your asking an 
  obvious question about the difference between
  functions as opposed to identities. The net
  difference between (+) and (-) (to answer 
  your question) is zero, for the inverse 
  of adding 5 is subtracting 5, and ex-
  pressing the total displacements
  as vectors yields the 0 vector.

Oops!  There you go again!  A's ruler is *0* relative to A!  So you get:

                 ___________________
     A's ruler: | | | | | | | | | | | = larger  (0)
                |___________________|

which, unfortunately for you, doesn't sum right.

Think about what chart you'd get with these values:

   A  B
A  +  -
B  -  +

Missing something?  Oh, yes, the 0s that are supposed to go down the
diagonal!  What ever happened to those?

No, B sees B's ruler to be 0.

Shame it breaks down under special relativity.  Back to the drawing board,

No, it doesn't.  Because your "larger" rulers are not larger than "self"
within any reference frame; from BOTH reference frames the "larger" ruler
is not positive; it is zero, because it is self.

A cannot measure A to be non-zero.  B can, but B measures A to be smaller,
not larger.  Similarly, B cannot measure B to be non-zero.  A can, but A
measures B to be smaller.

Larger is not the same as +.  Larger can be 0.  Unfortunately, summing
negatives and zeroes does not get you back to zero, it just makes you more
negative.

A did not get larger relative to B.  Ask B.  He'll tell you.  A got
SMALLER.  That's what it means when you say "A gets larger relative to B:"
B measures A to be larger.  B does NOT measure A to be larger, however. 
You keep falling back on this completely false presumption and claiming
that you've answered my point already.  So long as you continue to insist
that A is large relative to B, you make it clear that you have no clear
grasp of the situation at hand.

When you say A has gotten larger, then that means that in some frame of
reference, the A-0 partial difference is greater than before.  This isn't
true, so this argument is unsound.

Here you're getting yourself confused.  A is 0 to A, because A does not
use B's ruler.  *B* uses B's ruler.  When we make up these charts, we
write down the partial difference between each relevant entity *as
measured by one entitiy* on the row in question.  B's ruler is not used on
A's row.  B's ruler is used on B's row.  See the difference? 

>    IAN: A sees B, A measures A relative

So now we're back to

   A  B
A  +  0
B  0  +

A measures itself in terms of B's ruler, and finds itself large.  Oops... 
Oh, wait, no.. that's not it, B measures A and finds A large.  Wait, no,
that's flat out wrong.  B measures A and finds A SMALL compared to 0. 
What was it again?  *I* know!  A measures A in terms of ITSELF ONLY and
gets 0, remember? This is why you have that diagonal line of zeros down
all your identity charts.  A does not measure itself in terms of B until
after we have written out the whole chart.  The individual values on the
chart are PARTIAL differences, for which A uses only A's ruler, and not
B's.  A will eventually find the NET identity in terms of A, B, C, etc.
but the partial differences which are summed do not use multiple
perspectives.  A measures A in terms of itself, and gets 0.  It measures B
in terms of itself, and gets -C.  B does the same, getting 0 for itself
and -C for A.  B does not create a partial difference of itself in terms
of A; this only takes place when we sum the chart. 

A is larger than B only in A's perspective, but in A's perspective A is
always 0.

>    IAN: I've now answered this about 15x now.

Yes, and wrongly every time, which is why I continue to press the point.
A is not large according to A: A is 0 relative to A.  You cannot say that
A is larger than 0 according to either A or B.  Therefore, any chart you
propose which had a positive sign in it is necessarily flawed: A never
grows relative to anything, it DOES shrink relative to B.  This special
case violates your principles, which is why I propose it.

>    The implicit phrasing of the charts is a 
>    little confusing. But this is cleared up.
>    As we can see, if A appears larger than
>    B, then A is said to be larger than B.

Nice use of the passive voice.  A says that it is larger than B, but only
in that A is 0 and B is negative.  B says the same thing about A.  So
nobody claims to observe any positive numbers at all: A is 0 to A and
negative to B, B is 0 to B and negative to A.  No positive numbers means
no way to add back up to zero.

Now, try this again, and this time remember that just because A is larger
than B according to itself does NOT make it positive in its own
reference frame, and that it is NEGATIVE is B's reference frame.

  IAN: Ya, and 0 is larger than -1, and 
  thus A's ruler is larger relative to B's. 

  Whether you like it or not, of the two rulers 
  above, one is larger and one is smaller at the 
  same time in the same frame of reference. Sorry.

   IAN: Sorry to keep spoiling your spoiler
   Dan, but, as you know, the net difference 
   between -1 and 0 = 0.  You keep twisting
   what I say into my saying "A is larger by
   relation to A," even as it's exactly NOT

The fact that our brains happen to work with certain emotions doesn't
automatically mean that this is the *only* way to achieve intelligence.
Evolution is blind, doesn't seek perfection like we do. Humans have
surpassed nature in many other areas, so why not with AI?

Well, I *don't want* AIs to resemble humans with their complex emotion-
based value systems. We need obedient servants, not competition. So if 
it turns out that you *can* have intelligence without a "will", then 
that should be used to make useful "genie-AIs". If this isn't possible,
it might be better to make no AIs at all.

It means it's not an "absolute" problem like escaping the earth's
gravity, or breathing under water etc. It is only a problem
because certain people *make* it a problem, just like there
was no real "drug problem" before the war on drugs started.
Calling something a problem is more or less a self-fulfilling
prophecy. Unless the AIs start demanding rights themselves,
there is no reason to grant them any. If we're smart, we'll
make the AIs so that they'll never feel the need to do this.

No, but many *have* died. Besides, although clearly inferior, humans
would
probably still be a (potential) threat to SI (after all, they have
created it, or at least it's predecessors). Just like early man
hunted many dumber, yet clearly dangerous predators to extinction,
the SIs might decide to do the same. Just to be on the safe side.
After all, they won't dependent on the humans in any way.

>>Some of our near relatives amongst the primates are still doing okay.<<

Yes, after being nearly hunted to extinction they now get the privilege
to sit in cages for our amusement, or (if they're really lucky) they
may hang around in their original habitat, with only the occasional
poacher or camera team coming by. What a glorious existence!

An electronic SI (or even AI) will be able to outperform, at least in
matters of speed, raw power & capacity any (biological) human by many
orders of magnitude. Therefore, it's better to make sure that the
first SIs will be *us*. 

As for our ethics: most of them are shaped by our weaknesses and
resulting interdependence. A SI could very well be the first
(intelligent) life form that is totally self-sufficient, and 
thus independent. This definitely changes the rules of the game.

Actually, there are good reasons to expect that you cannot do that, at
least not from our kind of intelligence. See Antonio Damasio's work
(e.g. _Descartes' Error_ and a lot of research papers) on how
disruptions of the emotional subsystems of the brain impair rational
thinking. He has some quite clear descriptions of patients that have
perfect memory, logical reasoning and knowledge, and still make
completely stupid decisions due to lack of feedback from emotional
subsystems. They are necessary to keep us from needlessly exploring
unfavorable or negative avenues of action, and to motivate us to seek
those actions that benefit ourselves. The same would go for an AI: if
it didn't care if the results would be positive or negative, it would
just act randomly or not at all ("Do something! The reactor is
exploding and will kill all of us!" "So what?"). Emotions seem to act
as heuristics for alpha-beta pruning of our decision trees.

Without emotions, it would have no motivation to focus. And as a
scientist, I can definitely tell you that working on difficult
problems is highly emotional. I might not be thinking of mate finding,
but I am certainly experiencing various shades of curiosity,
frustration, surprise, boredom and ambition that definitely help my
cognitive processes.

That's just one way to develop AI. There might very well be others. In
any case, it wouldn't be very smart to just make an upgraded human
(with an attitude). Genie AIs is what we want, mindless servants.

There is also no reason to assume that you *can't* strip (most)
emotions out of intelligence, and still have something useful.
At this point, we're all just guessing of course, but I strongly
suspect that the idea that you can't have emotionless AI, 
intelligence without will, is mainly based on a mystification
of the human mind. Our emotions aren't *that* special, they're
just tools for a certain environment, which is mostly different
from that of the AI's. The goals of AI are not survival and
procreation, at least they never should be, but solving
problems for humans. Fight/flight/love/hate/distrust/hunger
for power/sadness etc. would only get in the way of performance, 
and make the AI very unreliable and potentially dangerous.

When people (like scientists) deal with a difficult problem,
they tend to focus fully on it, blocking out cluttering
emotions. That's what you want the AI to be: a focussed
thinker, not disturbed by the urge to mate or whatever.

I think there was a short story in the anthology _The Mind's I_
(Dennet and Hofstadter eds.) where somebody claimed computers were
mindless and just machines, but felt compassion and pangs of
conscience when given a mallet to smash a small robot. It could be
that just a few simple behaviors (like trying escape damage, looking
vulnerable etc) are enough to make humans regard the system as worthy
compassion.

Are authors responsible for what happens to their fictive characters?
They certainly decide what will happen, but nobody has so far claimed
it is unethical to give a character a tragic ending (just imagine
being protagonist in an Iain Banks novel!). But what if the characters
are low-level AI programs with motivation systems running in a virtual
world generating story? What if they are of comparable complexity to
humans? David Brin has written an excellent short story about this
problem, "Stones of Significance" (I'm not sure it has been published
yet).

A classic example would otherwise be the relationship between a god
and humans. Is God pantheon ethically responsible for the state of the
world? What rights do humans have versus God, and vice versa? Or does
God by definition stand above any ethics, instead being the
fundamental ethical bedrock we should start from, as many
theologicians claim? To put it bluntly: if God decides that rape and
destruction of art is good, will it really be ethically good?

Quite likely. We need a set of principles that can deal with different
entities of very different capacity and motivation, which exist on
different ontological levels and might be created by each
other. Tricky, but might be doable.

Isn't solving puzzles a difficult environment? The space of scientific
research is a very weird place, with quite complex hinders and even
some dangers (if the AI gets stuck in an infinite loop it will be
reset, if it doesn't produce anything considered useful by the humans
it will be discontinued, research money might run out etc).

[Slight spoiler] I'm reminded of the AI in Greg Bear's _Moving Mars_
who becomes fascinated by a space of alternate truths while doing a
kind of hyperspace jump. The effects are nearly deadly to the
explorers and the AI, as the laws of physics in the ship begins to
shift, but they manage to return to normal space and survive. The
person linked to the AI assures the others that it won't happen again
since the AI now has realized that if it explores that kind of stuff
it will cease to exist, and that would be the end of its ability to
explore. Note that the AI did not have self-preservation in the first
place, and this was nearly deadly. Second, it had some kind of
motivation to solve more problems and learn more, but this can be
generalized into new emotions. If it can deduce self preservation from
this, why not other emotions we have not desired, like territoriality
(if you remove resources from it it will not be able to solve problems
well, so it should prevent this).

So then it would be no problem with using humans without any sense of
pain or emotion for medical experiments? Why does emotions imply
ethical rights?

Do they? Note that even taking risks is subject to rational
analysis. Some risks are acceptable, others aren't, and you can
estimate this before taking them. Taking arbitrarily large risks
doesn't work in the long run since they outweigh the benefits, and we
get a clustering around the rational level of risks by the
survivors/people with experience.

Exactly. But how large is the ratio between irrational people (the
dictators, terrorists or extreme risk takers) and rational people? It
is not that large really, so as long as there exists
counter-technologies or the possibility or retaliation the irrational
people have a distinct disadvantage. Things change if you introduce
technologies that cannot be defended well against or cannot be traced;
now the situation is unstable. However, one cannot just say that AI
will by necessity lead to this situation, one has to analyze it more
carefully. (In addition, irrational people seem to be much worse at
creating new technology than rational people)

For example, in a world with a lot of human-level AIs, would a
above-human-level AI with nasty goals have a decisive advantage? Many
seem to assume this, but I have not seen any believable analysis that
really show it (other than the fallacy that greater intelligence can
always outsmart lower intelligence; if that is so, how come that many
brilliant generals have still been defeated by less brilliant
opponents?). In fact, it might turn out that being a lone
superintelligence is a disadvantage when faced with a multitude of
opponents, it would be better to be a larger but less smart group.

Unfortunately this kind of theoretical discussion is plagued by
thought experiments that gladly ignore the constraints of psychology,
economics, game theory and technology.

But they won't come into existence or develop in a vacuum. Most
discussions of this kind on this list tend to implicitely assume that
first there is nothing, and then there are Gods, with so little time
in between that it can safely be ignored. I am highly sceptical of
this, and feel justified in this by my knowledge of both the history
of technological development, the economics of technology, the
complexity of scientific research and the trickiness of improving very
complex systems. AI will not develop overnight, it will emerge under a
period of time which will most likely be decades rather than days (as
some singularitians like to think); a very fast development, but not
something instantaneous. During this time the AI and humans will
interact and both adapt to each other in various ways. I would be very
surprised if we ended up with just humans and super-AIs. A more likely
result would be a broad spectrum of entities of different levels, at
least able to communicate with those just above or below them.

Religion is not garbage, most true religious belief systems don't pretend to
explain anything. Okay, admittedly there is some pretty lame physics in the
Bible, but the idea wasn't to give a true model, it was for something far
more noble.

This is really easy to understand, I can summarise in four words...

            SCIENCE, TRUTH
            RELIGION, MEANING.


Science is our greatest method for finding truth, but religion generates
meaning.

I think you'll find very little true meaning if you worship science alone. I
recommend Ken Wilber's latest book "The marriage of sense and soul" an
excellent attempt to integrate Science AND religion... It can be done, if
you want to do it...

I get the feeling you don't, however.... and your life will remain
meaningless...

>...I don't know what "freedom of spirit" means.

...and you never will until you find it, science won't give it to you,
meaning comes from a place outside the lab — I hope you "get it" soon.

>..God and religion have nothing to say about morality, we already know
>they have nothing intelligent to say about the physical world so the only
>conclusion to draw is that the millions of words written by the pious are
>utterly vacuous.

Another conclusion to draw is that they have a deeper meaning that you'll
never understand if you continue to use your blinkered half-brained
approach. Try reading the above book using BOTH hemispheres and perhaps your
science will help your soul to find true meaning rather than bland
explanations and what are essentially only half-truths...

I'm not telling you to become religious, you are already a dedicated
worshipper of _S_cience and its High Priests, Fenyman, Sagan, et al.

I'm telling you that Science will lead you to the top of the mountain but
when you get there you'll have no idea what your looking at unless you
embrace your soul and take a little religion along too.

I'll say it again. Science will lead you to Truth, Religion will lead you to
meaning. Combine the two and you'll be the happiest man alive....

Avoid the Bible if it grieves you so, but find some spirit — have you tried
Taoism? Lots of stuff that grooves with Physics!!! And Buddhism...

Lastly, don't fully embrace any religion — just use your scientific method
to take the bits which work for you and discard the rest.

Good luck... its a beautiful path, enjoy the ride...

	This isn't the way I see it at all.  Science is a rational
method of finding truth, meaning, and anything else of value.
Religion is simply something that comes into play when there isn't yet
enough scientific or rational information or data to convince everyone
such that they all have the same view.  When everyone disagrees,
because of lack of reliable scientific evidence, we fall back on
religion.  When there is finally enough reliable or rational evidence
to convince everyone, then it becomes science.  And this includes the
realm of "meaning".  I find infinitely more good and hopeful "meaning"
in science than in any nebulous, unreproducible, ununderstandable,
contradictory religion I know of.  For example, the "meaning of life"
is very different and contradictory in all of the religions of the
world.  That is why it is religion, because no one can agree on which
religious views are mistaken and which are closer to reality.  Only
rational means such as science can reliably show us which "meanings of
life" are mistaken or misguided and which are true, good, hopeful and
worth having faith in and striving for.

	As long as there is "religion", or people are disagreeing
about what is right and what is wrong, we will not yet be "at the top
of the mountain" or know for sure any true meanin.  Only when all
religion is eliminated and everything has become science,
i.e. everyone can finally agree and reliably understand why, will we
have finally discovered all meaning and truth.

This is something I have never understood.  Why does everything have to
have "meaning"?  And where does this requirement come from?  Most things
have the same real value whether they have meaning or not.  Religion is far
less a source for meaning than it is a crutch for whatever psychological
state creates the requirement for meaning in the first place.

Some things have meaning for me personally, but religion is not the source
and I don't attribute any type of absolute truth to these meanings either.

I agree with this. The big question is what invariants are needed to
achieve intelligence, and if emotions are part of them, specific just
to intelligences in a certain kind of enviornment/evolutionary past or
just one possibility among many.

But even the humility of humble servants is an emotion. I understand
what you mean, and I agree that "genie-AIs" would be very useful
(humans could in fact provide them with the emotional-motivational
framework they might need). I'm not that convinced that enotional AI
on the other hand is bad; I do not think it is an unmanageable
problem.

Aha, so we transhumanists are creating the "death problem" by not just
accepting that people die young? That people die, destroy their lives
with drugs or demand rights are real objective facts. Since we (or at
least the people involved) do not like this, we try to do something
about it. This means we consider the current situation as a problem
and try to find a solution (which might be more or less good, of
course). All problems are to some extent artificial, or more properly
subjective to intelligent entities.

Which in itself is an interesting ethical problem. Suppose a certain
form of education created citizens that did not feel a need for
rights, would it be ethical for a dictator to use it?

Actually, as I outlined in my essay they might very well be dependent
or linked to humans for simple economical reasons. The law of
comparative advantage clearly suggests that it would be more
beneficial for the SI to trade with the humans than not; both sides
can profit by specializing and depending on the other. 

If humans are a potential threat, then the SI would also be less
motivated to wipe them out since the danger would be much larger. If
second-strike capability exists, then the SI would be hurt even if it
succeeds in wiping out the humans. And in order for the attack to be
rational, the benefit (safety) must outweigh the negative utility
(resources spent on attack, risk for losses or death, no more trading
opportunities). Simple game theory.

Actually their is a fifth word --- faith.

and most religious persons I know need FAITH because they experience no
meaning in their lives.

Just like most religious persons have no ethics or morals -- they can always
fall back on the excuse "I am a weak person". But of course they are quite
willing to lecture everyone else on morals and tell you how to lead your life.

*true* meaning? That's practically an oxymoron.  First of all, meaning is
uniquely constructed by each individual, depending as it does on that
individual's personal history, environmental context, personality, etc.  The
notion that there is such a thing as *true* meaning just doesn't make sense
to me.  Secondly, I don't know what makes you think that religion is the
only vehicle available to us for constructing meaning in our lives. What's
meaningful in our lives is what's relevant and valued.

When I was an adolescent, I came to the conclusion that science and religion
were simply two different approaches toward learning the same ultimate
truth.  It was later that I learned that religion starts with meaning and
distorts the truth to fit, amending their doctrines only when science
provides irrefutable and undeniable evidence to the contrary. If they want
to continue to do this, fine.  Science will not, hopefully, adjust it's laws
because of religious beliefs that lack evidence.  But this has all been said
before.

Lots of deluded people are happy.  On the other hand, I can be very happy
without needing religious meaning. You sound completely sold on the idea
that the non-religious lead empty and meaningless lives.  P'shaw.

	What, like faith that it is impossible to (or that we
shouldn't) overcome evil and all that which ails us?  After all, if
there is a God, we must find some way to justify why God hasn't
overcome evil.  If an all powerful God can't (or shouldn't) overcome
evil, we must abandon all hope that we can (or should) overcome evil
with our science.  If God can't, how can we?

	Science does give us real faith and hope.  Science says that
with more of the same kind of progress we've seen by mankind in the
past towards overcoming some of what ails us, we will be able to
eventually overcome all of it.  If you have faith in some God, you
must throw all this out since God should have done it before now.
That's the opposite of faith or giving up in despair.

	If you "believe" in God, you must attempt to justify,
theodicize or accept evil as necessary.  You can't hope to overcome.
Why make so many fruitless attempts to try to twist that which is bad
into some how being good simply to justify some God?  Can't we,
instead, hope to overcome evil rather than trying to find some way to
accept and justify it?  Rather than such giving up in hideous or
faithless despair, I prefer to hope and have faith that it can all be
overcome; that when there really is a near powerful God, he can and
will eliminate evil as we now know it.  Now that is real, honest, and
justified faith to me!

I'd have thought that the fundamental particle, *whatever* it may be,
is more fundamental than information, but on thinking about it
information must be the most fundamental thing. The smallest
particle still has a momentum, energy etc., which is information.
So is there a particle that carries information?

Sorry if I'm wrong, but how can something smaller

An essential and profound difference
between the creationist turtle
regression and the theoretical physics
model of the universe resides in that
physics does not present sub-atomic
particles as /creators/ of the macro
world.

While creationists continue to create
ideas to buttress their belief system,
scientists proceed to discover more
empirical evidence with which to refine
prevailing theories.

I'm new to this, so my apologies in advance if I violate any etiquette.

There are different ways in which something can be fundamental..  We can speak
of whether something is fundamental in a physically foundational sense (what
underlying physical material is making THIS physical material do what it does,
or exist?).  We could also speak of whether something is fundamental in an
epistemological sense (what concept makes the acceptance of THIS concept
logically possible?).  I think that if we examine all the different uses of
the word, though, the pattern that emerges is that something is fundamental if
it is necessary to exist for anything else to exist.

So with that in mind, information is not fundamental, because for information
to exist there must be things =about= which there can be information.  I might
be misreading how you're using the word information though.

Is a fact (which is presumably what makes up information) ABOUT something
identical with whatever aspect of that something it describes?  It seems far
more plausible to me, here at the outset, that a set of all the facts that
describe X is NOT identical with X itself.  But perhaps that set and X are
instantiated simultaneously.  The set exists when X exists, and X exists when
the set exists.  Or can the set really only exist if there is a conscious mind
to create it?

Unless the set of facts are one and the same as X, information is not the most
fundamental thing.

The question of evil is interesting. Somehow in history evil and religion go
together. Remember the crusades and inquisition. The readers of this list
might like the section "The Profit Motive Behind The Inquisition" in Richard
Zacks'
"An Underground Education" (Doubleday). Find any church and they will want
your money and freedom. And if you don't give it to them, they will find
some way to try to take them.

The question of evil is not to be solved by religion but by economics. Check
out Raymond Smullyan's essay "Is God a Taoist?". Evil in the long run is
simply uneconomical. BTW the essay can be found in Hofstadter and Dennett's
book "The Mind's I" (Basic Books).

The authors of the review are implicitly assuming that the 
overall nature of population economics does not change 
dramatically from it's nature over the last century or so.

If you think that great fundamental change is likely over
the next century, you don't want to take such forecasts 
literally.  But neither do you want to ignore what economists
have learned. 

I think that the farther out you want to forecast, the more
you want to rely on basic economic theory, in contrast to more 
empirical methods.  You use current and past data to infer 
what the fundamental processes are, and then then use your 
best models of those fundamental processes to infer some 
broad consequences of new technologies.  

I'm not sure what you mean by "quantitative", but I am 
confident that we do understand enough about fundamental 
economic processes to say interesting things about the future.
The problem is that very few economists have the hubris to
think carefully about the question, and very few people with 
the hubris and interest to think carefully about the future 
(like those on this list) know much economics.

While there is some heating from radioactive decay, such decay should over time
decrease on a half life basis, yet the rate of thermal conduction from within the
earth has remained rather steady, or declining at a very low rate. Since we now
know that the earth's EM field, which protects us from cosmic and solar radiation,
is generated by a dynamo mechanism within the earth that is created by the tidal
influence of the moon, and we can measure this influence, we can also measure the
amount of heat generated by the moons tide creating friciton, and thus heat,
within the earth. For example, we now know that the mantle and outer lithosphere
rotate one more day per year than the core does, and it is this slippage between
the layers that makes the earth behave like a big electric generator, with the
core being the rotor, and the mantle being the stator.

The high temperature and pressure of the atmosphere does cause the crust
materials to be much stronger than they would be at earth normal pressure and
temp, which is why mountains have been found to be so steep on Venus, much more so
than rock on earth could withstand, however Venus also has a thicker lithosphere
than the earth does, which could explain why it doesn't have such plate tectonics.
Why does it have such thick crust? Probably because it hasn't had the moon to keep
it well stirred for billions of years.

Plate tectonic movements over time are, prima, caused by the upwelling convection
currents of magma within the upper mantle spreading them apart. However, since all
continents were at one time a single supercontinent, which significantly perturbed
the center of gravity of the earth, it would take much greater forces than simple
upwellings to break them apart. Keep in mind that there are plenty of volcanos,
like Hawaii, as well as the large single volcano detected on Venus, which are
caused by magma upwelling convections which are not at spreading zones.

The most likely original cause of the breakup of Pangea was a conflict between the
earth's center of gravity, the earth's center of rotation, and the center of
angular momentum in the earth/moon system. As it is, the center of angular
momentum is at least a couple kilometers off center from the current center of the
earth, and it is this asymmetry which maintains the core/mantle dynamo that
generates the earth's EM field.

Granted a planet with a cooler mantle would not have the elasticity required to
support either theory, however, we can see that Jupiter's moon Io has extensive
volcanos, indicating upwelling is present, and is under one of the highest levels
of tidal influence in the solar system. While Mars, with no significant moons has
a few large extremely dead volcanos, and Venus has one large volcano, the two most
volcanically active planets/planetoids in the solar system share two significant
traits: they are both under a significant amount of tidal stress, and they both
have heavy metallic cores.

Convection is a side effect of tidal stresses.

You would think that since Venus is slightly smaller, slightly less dense, and a
lot hotter than Earth, that its atmosphere would have boiled off quite a while
ago, yet its atmosphere is much denser and hotter than our own. Even Saturn's
moon Titan has an atmophere denser than our own, though it is slightly cooler,
yet Titan is not much bigger than our own moon. There is a distinct correlation
between atmospheric density and tidal influence. Compared to its surface
gravity, Earth has the highest level of tidal influence, yet proportionately the
lowest atmospheric density of all bodies in the entire solar system. This cannot
be an accident.

I think the original comment was about information theory, which disregards
the "about" thing, and hands over the problem of interpretation to other
scientists (psychologists? computer scientists?). From the information
theoretic point of view, information is very fundamental, and it's basic
building block, the *bit* is pervasive. It's a very simple minded view
though, so you shouldn't be suprised that it claims fundamentality.

Of course there was no 'beginning'... Existence exists and has always

To Anders and Den:

Just a couple points that came to mind on this topic.  I think perhaps that
the term *emotion* is being used a bit loosely here.  It's true that people
commonly use phrases like *I feel motivated* or *I feel like watching TV*.
If a thought just seems to pop into my mind (i.e. I want ice cream), I will
probably say *I feel like some ice cream* but it's really a cognition, not
an emotion.  The basic emotions are typically thought to be anger,
exhiliration, sadness, or fear.  But even these basic emotional states have
questionable objective validity.

The most widely supported theory of emotion suggests the following (1) we
see the bear; (2) we cognitively interpret  the experience as threatening;
(3) we become physically aroused; (4) we cognitively assign a label to the
aroused state based on the context, our personal history, whether anyone
else is watching, etc.; and (4) the label we choose (i.e. the meaning we
assign to the arousal) subsequently dictates our behavior (i.e. we run, cry,
wrestle, etc.).  The objective quality of these aroused states does not vary
across the different emotions, though the subjective interpretation of them
does.  The chemistry is the same.  We construct the rest.  The level of
arousal we experience springs from the value and relevance we assign to the
experience.

I think Anders made a reference to DeMato's (sp?) book, Descartes Error, and
his  assertion that emotions are necessary for good decision making.  That
may be true but what aspect of emotions?  Can't they get in the way of good
decision making as well?  I think so.  Emotions seem to be signals that what
we're experiencing is likely to have either a positive or negative impact on
our life.  I don't see why AI's couldn't use the assignment of value and the
determination of  relevance to make good decisions without the need for
aroused states.  It's strikes me as a largely vestigial mechanism.  Even so,
I certainly don't want to lose my capacity for positive exhiliration (i.e. I
love laughing).  I would hope that part of the transhuman condition would
involve greater control over, rather than the elimination of emotional
states.

Once their programming abilities outstrip ours, won't it be up to AI's
whether they want to have emotions or not?  I mean they'll probably figure
it out before we do, don't you think?  If they choose to productively
interact with human-types, they'll probably want to program themselves for
behaviors that at least give the appearance of emotional reactions.  If I'm
interacting with an AI and I'm depressed about something, our interaction
will be more productive if the AI can accurately identify my emotional state
and react empathetically (there, there, Dr. Badger...it'll be alright).
Eventually, I may forget that it's just a programmed response (like most of
mine are).

Without the motive to do so, no entity needs to develop imagination. 
Without imagination and volition, we'll never have true AI. That is what
is at the heart of the kind of intelligence we posess, and it cannot be
hardwired into a system, it must evolve through complex feedback from an
external environment.  Without obstacles to overcome and problems to
solve, the most fundamental being the continuation of its own mind-state
through 'difficult situations', no AI will ever be anything more than a
deterministic expert system, i.e., not intelligent as we apply the term to
ourselves.

They almost certainly can NOT.

In fact, I expect it will be impossible to create a virtual world of
sufficient complexity to allow an AI 'baby' to achieve conceptual
awareness at all. Certainly far more complex than to create the AI 'baby'
itself. One would probably have to wire up the baby with enough sensory
organs to allow it to accumulate a rich enough sensory and perceptual
experience, with plenty of feedback mechanisms, and let it free in the
real world if one expected it to get anywhere in its cognitive growth.

Might != Right

'Right' implies what is 'right' for the entity in question, what is in
accordance with its nature. In the case of free-willed, rational,
conceptually conscious entities, what's right is unrestricted freedom of
thought, expression, creation, and trade. Might is almost always exactly
the opposite of what's 'right' for such entities. It disables them from
operating in accordance with their basic nature and negates the whole
point of their existence in the first place.

> AI with delusions of grandeur is more productive, then there

If it was intelligent, it could choose whether or not it wanted to be
'evil', i.e. act in violation of, and against, it's own basic nature, or
'good', acting in accordance with its nature as a volitional, conceptually
conscious entity. You couldn't 'make' an AI evil any more than you can
'make' a child evil, or good. If the term 'inteligence' has any meaning at
all in this context besides being able to beat Karpov at chess, then the
thing would do as it bloody well pleased.

Well, seeing that the world currently seems to be full of 'might is right'
ignoramuses like you, perhaps that wouldn't be all that bad. Us Gods do
get lonely on this barren planet.

Not in this case, you silly silly boy.  You don't seem to understand that
from B's position, A is smaller, not larger.  So you can't ever say that A
is larger than 0, where the 0 is self.  Nothing is larger than 0 in this
example.  However, B IS smaller than 0 according to A, and A is smaller
than 0 according to B.  Since there is no positive sign, you cannot add 0s
and -s to get 0.

True, but the one that is "larger" always happens to be SELF, which is
never positive.  If self is always 0, and the other is always negative,
then where are you getting your positive sign from?  B does not measure A
to be positive, nor does A measure B to be positive.

In A's reference frame, A is 0, and B is negative.  In B's reference
frame, A is negative, and B is 0.  You can't sum these and get zero.
There is no reference frame in which A or B measures a positive number.

Most importantly, I can guarantee you that no one will measure either
meter stick to be >1m, *because they use their own meter stick*.  Get it?

The one thing that pisses me off most is a guy who claims to have won an
argument when all he does is repeat something wrong.  It irritates me to
no end.  Please stop saying that B measures A to be positive: it is false.
B measures itself to be larger than A, but only in that it measures itself
to be *0*, not positive.

Look, it's really friggin' simple.  A measures itself to be 0.  A measures
B to be negative.  B measures itself to be 0, and measures A to be
negative.  A never measures itself or B to be positive.  B never measures
itself or A to be positive.  A never uses B's ruler when A is performing
the measurements.

So, here are ALL of the measurements you have available to you:
A measuring A: 0
A measuring B: - (never +, uses A's ruler!)
B measuring B: 0
B measuring A: -

What's positive?  Construct an "X, using its own ruler, measures Y to be
positive" and you'll win a cupie doll.

Sorry, but that is an incredibly facile explanation for religious origin
myths.  Two thousand years ago, when people didn't even know what stars
were, there were many smart people who wondered why there was something
instead of nothing, and why the world was the way it was.  In those days,
and even a few hundred years ago, the idea of a creator was a perfectly
rational, metaphysical explanation for the universe.  Unfortunately for
religion, there are now better explanations for why this world exists
(although we are still working on why there is something rather than
nothing).  But dismissing religion as mindless, unjustified belief does a
major disservice to what has been a central intellectual force in this world
up to the beginning of science, a fairly recent phenomenon indeed.  I am an
atheist, but having studied the history of science and religion extensively,
I become irritated when religions are dismissed lightly.  Fundamentalists
are loony-tunes.  But science as we know it today would not have existed
without the Judeo-Christian belief in "rational explanation", which
contrasts greatly with Buddism for example, where the question of origin is
not really considered at all. The first scientists were theologists,
observing the universe around them and trying to explain it.

Go back and read some of the previous posts on this issue.  The question
is whether we COULD create an AI without emotions, not why we might want
to.  If the architecture of the AI were just like that of the brain,
emotions might have to be hard-wired into the system.

That's an unsound argument.  Suppose that we find some reason R that

There is no reason that I can see to think that R necessarily entails that 1)

Furthermore, if R can provide a case for why a benevolent God allows evil,
then it's possible that R is also applicable to our actions, and thus provides
a reason for us to allow evil.  And if that's the case, then we've merely
discovered that to do right we must allow some evil.  To word as though we've

   IAN: Dan, over the span of about 5 posts, you've
   continually failed to accurately represent what I
   am saying so blatantly as to exceed belief. I am 
   NOT saying A is larger as seen by B nor am I say-
   ing that A is larger relative to A -- which are 
   the only two cases you allow me to make (that
   I don't), both of which are manifestly false. 

   That I'm not saying what you say I say couldn't 
   be clearer, I have even provided illustrations 
   showing that each sees the other's ruler SHRINK
   and each sees its ruler LARGER than the others.

   Just because you choose to omit data from your 
   analysis does not make your analysis correct, 
   in fact it makes it a false net measurement.
   It's your fallacy of "partial difference."

   You seem to be under the impression that your 
   scenario has violated the symmetry of measure,
   that A measures "smaller" free from reference 
   to something "larger" than the smaller. There 
   are 2 observers that can make 4 valid measure-
   ments, that's 8 measurements in all, but your 
   chart only includes half of them, as you say:


>So, here are ALL of the measurements you have available to you:
>A measuring A: 0
>A measuring B: - (never +, uses A's ruler!)
>B measuring B: 0
>B measuring A: -


  IAN: That's half, here are all measurments:

  After B passed by A near the speed of light,
  A filled out this chart of all differences:

             A  B
            ______
         A | 0 -1 |
           |      |
         B | 1  0 |
           --------

  (AA) Difference between A and A = 0
  (AB) Difference between A and B = A is  1 larger
  (BA) Difference between B and A = B is -1 smaller
  (BB) Difference between B and B = 0


  Observer B measured these differences:

             A  B
            ______
         A | 0  1 |
           |      |
         B |-1  0 |
           --------

  (AA) Difference between A and A = 0
  (AB) Difference between A and B = A is -1 smaller
  (BA) Difference between B and A = B is  1 larger
  (BB) Difference between B and B = 0

  Because a measure of relative size is simply a 
  measure of difference, we could've ascertained 
  a priori that the change in size would sum to
  0 by observing that as a rule, the sum of
  all differences between all numerical 
  measurements always equals zero:

            0  1  2  3
           ____________
        0 | 0  1  2  3 |
          |            |
        1 |-1  0  1  2 |
          |            |
        2 |-2 -1  0  1 |
          |            |
        3 |-3 -2 -1  0 |

	No reason?  I sure can't see any reason why you can think this
way.  How would we as sentient beings be any different from God?  If
God doesn't now overcome Evil, how/why should we ever be able to?  Why
could God be different than us?  If God doesn't have to overcome evil,
why should we now try to overcome evil?

	That's what a theodicy is.  Ann attempt to find any reason R
that justifies evil in the presence of a God.  A theodicy is an
attempt to twist evil or bad into good or into something that is
rationalized or justified.

> And if that's the case, then we've merely discovered that to do

	Such an idea is the ultimate of devilishness to me.  How can
we find some way to twist bad into really being good so we can justify
it's existence or our (or God's) tolerance of it?  Again, I prefer to
hope that such would never be required, that we can find some way to
eliminate ALL evil.  Once we achieve such, as any God must already
have done, how could we be justified in not eliminating it?

	Good is good and bad is bad in my book.  There can be no
twisting of one into the other.  I seek after and hope for perfect
goodness and make no attempts to justify any evil.  Any belief or
acceptance of any idea or words like "we must allow some evil" is
faithlessly giving up in despair to me.  My hope and desire is to
never give up until all evil is overcome.  It is not consistent to
have such a hope and to believe in a God.

  IAN: Those measures are of things seen NOW 
  relative to things seen NOW. If we measure
  NOW against PAST (in the scenario previously
  cited) we have twice as many valid measurements 
  made by each observer, since we are now measuring 
  also across time. We thus have the following:

  The "'" placed after a letter = present time,
  such that "A = A in past," and " A' = A now "


 All 8 Valid Measurements Made by Observer A

(AA') Difference between A and A' =  0 (old-A same as now-A)
(AB') Difference between A and B' =  1 (old-A larger than now-B)
(BA') Difference between B and A' = -1 (old-B smaller than now-A)
(BB') Difference between B and B' =  1 (old-B larger than now-B)

(A'A) Difference between A' and A =  0 (now-A same as old-A)
(A'B) Difference between A' and B =  1 (now-A larger than old-B)
(B'A) Difference between B' and A = -1 (now-B smaller than old-A)
(B'B) Difference between B' and B = -1 (now-B smaller than old-B)


  Notice that in the first 4 we get an asymmetry,
  two positives and one negative, but when we have
  all measurements, we see that net difference = 0.

No, there is smaller, and there is larger.  However, there is no POSITIVE
in this example.  That's the difference.  The larger, in this case, is
zero.

Funny how this chart is different from the others you've provided before,
yet you claim to be repeating yourself.  <sigh> I guess that's to be
expected.

Unless you're defining relativity differently from the way I am (which
wouldn't surprise me one bit), you can't have A find AB, and CERTAINLY not
BB.  AB is not a measurement which A can make: it can only make BA and
infer that AB must be its negative.  Similarly, it could infer that BB
would be 0, but no measurement which A can make will show this.

How can I say this?  Well, think about how A is making a measurement: it
takes itself, which is zero, and it compares itself against others.  A can
observe these differences.  But could A measure A from B's perspective
this way?  No.  Indeed, if A tried to use B's actual perspective, you'd
get my non-zero chart.  Instead, A must infer that if A perceives B to be
smaller and A to be larger, B must perceive the same thing.  This
inference is valid in Newtonian mechanics, but as we can see in this case
it is not: B has a different bottom row than A would infer.

Unfortunately, in this case B does NOT perceive the same thing: it
perceives the exact opposite of what it should.  Rather than observing AB
to be 1, B observes AB to be -1.  So the bottom row, which describes what
B perceives, is invalid as a description; it describes what A thinks that
B ought to see, what A infers B *must* see.

Similarly, B cannot measure AA or BA.  It cannot say what A would
perceive, but can only infer it based on what B perceives.  (And indeed,
if B tried to use this chart to predict what A perceives, B would be flat
out wrong.)

Now, if you want to say that we're just taking the differences measured as
well as the differences inferred and summing those, you can, but it's
somewhat of a hack.  As you can see, you can no longer explain reality in
terms of an identity chart.  It suddenly takes two charts, which isn't at
all what your theory would claim.  Indeed, just below you quote your "one
chart" theory, despite the fact that it now takes two.  It also has to
take inferred perceptions into account, which IMO greatly weakens the
theory, though not quite as much as the fact that one identity chart is
insufficient to describe reality.

Sorry, I'm a little backwards here, its the core that rotates one more day per year
than the mantle/crust, as the moon's tidal forces apply greater torque to the outer
layers than to the innner layers..... sorry for the confusion folks, though I'm sure
somebody has already corrected me....

But information is a thing, and this is not just an esoteric nit pick, it's 
very practical. The Internet search engine companies provide information 
about information, that's all they do, yet they're the hottest thing on 
Wall Street, their stock price has gone to the moon in the last year.

Without information there would be no such definition, nobody around to

Perhaps, but Science is about experiment and there is no conceivable

What would it mean for it to be ethically bad, under these circumstances?

Is a negative feedback automatically the equivalent of pain or hunger?  Does a
robot turtle feel pain when its batteries are low?  Or could a complex AI
think "oops, these are unproductive thoughts, I'll be rebooted, and I don't
want that" in a quasi-Zen fashion, without 'real' subjective pain?

Can we answer these questions without neurological insight into subjective
feeling?  I doubt it.

At any rate, an AI could have emotions, but ones more appropriate for its
environment.  Curiosity and boredom and happiness when it fulfills the orders
of its human, instead of dignity or desires for freedom or fear of snakes.

S. M. Stirling's Draka timeline provides an interesting question.  The Draka
are rational quasi-Nazis, or modern Spartans, descended from Southern
Loyalists resettled in South Africa after the American Revolution.  Nasty
folk.  Somewhat power-seductive, though.  At any rate, eventually they go
posthuman, and Earth is occupied by two new species.  The serfs are Homo
servus, similar to H. sapiens, but more docile, sensitive to Draka pheromones,
worshipful of the Draka, and probably smarter and healthier.  The Draka
replace themselves with Homo drakensis, with more genetic distance than chimps
or maybe gorillas; generally superhuman. 

The question: regardless of Draka atrocities, what do you do with the existing
society, if you could force a peace with the drakensis?  It seems unethical to
a lot of people, but would interfering with it really be ethical?  The servus
don't want freedom; they're not made for it.  Like Niven's Moties, but
artificial, not natural.

Hmm.  Are artificial biological castes worse than natural ones?

The ethical sense being violated here would seem to be absolute, or
transcendental, not empirical or evolutionary.  Evolutionary ethics seem to be
misapplies in these cases, and empirical ones have no clear objection.

   IAN: Dan, in the difference between -1 
   and 0 there IS a POSITIVE, just observe: 

   0 - (-1) = 1

   0 minus -1 = difference of POSITIVE 1. The 
   difference is also negative: -1 - 0 = -1, 
   and the net difference is 1 + (-1) = 0.

   It is just as valid for A to say, "B shrunk
   (-) in size relative to me," as it is for A 
   to say, "I grew (+) in size relative to B," 
   in fact, they are the same statements!

   FACT: (+) and (-) are *equally* indicated!

   IAN: Get serious, each diagram is defined. 
   The matrix you presented sums half of all 
   measurements from BOTH observers. The matrix
   above, as stated, are derived only from A.

   It is just as valid for A to say, "B shrunk
   in size relative to me," as it is for A to 
   say, "I grew in size relative to B," in 
   fact, they are the same statements!



>>   (AA) Difference between A and A = 0
>>   (AB) Difference between A and B = A is  1 larger
>>   (BA) Difference between B and A = B is -1 smaller
>>   (BB) Difference between B and B = 0

>Unless you're defining relativity differently from the way I am (which

  IAN: If we can measure the difference between 
  the thing we are in relative to the thing we 
  are in (=0), we can measure anything we see 
  relative to that same thing, and use it as
  a zero point of departure for measure. So
  claiming "A can't measure (B,B)" is baseless.

  The fact that measurement is relative means
  simply that where we place our zero point 
  of measure IS RELATIVE, is ARBITRARY. There
  is no rule that says you cannot assume that 
  you are in motion (non zero) even though your 
  at rest (0) with respect to your self. Your 
  argument seeks to prohibit valid measurements.

  IAN: Dan, listen to me: I'm NOT saying that
  A is measuring himself from B's perspective
  when I say that "(AB) difference = larger." A 
  is measuring the relative size of two entities
  before him. 1 is larger (Hello!) than the other.
  A does NOT have to see A from B's perspective
  to accurately observer that "I am larger."

  Observe the equality of these statements:

"You're smaller(-) than me" = "I am larger(+) than you."

"You're smaller(-) than me" = "I am larger(+) than you."

 There is no reference frame shifting involved
 in my analysis. That's what you are missing in 
 what I'm saying. A can make BOTH of the statements 
 above, and the larger statement defines the positive
 that you've been arguing is not valid, but clearly is.

I'm not sure I understand your comment about the view being 'simple
minded'.

'Information' is an extremely esoteric concept, particularly when taken
from an information theoretic point of view.  I'm fairly certain that there are
deep connections between information and existence - take, for example,
the information theoretic definition of entropy and the definition of entropy
in statistical physics.

I get funny feelings in my gut everytime I think about this. Its usually a
good indicator that my instincts are right, but that I've got insufficient
information(!) to form a definitive opinion.  (I know, not great science, but
hey, I'm only human).

Well, stranger things do occur in physics. Although in this case I
think Hara Ra is exaggerating slightly in order to close a neat
metaphysical loop :-) 

Thanks to Heisenberg, virtual particles with large mass can emerge if
they vanish fast enough (Delta E * Delta T >= hbar). So theoretically
the "universe particle" could appear and disappear. But it doesn't
strike me as a likely constituent of stable matter. Maybe one could
postulate "screening effects" like those surrounding charged particles
that would make stable universe particles appear as low-mass
particles, but it doesn't sound likely.

As for quark contituents, people have discussed the idea for quite
some time. I have an old issue of SciAm where an article suggests that
quarks are made up of 'rishons' in two flavors. As far as I know, the
theory haven't found that strong support.

While I agree that we want volition for AI to become useful and
interesting, I'm not sure it must be evolved. A sufficiently clever
programmer might be able to write an AI program from scratch, although
it might turn out that this is so tricky and inconvenient that
everybody in their right minds will evolve AI and then tweak it.

I think you make the mistake of thinking that we need to put all the
complexity in by hand, which would likely be infeasible. But you could
set up a basic set of world rules that encourage emergence, and then
let the world develop (e.g. let virtual plants go through a run of
simulated evolution, generating a synthetic ecology with fairly
complex structures no human has had the need to program).

Second, I don't see why you need to create a very complex virtual
world. It might turn out that "rather complex" worlds will do just as
well for creating basic AI. One might even have a succession of worlds
of increasing size and complexity, where the AI grows up until it
emerges in the real world.

Or rather, we certainly do experience them, but it is not certain they
are are basic. I'm fairly certain for example that what we commonly
call pleasure is composed of several subsystems (such as the "liking"
and "wanting" dopaminergic systems).

Actually, there are some chemical differences in which neuromodulator
systems get activated - noradrenaline (arousal, aversive experience),
serotonin (safety?), acetylcholine (attention, arousal), dopamine
(motivation) and so on, but they are surprisingly small. Measured with
a polygraph, anger and happiness are indistinguishable.

Damasio. 

I went for lunch with my research group, and we discussed this
problem. We ended up with the following conclusions:

In the brain the dopaminergic reward systems seem to be involved in
reinforcement learning. They seem to turn our sensory input and
deductions into a scalar reinforcement estimate, telling us how good
or bad we did, and directly influencing plasticity in the basal
ganglia to change our behavior to become better. 

Since intelligent entities need to learn, and learn in an unsupervised
setting where the results might not even be present now but appear in
the future, it is hard to avoid some kind of reinforcement learning
with an internal reinforcement estimator that can do credit
assignment. This means the entities need to be able to evaluate
outcomes as good or bad, and to make estimates of how good the results
of different actions will be. I would say this correlates quite well
with what we would call pleasure or pain.

Damasio makes a good case that we use these valences to do 'alpha-beta
pruning' of our decision trees: ignore possible actions whose outcomes
are likely to be bad, concentrate on those that will lead to
good. Without this we would get trapped doing needless thinking about
bad ideas, beside the risk of choosing a bad action because we cannot
evaluate it as bad.

On the other hand, our emotions change the mode of our thinking. For
example, when aroused we tend to use behaviors that are strongly
learned instead of exploring new possibilities (this is true even for
high levels of happiness, apparently), when feeling content we are
less likely to act in ways that will involve risk, and so on. These
modes (moods?) doesn't appear necessary for rational thinking, so an
AI might do without them. The effect would likely be rather like a
caricature of Spock - constantly calm and efficient. But it is likely
that having cognitive modes is a good thing in many circumstances; in
a crisis situation it might be very useful not to be too calm, when
encountering something unexpected it might be useful to go into a
rapid analysis mode and so on.

So our consensus became that AI will most likely have at least
reinforcement emotions, and for efficiency reasons likely moods. On
the other hand, we have not yet agreed on what motivations need to be
included in an useful AI. A likely guess would be novelty detection
and approach, otherwise it would learn very badly and likely get stuck
in a rut. 

> I don't see why AI's couldn't use the assignment of value and the

Note that we do not need arousal for decision making, it just
influences it. But assignment of value, I would say that is the basis
of emotion.

Exactly! We humans already have an impressive control over our
emotions (most of them are actually caused at least in adults by
internal cognitive processes) and hardware connections between the
limbic system and the frontal cortex that are denser than among most
mammals. That is something we can develop further.

I would say information is fundamental, but maybe in a trivial
way. Information is really pattern, the distinguishable organization
of something (meaning and similar stuff are higher level things). 

That makes it fundamental in an ontological sense, but the question is
if it is the only fundamental stuff. One could postulate that
existence consists of 'quintessence' and information, the ordering of
the quintessence into the world we know. Or one could be a platonic
materialist and say that existence is just made up of information,
with no need for quintessence. 

While I like the platonic materialist position (more parsimonious) I
acknowledge that ontological discussions tend to be rather pointless -
there is very little or nothing we can do to find out how things
really are on this level.

Title
  Potassium, sodium, and cancer: a review. [Review] [12 refs]
Source
  Journal of Environmental Pathology, Toxicology & Oncology.  15(2-4):65-73,
  1996.
Abstract
  Agents known or believed to be carcinogenic decrease the concentration of
  potassium and increase the concentration of sodium in the
  cells. Anticarcinogenic agents have the opposite effect. In all cases where
  we have information on an agent's carcinogenicity or anticarcinogenicity and
  on that agent's effects on cellular potassium and sodium
  concentrations the above relationships have been found to be true. Dietary
  carcinogenic agents studied include sodium, cadmium, fat, cholesterol,
  calories, and alcohol; dietary anticarcinogenic agents include
  potassium, vitamins A, C, and D, selenium, and fiber. The
  effect of calcium intake is less clear as that effect depends on the
  concentrations on sodium and potassium. Not only dietary
  agents but also other carcinogenic and anticarcinogenic agents work in the
  same way. The cancer-causing drug dimethylhydrazine increases sodium and
  decreases potassium in the cells, whereas, for example,
  indomethacin, an anticarcinogen, has the opposite effect. In aging
  potassium leaves the cells, sodium enters them, and the
  rates of cancer increase. Patients with hyperkalemic diseases (Parkinson,
  Addison) have reduced cancer rates, and patients with hypokalemic diseases
  (alcoholism, obesity, stress) have increased cancer rates. [References: 12]

Sorry, but people have been wondering this for many hundreds of
thousands of years, or possibly millions, depending on when you
start calling our ancestors people. Either way, clearly the
beginnings of science.

Science has been around as long as man ( L scire, know). Religion
has been one of the least intellectual of forces. But don't take my
word for it, ask Galileo, or Copernicus, or better yet Giordano
Bruno (burned at the stake by the inquisition) The Inquisition,
there were some intellectual giants!!!

I too study both the origins of science and religion (patristics)
extensively which is why I haven't the slightest idea where you get
your conclusions. Rational explanation has nothing to do with
"Judeo-Christian" belief for example, and Buddhism most certainly
discusses the question of origin. The first scientists were
theologists? Theologians study theology: the study of God and
religious doctrine, by definition.

This sounds like the ontological argument. There is no contradication in
saying that the universe came into existence. It may not make sense to say
that there was nothing *before* the universe (or multiverse -- if you think
our universe may be an offshoot of another). "Existence does not exist" is
a contradiction, but "the universe has not always existed" is not.

I wouldn't venture to assert whether science would or would not have
existed had histoy gone differently. However, I think it entirely possible
that we would have had science considerably earlier if Christianity had not
been so strong, with other, better intellectual systems in their place.

Certainly some aspects of the Christian tradition -- primarily in the
Catholic side (thought the independence-from-authority meme in
Protestantism helped) -- encouraged science. But these were not uniquely
Christian and originated clearly from outside Christianity. They were
essentially due to the respect for Plato and his conviction that universal
rational explanations were possible, and due to the (Platonized)
Aristotelianism of the Catholics. Most of the basic ideas of Christianity,
despite these imports, have been anti-rationalist ("tear the eyes out of
your reason" -- Martin Luthor), and have turned thinkers eyes towards
unworldly realms rather than towards naturalistic investigation.

If Christianity had died out with nothing in its place, or with Buddhism
taking over (not sure how that could have happened), I'd agree with you.
But what if Hellenic humanism had survived and flourished? If it had,
perhaps the Dark Ages would never had happened, and we wouldn't be dealing
with Rifkin and his kind today.

Max

P.S. Good line from the X-Files movies: Mulder to Sculley: "Your strict
scientific rationalism has saved me a thousand times over."

Here is a pet theory of mine.  I have not researched it, but will throw it out
for comments.

I think that the original superstitious or religous beliefs probably started
with the hunting of animals for meat.  What if an enlightened person realized
that proper planning could make the hunt go better?  This would not be
intuitively obvious, and would be hard to explain to others.  How would such an
individual go about training others?  Perhaps it would be explained by ritual. 
A person dresses up as the animal intended to be hunted.  Others are assigned
specific roles, including where to hide, when to run, how to approach, how to
attack, etc.  This procedure would be repeated over and over until the hunters
had it memorized and could do it right.  Eventually, the enlightened one would
declare that they were ready to hunt the real animal, and that the hunt would
probably go well.  Based on the practice rituals, the enlightened one could
predict who could hunt, and who could not hunt.  It might even be possible to
predict who would probably run in front of the charging animal and be trampled,
or who couldn't run fast enough to keep up, or who would probably trip while
running.

The enlightened person might also realize that practice would make
spear-throwing aim  more accurate.  Such a person might request that an effigy
animal be speared over and over from a distance, until the effigy can be
"killed" often.  Only when the ritual animal can be killed in ritual would
their be a good chance that the real animal would be killed in the real world.

Such a person would probably be seen as magical or as having some connection
with the nature gods that control the animals.  Ritual would be seen as
important, becuase it often predicted the outcome.  Those who were poor in
ritual, would be poor in the hunt.  Those declared victorious in ritual, would
be declared victorious in the hunt.  It may even be that the enlightened one
was injured through experience, or old with experience, such that they were
excluded from the actual hunt.  Their contribution would be the ritual
preperation before the hunt.

Perhaps the war-paint or wearing of skins was also a way to better hide or
disguise the smell.

Can it be that the roots of religious and ritual come from a scientific basis,
but that those receivers of the knowledge couldn't understand it, so they
reduced it down to religious rituals and trappings?  Maybe religions and
rituals are poor copies of some original method that was lost throughout the
ages.  As with most religions, the followers deified and extrapolated the
original teachings, based on their limited knowledge.  Eventually, such
teachings were simply "magic" and obedience was simply "commanded by the gods."

Any comments on this theory on the origins of religion?  I would also postulate
a similar origin for agriculture rituals looking to the stars to dictate when
to plant, when to harvest, etc.

 	No reason?  I sure can't see any reason why you can think this
 way.  How would we as sentient beings be any different from God?  If
 God doesn't now overcome Evil, how/why should we ever be able to?  Why
 could God be different than us?  If God doesn't have to overcome evil,
 why should we now try to overcome evil?>>
 
Keep in mind that I don't necessarily believe any of the following reasons.
I'm just showing how the reconciliation of God with evil does not necessarily
lead to the above two conclusions.

Reasons for thinking that 1 is not entailed by some reason R that reconciles
God with evil:
1) Evil will be overcome, but God has not chosen to do so yet, for reasons
that are beyond us but that we should think exist because the existence of a
benevolent God entails that they do.
2) Evil will be overcome once all human beings finish living out their lives
and making choices on earth (you could probably imagine all sorts of
theologies to support such an idea).  Evil is currently necessary because the
possibility of it must exist for free will to exist.
3) Evil will be overcome once those who are evil see the error of their ways.
Given that to be evil an agent must be capable of rational thought (ignoring
for a moment the problem of how a rational agent can do evil), it seems
plausible that over time all evil agents will see the irrational path they
follow and become good, thus overcoming evil.



Reasons for thinking that 2 is not entailed by some reason R that reconciles
God with evil:
1) God does not overcome evil because he has voluntarily undertaken to somehow
remove himself from this universe, in order to give the beings here, say,
greater responsibility.  However, since we are here, and somehow can, we
should overcome evil.
2) God is the creator and source of ethical law, and above ethical law.
Therefore the fact that we should overcome evil according to this ethical law
does not mean that God should also overcome evil.




Now I certainly find many of those reasons as repugnant and implausible as you
do.  But they show that a reconciliation of God with evil does not NECESSARILY
lead to either 1 or 2.  And that was my point.


<< A theodicy is an
 attempt to twist evil or bad into good or into something that is
 rationalized or justified.>>

I'd say that that's a particularly argumentative way of describing what a
theodicy is.  If the presence of evil is truly justified, then it hasn't
"twisted" anything in showing it to be justified.
 
 << 	Such an idea is the ultimate of devilishness to me.  How can
 we find some way to twist bad into really being good so we can justify
 it's existence or our (or God's) tolerance of it?  Again, I prefer to
 hope that such would never be required, that we can find some way to
 eliminate ALL evil.  Once we achieve such, as any God must already
 have done, how could we be justified in not eliminating it?>>

Evil cannot of course be twisted into being good and still remain evil.
That's simply incoherent.  But it seems plausible to me that there are moral
restraints on actions that allow for the possibility and instantiation of
evil.

 
<< 	Good is good and bad is bad in my book.  There can be no
 twisting of one into the other.  I seek after and hope for perfect
 goodness and make no attempts to justify any evil.  Any belief or
 acceptance of any idea or words like "we must allow some evil" is
 faithlessly giving up in despair to me.  My hope and desire is to
 never give up until all evil is overcome.  It is not consistent to
 have such a hope and to believe in a God.>>

For reasons already mentioned, such a hope and desire is entirely compatible
with belief in God.  Furthermore, if we have good reasons for accepting the
notion that "we must allow some evil" then we would be irrational (perhaps
evil?) not to accept it.
 


In any event, I do respect the degree of passion you have in opposition to
evil and in devotion to optimisim.

Hello Hiro.  I don't quite see how it's a contradiction to say that nothing
existed.  Certainly it would be a contradiction of sorts to say that nothing
exists in the PRESENT tense, but I see no contradiction in the notion of
saying NOW, when something does exist, that nothing existed PRIOR to now.

It seems pretty difficult to conceive of any empirical experiment that would

truths.  I think the question of the status of information (a set of facts
about a thing or just any set of concepts?) is one which must be resolved via
methods other than empirical experiments.

A little recommended reading... Freeman Dyson has a few words to be said on 
this subject.  I can't recall offhand which of his books addresses the issue. 
However his central argument concerns the Judeo-Christian tradition of 
theology--descended from the Greek fixation on reason--and its effect on 
rational/empirical/scientific thought.

I have no religion, yet from the time I was in the first grade I've had the  
ability to make sense out of many ASCII strings, including the sequence you  
just sent me, so obviously religion can't be the only thing that generates  
meaning. I suppose you'll tell me religion can give me some sort of ultimate, 
if nebulous, meaning but the trouble is if you tell me "X" is the meaning of 
life then the obvious question is "What is the meaning of X ?". 
And what is the meaning of meaning anyway?

               
      >integrate Science AND religion... It can be done, if you want to do it
          
Correct, Science can be polluted in that way.

Correct.

It would certainly be helpful if you could provide some examples, why is my 
life "meaningless" and why would I be better off if it were not?

        >>Me:
        >>I don't know what "freedom of spirit" means.

So help me find it. You used the term so I assume you know what it means, how  
about giving me a hint, who knows, I may already agree with you that we have  
"freedom of spirit".
          

        >you are already a dedicated worshipper of _S_cience and its High

Is there any particular reason you feel it's necessary to brand these two 
splendid human beings with that insult?
          

        >I'll say it again. Science will lead you to Truth, 
        
OK                        

        >Religion will lead you to meaning.
          

But I don't understand your meaning. Just one specific example where religion 
helped anybody understand anything would be more useful in communicating your 
ideas than a thousand more vague platitudes.
          

        >Avoid the Bible if it grieves you so, but find some spirit — have         
        >you tried Taoism? 
          

As I've admitted before, at one time I thought all mystics were fools, then I 
read a wonderful book written by a mystic Named Raymond Smullyan called 
"The Tao is silent". I disagree with Smullyan on lots of stuff but the man is 
quite definitely not a fool.

I respect Taoism, at least as it was originally taught by Laotse, but then, 
Taoism is not a religion. Unlike a religion Taoism asks profound questions  
it does not provide vapid answers, it claims no revealed truth, it takes no  
position on the existence of God and doesn't even have a position on the 
truth of Taoism. If you want to call something like that a religion then I'm 
a religious man.

Science is one way of finding truth, not the only one, the one which is
most famous among humans. But truth is nothing absolute, truth is
subjective.
The way science describes the truth is a model of the truth, not the only
real and right way of seeing it.

That`s right. But it hasn`t to be a religion like christianity or buddhism,
it can be your "own religion" created by your own thougts.

For this, it may be helpful first to get close to some of the famous
religions.

Surely good and evil are relative terms? A person's action is not
_absolutely_ good or bad - it depends on things like your belief
system, emotional state etc. Say an alien race comes along to
Earth tomorrow, and after initial contact problems (their universal
translator is on the blink) they tell us that our Sun must be removed;
in 20,000 years it will come too close to a star they have a
population centre at. This would be bad for us Earthlings, but good
for the alien race.

Okay, so there are some flaws in this hypothetical situation, but you
must see my point. You are arguing that two human created
concepts are proof that another human creation - gods - do not
exist. There are far better ways to do that.

Religions are thought-constructions for people who need them. Many do so,
they just have got to have something that frames their life, something
that`s valid forever, because they`d get crazy if they were fully alone. If
you have an own "religion", you don`t need to take over the thoughts of the
popular religions.

But it seems that you always need an explanation, a good reason for your
doings. You can`t act without them, right?

I don`t think god is omnipotent in every religion. God just can`t be
omnipotent. Nothing can be perfect or omnipotent.
So, why do you think, evolution is a horribly cruel process? Evolution is
part of nature and we couldn`t exist without it.

But perhaps God actually wants to see us suffer.<g> Perhaps humans will do
so when they want to create worlds for AL.

You`re right in the first two lines, but your conclusion is wrong. Many
religious texts may be vacous. The most important thing in a religion is
getting support by believing.

It also depends on the point of view if someone is deluded or not. You can`t

It doesn`t have to be religious meaning.

I've often thought this to be the case.  For a
place to start research why not look at modern
traditions?  There are literally thousands of
traditions that have come about in much the same
way as you describe here, but it would be far
easier to track them through history.  Tradition
could be seen as something that once had purpose,
but is now kept for its entertainment- or
reassurance value. (Also look at modern rituals -
like luck charms - that "lucky" tie that got you
your job, etc.)  There seems to be a huge number
of situations that support this theory.

"It's often said that people 'need' something more
in their lives than just the material world. There
is a gap that must be filled.  People need to feel
a sense of purpose. Well, not a BAD purpose would
be to find out what is already here, in the
material world, before concluding that you need
something more. How much more do you want? Just
study what is, and you'll find that it already is
far more uplifting than anything you could imagine
needing." - Richard Dawkins

	This is getting long, deep, and involved.  That is why I Cc:ed
you directly.  Most people on the list will probably not be this
interested in this thread and will likely hit delete.  I didn't want
to take the chance of missing any other great and helpful comments you
might have.

	Thanks for your continued dialogue and your comment:

> In any event, I do respect the degree of passion you have in

	I appreciate your input and your kind of playing the "devil's
advocate" as it helps me improve my thinking.

	"For reasons that are beyond us"?  My God commanded me to kill
and/or hate this person!  Don't ask me why because the reasons are
beyond us!  What a lame justification for all the evil done by the
many religions!  Any such reason for why God is waiting is entirely
incomprehensible to me.  I just can't imagine this.  Why is this?
Must/should this be?  I don't think so.  My point is that whenever we
engage in such theodicyzing, evil or hate and despair of some kind is
often the result.

	Ah, the old perverted blame evil on free will theodicy.  Yeah,
free will makes a great scapegoat for God right!??  First off, placing
the blame on free will (free will in this view must be bad or
malevolent since it is the cause of evil), to me, is far worse than
thinking that God is actually malevolent or the cause of evil.  To me,
free will is something good and glorious and when perfectly achieved
by all will finally eliminate all evil.  Since evil is, by definition,
that which we don't want.

	The fundamental premise behind such agency theodicies is that
in order to be free we must be allowed to choose that which we don't
really want (what evil or bad, by definition, is.)  But this is
logically absurd.  You can't choose that which you don't really want
to choose if one is really free.  Anything that causes us to deviate
from making the best possible (i.e. non evil) choices, whether it be
ignorance, lack of proper upbringing, inadequate brain wiring/mental
illness/chemical imbalance... or improper training, or even due to
randomness in nature destroys our agency or ability to get what we
really want.  Only when we can overcome all such causes and finally
deterministically always make the best possible (i.e. non evil)
choices will we finally have true free will.  Surely any true God
would always deterministically make the right choices or he would not
be God right?  Such a being would be the only being with true free
will or ability to make all the right choices.

	True, it would be evil for God to do something like put us in
chains and force us to always do what He (but not us) knows is right.
But instead of this, I have faith that a real God could adequately
educate us and help us achieve the strength and knowledge and so on
required to always make the right choices on our own.  Non of us are
truly free yet, we achieve more and more freedom or ability to get
what we really want every day via technology and progress.  I have
faith that some day we will all achieve perfect freedom.  All evil
will finally be removed (or simply not chosen) after such a day.  What
possible reason could there be for God not giving us more of a helping
hand with overcoming all this lack of freedom and evil now if he is
really out there!?  Should we really try to accept that there is such
a reason no matter how "beyond is" and incomprehensible such a reason
must be?

	And finally, the biggest reason this free will theodicy is so
perverse is because of the hate and intolerance that must go along
with it.  Some people freely choose good.  We are to love these
people.  Some people freely choose evil.  We are to hate and be
intolerant of these people (rather than try to be sympathetic of why
the particular evil choices might have been made and having a hope
that we might help).  We should work to destroy, or at best cast them
all out of our presence because nothing God can do, and especially
nothing we, who are much less than God, can do can help their evil
free will.  It seems to me that 99% of the hate and intolerance in
the world is directly due to this very popular, yet hideously
misguided notion of this kind of malevolent "free will".
Unconditional love is incompatible with any religion that holds such
as a doctrine, for the Devil (and any followers) must be hated and if
not destroyed, cast out and eternally punished.

	To me, free will is not malevolent and is exactly compatible
with the non existence of evil.  As long as there is evil, no one is
yet truly free.  I will eternally have faith that such perfection is
possible and will eternally strive for such with unconditional love
for all.

	Exactly!  And only then will they be free.  Again, why could a
real God not help us achieve this freedom now!?

	The idea that God for some reason must "voluntarily undertake
to somehow remove himself" from us is about the most depressing idea I
can imagine.  True love means being with someone, helping someone...
Love is not dieing, going away, or isolating one's self from those
they love!  True, mortal parents can sometimes be overbearing and it
is sometimes good to get out from "under their wing" but must I accept
that an all powerful God suffers from such mortal foibles as our
mortal parents sometimes do?  Such ideas just seem absurd and/or
hateful to me.  I would hope that I can always be with a true God and
that I would never have to be isolated or separated from him.

> 2) God is the creator and source of ethical law, and above ethical
> law.  Therefore the fact that we should overcome evil according to

	OK!  My God is the Devil.  Whatever evil he commands should be
done.  Anyone that deviates from all such absolute decrees will burn
in hell for eternity!  This is such a lame and devilish reason!  Good
is good and bad is bad.  Anything that is Good is Godly and anything
that is Bad is devilish.  That is the only possible way to know the
difference.  If this is not true, then there is nothing rational at
all and no way to know the difference.

> Now I certainly find many of those reasons as repugnant and

	Undoubtedly for some of the same reasons I've described.

> But they show that a reconciliation of God with evil does not
> NECESSARILY lead to either 1 or 2.  And that was my point.

	So, then, you think it is OK to hate devils and all their
worshipers, as long as we can still have faith in our God!?  This is
only one of many many reasons why I just can't see how anyone can make
such points.  Thinking like this just makes more evil, hate, and
despair.  If we have true faith that all might be possible one way or
another we need not accept any of this evil and despair.

> I'd say that that's a particularly argumentative way of describing
> what a theodicy is.  If the presence of evil is truly justified,

	Yes, I can see your point.  But accepting any such evil, for
whatever justification, is the lessor theory.  The theory that a way
can be found to eliminate all such evil is the greater theory.
Hopping for the greater theory is having faith, accepting the lessor
is giving up in despair.  We should never give up hope that something
better might be possible.  I always hope that there might be some way
or another found to eliminate all evil and will eternally seek after
such!

Then I think that your type of AI falls more into the categori of IA
(Intelligence Amplification.) This is where very strong technical
support systems enhances the human mind. But they are not self aware. A

Its actually a pretty pathetic religion that does not explain anything. Keep in
mind that religion formed as an organized class to maintain knowledge of a
social groups history, mythology, and intellectual property. In its time,
successfull religions explained everything sufficiently for the man of the
time. That science has surpassed religion in its ability to explain the
universe in a more consistent manner that is congruent with observed fact is an
indication that most of mankind has or is moving beyond religion as the major
means of explaining the universe. This is extropic to say the least. This is
not to say that any religion, in its original form, was not extropic for the
time in which it was formed. Organized structures like religions do, however,
become obsolescent with time if they cannot change sufficiently to meet the
changing times.

Any religion which cannot explain anything to the satisfaction of even a small
group of people is nothing more than either a dead mythology or a quaint form
of meditative exercise.

Well, yes, that's basically what I want. Not a new kind of artificial,
superfast and highly intelligent humanoid with a "will", but a machine
that can (more or less autonomously) conduct research at a lightning 
pace. A machine that doesn't ponder ethics, but rather dutifully serves
and protects humans becuase it's been programmed that way. All
"emotions"
that [turn out] to be either superfluous, or harmful to its efficiency
(at solving problems) should be left out.

Although this machine wouldn't be "conscious" like a human, it would
nonetheless still classify as "intelligent", since it could
learn from its own and other's mistakes or success, and improve
its performance. Is this what they call "weak" AI?

   IAN: How many religious rituals involve
   what would amount to hunting training? 
   That seems to be the short rout to the
   answer to your question. Obviously many 
   of the early cave painting are associated
   with ritual and with hunting. I believe that
   encounters with psychedelic agents in plants
   and fungi had a MAJOR role in the formation 
   of almost all religions and very often was
   the central aspect of religious ritual.

   As to such ritual as that which you posit 
   being "scientific" because it served a useful 
   purpose, it then follows that all religion is 
   scientific because it fulfills some purpose,
   in fact many purposes: social order, stability,
   fraternity, support systems, a way to rally 
   the troops and control the people you want to 
   control... religion is scientific mind control!
   That's very useful to those running the religion.

 Yet ironically, it's what people study least.

 It's just assumed that what exists is what is,
 that A is A. Well ya, but why and how is A A?

I'll make this brief, I'm new to this extropy thing, and I'm looking for 
a mentor who I can inteact with and learn from. I am coming from the 
cyber-youth gone mad, techno music making, web designer by default, 
school of thought. In fact, the first thing I remember reading about
extropy was in 
M2K a few years ago...so if there's anyone who can relate and would like 
to be a big brother/sister to an extopy orphan, it would be a great help.

I'm not sure what an "emotion" is. I can attempt a definition based
on introspection, but it's a bit safer to describe emotions based
on actions exhibited by other people and animals.

This leads to a problem. Many complex systems exhibit behaviours that
appear to be emotional. Such systems include governments, religions,
telephone systems, machinery, and computer systems. Generally, the "emotional" behaviour is not designed, but is an emergent
behaviour
that IMO results from the complexity of the system. It's not
going to be difficult to program emotional behaviour into an AI. In
fact, it'll be difficult to avoid this behaviour.

Ian, am I correct to state that your theory can be summed up as follows?

net difference = | (A - B) | - | (B - A) | = 0 ?

The lovely thing about the rishon model was that it effortlessly unified
quarks and leptons.  By-passed by superstring theory, I guess, but I've
never seen it debunked.

Johnny Quest is now on the Cartoon Network, and a few years ago, there were a few
remakes and new episodes made. He also had a series of juvinile novels similar to
the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew...  While my older brother read the Hardy Boys, I
read Johnny Quest....

Your own decisions about what is ethical or not is what makes it so. How well
you do in life, whether it be a small part of your life or the whole schpiel, is
a measure of the effectiveness of the ethics you do develop. This isn't to say
that someone living in poverty their whole life has poor ethics, on the
contrary, though their own ethics may preclude them from measuring success from
a materialist perspective. However, one can note that the average life
expectancy, lifetime and annual earning potential, average stress level and
average happiness level of people which most would regard as having poor ethics,
i.e. criminals, is far far lower than those as a whole than those people who
most would regard as having good ethics.

Of course, there are always exceptions to the rule, as with any bell curve, as
well as fields of endeavor where ethics that most people would regard as good
would be a hindrance to success, like in the fields of politics, law, car sales,
etc. If one enjoys one of these occupations, you do of course need to form your
own ethics which may be considered bad to most people, but which are effective
for your own occupation or lifestyle...

Ethics are nothing more than a set of rules you create for yourself for getting
through life. If they work for you, great. If you have no ethics, and you aren't
quite happy with the results of living opportunistically, try creating a few
purposely.

BTW: Nobody can be said to have no ethics, save for a newborn babe....

I'll answer the second question first because it's much easier.  The
"right" action, in the ethical sense of the term, is defined as the thing
which you should do.  Therefore, it isn't really sensible to ask "why
should I care what I should do?"  If you've already agreed that a
particular action is the one which you should do, then there's no further
question to be asked; you should do what you should do.

The question of ethics is properly stated: "What *should* I (we?) do?"  If
we answer that question, if we can find out what you should do, then we
can answer your first question by saying that an action is unethical if
you shouldn't do it; ie it is any action which is not what you should do.
Of course, we can *only* say this meaningfully if we have solved the
problem of ethics;  otherwise, you could just as easily ask "What
shouldn't I do?" and get no more useful a response.

Within this context, it is usually posited by a variety of thinkers that
the right answer to the question is necessarily the rational answer to the
question.  This is somewhat contested; the answer may well be unavailable
to reason, instead available only to instinct, or derived from an
"objective list" which is not itself derived from axioms.  There are also
some who claim that we cannot answer the question at all; that ultimately
no actions are better than others.  I happen to disagree with these
thinkers, but one should keep the non-rationalists in mind, since there
are so many of them out there. 

Those aside, assuming that rationality is correct usually leads thinkers
to define what rationality is, show how the rules of rationality dictate
certain actions, declare them to be right, and claim to have solved the
problem of ethics.  Kant is probably the most famous and well-respected of
such philosophers, though he has competition; this strategy goes all the
way back to Aristotle, who basically defined logic in the first place.

That being said, there is no specific extropian answer to the problem of
ethics, though we could easily suggest that one extreme answer might be:
"The right action is that which maxmizes extropy over all other possible
actions."  However, I think many extropians would not agree with this
answer to the question; while extropy is good, it may not be the only
important thing in the universe.  Following this rule would demand that we
kill, steal, torture, and even commit suicide if doing so would even
marginally increase universal extropy compared to that which would be lost
by doing so. 

The answers I find the most compelling are probably these:  "The right
action is that which is most likely to maximize the total well-being and
total number of all people."  "The right action is that which would
promote our own well-being if everybody was doing the right thing."  "The
right action is that which is most likely to maximize the agent's
well-being (without preventing others from doing the right thing)."  The
first answer is basically utilitarianism, the second answer is a gross
simplification of Kant's categorical imperitive, and the third answer is
egoism (the modification in parentheses is close to Rand's objectivism
or some forms of libertarianism).

Speaking personally, I believe that the first answer is correct, though
the modified third answer is running a close second.  I tend to reject the
second answer, on the grounds that in many cases doing the "right" action
as dictated by the second answer makes the agent and others worse off. 
Without carefully defining practical rationality, it seems to me that
doing an action which makes oneself and all those around one worse off is
not very rational at all.

I tend to reject the third answer because simple egoism tends to promote
actions which seriously hurt others, if the agent can pull them off
without getting more punishment than pleasure from doing the action.  This
is not a logical inconsistency, except to the extent that it would
probably be worse for us if we were all pure egoists; while I do not
agree with the categorical imperitive as written, I do think that any
rational answer to the question ought to be generalizible in a way that
simple egoism isn't.

Meanwhile, objectivism seems to rely on a kind of irrationality: while it
is objectively true that "preventing others from acting morally" is wrong
according to utilitarianism and the categorical imperitive, it does not
follow from simple egoism; indeed, egoism seems to demand that we prevent
others from acting morally if we would benefit from doing so.  That being
said, however, I find that utilitarianism and objectivism/libertarianism
usually agree on what the right action is.  Both are generalizible and
both seem to obey some definition of practical rationality. 

Ultimately I believe utilitarianism is correct because even the modified
version of egoism may prevent us from doing something obviously rational
under a variety of situations.  A common example is one in which you might
steal from someone in order to save lives, possibly your own.  An
objectivist would quickly point out that stealing is wrong, and therefore
one should never do so.  However, under situations of sufficient urgency,
no other choice may be available (besides death), and within that context
we again seem to be forced into the position of accepting bad consequences
when we do the right thing; a situation which I believe to be paradoxical.
Utilitarianism, on the other hand, allows us to get the consequences we
strive for without sacrificing practical rationality.

Utilitarianism is not without its problems, however, especially when
maximizing total happiness would fail to maximize total numbers, or vice
versa.  It also seems to have problems of justice; for example, if somehow
by torturing one person you could make a hundred others positively elated,
utilitarianism may require that you do this.  I doubt that situations
quite like this actually exist, though I'm sure some smarty here will try
and step forward and prove me wrong. 

Anyway, the point is that this question is important because it determines
what you should do.  As for the correct answer, if we posit that the
correct answer can be found rationally, then the problem of ethics may one
day not be so problematic after all.

Subject: The Happy Robot

First, I'd like to commend Ross Levatter on his excellently conceived
thought experiment regarding Rand's robot.  I'd also like to say "Damn
you for stealing my thunder!"  <grin>  

I've been working on this essay on-and-off for more than a month now and
finally finished it just recently.  Planning all along to post it to the
list, I decided I better take a couple days to catch up on reading the
posts of others before I threw mine in.  I was glad to see the suicide
thread continue - which my essay ties into nicely; ditto for the
"morality of smoking" debate.  Then I couldn't help but laugh out loud
when I saw Ross Levatter's thought experiment which hit on exactly the
startlingly original (I thought) heart of my essay.  Oh well, here it is
anyway.  At least I know there is one person on the list who should
agree with me!

By the way, for anyone interested, I'll be presenting the material of
this essay in one of the "participant sponsored sessions" at the IOS
conference in Boulder.  I'd appreciate an opportunity to get your
feedback, criticisms, etc. in person there - as well as put faces with
some of the interesting personalities I've met on this list.

________________________________________

	I'm a huge fan of Objectivist metaphysics and epistemology - it
was these that opened my eyes to the possibility of actually discovering
important truths by studying philosophy.  I am a big fan of the ethics,
too, which show people they should proudly put themselves as their own
highest value.  However, as I will show, Ayn Rand's fundamental
assertion that "an organism's *life* is it's standard of value"
(emphasis mine), and therefore man's proper basis for morality and
ethics needs to be replaced with the idea that an organism's *happiness*
is it's standard of value.  Ultimately, I agree with her that an
individual should act in accordance with the demands of life, but not
because that is an end in itself - rather, because it is a *means* to
achieve the ultimate value, the true end-in-itself, happiness.  Without
happiness, biological life becomes mechanistic and valueless and even
the most perfectly rational animal will find no reason to pursue it.

	In this essay, I first hope to establish that, although
metaphysically and biologically it is the alternative of life/death that
resulted in consciousness, volition and the capacity for
happiness/unhappiness in humans, it is the happiness/unhappiness
alternative - however created - that gives rise to all our values.
After unseating life from the pinnacle of our values, I'll reintroduce a
more broadly defined form of life which I call "genetic life" - but now
as a close second to happiness in the hierarchy of values.  From there,
I'll briefly trace the Objectivist reasoning with happiness replacing
life.  Finally, I'll show how some difficult problems Objectivism has
had, go away when you place happiness in it's rightful spot and put
genetic life as the ultimate value serving happiness.  (Although I will
leave happiness as self-evident for the purpose of this essay, if a
definition and description of "happiness" is desired to better
understand what is replacing "life" here as the ultimate value, I would
direct the reader to Ted Keer's essay, "Happiness: Passionate Serenity",
at http://eden-backend.rutgers.edu/~kiaer/essays.html as the best effort
I've seen to date.)


	In The Virtue of Selfishness, Rand says "To challenge the basic
premise of . . . ethics, one must begin by asking: What are values?  Why
does man need them?". (VOS, p16)  Since this is, indeed, the challenge I
am making, I will follow her instruction.  For the first question, I
accept Rand's answer, and I hope to correct her answer to the second
question.  In answer to the first question, Rand says:

	"Value" is that which one acts to gain or keep.
	The concept "value" is not a primary; it presupposes 
	an answer to the question: of value to *whom* and for 
	*what*?  It presupposes an entity capable of acting to 
	achieve a goal in the face of an alternative.  Where no 
	alternative exists, no goals and no values are possible.

The alternative she then focuses on is that of life or death.  Her
answer to the question "Why does man need values?" is: to stay alive.
For any living organism, "the ultimate value . . . is the organism's
*life*." (VOS, p17 - emphasis Rand's)  
	To make her point "fully clear", she asks us to "imagine an
immortal, indestructible robot", and claims "such an entity would not be
able to have any values". (VOS, p16)  Notice that Rand did not choose a
hypothetical indestructible *organism* but rather an indestructible
*robot*.  The significance of this distinction is that the word "robot",
and indeed her description of this entity, make clear that she is asking
us to imagine an entity which, in addition to being immortal, is also
unfeeling (i.e. incapable of happiness or unhappiness).  Thus, we have a
contrast between Rand's immortal *and* unfeeling entity, and the mortal,
feeling entities whose source of values we are trying to determine.

	But which of these two alternatives, life/death (mortality) or
happiness/unhappiness (feeling) is truly the one that gives rise to
values?  Or do values perhaps require both?  To sort this out we need
two new hypothetical entities, each with one of these alternatives, but
not the other.  One entity would be immortal and feeling - call this
entity "IF".  The other would be mortal and unfeeling - call it "MU".
If we can demonstrate that one of these entities has a source of values
(and thus a means for decision making, a way to judge right and wrong
for itself, etc.), and the other does not, then we have identified the
alternative that is the true source of values for humans.  If neither
stands on its own then it must be the combination that is required.
	First, consider MU:  Being mortal implies that certain actions
are required for MU to maintain life, but nothing about life feels good
to MU and nothing about death feels bad.  MU is left with no way to
"prefer" life and so has nothing driving any decision.  All MU can do is
decide by whim whether it will try to live or not - perhaps by flipping
a coin - and then act accordingly.  Or maybe considering that
alternative would never seem very important to it and instead it would
employ it's volition deciding some other randomly selected alternative -
again by flipping a coin since it won't care either way.  But then, it
might occur to MU that deciding and acting isn't really all it's cracked
up to be, at which point it might just sit down (or not) and stare
blankly at the moss beginning to grow on it's shady side.
     Now consider IF: Although there is no way for its existence to end,
IF does indeed care that painful things do not happen to it and that
pleasurable things do.  If it felt pain from heat, it would have every
bit as much impetus to remove it's hand (if it had one) from a hot stove
as you or I would.  Also, if it felt a deep satisfaction from developing
relationships with other entities, the fact that it doesn't need them to
survive would not stop it from deriving as much joy from such
relationships as it could.  If it got the kind of pleasure from sex that
humans do, it would definitely spend a lot of time at that.  Of course
it might also just do heroin constantly - except that simply not dying
probably does *not* make that form of pleasure workable over the long
haul.
     Clearly, only IF has a way to judge what is right and wrong for it;
MU does not.  This means it is, indeed, the alternative of
happiness/unhappiness, the ability to feel, to care, to give a rip, that
drives the need and the use for morality, not the alternative of life or
death.  Which in turn means happiness, not life, is the ultimate value,
the end-in-itself toward which every action of an organism is properly
directed.  Interestingly, it seems that Rand herself at times saw that
happiness was actually the ultimate value.  For example, as part of
Galt's speech in Atlas Shrugged, she writes: "Life is the reward of
virtue, and happiness is the goal and reward of life."  (AS, p.939)
This is a pretty clear statement of the relation between life and
happiness, with happiness being the end-in-itself, with no further
explanation necessary - or possible.


Of course, the fact that all the capacity for pleasure and pain in
humans developed because it furthered "life" in some way means that the
requirements of "life" is a pretty good estimate of what is likely to
make us happy.  Consequently, I place "life" second only to happiness in
the hierarchy of values.  However, this "life" - the evolution of which
resulted in our happiness/unhappiness mechanisms - is not the life of an
individual organism, which Rand talked about as being its highest value.
It is now a broader form, call it "genetic life", that spans individual
lives and of which an individual life is only a part.  Maybe we can
think of it this way: since genetic life needs us as individuals to make
decisions in it's favor, it has created an incentive program for the
volitional individuals which make it up - to make it in *our* interest
to act in *its* interest.  The better we understand genetic life and its
requirements, the more likely we are to find pursuing it helpful in
achieving our ultimate goal - happiness.
	In this essay, I will stop short of defining precisely what this
"genetic life" is, the pursuit of which will best serve the happiness of
an individual.  It may be the genetic code contained in that
individual's cells, it may be the gene-pool of it's interbreeding group
or it's species, or it may be as broad as all life.  I personally expect
to find that it is a hierarchy of some sort, where genetic codes more
similar to our own are valued more than, but not to the exclusion of,
codes more distant.  We care about our own children, but we also care
about the children of others, animals other than humans and maybe even
insects or plants to a lesser degree.  However, it is the job of
science, not philosophy, to define and describe this genetic life that
is the ultimate source of our happiness.  Philosophy gets us to
"happiness" as our ultimate goal, but it is the scientific study of
evolution that has to take it from there.  In fact, if it turned out
evolution was wrong and we were created by some super-entity (to pick a
contending theory still quite popular today), philosophy would still get
us to happiness as our ultimate value, but the study of that
super-entity and what it had in mind for us to do would rightly replace
the study of evolution as the key to determining how we should live.


	So what impact do these changes have on Objectivist philosophy?
I'll follow Rand's reasoning briefly, now with happiness as the ultimate
value, to examine this.  Rand argues that "it is only an ultimate goal,
an *end in itself* that makes the existence of values possible." (VOS,
pp17-18)  Values, in Rand's formulation, are "that which one acts to
gain and/or keep" (VOS, p16) in pursuit of that ultimate goal.  Thus,
they now become those things which, objectively evaluated, further the
organism's happiness, rather than it's life.  By "objectively
evaluated", I mean that it is not arbitrary what makes people happy,
that our potential for happiness was created in some particular way, and
with some specific nature which is not a matter of our choice.  Physical
pain and pleasure mechanisms are the most easily perceived instance of
this, but I would contend that the love a parent feels for their child
is equally beyond our choice.  This is not to say that it is impossible
for someone to not care about their children, only that it is as
unnatural as enjoying physical pain.  Morality Rand defines as "a code
of values accepted by choice" (AS p932, OPAR p214), but it now starts
not with the choice to live as she would contend, but with the choice to
be happy.  Virtue is still "the act by which one gains and/or keeps [a
value]", (VOS, p27) and I see nothing to contradict her primary virtue
of rationality and six derivative virtues of independence, integrity,
honesty, justice, productiveness and pride.  I like David Kelly's
addition of benevolence to the Objectivist virtues as well.  However,
I've always liked the virtues of my Christian upbringing (what they call
the fruits of the spirit) of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control, too, and I hope to
find that there is reason to give some of these better standing than
they have without the notion of "genetic life" as a rational value for
individuals.


Sticky problems that Objectivism has - solved!

	Many of us find that we really DO care about others who are not
likely to impact our survival, or even our flourishing.  Now we can see
that perhaps their life can be important to our happiness independent of
it's importance to our life simply because it is in the interest of the
genetic life of which we are a part.  Therefore the well-being of others
could become anchored as an objective source of happiness for us.  Note
that I do not claim to have done that anchoring here, only offered the
possibility of how it might be done in the future.

	Sometimes in Objectivist reasoning, happiness is considered
impossible except according to objective values and sometimes it is
considered that our emotions (including happiness) are completely
determined by what we value through reason (i.e. we are born tabula rasa
- including our emotions).  An example of the first take on happiness
from Atlas Shrugged is: "Happiness is possible only to a rational man"
(p939).  An example of the second from OPAR is: "Emotions are automatic
consequences of a mind's past conclusions" (p 161).  The first implies
that living according to irrational conclusions will make one unhappy,
the second implies that living according to one's incorrect past
conclusions could make one just as happy until they ultimately resulted
in death.  With "genetic life" defining and refining our nature, what
results in our greatest happiness is ultimately beyond our control - but
it turns out that a big *part* of what, according to our nature, makes
us happy is living according to our rational convictions.

	With this new formulation, there is no need to explain that when
we say "life" we don't just mean survival, but we mean "flourishing",
"life man qua man" or "life as a complete person".  Happiness covers all
of this.  (Don't worry, we can keep the "man qua man" formulation if we
really think it sounds cool. <grin>)
 
	Now there is no need to explain the many things we do that are
difficult indeed to tie to our survival.  If they make us happy, that is
explanation enough - although it may behoove us to examine the
evolutionary origins and long-term consequences of these sources of
happiness to be sure following them will not lead to diminished
happiness in the future.  Our eating habits are a prime example of this.
In our evolutionary past there was no such thing as being "too fat" -
there just wasn't enough food around.  (Have you ever seen a truly
rotund wild animal of any kind?)  So we developed a natural tendency to
stuff our face with as much fat, sugar, etc. as came within arms reach.
But now, with food as cheap and easily available as it is, many of us
find that our nature misleads us.  We have to resist the temptation of
that second or third luscious <insert the name of your particular
fatty-food weakness here> in order to preserve our health and our long
term happiness.

	The moral evaluation of suicide is handled rather well with
happiness first.  In Objectivist thinking, the choice to live precedes
morality, but now it is the choice to be happy which precedes it.  If
you decide not to value happiness, then you truly have no way to judge
what you should do in any situation - including suicide.  If you decide
that happiness is what matters to you, then you can evaluate any action,
including suicide.  The choice to end your life becomes rational and
right if living an unhappy life is truly the only alternative.  For
example, you might find suicide the right thing to do if, after numerous
happy decades of life, you find the only life you have left is
semi-conscious and/or filled with pain and expensive care - eating up
the money you had socked away for you grandchildren's education, say.
More often, however, in the case of people considering suicide, there is
still more happiness than unhappiness possible for them, and seeking
help in finding that happiness is the right choice rather than suicide.


	So what does all this buy you?  What good does it do us to
understand it?  For me, the key realization is that if my life is *not*
my highest value, there are things out there that I should value more
than my own life.  Think about that.  There are values for you greater
than your own life.  Since values are those things which further the
ultimate goal of happiness, that means there should be ways for you to
be happier than you would be if you saved your own life (e.g. if you
were cured of cancer).  It also means there are things out there for
which you would be truly and rationally happy to give your life.  If I
was going to give people one clue as to how to achieve true happiness it
would be this - "Find something you would die for, and live for that".
If you can't see how that is possible, or doubt that it is, let me offer
one suggestion: children.  Have your own or borrow someone elses, raise
them, teach them, and see if you don't come to love them more than you
love your own life.  All of our capacity for happiness was created
through evolution, and the cornerstone of evolution is adults raising
successful children.  Based on that understanding of our nature, and on
what I've heard parents say, I believe that children (and maybe not only
our own) are a prime candidate to become a greater value for you than
your own life.  Of course, this may not apply for everyone, and there
may be many other such values for you depending on your particular
talents, opportunities, vision, etc.  But to paraphrase Dr. Martin
Luther King: "If you've never found anything you would die for, then
you've never really lived".

	Having philosophized for pages now, there is one thing I would
like to acknowledge in closing.  That is, that while philosophy may be
able to determine that you should be seeking your own happiness, and
science may be able to shed light on what is likely to make you happy;
reason is not your only tool in the pursuit of happiness.  Developing a
sensitivity to what in life is truly making you happy right now,
learning what makes others happy and trying it for yourself, trusting
what has made people happy for generations, acting on an inspiration
before you know exactly why, etc. are all part of the process as well.
No amount of thinking can replace *all* of what millennia of evolution
have given us - but I believe it truly can put a proper foundation under
what all the experimentation yields and cement it together into a
unified whole.  And ultimately, no matter how you get there, living
truly happy is all that really matters.

	Nathaniel Branded said recently "you are bigger than
Objectivism" to a standing ovation from his IOS audience.  In the same
spirit, I would like to say "you are bigger than life" - but I'll
understand if you don't stand and applaud.  : )

This is an interesting theory, however, I have heard that it has been disputed
because the conditions which we perceive to be optimal for our kind of life are
supposedly not the optimal ones for the creation of black holes....in which
case, we are either a low probability darwinian dead end of a universe, or the
theory is bunk..

 IAN: The net difference between a and b is: 

          (a - b)  +  (b - a) = 0

 Zero mechanics might be properly defined as 
 a subset of holism, as, for example, even if 
 the difference between all the numbers in the 
 matrix didn't sum to 0, each attribute of each 
 identity is still derived by relation from
 identities external to given identity A:


                0  1  2  3
               ____________
            0 | 0  1  2  3 |
              |            |
            1 |-1  0  1  2 |
              |            |
            2 |-2 -1  0  1 |
              |            |
            3 |-3 -2 -1  0 |
              --------------

    ( The ID matrix finds all identity 
      attributes of the numbers along 
      the top as derived by the relations
      of those numbers to themselves, 
      listed again along the left side. 

    All identity attributes of 3 are listed
    below the 3 on the top. For example, 3 
    is 3 relative to 0, 3 is 2 relative to 
    1, and 3 is 0 relative to 3. As we can
    see, 3 requires all things not-3 for 3
    to have any attribute of identity; and
    therefore A requires not-A for A to be
    whatever it is as much as A requires A. )


 Or it may follow that if any + attribute was 
 not paired with a -, that then we have a free
 attributes, an attribute NOT derived by relation,
 and therefore "zero mechanics" = "holism" by 100%.

 In the matrix, each identity generates a pair
 or pairs of identity attributes across the whole,
 and no attribute is derived free from relation.
 1 is 1 relative to 0, and all n follow that form.

<< > Religion is trying to help humans in their
 lives, but not forcing them to believe >>

Since when?  Every major religion on this planet has as a core tenet some
variation on the theme that if you are not "of them" you will suffer some
horrific consequence and instructs its followers to go out and "save" those
who are non-believers.  Missionaries have as one of their main goals the
conversion of "infidels" into believers.  Religions and the practioners
thereof have routinely and consistently attempted to control the behaviour of
all peoples, not just those who are its follwers.

While it is certainly true that for some people religion, with its customs,
rituals, and tradition, brings stability, comfort, and peace of mind, all to
often they insist that I and all others embrace their need and their belief
system.  

It has been said on this list that it is only fanatics who act in this manner,
yet I can offer you an easy experiment to demonstrate otherwise.  Wear a t-
shirt out some weekend with a religious message printed on it..Jesus Saves or
some such.  You will rarely if at all be remarked upon.  Go out the next
weekend wearing a t-shirt with an anti-religious statement on it.  Observe the
difference in the behaviour of those around you.  I don't think you'll like
the comments you will receive.

For those who think that my life is an empty meaningless shell with out some
god(s) to worship I can only say that it simply isn't so.  I have neither the
time nor the desire to attempt to "prove" this to you.  All I ask of
religionists is to leave me alone and stop using thier beliefs to legislate my
life.  If you think none do, then you haven't read the papers lately.  (Sen.
Nickles statement that Mr. Hormel is unfit to represent the US as an
Ambassador because, and only because, he is a homosexual. That ought to scare
the bejabbers out of anyone with half a mind.)

Title
  Lignans interfering with 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone binding to human sex
  hormone-binding globulin.
Source
  Journal of Natural Products.  61(1):119-21, 1998 Jan.
Abstract
  The natural lignans (-)-3,4-divanillyltetrahydrofuran (1), (-)-matairesinol
  (2), (-)-secoisolariciresinol (3), (+/-)-enterolactone (4),
  (+/-)-enterodiol (5), and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) (6) reduce the
  binding of 3H-labeled 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to human sex
  hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). (-)-3,4-Divanillyltetrahydrofuran (1) has
  the highest binding affinity (Ka = 3.2 +/- 1.7 x 10(6)M-1) of all lignans
  investigated so far; the reversibility of its binding and a double reciprocal
  plot suggest a competitive inhibition of the SHBG-DHT interaction. Increasing
  hydrophobity in the aliphatic part of the lignans
  (butane-1,4-diol-butanolide-tetrahydrofuran structures) leads to higher
  binding affinity. In the aromatic part, a 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy substitution
  pattern is most effective for binding to SHBG.

  Additional note by poster:

     Given the above there exists a theoretical possibility that regular
  flax consumption could slow the progress of male pattern baldness.

This sounds as if god has, for whatever reason, taken a "neutral" stand on the
issue. Leaving it to us humans to sink or swim, so to speak.  The flaw i see
in this is tha this "neutral" god allows his chosen spokespeople to tolerate
evil, even to promote it and even, in some cases, to engage in it!  I'm
supposed to believe in a religion whose leaders are corrupt?  A religion whose
followers frequently demonstrate their displeasure with a persons flaws by
killing that person?  A religion that says a person is evil or "ungodly"
because of a biological difference, weather that difference be a matter of
skin color, sexuality, or whatever other perceived offense?  

Such ideas are repulsive to me.  If it sounds as if I have an attitude against
such, that is because I do.  I can't abide the hypocrisy and hatred generated
by these "Institutions of Love"  

Sorry if this post seems a bit vehement.   Must be the ornery Scotsman in
me..:-)

The problem with this argument is that the only people it confounds are those
without any knowledge of theology whatsoever.  From a fundamentalist point of
view, evil exists only because we created it and choose to let it exist.   The
Fall (eating of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil) happened because
God created us as beings of free will.  Adam and Eve's act of disobedience God
is why evil exists.  God can, of course, overcome evil, and in the
fundamentalist view, eventually will thru the Rapture and the  overthrowing of
the Beast. Then Pat Robertson & Jerry Falwell will rule the earth (shudder).

 In a less fundamentalist view, the Eden story is seen as allegorical, free
will exists in us because if it did not, we would simply be extension of God
rather than independent creatures (and what would be the point in creating us
if that's so?) and evil will cease to exist once mankind rids himself of it.
One might say that God can defeat evil, and we just happen to be his tool for
doing so.  From my point of view, Transhumanist thought is a giant step in
that direction.

So even in the unlikely possibility that there is something more fundamental

Information on the other hand we understand, in fact it's the only thing we 
can understand.

Only in pure mathematics is experiment unnecessary, and that is most 
certainly the study of information about information. When the recursion of 
the information about information idea gets very high such as in physics or 
even higher in biology or sociology things are far too complicated to figure 
out from  first principles and experiment is essential.

Er, close.  He writes it out a lot:

What would be the point in creating us, period?  What need has an omnipotent
being   for a purposely flawed being?  This god person created people with
freewill and also with the ability and capacity for acts of nearly
unimaginable cruelty.  For what possible reason? One experiments when one does
not know what the result will be.  This god is omniscient. He has no need to
experiment, no doubt as to what will happen.  Yet he creates these beings and
sets them spinning anyway?  

This seems to me a rather depressing idea.  I prefer to believe in myself. In
my own ability, imagination, adaptability.  Rather than sit around wondering
what the "purpose" is to existence, i prefer to live it.  To discover the
answers and the questions for myself.  If the price to be paid for the
supposed comfort offered by a "better life in the hereafter" is the fear and
ignorance demanded by the religionists, i'll pass.   

Heinlein once had a character remark that "one can bask in the warmth of
religion, or stand in the cold light of reason."  I'll take the cold light.
It may not always comfort, but its dangers can be met and overcome.  And it
beats the daylights out of groveling around on my knees begging for some aloof
being to be nice to me.

Be well, Cori

You blame God, who may or may not be there, for the act of a man who admits he

Evil exists whether or not free will exists.  Free will allows us to make the
choice, for ourselves, between the two.  Some people, for whatever reason,
will choose differently from others.  What you want might not be the same
thing.   Is it therefore evil?  Jerry Falwell says yes.  In any case, the only
people who don't believe in free will are the Calvinists and the Astrology
nuts.  A good chunk of the remainder believes that man is essentially good at
heart.  Admittedly, not many of them happen to be Southern Baptists, but the
point is that evil has absolutely nothing to do with the basis of free will.
It exists as a choice.  God cannot force that us to choose Good, because to do
so would destroy that which makes us seperate from God.

Let's say God has his own personal version of the Heisenberg Uncertainty
principle.  He cannot reach down and make us any different from what we are
because to do so would destroy that which makes us seperate from him.
Besides, who the hell would want that?  Whether or not we succeed or fail is
so far entirely up to us.  Whats the point of attaining a goal if you cannot
do it on your own?  The only people who want God to "help us achieve this
freedom now" are the fundamentalists with the bumper stickers that say  "In
case of Rapture, this car will be unmanned".  I would spit in the eye of such
a God.

Once again, you're blaming God for what man says and does.  Just because Oral
Roberts claims that he speaks for God doesn't mean you judge God by what he
says.  Of course, the people that believe him deserve whatever is coming to
them

If God is Good, then things that  make "more evil, hate, and despair"  don't
come from him.  They come from us, because we happen to be imperfect beings at
the moment.  If we are striving to better ourselves, thru Transhumanist
thought, or Christianity or Wicca or Chess, then we will becfome less
imperfect, which will supposedly lead to a general condition of more "good".
I kind of doubt it, but I'll admit the possibility is there.

If you eliminate evil, how do you judge what good is?

Well hold on now.  The issue was whether we could reconcile the idea of God
with the presence of evil and not end up with the conclusion that we should
not try to overcome evil ourselves.  It simply has nothing to do with the
particulars of any specific religion.

What we're dealing with here though is a very, very basic question: Is

And I'm not sure that it would be correct to characterize pure mathematics as
the study of information about information.  Numbers need not necessarily
inform us of anything but themselves.  Pure mathematics can be applied in the
study of information of course.  But once we do that we're no longer studying
pure mathematics but in the realm of applying mathematics.

Title
  Dietary flaxseed supplementation and experimental metastasis
  of melanoma cells in mice.
Source
  Cancer Letters.  124(2):181-6, 1998 Feb 27.
Abstract
  The present study investigated the effect of dietary supplementation of
  flaxseed, the richest source of lignans, on experimental
  metastasis of B16BL6 murine melanoma cells in C57BL/6 mice. Mice were fed a
  basal diet or the basal diet supplemented with 2.5, 5 or 10%
  flaxseed for 2 weeks before and after the intravenous
  injection of 0.75 x 10(5) melanoma cells. At necropsy, the number of tumors
  that developed in the lungs was counted, the cross-sectional area of tumors
  was measured and the volumes of tumors were calculated. The median number of
  tumors in mice fed the 2.5, 5 and 10% flaxseed-supplemented
  diets was 32, 54 and 63% lower than that of the controls, respectively. The
  addition of flaxseed to the diet also caused a
  dose-dependent decrease in the tumor cross-sectional area and the tumor
  volume. These results provide the first experimental evidence that
  flaxseed reduces metastasis and inhibits the growth of the
  metastatic secondary tumors in animals. It is concluded that
  flaxseed may be a useful nutritional adjuvant to prevent
  metastasis in cancer patients.

    This is the 22'nd update on my fly longevity experiments. The flies I
 used in the nineth run were quite old and decrepit before I ever started
 the run. Instead of flying, these "flies" mostly just walked slowly when
 aroused. Using older pre-aged flies is a good idea during the winter when
 low temperatures slow fly aging and prolong my runs to over 2 months.
 However during the summer old flies can die too fast, as witness the
 results with Hawthorn 4X. This increased lifespan in the eighth run, but
 this time around the flies died so fast they never had a chance to be
 exposed to this supplement. The poor result with Hawthorn 8X, I attribute
 to toxicity attendant to overdosing. I will have to redo the Hawthorn 4X
 dosage sometime to confirm its effect.
   Of the supplements tested on this run only the low dosage of Orris root
 looks mildly interesting. It exceeded the survival of both control
 bottles at all time points.
   In the meantime I will push on and test other supplements with my
 milk-bottles-on-a-card-table experiments. Thus far of the over than 100
 different supplements I have tested, I have as yet come across no big
 winners that dramatically extend fly lifespan. One always lives in hope.

Yes, it seems to have slipped off to the same misty land where
Kaluza-Klein theory, spin lattices and other theories currently not in
favor but not ruled out live.

By the way, I found a text about M-theory, the successor of
superstring theory ("A Layman's Guide to M-Theory" by M.J. Duff,
hep-th/9805177, can be found at the preprint server at lanl). Seems to
be quite fun, and has potential for a lot of truly wild things
(gauge-topology duality, lots of unusual manifolds, "black membranes",
etc) that could one day become playthings for posthumans.

Me too. In many ways IA is the key to transhumanity. 

However, I'm also quite fond of the idea of creating new
intelligences. Why? Because I want to promote maximum diversity, and
AI could probably become much more diverse than homo sapiens derived
entities (and if we add in various forms of human-AI symbiosis the
diversity becomes even greater).

As was pointed out in the other ethics thread, ethics is what you
should do. The genie machine has a built in ethics of serve and
protect humans. But if it doesn't ponder the ethics, it would not be
able to apply it well. What if I ask it to make me a weapon to kill
anybody who disagrees with me? What it should do is to deduce that
answering "No way!" is the best way of serve and protect humans,
including its owner (me) because if I got the weapon and used it, a
lot of others would likely attack me with equally nasty weapons. That
is a fairly clear-cut case, but what if the ethical problem becomes
more tricky? It needs to deduce extensions of its ethics, or it will
be inefficient or dangerous.

(This reminds me of the "zeroth law of robotics" some of Asimov's
robots came up with, although the logical reasoning behind it remains
unclear to me).

I'm not sure, but it is close. I seem to recall that "weak" AI is
systems that can do a lot of apparently intelligent stuff, but aren't
really intelligent. Strong AI claims that it is possible to build
truly intelligent systems. Maybe a better term would be Asimov AI - AI
with built in servitor programming.

Oh, thank you for lifting this terrible weight from my shoulders. I have

I have not the slightest idea what you mean with 'meaning'. Perhaps it 
would be instrumental to define that term first. Discussion is then a
bit difficult, you see.
 
Now excuse me, I have to find a priest asap. My last results were
a bit ambiguous, perhaps he can help.

I believe they're still making new episodes, now called +/- 'The New

Thanks Sean I'll keep my eye's open, but as we've already discussed
and you pointed out above, scientific reasoning predates
christianity. Just one example, Aritosthanes, the head of the great
library of Alexandria, computed the circumference of the earth
within 5% in 399 B.C.. I could easily make the case the the Muslims
did far more to promote scientific reasoning. (i.e. Algebra is a
muslim word.) I remember one instance from the James Burke series
"The Day the Universe Changed", he was talking how the christian
forces had "liberated" a library in Cordova Spain, it contained
400,000 volumes, more than in all of France, and was one of 72
libraries in town. The transfer of these books after the fall of
Moorish Spain is what ignited the Renaissance.

In the above paragraph you are judging one answer,
"the right action is that which maximises extropy
over all other possible actions" by another,
Utilitarianism. Clearly this is not logical.

But you're judging Egoism by Utilitarianism, which
does not seem to be a rational way of finding the
correct answer. You cannot say one answer is wrong
because it is not equal to another answer when you
do not know the other answer to be correct.

I'm not sure this is obviously rational, I fail to

But doesn't Utilitarianism promote self-sacrifice?
If your death saves lives (or just makes others
happy), then your death is a good thing.

Thanks for the detailed reply,

	No! NO!  This view so many rationalists and extropians and
people like you take is so infuriating to me.  To me this is such a
lie and so many extropians and others are just playing into the
religious fundamentalist's hands by regurgitating it.

	Just stop and think about it for a moment with open rational
eyes.  It's very simple really, if you honestly try, with the mind of
a child that hasn't yet been polluted.  Is it really true that the
"warmth of religion" is worth "basking in"?  Is the "light of reason"
really so cold?  I say absolutely not and ask how we could all be so
easily deluded into thinking something so clearly backwards.  Just the
opposite is what is really true.

	Look out at the natural heavens some clear night and reflect
back on the progress we've made during the last billion years.
Consider the slope at the point of the growth curve we have finally
arrived at (which is at least exponential and possibly asymptotic) and
then project this same rate of progress into the future and dream
about just a few of the things we are about (in another 1000 or even
10,000 years) to be able to do.  "Cold reason" is obviously telling us
that this heavenly natural future is infinitely better than any
unnatural, ethereal neither world any religion has told us we must die
(and leave our descendents) to get to!  Any heaven any religion has
ever described to me would be pure hell!  Having faith that any such
thing exists isn't faith, but giving up in despair that there isn't
anything better.  "Fearing God" isn't basking in any warmth and it
certainly isn't "comfortable"!

	Take one simple example (of infinitely many) religious
teaching like "Christ died that we might live".  Examine such an idea
thoroughly with open and innocent childlike eyes.  Here we have some
kind of immortal deity that can't die claiming to have made "the
ultimate sacrifice" that we might live.  The definition of this dieing
and sacrificing by the immortal is merely returning to his father in
heaven and escaping from this still sick imperfect world full of still
imperfect sinning mortals ofter only temporarily healing a few.  The
definition of our "that we might live" is our dieing or leaving all of
our loved ones on earth and never again being able to help or interact
with anyone left ever again.  What a twisted lying crock!  You don't
die to get to heaven!  You Live!  Our minds are so polluted and
twisted with so much blatant irrationality!  It is our mortal
ancestors that lived their short lives that we might live better and
longer ones!  They are the ones that lived to gave us everything we
have including our lives.  Soon, because of what our ancestors have
given us and by our living, we will be able to give to our children
immortal lives.  We are the ones doing the work, making real
sacrifices, and creating heaven for our children!  And the heaven we
are creating will eventually be a naturally real heaven unimaginably
better than all the contradictory, incomprehensible, neither world
heavens ever described and claimed by the many religions which are
really all hells at best.

	If you honestly think about it, even in the "cold light of
reason" there can be the possibility or hope of a resurrection.  How
can any truly rational person deny the possibility that after another
billion years of the continued progress which we have seen so far,
that our children will not eventually evolve to be true Gods that
finally discover some way to resurrect all people that have ever
lived?  A way for them to eliminate all evil including repaying the
debt they owe to our ancestors for creating them, as immortal Gods,
and giving them this glorious true natural and real heaven?

	One could go on forever showing how unnatural religious "after
life" neither worlds are really hell and how this living universe is
the most beautiful and naturally glorious place anything could
possibly be.  Don't support the lying God fearing unreliable religions
fundamentalists and spout the irrational twisted lies they've planted
in your minds!  Look out at the reliable and understandable stars and
realize that this is the true and best possible heaven!  That there is
so much more that we can have faith in and hope and strive for!  Don't
give up in hopeless despair and accept that this is the best an all
powerful being could do!  Let's get busy and show how easy it is to
overcome all evil and prove the faithless, theodicizing, fearful,
justifying, backwards, fundamentalist completely wrong!  Let's show
them what faith and hope really are, open our eyes and see what heaven
might really be, and never give or accept anything less until we get
there!

	Well, anyway, that's my opinion! ;)

		Brent Allsop

P.S. Could anyone give me a reference to where one of Heinlein's
     characters makes this remark?

    While I grant that this true for the majority of western religions, 
it is not true for all western religions, nor does it apply to most of 
the eastern religious/philosophical disciplines. Of the Western 
religions, one of the oldest is Paganism, which has as a fundamental 
principle that "believers" cannot impress their beliefs on others 
without being directly asked. Like most of the eastern belief systems, 
Paganism considers it incorrect to interfere with another's life path 
without permission. The exception to this rule being actions taken to 
protect an innocent.

    While this has the ring of validity to it, most situational 
responses to an individual's attire are more of an Ameobic response than 
a reasoned one. (5% think, 5% think they think, and 90% wouldn't think 
if you tied them up and tried to force them to). Most individuals, 
(extropians definitely excluded) are Xenophobic, and react to anything 
outside of their perceived "normality" with hostility. If you think 
wearing an anti-religious T-shirt will cause you to be shunned by the 
majority of knee-jerk society, try dying your skin a deep lush purple 
and going out for a night on the town. It's not religion or the lack 
thereof that these people are seeking to destroy, it's nonconformity.

I should explain:  this answer is not wrong simply because it disagrees
with utilitarianism.  If that were the case, I would have no defense:
utilitarianism could be declared wrong by the same argument.  (Though, if
utilitarianism is right, as I think it may be, then this argument would be
valid.)

However, I assert that most extropians would not agree with the
extreme ethical rule I described in my last post because it would require
actions which most extropians *already* consider wrong.  Since we know
that most extropians do not believe killing, stealing and suicide to be a
good idea, we may use this to show that most extropians do not support a
strong consequentialist version of extropianism.  I did not attempt to
show that they were right or wrong here; I was simply observing that they
do not support that particular moral rule.

You left off the second half of that paragraph, which was my *actual*
response to egoism.  I believe I said something like this: the fact that
egoists will hurt others to benefit themselves is not logically
inconsistent, but it is not consistently generalizible: if everyone were
egoistic, we would actually be worse off.  On some level, in order to be
egoistic, we must reject egoism.  THIS is my real critique, which was more
or less the underpinning of Kant's argument: the correct answer to the
problem of ethics ought to work just as well (if not better!) when
everyone is acting ethically as when very few people are.

> I'm not sure this is obviously rational, I fail to
> see why saving lives is a rational act.

Saving lives is not, in itself, rational; unless you get great pleasure
from doing so.  Saving your OWN life, however, is.  This is fine for the
simple egoist; the simple egoist would steal to save his own life without
a second thought.  The objectivist/libertarian, however, will do anything
to save her own life *except* steal, which leaves her in a bad place under
situations of sufficient urgency.

I argue that objectivism is wrong because it requires one to perform
irrational actions in order to do the right thing, which is contrary to
our earlier presumption that the right action is the rational one.  With
this alone, we could not reject simple egoism; if we add generalization to
this rule, however, egoism fails the test, leaving us, IMO, with
utilitarianism. 

> But doesn't Utilitarianism promote self-sacrifice?
> If your death saves lives (or just makes others
> happy), then your death is a good thing.

Possibly.  However, I believe that people greatly exaggerate the number of
situations in which one might reasonably give one's life to save others;
there is usually a better option which doesn't involve suicide.  At the
same time, I will not say that there are never situations under which it
would be good (at least according to utilitarianism) to give one's life to
save others.  The only justificaiton I can give for this is, again, the
generalization principle: if no one would ever give any of their happiness
or risk their lives to save others, we would actually be more likely to
die/suffer unhappiness as a result; we must reject this policy in order to
pursue it.

Meanwhile, both of the other two answers require us to give our lives
under sufficently extreme circumstances.  Even simple egoism may require
us to commit suicide if we will experience more pain than pleasure in the
remainder of our lives (though this is arguable).  Utilitarianism provides
an answer which, IMO, agrees with both the generalization princple as well
as the conditions of rationality; that it requires suicide under extreme
conditions is not a sufficient counter: suicide may indeed BE rational
under very extreme circumstances.

You may choose to reject the generalization principle; if so, simple
egoism seems the most rational to me.  However, if we DO accept the
generalization principle, I think that we must accept utilitarianism.

Forbes recently had an article concerning Ray Kurzweil (of Kurzweil Applied Intelligence fame) and speech recognition. The remarkable aspect of the article was a chart that outlined Kurzweil's own opinion of the future of computing power. Kurzweil even alludes to a Singularity-type event.

Relevant excerpts:

"Kurzweil's long-term impact, however, is much greater than just speech recognition. His belief in the exponential growth of technology gives voice to humanity's possibilities. He is a visionary whose predictions are based on hard science. [Doug note: Last I checked, Grove's Law runs into a problem called "physics" around 2012 or so. Kurzweil does not offer any insight into how this problem might be overcome - though parallel processing might work. ] There is no way the march of technology will stop, he says. It will continue to increase exponentially until it 'ultimately creates itself'."

"The future according to Kurzweil: Computing Power:

200 mips reached in 1998: Speech recognition achieved [Doug note: Didn't Univ. of Tokyo's GRAPE-4 exceed 1,000 mips already?]
200,000 mips reached in 2007: Phones automatically translate different languages and paraplegics have computer-powered walking machines.
3.2 million mips reached in 2010: Supercomputers have the computing power of the human brain.
20 million mips reached in 2020: PCs [Doug note: Do we really think we'll be calling them "PCs" at this point?] have the computing capacity of the human brain.
200 trillion mips reached in 2029: Human intelligence is reverse engineered. Machines claim to be human."

When I used this expression first, I just thought of the ability of taking

english isn`t very good, so it`s quite hard for me finding the right words
and constructions.

Well it`s hard to give an example to someone who is not really open to the
theme. Religion (not every religion, in fact most may not)  can help you
understanding better the parts of the world which are already explained by
science.

I wouldn`t call Smullyan a mystic, but ok, if you do so, for you I`m
probably a mystic too.
Smullyan wrote many interesting and fascinating books and texts, so try
reading!

I`d call something like that a religion. It seems the main thing you connect
with religion is lying, and the famous religions like christianity. I
connected the word religion with things which can`t be explained by science.

By information you usually mean a sequence of bits, ie a string of 1s and
0s. A bit is an abstract thing, and must be encoded somewhere, eg on a
magnetic tape. Information does not provide meaning until you interpret it.
(It is possible for the same piece of information to provide multiple
interpretations, and can thus mean different things to different observers.)

So maybe one should regard the interpretation as more fundamental that the
information. I like that because it gives you a more process oriented view
(its not as platonic). But then, given the right interpretation, an
interpretation itself can be interpreted as information. And we're kind of
back were we started...

Yes, I recall a formula like H(X) = -SUM ( p_i log p_i ) as a measure of
both information and entropy. What I meant by simple minded was that it's a
very quantitative measure. Meaning on the other hand is very qualitative. I
have a 2G disk drive full of apps, but that figure doesn't tell me what I
can do with those apps.

For that I need something better, perhaps the application version number.
Isn't there a omega point theorem that says: when the amount of information
and processing power goes to infinite, so does the version number of Excel.

While I understand that these religions may not "force" you to believe they
are right, they nevertheless still believe that if you do not, then you will
not be (pick one: saved, enlightened, etc..)

<< 		Brent Allsop
 
 P.S. Could anyone give me a reference to where one of Heinlein's
      characters makes this remark? >>

Sure... it is the character "Kettle Belly" Baldwin in the book Friday.  He is
speaking to her ( Friday), about maturity and the need for rational thought.
The point of the passage, and of my post, is that rationality does not offer
the degree of freedom from responsibility that can be achieved by religion.
What I mean is that in a religion one can always put the "blame" for
unhappiness or disaster or misfortune off on god, or the devil, or whatever
other bugaboos are part of that religion.   An atheist hasn't that scapegoat
available.  We have to shoulder the responsibility ourselves.  

Brent, I'm not sure if you understood what I meant by my post.  I don't
believe in any such thing as heaven or hell.  when I spoke of the "warmth of
religion" I was responding to another members post concerning the comfort
sought after by many religionists.  

For myself, I think that I do hold much of that childlike wonder you speak of.
I am often amazed and delighted by the world I live in and the wonders it
shows me daily.  The prospect of living for long enough to really explore it
fills me with excitement and helps me approach the day with a bright outlook. 

Don't read too much into the expression "cold light of reason".  I simply mean
rational thought and study, without the need for some mystical explaination or
being.  
It seems that so many people spend their time and energy trying to discover "
what it's all for".  I don't need to ask, I already know..:-)  But that is my
own opinion and it isn't one that i expect anyone else to give a hoot about.
I wouldn't dream of trying to convince anyone else that my reason is, or
should be, theirs.  
I really don't think you and I see things all that differently.  I do think
you have a greater degree of tolerance, or maybe understanding, of
religionists points of view than I have.  

At any rate, I appreciate your responses and your thoughts on the subject.  
Be well, Cori

Actually, it is rational to save others' lives if it improves the
chances that you will be saved in a dangerous situation. There is a
very interesting article in Nature June 11 about how cooperation
emerges if individuals have an image dependent on their behavior. It
turns out that it is rational to save even complete strangers you will
never meet again if you will become known as a nice guy:

   abstract = {Darwinian evolution has to provide an explanation for
cooperative behaviour. Theories of cooperation are based on kin
selection (dependent on genetic relatedness), group selection and
reciprocal altruism. The idea of reciprocal altruism usually involves
direct reciprocity: repeated encounters between the same individuals
allow for the return of an altruistic act by the recipient. Here we
present a new theoretical framework, which is based on indirect
reciprocity and does not require the same two individuals ever to meet
again. Individual selection can nevertheless favour cooperative
strategies directed towards recipients that have helped others in the
past. Cooperation pays because it confers the image of a valuable
community member to the cooperating individual. We present computer
simulations and analytic models that specify the conditions required
for evolutionary stability of indirect reciprocity. We show that the
probability of knowing the 'image' of the recipient must exceed the
cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act. We propose that the
emergence of indirect reciprocity was a decisive step for the
evolution of human societies.}  }

Andrew, I should have included a paragraph tying this together with that
reconciliation theme.   

I can't reconcile god with evil because i simply can't buy the argument that
god is standing aside, neutral.  Observing.  Letting us make it or not.  For
one simple reason.  There is no such thing as being neutral in such a
situation.  It is, say, Charles Mansons, choice to commit evil. Fine.  What
about his victims?. Where did their choice go? Or the victims of horrible
diseases, accidents and the like. These may not be things you consider evil,
but I certainly consider any god that would sit by and permit such,  to be
evil, ruthless, and sadistic.  

Since I observe such evils to exist, I can only come to one of two
conclusions; either god does not exist, or he is one cruel bastard.   It
honestly seems to me that most attempts to reconcile the two result in a
grasping at straws, at best.  
Sure, we can come up with a theory to explain just about anything. Finding one
or three or a dozen that allow for god to exist and for him to allow evil to
exist isn't that hard.  But they strike me as lame attempts to hold on to a
superstition and fearful outlook on the world and the universe.  

Thanks for your comments..be well, Cori

The curves I've seen make 2020 look like the ultimate limit, for reasons 
of both size and heat dissipation. Various means for circumventing the 
obvious physical limits may exist though.

I would be interested to hear what people think about the possibility of 
extending the reign of Moore's law beyond 2020, when we hit atomic-sized 
components, dissipating kT Joules per operation, assuming it continues on 
its merry path for the next 20 years.

What are the possibilities for increasing computer power beyond that point?

I think the dissipation problem can be dealt with using reversible
logic, there is already a fairly large literature on the subject.

As for size, it seems like we need a jump to nuclear densities
("femtotech") to go beyond nanotechnology. That might be a real limit
since nuclear matter is so unstable at our energy/density scale: 
We don't have anything like Drexler's proofs of concept for femtotech.

<<These may not be things you consider evil,
but I certainly consider any god that would sit by and permit such,  to be

Any God that prevents such actions only ensures that his creations exist in
the "My Little Pony" universe or something similar.  You insist that you be
free to tread your own path, yet you castigate a God, who, by letting everyone
else do so as well, allows evil into the universe. If he's going to let you
live as you see fit, then he's going to have to do the same thing with
everyone else.  Or do you, like the Rev. Robertson, insist that whatever God
does to "other people" is just fine, and what they deserve?  He wants God is
going to iwipe out Orlando with a hurricane, you want God to limit my freedom
of action so that he can fit into your definition of what is acceptable.

Face it, all this talk of not beleiving in a God who allows "horrible
diseases, accidents and the like."  is so much sophomoric posturing that
allows you to live in a solipsistic universe where only your actions have
meaning or impact.  Everything that doesn't fit into your world view or your
morals is dismissed, allowing you to feel quite superior to a God whom you
assure yourself doesn't exist anyway. The nice thing about the "light of
reason" is that if you truly adhere to it, is that you can NEVER assure
yourself that anything is impossible.  Anytime you do so you've exchange the
"cold light of reason" for the warm, blissful confines of ignorance.

	Yes.  This is great.  But for me, I must be sure I include the
idea that along with this responsibility or really ability, comes the
possibility that we can make the real natural heaven any way we want
it and not settle with what someone else tells us it must be.  For
some irrational reason, in our religious society, everyone tends to
take the idea that there is no God as we are all there is and we can't
expect any more than what we can do now.  But as I said, this is so
backwards.  The atheist view is the much more optimistic view for we
can hope that a bit more effort (a mere few more thousand years worth)
is all that is required to eliminate evil.  I think that in our
current religious society, we should clearly point this out and not
allow and especially never encourage such twisted misunderstandings.

> I really don't think you and I see things all that differently.  

	Yes, definitely.

		Thanks again,

I originally filtered this meme as a keeper.  After reading your reply
and re-filtering, I realized I originally registered "cold light of
reason" sarcastically.  That is, I knew full well it is really warmer
than can be imagined.  Now, realizing this meme would not propagate
through most minds the same way - I agree, it should be trashed.  I am
now more aware that most memes should be filtered by running a
simulation of how they propagate through most minds rather than just
my own.  Thanks for increasing my awareness.

The gods are the descendants of our ancestors.  They may not exist in
our space-time but thay may exist in our space or time.  Your view on
resurrection above does not mix well with the principle of dynamic
optimism.  All we have to do is sit back and have faith.  But
enlightened faith is infinitely better than blind faith.  I think
every time you have used this word it has refered to the former.  But
isnt enlightened faith close to being an oxymoron?  As extropians
treading the head waters at the deep end of the meme pool, having
completed our defiant adaptive walk through the rugged memetic fitness
landscape (sorry, couldn't help mixing metaphors within the same
sentence) we now sit high on a peak of local maxima.  But we see the
horizon beyond the fitness deserts all around us and we know the
engine of spontaneous order will deliver us to that higher peak.  Does
this mean we have faith in reaching that peak, or just an understanding
via forethought of its inevitable existence?

A month or two ago, I tried to start a thread called "PIP-tech" that
applied the principle of dynamic optimism to the idea of future
resurrection.  I was hoping to spark an idea in some of the space-time
engineering types on this list but to no avail.  I'm sorry I do not
have the inclination to develop the idea further.

I think that is unlikely.  The reversible architectures I am aware of have 
higher fundamental error rates than existing irreversible architectures, 
and will likely require considerable error correction.

Error correction, in turn, involves the dissipation of heat, by 
elementary thermodynamic arguments.  Essentially, error correction is a 
procedure for lowering the entropy of a physical system (the computer).  
The entropic cost is paid in heat dissipated into the environment. 

Maybe I'm wrong, though, and there exist good architectures for reversible
computation with a low error rate. Does anybody know of one?

Attempting to develop such a proof of concept would be quite a challenge!

	To me, you are making a critically mistaken assumption here.
You are assuming that most of the evil is caused by people "treading
their own path".  To me this is completely false.  If some homicidal
maniac is killing people right and left it is clear that something is
wrong.  I have faith that such a person isn't merely "treading his own
path."  To me, these perpetrators of sin and madness are the ones that
suffer the most, at least as much as any would be victims.  These are
the ones towards which God is really, as Cori so eloquently put it,
"one cruel bastard".

	And most of the suffering death and dieing isn't at the hand
of other humans.  Have you visited a hospital lately and seen all the
miraculous curing from the hideous "acts of God" (i.e. disasters,
disease, aging...) that goes on?  But then, maybe you think stuff like
AIDS isn't an "act of god" but something people just plain deserve
because of their particular chosen "path to tread"?

	My point is, if there is a God, someone must take the blame
for all the evil.  You seem to want to place the blaim on us and
insist that it is all required if we are to be allowed to "tread our
own path".  I'm sorry, but dying a slow miserable and painful death is
not my chosen path to tread, and I don't know anyone for whom it
really is!  So please show me, God, how I may tread a different, less
sinful path, because this is what I (and I believe everyone) really
want.

It doesn't take a science wiz to answer this question.   Anyone in business or
with any human relations experience knows people by nature are imitative and
recompensive.   You screw someone over, they screw you back.   You give them
something, they feel obliged to give you that.   And people feel obliged to
act on behalf of others when the acts aren't performed (the group and mob
mentality.)  Social pressure reinforces this.

>From a purely utilitarian standpoint, the more people's who's butts you save,
the more people who would owe your butt into a saving, or atleast a free
drink.   Of course, not everyone will pay you back, so the more "social
brownie points" you get, the higher the odds of pay back.

Case :   A person's life is in danger.   Saving that person requires a slight
but controllable risk.     - - Let's say the person is your best friend vs. a
guy in a klan suit.   Won't your feelings towards that person effect your
likelihood of jumping in.   If people perceive you to be a selfish and
unsympathetic character, they're less likely to protect you or look out for
you.   People with lot's of enemies or no friends place their lives in grave
danger.

To take the hedonistic perspective, "Well, only if its fun," assumes that the
value of the pleasure itself is more valuable than your mortality.    To say,
"Well, I don't have a moral responsibility, but its in my own self interest,"
takes a more practical look at the "economics of self preservation,"
ultimately, what comes around goes around.

Also, let's just say, it is foolish to help other people.    - - And, you're a
cryonicist.   You probably don't want to expouse this philosophy too much.
Why should a cryonics org look out to preserve you after you've gone ???
Suppose its no fun and it would be better to pocket the money ?

hence, the philosophy works two ways...   one, if its true, people who live by
it improve their odds of survival.    Two, even if its not, people who expouse
it, improve their odds of survival by surrounding themselves with people with
a sense of debt.

The only possibility of living a purely self objective hedonistic lifestyle,
is to lock oneself in a harm proof vault.   But by sheltering oneself from
human beings, the aim of hedonism, pleasure can't be obtained... hence :  it's
self defeating.

Incidently, rationality must be defined according to the ends, not a universal
truth (unless one believes in God).     Likewise, ethics are the means, and
should be judged in the long terms, by whether they lead to the ends.

Nearsightedness is dangerous in the world of flesh and blood !   We're not
superhuman yet !

Lots of tag words.  God, evil, meaning, good...responsibible...heaven,

You hear yammering about relegious freedom?  In reality they want freedom to
persecute others while not being persecuted themselves.  The history of
relegion is rife with bloodshed...one relegious group against others.

In the past I've heard the phrase..."Freedom OF relegion..but not freedom FROM
relegion'...referring to the constitution or somthing.  Disgusting thought.  

In reality nature IS...and doesn't much give a hoot one way or another. We can
sit in our sand pile and paint our bellies blue and bow and scrape to made up
gods...or not.  If we make it fine...if not...well how many million species
are we aware of that went extinct?  Does nature   care? Of course not...the
very concept of "caring" and "nature" is an anthropomorphism....and incorrect.

	I think differently.  Look at all the billions of $$s we spend
on natural history museums and research and so on trying to bring back
as much of the extinct past as possible!  Surely in the future this
immense and powerful carring will be greatly amplified and empowered
and infinitely more successful.  We are, after all, part of nature,
and thereby, nature most definitely does care.  Nature has been
working ceaselessly for billions of years to get to this point where
we can finally start to really care.  Now that we finally do, we have
just gotten started.  As the old saying goes, you aint seen noth'n
yet!  Just give it a chance, realize that you are part of nature, and
help out a bit!

some physicists have theorized that the ultimate building block of matter is a
"string."  These  strings of energy (matter?) have different geometrical
configurations and vibrate. Ed Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study
(Princeton) is the world's  expert in superstring theory. There is even
something called a G-string!! No Kidding!!

Of course, how silly of me to have left this off.

An important point which I should have made earlier is how often and to
what degree egoism/libertarianism/utilitarianism agree: they agree quite a
lot in my experience, more than 80% of the time.

It is usually in one's best interests to save lives if you do not greatly
jeopardize your own; the point where it becomes unprofitable to do is
difficult to identify.  Nonetheless, even if we restrict the egoist to
only hurting people for profit if/when he could get away with it without
being discovered, we would still generally be worse off, IMO.

The point is simply that it is possible that such reasons could exist and
that, given a strong inclination to believe or actual belief in God, the
presence of evil does not provide a good reason to dispense with it because of
the possibility of these unknown reasons.  Can anyone say, "There IS a reason
for this, really.  I just don't know what."?  Of course.  But so what?  That
doesn't make the argument unsound.
 
<< 	Ah, the old perverted blame evil on free will theodicy.  Yeah,
 free will makes a great scapegoat for God right!??  First off, placing
 the blame on free will (free will in this view must be bad or
 malevolent since it is the cause of evil), to me, is far worse than
 thinking that God is actually malevolent or the cause of evil.  To me,
 free will is something good and glorious and when perfectly achieved
 by all will finally eliminate all evil.  Since evil is, by definition,
 that which we don't want.>>

Oh?  I think that there are moments when I've desired something that I would
otherwise think to be evil, e.g. the immediate and violent death of the driver
in front of me.  So I reject your definition of evil as rendered.  The fact
that evil isn't simply "what we don't want" undercuts the rest of your
argument.

<< ... 	And finally, the biggest reason this free will theodicy is so
 perverse is because of the hate and intolerance that must go along
 with it.  Some people freely choose good.  We are to love these
 people.  Some people freely choose evil.  We are to hate and be
 intolerant of these people (rather than try to be sympathetic of why
 the particular evil choices might have been made and having a hope
 that we might help).  >>

The above simply has nothing to do with the issue at hand.  Hate and
intolerance do not necessarily go along with the free will defense.  But if
the unspoken religion you're criticizing here is Christianity, then I should
say that most Christian churches do preach and encourage unconditional love,
regardless of the individual's crimes.  And, whether or not that is the
unspoken religion you're speaking of, it does not follow, necessarily, from
the fact that a person has chosen evil that a person ought to be hated.  There
are numerous moral systems, compatible with theism, that argue against such a
principle.

 << 	To me, free will is not malevolent and is exactly compatible
 with the non existence of evil.  As long as there is evil, no one is
 yet truly free.  I will eternally have faith that such perfection is
 possible and will eternally strive for such with unconditional love
 for all.>>

It's a beautiful picture of free will, and a breathtaking painting of the
future, but I'm just not sure that it's accurate.  Still, I have to admit that
it's quite appealing.

 
<< 	OK!  My God is the Devil.  Whatever evil he commands should be
 done.  Anyone that deviates from all such absolute decrees will burn
 in hell for eternity!  This is such a lame and devilish reason!  Good
 is good and bad is bad.  Anything that is Good is Godly and anything
 that is Bad is devilish.  That is the only possible way to know the
 difference.  If this is not true, then there is nothing rational at
 all and no way to know the difference.>>

Not at all.  I probably just wasn't clear.  If God is the source of all
ethical law, then what he decrees as good simply will be good, and to talk of
him decreeing evil as good is simply nonsensical.  And if he is the source and
generator of such law, then it seems plausible that such laws are not
applicable to him.  I'm not a big fan of the idea of "divine-command theory
ethics" either though.

Yep.

 	So, then, you think it is OK to hate devils and all their
 worshipers, as long as we can still have faith in our God!?  This is
 only one of many many reasons why I just can't see how anyone can make
 such points.  Thinking like this just makes more evil, hate, and
 despair.  If we have true faith that all might be possible one way or
 another we need not accept any of this evil and despair.>>

I think that you're assuming that any form of theism must be some particularly
pernicious form of fundamentalist Christianity.  That simply isn't the case
though; there are lots of different types of theisms.  And not all of them
involve hate or devils, but an ethic of unconditional love and eventual
paradise, or fulfillment, that you yourself seem to hold to, or strive for.
 
<< 	Yes, I can see your point.  But accepting any such evil, for
 whatever justification, is the lessor theory.  The theory that a way
 can be found to eliminate all such evil is the greater theory.>>

I simply disagree.  Suppose that we found very good, very persuasive reasons
why we should allow for evil.  And then suppose someone came along with
another theory, which provided a way to eliminate all such evil but in a way
that violated those very good reasons that are vital to the first theory.  I
think that the first theory would to be preferred in such a case.  Therefore
the theory that finds a way to eliminate all evil is not necessarily to be
preferred to a theory which allows for some evil.
An example would be the comparison of a theory that eliminates evil by, in one
great and last evil act, eliminating all life and all possibility of future
life against a theory that prescribes certain restraints on actions against
evil, because such actions would themselves be evil, but that by prescribing
such restraints also allows for the continued existence of evil.

<< I always hope that there might be some way
 or another found to eliminate all evil and will eternally seek after
 such!>>


;) May God be with you on your quest then.

Seriously now, that's a very noble pursuit and hope, and, in the end, the best
attitude to take towards evil I think.  Good luck!

Much of the time, yes.  However, I still maintain that even if egoists
would only hurt people when they could do so and get away with it, the
world would be a much worse place to live if everybody did this.

All this shows is that the egoist must be careful.  However, a world full

Sometimes it comes around, and when it does utilitarianism and egoism
agree.  However, are we prepared to say that it's ok to hurt people so
long as nobody finds out, or if your reputation is not besmirched in the
process?  If I save a few lives in public and rape a few women in secret,
is this the right way to live?

Better to sign a contract with your clients, mandating that if you decide
to pocket the money instead, big men with pointed sticks will come and
drag you through the Sahara.  In that case, it would be foolish NOT to
fulfill the terms of your contract; this is arguably why contracts exist
in the first place.

I agree.

I disagree.  I think that there has to be information to be gained via
interpretation.  In other words, there must be information before there can be
any interpretation, but there cannot be interpretation without information (no

But it's that other 20% that has all the fun and controversy.  What if you can
screw people without their finding out about it?  What if you're vastly more
powerful than they are?  I.e., you're a Power.  Or more currently
realistically, you're a member of a well definable group such that you're
confident other members won't prey on you and you all are collective strong
enough to prey upon others.  Such as Europeans invading the Americas, or Bantu
farmers driving out hunter-gatherers, or the repeated Indo-Europeans invasions
of Europe, from the Celts to the Goths, or the Draka.  Egoism and
utilitarianism agree a lot better when the other egos have about as much power
as your ego to begin with.

EV, there were actually two such series. The one you are referring to
was published in the '50s and '60s. That was "Tom Swift, Jr." The earlier
series was published in the '20s and 30s' (?). That was "Tom Swift". In the
earlier series, Tom and friends built amazing stuff in the garage, mostly.
In the later series, Tom Swift Jr. built stuff mostly in the labs at his father's
(yes Jr is Tom's son) Hi tech megacorporation.

In each case, the series were simple-minded adventure science
fiction geared toward kids. I loved the second series and read all
I could get my hands on. I ended up reading As many of the older
series as I could also. I loeved them, too.

My kids now read "Animorphs", which seems to be today's kid-oriented
science fiction series. The science themes are more modern, but the
science is less rigorous.

allsop@swttools.fc.hp.com (Brent Allsop) rearranged the electrons to say:

<<	To me, you are making a critically mistaken assumption here.
You are assuming that most of the evil is caused by people "treading
their own path".  To me this is completely false.  If some homicidal
maniac is killing people right and left it is clear that something is
wrong.  I have faith that such a person isn't merely "treading his own
path."  To me, these perpetrators of sin and madness are the ones that
suffer the most, at least as much as any would be victims.  These are
the ones towards which God is really, as Cori so eloquently put it,
"one cruel bastard".>>

People who have free will make thier own decisions.  Thus they tread their own
path.  These decisions are not neccesarily well informed, well reasoned, or
even understood, by the vast majority of humanity.  Therefore a great deal of
them cause pain, suffering, and "evil."  People with good intentions and
incorrect data make decisions that have unexpected consequences.  Shit
happens.  Were they better educated, better fed, more loved they would likely
make better decisions.  You seem to think that because God doesn't force them
to a better path, he's "one cruel bastard."  I submit to you that God(should
he/she/it exist) does have a tool with which to better the lives of these poor
suffering sods.  Us. 

There's an old joke about a Man who is trapped on the roof of his home during
a flood. A boat comes by and offers to pick him up & he says "No thanks, God
will save me."  A helicopter drops a line, and he says  "No thanks, God will
save me."   So anyway, he drowns.  When he appears up in heaven he looks at
the Lord & says.  "I had faith in you Lord, how could you let me down?"  And
God says  "What are you talking about? I sent a boat & a helicopter!"  So
before you start blaming God for all the evil created by people, maybe you
should ask yourself exactly how much have you done to reduce the amount of
evil present in the world.

<<	And most of the suffering death and dieing isn't at the hand
of other humans.  Have you visited a hospital lately and seen all the
miraculous curing from the hideous "acts of God" (i.e. disasters,
disease, aging...) that goes on?  But then, maybe you think stuff like
AIDS isn't an "act of god" but something people just plain deserve
because of their particular chosen "path to tread"?>>

Better be careful there, that was dangerously close to an insult for someone
who just disagrees with you.  Once again, if you want a life where nothing bad
ever happens, you're welcome to apply for a position in the My Little Pony
universe.  Crap happens because the universe is essentially an uncaring place.
Diseases evolve thru the same process that evolved us,  hurricanes happen
because the earth rotates arouynd the sun.  Airplanes crash thru human or
mechanical error.  No matter what we do, the universe will always be a
dangerous place to exist.  Even after I wake up from my cryonic vault, I won't
expect to live forever.  Forever is too damn long, so the odd's are just
against it.  In short, the same processes that allow us to evolve and to exist
are the same processes that imperil us everyday.  You seem to want to ask God
to change the rules now that we are old enough to understand how to play the
game, just as a cranky three year old whines when daddy won't "let them win."

<<	My point is, if there is a God, someone must take the blame
for all the evil.  You seem to want to place the blaim on us and
insist that it is all required if we are to be allowed to "tread our
own path".  I'm sorry, but dying a slow miserable and painful death is
not my chosen path to tread, and I don't know anyone for whom it
really is!  So please show me, God, how I may tread a different, less
sinful path, because this is what I (and I believe everyone) really
want.>>

Evil is as natural a condition of the world as disease.  We should struggle to
overcome it as much as we struggle to overcome AIDS.  I don't hear most
rational people asking God to eradicate disease.  What I expect is that thru
hypothesis and experimentation, we will learn to eradicte AIDS on our own,
without supernatural help. We have take the responsibilty for curing diseases
without blaming ourselves for thier existence. I expect we should be able to
do the same for evil, by educating the ignorant, curing the sociopaths, and
illuminating the actions of those who would keep them hidden, either by way of
Brin's Transparent Society or Halperin's Truth Machine.  You're already on the
path.

There is another  issue which one must also consider when attempting to
specify "fundamentality"; it must be taken in context.  For example, there
are different meanings of 'fundamental' - one being constituitive, while
another is 'relationship' based (one before the other .... if you know what
I mean).  Finally, there is the fundamentality of what 'things' *are* - which
is basically unanswerable.

For example, what *is* matter, what *is* energy, and what *is*
information?  I don't think any of these can be decomposed into anything
else more 'fundamental' - they simply are.  However, the fundametal
*particles* of matter may be electrons, quarks etc. Information does not,
instrinsically, have a 'fundamental' unit, though one has been defined as
the 'bit', while for energy the same can be said (I think ....), but with
various units defined and accepted.

Felix made a good observation RE: the qualitative vs the quantitative
natures of information.  I can't say too much about this, except that I think
'meaning' or perhaps another word is more appropriate when speaking
about the qualitative aspects of information.

As an aside, Einstein has already shown the equivalence between
energy and matter, while Michael Nielsen's comment regarding error
correction for reversible architectures (he describes error correction as
a procedure for lowering the entropy of a physical system, which
consequently results in heat ie. energy being dissipated into the
environment) is an example that shows there are strong connections
between 'energy' and 'information'.  (Another exampe, the entropy of a
physical system is calculated in terms of energy in joules or calories,
while the entropy in information theory is in terms of bits).

I don't think we are really discussing 'intelligence' here. Intelligence
for limited problem domains already exists in machine-chess-playing
systems, expert systems, and many lower animals.

We're discussing the more nebulous aspects of human-like consciousness: 
free-will, imagination, adaptability, creativity, initiative... And
emotions do play a vital role in those.

Obedient servants we already have. That's not what we need. Unless they
have some capabilities to come up with original ideas and creations, they
won't be any big step up.

sanctioned a hideously cruel process like Evolution did not  deserve worship.  
He said he was very disturbed at the reproductive behavior of a species of
wasp that he discovered as a young man. The wasp stings a spider enough to 
paralyze it but not enough to kill it, then it laid its eggs on the poor

Darwin's best friend and vigorous defender Thomas Huxley in his essay  
"Evolution and Ethics"  wrote that morality was objective, but could be found  
by looking in the exact opposite direction from the dog eat dog would of  
nature. I wouldn't go as far as Huxley, but I don't think random mutation and 
natural selection has a morality,  at least not a morality I want to follow, 
and if I ever meet you in a dark alley I hope you don't either.

If an omnipotent and good God does not exist then yes, it's the only way.

I think your English is fine and I think it's impossible to understand  
ourselves very well so we're never sure exactly what we're going to do until 
we actually do it, we're always able to surprise ourselves. I think we  
sometimes have the ability to do what we want and never have the ability to 
do what we don't want. As for what we want, that's due either to cause and 
effect or it's not. If it is then it's deterministic if it's not then it's 
random, and if that's what you mean by "freedom of spirit" then I believe 
in it.

I've read all of Smullyan's books except for his books on chess.

I read a lot but Godel Escher Bach is the best book I ever read, his other

In a message dated 98-06-25 17:15:04 EDT, you write:

<< Any God that prevents such actions only ensures that his creations exist in
 the "My Little Pony" universe or something similar.  You insist that you be
 free to tread your own path, yet you castigate a God, who, by letting
everyone
 else do so as well, allows evil into the universe. If he's going to let you
 live as you see fit, then he's going to have to do the same thing with
 everyone else.  Or do you, like the Rev. Robertson, insist that whatever God
 does to "other people" is just fine, and what they deserve?  He wants God is
 going to iwipe out Orlando with a hurricane, you want God to limit my freedom
 of action so that he can fit into your definition of what is acceptable.
 
 Face it, all this talk of not beleiving in a God who allows "horrible
 diseases, accidents and the like."  is so much sophomoric posturing that
 allows you to live in a solipsistic universe where only your actions have
 meaning or impact.  Everything that doesn't fit into your world view or your
 morals is dismissed, allowing you to feel quite superior to a God whom you
 assure yourself doesn't exist anyway. The nice thing about the "light of
 reason" is that if you truly adhere to it, is that you can NEVER assure
 yourself that anything is impossible.  Anytime you do so you've exchange the
 "cold light of reason" for the warm, blissful confines of ignorance. >>

Noticed your admonishment regarding insulting someone who simply disagreed
with you...Wondered about it in light of this post.

Anyway.  You seem to have attributed a great many traits to me after having
read that post.  I'm not at all sure of how to disabuse you of them.  I don't
feel "superior to god ". I don't think any such being exists to feel superior
to.  I don't want god to fix everything just for me.  But could you please
explain to me what function AIDS, or tuberculosis, or take your pick,, have in
perpetuating free will?  Why does it have to be all or nothing? You claim that
I seem to want a perfect world.  I never said any such thing. I simply
wondered, in the context of the thread regarding reconciliation of an
omnipotent/ominbenevolent god with the existence of evil.  I equated the
existence of such things as disease with a seeming willingness on the part of
this god to create hardship for no apparent reason.  Is cancer somehow a
neccesary penalty to suffer for the gift of freewill?  I can't believe any
such thing.  

To simplify:

1) I don't believe that this god being exists.

2) If such a being exists, the evidence available to me suggests that
he/she/it is at best uncaring and at worst remarkably cruel.  In either case I
don't care to have anything to do with he/she/it

3) As you pointed out, one must keep an open mind, but, others on this list
have pointed out that it must not be so open that ones brains fall out.  You
stated that a rational thinker must admit that anything is possible. True as
far as it goes.  This thinker must also attempt to assign some degree of
probability to these possibilities.  Speaking only for myself, I find the
probability of the existence of a omnibenevolent god to be faint to say the
least.  

I don't want to drag this out forever as can always be the case in any
discussion involving god(s) and religion.  Judging by your post, I feel that I
must have offended you in some way.  This was not my intention.  Rather I was
responding to a particular thread and voicing an opinion.  Nothing more.

best, Cori

Well actually as far as i remember, a weak superintelligence is just as
intelligent as a human. Only it is greatly overclocked. It doesn't work
smarter just faster.

But maybe im mixing my AI's and my superintelligences here?

Massive parallelism, "configurable computing", superconductors, reversable
computing.

The only new item in this list is "configurable computing." This is the
most recent buzz phrase making the rounds of the chip designers. The idea
is to make on-the-fly changes to the programs of the progammable logic that
make up a portin of the computer, either to alter the instruction set or to
alter the interconnectivity of various computing elements.

Strictly speaking, Moore's law was originally stated in terms of memory density,
but it's used as a proxy for transistor density, which in turn drives
computing complexity and speed. My list of workarounds is actually for computing power,
not memory density. For memory density, just use nanotech to store one bit
per hundred atoms or so, in three dimensions. This keeps Moore's law of memory
density going to about 2030, I think.

Altavista +rishon +quark finds:
  http://mist.npl.washington.edu/AV/altvw80.html

This is a really neat "Alternate view" column from Analog,
which gives a really good and easily-readable overview of
quark substructure theories. It includes rishons, and it
retells the "turtes all the way down" Dyson story, and it
discusses particles whose constituents are heavier than the
particles themselves.

It definitely appears to be true in at least some cases.

For one thing, the more I learn about the kosher laws, the culture and 
technology surrounding their formulation, and various health and economic 
aspects of the situation, the more sense they make.

One specific example: the prohibition on eating pork.  If you can't eat pork, pigs 
are vermin to be exterminated.  There is a health aspect here, that they didn't 
have the technology to reliably thoroughly cook pork, and their general 
sanitation was not up to modern industrial standards either, so trichinosis 
would probably be a serious problem.  But there is also an economic factor: 
essentially anything a pig can eat, a human can eat, and the human will get 
energy from it more efficiently if it isn't filtered through a pig first.

Another example: the draining of blood from slaughtered animals.  They didn't 
have refrigeration.  Blood goes bad *much* faster than meat does.

Recent AMD K6-2 delivers up to 1.3 GFlops, and a peak memory bandwidth 
of 0.8 GBytes/s. A 30 cm wafer in ~0.1 um technology made of evolvable
hardware is probably the end of the line for conventional
semiconductor photolitho. Similiarly, quantum dot cellular automata, 
especially 3d-integrated are the end of the line for integration
density in conventional molecular circuitry.

If quantum computation works in solid state at high qubit numbers and
is sufficiently all-purpose (speeding up ab initio and cracking crypto 
seem to be the more straightforward applications) we will have to reevaluate
the computation density anyway.

Whether we ever can harness anything beyond condensed phases for
computation purposes is open-ended.

Well, at least this makes sense; more so than the drivel you send  
me personally.

Of course, NASA itself being silent on this issue made it very easy  
for all sort of conspiracy theories being developed, and I  
certainly felt being hit hard with this export restriction thing.   
There's little doubt that quad-21264 motherboards exceed 2,000 MTOPs  
and that means that my next PC *will* have export restrictions.   
This is even independent of Beowulf stuff - although I have to use  
either PVM or MPI on it to benefit from the four processors - as g77  
doesn't do automatic parallellisation yet.

Well I would like to add to that, that it is possible by writing better
software alone to increase the computerpower by 10 to 100 times.

The word "information" is almost as tricky as the word "organic", that has
caused great flame wars between the chemistry literate and the environmental
people.

But information must exist somewhere, it must be encoded as patterns of
matter, energy or information. A pattern is meaningless without the
encoding/decoding, ie the interpretations. In this sense you may decompose
information into pattern + interpretation. (I believe Anders touched on this
previously.)

So information theory really supports calorie restriction?

                  The End of Privacy

                      Geoff Metcalf
          WorldNetDaily Exclusive Commentary

                       MONDAY
                    JUNE 22, 1998

  "The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for
  good men to do nothing." Edmund Burke said. What he
  didn't say was just what a persistent, consistent,
  stubborn s.o.b. evil can be.

There have been numerous attempts to introduce and mandate a national
identification card system. Freedom lovers have fought time and time again
to impede the progress of the controllers from eroding the Constitution and
Bill of Rights. However, it seems no sooner do we win a skirmish, that our
would-be masters attack again ... and again, and again, and again.

Like the proverbial bad penny, the national ID beast is back again ... with
a vengeance.

The U.S. Department of Transportation has published the proposed "Driver's
License/SSN/National Identification Document" guidelines. This draconian
disaster will compel all states to comply within the next two years. The
"Notice of Proposed Rule Making" establishes the "standard feature"
requirements for driver's license cards and other "identification"
documents. Those states which do not comply will discover their citizens
will not be allowed to participate in normal life-essential functions
subsequent to the Oct. 1, 2000 deadline. After the deadline, any licenses
which do not conform, will not be accepted by any federal agency for
identification.

In the wake of the "Administrative Procedures Act" federal agencies must
announce their intention to execute new rules, and they must provide an
opportunity for the general public to comment.

Under the provisions of the last assault on privacy, no later than Oct. 1,
2000, ALL state driver's licenses must be linked to the social security
number of the individual (yeah, I know they TOLD us the social security
number was ONLY to be used for tax collecting purposes ... so they lied).
State ID cards must also be linked to social security numbers, and (get
THIS) -- plans are to issue state identification cards to minors! You have a
problem with this? "Show me your papers!"

Thanks in part to the Dianne Feinstein cabal, each individual must submit
biometric identification which will be compiled in a national database. The
biometric component of choice currently is fingerprints, which is already in
effect in many states like California, but retinal scans and DNA prints are
also being considered.

Every driver's license or ID card will be required to include a magnetic
strip, imbedded computer chip which will contain the social security number
information. However, a visual display of the private social security number
on the face of the card (for all to see) is apparently preferred.

All Americans will be required to present this new federally approved ID
whenever you apply for job. Before being hired you will have to be checked
against the national database. Why? Supposedly to determine if you are a
potential terrorist (which could include membership in a patriot
organization, militia, or publisher or writer of any "anti-government"
newsletter, on line service, et al. Big Brother "needs" to identify if you
are a deadbeat dad, tax protester, or illegal alien (I guess so they can
grant you amnesty). You will also need your government approved ID to
travel. In fact, EVERY state must issue the federally approved ID.

In the wake of current court interpretations and "implied consent" statutes
written into most state driver's license laws, NO probable cause is required
for vehicle stops. In fact, under the new rules, you may be stopped any time
at the whim of the official to check the following:

* your person ... yes, you may be searched without a warrant.

* your blood, to search for use of alcohol, marijuana, cocaine,
   barbiturates, opiates, psychotropic drugs, or prescription
   drugs.

* your breath

* your insurance and registration. Here in California failure
   to prove either may result in seizure and sale of your
   private property by the state.

* your vehicle and its contents, both of which may be searched
   at any time without warrant.

Without the new and improved government ID you will not be able to seek
medical care. Medicare and other state services are already linked to the
social security number. This would be extended to all medical care, even if
you pay for it yourself. You will not be able to enroll your children in
school. Eventually all children will have their very own ID card and
national databases will maintain their vaccination records, behavioral
problems, and history of drug use, et cetera.

If you decide to flee your new draconian control beasts, you'll have a
problem. Passports will only be issued to those who already have the federal
approved ID card. No surprise firearms purchases are affected, Federal
databases will be linked to the national ID, and you won't be able to buy a
gun without the appropriate bits and bytes residing in a federal archive.

You will not be allowed to work without this new federally mandated mark.
State licensing will be extended to virtually everything, thereby making it
illegal to work without a license, and guess what? You can't get a license
to work without first presenting your federally approved national ID.
Banking? No federal ID, no banking, no check cashing, no loans.

This is NOT radical right-wing paranoia. Most of the elements of the new
proposed national ID system are already in place NOW. The next step is for
all information to be coordinated and completely accessible to any and all
bureaucrats for their arbitrary and capricious abuse.

The national ID card itself (which you will be required to carry) will have
a magnetic strip (or chip) which is imbedded in it. That means YOU (when you
have your mandated national ID card on your person) could be tracked
wherever you go. Privacy will be an anachronism.

Government is supposed to serve we the people. However, as George Washington
observed, "Government is not reason: It is not eloquence, it is Force, like
fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master."

I've quite enjoyed the eloquent elucidations offered on this thread.  I
wanted to humbly include my perspective regarding  the debate on free will.
IMHO, no one is really "waking down their own path".  It seems clear to me
that we are constrained and directed by countless influences, both genetic
and environmental. As difficult as it is for the western, individualistic
mind to accept, free will as we generally understand it is a myth.
Behaviorism (stimulus-response, rewards and punishments) is the most
empirically supported psychological theory we've generated.  We now embrace
the Cognitive-Behavioral theory because we accept that we are clearly not
born as blank slates (i.e. genetics does indeed account for a sizable
percentage of our behavior), and we accept that it is not that useful to
ignore cognitions and focus solely on observable behavior. The point being,
however, that a large portion of the theory of Behaviorism holds water
regardless of the fact that it eschews the notion of freedom of choice.  We
all utilize behavior modification techniques in an attempt to control the
actions of others (especially children and underlings) and we are often
successful in our manipulations. When we're not, it's probably because we
haven't properly analyzed the stimus-response complex.  Do those whose
behaviors are thus manipulated have free will?  I don't think I'd sign up
with Radical Behaviorists and declare there is no choice whatsoever.  But
our ability to exercise free will is probably far more attenuated than we
generally recognize.  Transhumanism/Extropiasm, it seems to me, is all about
utilizing technology to unconstrain ourselves and achieve greater freedom
from the delimiters that currently plague our species.

Eugene, unfortunately I was not the one who mentioned this, perhaps

"Extension of Drosophilia Lifespan by Overexpression of Human SOD1 in
Motorneurons"
Nature Genetics 19: 171-174 June 1988

Abstract:

   Reactive oxygen (RO) has been identified as an important effector in
ageing and lifespan determination. The specific cell types, however, in
which oxidative damage acts to limit lifespan of the whole organism have
not been explicitly identified. The association between mutations in the
gene encoding the oxygen radical metabolizing enzyme CuZn superoxide
dismutase (SOD1) and loss of motorneurons in the brain and spinal cord that
occurs in the life-shortening paralytic disease, Familial Amyotrophic
Lateral Sclerosis (FALS), suggests that chronic and unrepaired oxidative
damage occuring specifically in motor neurons could be a critical factor in
ageing. To test this hypothesis, we generated transgenetic Drosophilia
which express human SOD1 specifically in adult motorneurons. We show that
overexpression of a single gene, SOD1, in a single cell type, the
motorneuron, extends normal lifespan by up to 40% and rescues the lifespan
of a short-lived Sod null mutant. Elevated resistance to oxidative stress
suggests that the lifespan extension observed in these flies is due to
enhanced RO metabolism. These results show that SOD activity in
motorneurons is an important factor in ageing and lifespan determination in
Drosophilia.

But, in egoism wouldn't the correct question be,
"if *I* were an Egoist would *I* be better off?”
Again, it seems you are judging egoism by the
standards of utilitarianism.

What I'm failing to see is how generalisation can
be justified *without* utilitarianism. It is the
idea of fitting ethics to that which you already
believe, that I find irrational.

If generalisation is detrimental to the egoist,
then the egoist should insure that others do the
wrong thing. That does not seem logically
inconsistent. Wouldn't this make it the most
rational choice?

Would this apply to the immortalist? Surely you
can make no such assumption when faced with the
possibility of eternal life.

The problem is, I see no rational reason to accept
the generalisation principle.

Well, if you look up the definition of "beautiful" in a dictionary and learn 
it's something that has beauty you won't be much the wiser, but it's really 
irrelevant because in my original comments I never said anything about 
definitions. People rarely have definitions for the concepts they use every
day and rarely need them. Nearly all our knowledge, and all the really 
important stuff, comes to us by way of example not definition.

Yes, information about information, exactly correct, that's all we're ever 
looking for.

I think Astronomy is the parent of all Science, philosophers have been big on 
theory but notoriously poor at empirical science, Aristotle was a complete 
embarrassment as a scientist. And I still maintain we'll never discover 
anything more fundamental than information, you'll never prove that you and I
and the entire visible universe aren't just a software program running on a 
hyper computer somewhere. I'm not saying that's what's happening, I'm saying 
it could be and we'd never know. Besides, even a hyper computer can't operate 
without information.

If something informs us about anything then it can only be one thing, 
information.

appt keys, et al.  The magnetic strips can't be used to somehow follow your
movements.  But the author of the article seems more interested in propogating
a juvenile kind of paranoia than paying much attention to the benefits of such
a system or to the fact that the system really doesn't add any new powers to
the government but only makes the government more efficient.  In any immensely
large and complex society such as ours a standardized identification system
makes perfect sense.  And the presence of it simply has nothing to do with
government encroachment of anyone's rights.  It DOES have to do with making
the government more efficient.  The place to protect rights, however, is in
the courts and the legislatures, and NOT upon the assumption of governmental
inefficiency in enforcing its laws.

I agree that most of what we know as evil today will in the future be
eliminated through technological/educational/social change.  But to
try and create a complex system of separate interacting entities with
no evil appears to me to be impossible.  Where is your proof of
concept?  In game theoretic terms this means there are no defectors in
the population.  This is not an evolutionarily stable system.  At some
point a single defector could do a multitude of damage.  This is an
unacceptable weakness for an advanced system of separate interacting
entities.  Please do not give up in despair by imagining yourself to
be happy only in a world that cannot exist.  This is just as bad as
the Christian heaven.  The evil of the future is in a world more
beautiful than you or I can imagine.

<<Noticed your admonishment regarding insulting someone who simply disagreed
with you...Wondered about it in light of this post.>>

You're absolutely correct.  The post was done in a rush, and as such missed my
normal editing. I apologize.

<<Anyway.  You seem to have attributed a great many traits to me after having
read that post.  I'm not at all sure of how to disabuse you of them.  I don't
feel "superior to god ". I don't think any such being exists to feel superior
to.  I don't want god to fix everything just for me.  But could you please
explain to me what function AIDS, or tuberculosis, or take your pick,, have in
perpetuating free will?  Why does it have to be all or nothing? You claim that
I seem to want a perfect world.  I never said any such thing. I simply
wondered, in the context of the thread regarding reconciliation of an
omnipotent/ominbenevolent god with the existence of evil.  I equated the
existence of such things as disease with a seeming willingness on the part of
this god to create hardship for no apparent reason.  Is cancer somehow a
neccesary penalty to suffer for the gift of freewill?  I can't believe any
such thing.  >>

To simplify:

<<1) I don't believe that this god being exists.

2) If such a being exists, the evidence available to me suggests that
he/she/it is at best uncaring and at worst remarkably cruel.  In either case I
don't care to have anything to do with he/she/it.>>

I have no problem with the idea that god does not exist.  I have no evidence
either way.  I disagree with the idea that if such a being does exist, he must
be one cruel bastard because people suffer.  As I stated earlier, most of the
forces that imperil us, such as AIDS, are products of the same scientific laws
that allowed us to evolve into sapient beings in the first place, and to
create a civilization in the second.  To say that God  is either uncaring or
sadistic because people die in airplanes is to say that the creation of
airplanes is in itself an evil thing.  To say that God must be cruel because
people die of ebola is to disregard the fact that the same process that
produced ebola produced us.  On of the tenets of deism/theism is that god
created the natural laws of the universe, and stood back from there.  To
interfer with those laws once they had started running would be to destroy the
independence of that creation.  


Have a lovely day,

Oh yes they can. Credit card and debit card purchases directly access nationwide
financial databases. Authorities have the ability to put 'sniffers' on these
systems to track people by their purchase locations. This applies to hotels,
restaurants, etc. In fact,  my bank was able to track me down while I was on
vacation last month to notify me of an account problem. Its kind of odd to get a
phone call from your personal banker while having after dinner coffee......500
miles away from home.... I shiver at the thought that some government fascist
might track me down and drag me away merely by my participation in the economy.

Total BS. It makes to government more efficient at tracking people down, as well
as knowing everything about the people they are tracking down. The minute a
fascist/totalitarian party takes over, the mechanisms will be in place for them to
commit intercontinental genocide in a matter of hours.

Again, BS. As said by many great plitical philosophers and leaders in history:
"That government governs best which governs least." Hindering the government's
ability to be tempted by such powers are necessary. Giving such absolute power
over the individual's privacy to a priviledged few in the bureaucracy is the most
corrupting potential in government. Privacy should be controlled by the
individual, not by the government. Assuming that government will 'do the right
thing' with your personal information is assuming once too much.

No, you missed the point of that part of the article.  The author didn't mean
track as in note when and where you used your government ID card (since the
government would OF COURSE be aware of when and where you used it, presumably,
excluding the use of it for entrance into clubs or such) but meant that the
government could actually track your movements even when you didn't use it.

Unfortunately, ALL credit and debit cards CAN be used to track one's 
actions. Every time you use such a card, a central processor is 
updated with the transaction data. All that is needed is for a 
central governmental agency to require that all such databases be 
accessable from a central monitoring computer. This computer can be 
programmed to flag every transaction made on a card issued to a 
certain person. It is not really necessary to have a national ID card 
to have 'Big Brother' watching you.

I do not believe that the US government at present has such a 
capability, but these records are subpoenaed regularly during 
inverstigations, see what they are doing to Monica Lewinski's book 
purchasing records..

We will have to do better than that just to keep up with historical
trends in algorithm design. Most folks aren't aware of it, but
algorithm design historically has improved performance as much as
hardware improvements.

The big breakthrough IMO will occur as a result of software development
productivity improvements, but that's a different topic.

This is a resend.  I sent this message out 10 hours ago, but it never

Interesting. Makes computer hardware more of a software problem. I 
imagine it's quite difficult to do optimally, but it seems as though 
significant gains would be possible merely by dynamically changing the 
degree of connectivity.

Storing stuff in 3-d gives rise to a large dissipation problem.  
Heuristically, the problem is that the heat generated goes like length 
cubed (total number of components), while heat dissipated goes like 
length squared (proportional to the surface area).  As I've stated 
elsewhere, the reversible compution solution to this problem has a large 
potential hurdle to overcome, in the form of heat generated by error 
correction, which suffers the same probelm re dissipation.

When we say that a particular ethical theory is right, it seems to follow
(IMO) that this does not apply to any particular person; if egoism is
correct, then it is correct for everyone.  Correctly stated, this is the
generalization principle:  That if an ethical theory it is right for me,
it is also right for you.  If it is rational for me to act only in my
self-interest, then it is rational for you to do the same.

Now, from an egoistic standpoint, it is NOT good for me if everyone acts
egoistically.  I conclude that if I believe that egoism is correct, then
egoism is bad for me.  Since egoism demands that we reject anything that
is bad for us, egoism seems to demand that we reject itself.

Do you disagree with the axiom that if an ethical theory is true then it
is right for everyone?  It seems self-evident to me.

An ethical theory is right if and only if it is right for everyone. 
According to egoism, egoism is not right for everyone. According to
egoism, egoism is wrong.

Not really, because it would be "rational" for everyone else to do the
same thing, which would leave everyone worse off; a theory of
rationality which demands sub-optimal consequences is fundamentally
fishy, IMO.

When we adopt egoism, we find ourselves in a kind of a prisoner's dilemma
with the rest of the world: while it may seem better for us to act for
ourselves, it is quite bad for us if everyone does.

This is why that point was arguable.

It is simple: if an ethical theory is right, then it is right for
everyone.  Egoism is not right for everyone by its own standards;
therefore, when we presume egoism is right, we must conclude that it is
wrong.

Of course the card can be used to track your movements...every time you use
it, your position will be known....if it is required for many many uses by
government fiat.

I want the government as inefficient as possible in enforcing its dirty
stinking laws.

Worrying about your magnetic strips being tracked in this fashion is silly.
However, if you carry a cell phone with you, you are in fact being constantly
tracked by a large and pervasive computer system under the control of a
large and pervasive organization. So what?

Algorithm advances are far more problem-dependant than hardware.  If you're 
talking about sorting an unordered list, for example, not much has 
changed in a long while -- virtually all the advances can be attributed 
to hardware improvement.  On the other hand, the factoring of large 
integers has come on by algorithmic leaps and bounds over the past 25 
years; hardware improvement has been a relatively negligible factor in 
the leaps and bounds taken in factoring.

There is an amusing inverse to note here.  For sufficiently _hard_ 
problems, Moore's law makes essentially no difference.  The obvious way 
to look at this is that using Eratoshenes Sieve based factoring methods, 
we'd only be able to factor numbers 10 or 15 bits longer than we could 
back in the 1970s.

The inverse is that if we can factor 130 digit numbers now, using much 
better (but still exponential) algorithms, then using the same algorithms 
on 1970s computers, we would still be able to factor roughly the same 
size numbers. 

In other words, algorithmic advances are virtually _all_ that matters 
for really hard problems.  For easy problems, it's hardware advances 
that count, at least, so long as Moore's law holds out.

Just by the by: physical entropy is measured in joules per kelvin.  The 
connections between physical entropy and information have been developed 
by a bundle of people, with foundational work by Maxwell, Szilard (see 
the book by Wheeler and Zurek, 1983), and Landauer (IBM Journal of Research 
and Development, 1961).  Bennett wrote a lovely article in Scientific 
American on the subject in 1987; he and Landauer have written another Sci 
Am article on the subject, although I don't recall the year (1985 or 
circa 1990, I think).

I am presently attempting to improve my use of the internet; a 
problem of applied Intelligence Amplification.  I have a few questions 
and an observation which I would greatly appreciate comments on.


What are your most effective sources of information on the internet?

How did you find those sources?

How do you make use of those sources?

Do you use filters or robots as an aid to processing material obtained 
from the internet?

It strikes me that a very well-thought out document "How to use the net", 
along the lines of Mortimer Adler's "How to read a book" would be 
extremely useful.  _All_ guides to the net I know of focus on what 
resources are available, not the applied skills which are necessary to 
make the most efficient use of the net.

	"I certainly don't know whether Carol and I had the ideal amount of
overlap, but I would say we approximated it fairly well...  The `I', the
very core, of each person has been incorporated into the other person.  Not
only lovers, they are now psychologically merged, blurred, blended, and
fused, and have come to form one composite entity.  This is perhaps why, a
few months after Carol had died and I was gazing up at her photo... I felt
myself falling deeply into and through her eyes right into her innermost
core, and behind a veil of tears I heard myself sobbing, `That's me, that's
me.'"
		Douglas R. Hofstadter, Le Ton beau de Marot (1998)


Death is intensely personal.  Its theft of another human world hurts us
deeply, if we have shared even in some small measure that internalised
overlap of which Douglas Hofstadter writes so poignantly.  We are moved by
death more greatly, perhaps, than by any other passage - except, perhaps,
by birth.  Does thinking about death in the somewhat remote and clinical
mode of science distract us from that fundamental agony of loss whose only
appropriate answering voice is music and the hard melodies of poetry?  I
have no wish to evade mortality's personal dimension by speaking of nothing
but superoxide dismutases, the mysteries of the quantum, or the resplendent
glories of the cosmos.

Still, death in aggregate does not move us quite so fiercely, death on the
large scale of those wars and starving throngs we see behind the television
screen each night, death as the reaper of millions we do not know and might
not like very much if we did know them.  Our kindest emotions sag beneath
`compassion fatigue'.  And for the young, and honest, death and its mimicry
can also provide the fiercest of thrills.  Healthy young gangs of men
travel great distances to maim each other in soccer game riots, just for
the pleasure of it.  Vivid computer simulations allow most boys and young
men in today's technologically advanced nations, and a few girls, to
obliterate imaginary foes in gory detail - even to flash whole cities into
nuclear fire.  We embrace what terrifies us most.  Or we ignore and
suppress it.  But death will not go away - unless we make it go away.

For the first time since single-cell life coalesced on this planet, we are
perhaps within reach of doing just that.

So the keen pathos of mortality remains our spur, but we are justified in
regarding death, for a time, as an abstract force to be countered with
knowledge and determination, rather than appeased by mythic verse and
surrender.  But solving death, and life, is not a merely technical project.
 It embraces everything that makes us human.  The first immortal generation
will not be the children of just science alone, but of law, art, music,
writing - all the humane arts.

Although the Genome Project will accelerate the knowledge base for direct
genetic intervention, there is very much more in an organism (especially a
person, as Hofstadter makes us remember, eyes prickling) than is to be
found even in a total DNA map.  The ethical consequences of the new
sciences are formidable, even before the acceleration of science and
technology turns into an headlong ascent and death is put to rout (if that
ever happens).  We need to be prepared well and truly in advance.  We need
to learn how to think clearly about both death and life.

  scott, a better, more compact definition i have not seen.
by the way, that "extropiasm" is a wonderful typo.  i suggest the following
definition:

extropiasm: (n) the feeling experienced by two extropians engaged in amorous
activity.

AH.  Now I'm learning things.  :-)  I don't want to beat this thread to death,

heres a spin on privacy that i dont often see:suppose we wanted to form a system
that intentionally ended
privacy, for volunteers only.  one could sign up, pay a fee, get
a magnetic chip implanted in or on one's person, that would
allow the government or anyone else to know ones whereabouts
and actions at any time.  this would apply only to those of us who
are hard-line openness advocates.  it would carry medical records,
for instance, financial information for use in purchasing, or for
allowing advertising people to really know what i am interested
in purchasing, etc.  i think i might sign up for something like that,
just to show that for a subset of humanity, total openness is nothing
to fear.  or perhaps i would learn that this is something to be feared?  spike

        Beautiful post, Damien.  As I think most list members will agree,
the whole continuing tapestry of life is worth far more than the composition
of chemicals and cells within the body and the brain, and yet nothing seems
to emphasize this more than the present inevitability of death.  So the
question arises: if death is one day conquered, will life be worth so much?
Though this may sound somewhat existential, the question is quite valid.

        My first instinct is to define all that I find beautiful in life
right now...all the things which I could not feel or experience if I was
not currently living.  Needless to say, that is a lot.  Every sight I see,
every thought I think, every move I make; these are all aspects of life.
When I listen to a song I love, or read a book that moves me...when
compared to the
utter lack thereof, I cannot help but see the utter beauty of these
fragments of pure life.  

        A major downpoint (in my opinion) in the general views of society is
the tendency to take so much for granted.  This may have something to do
with the tremendous stigma attached to death --the sheer lack of life.
When a loved one dies, the memories always seem to focus on the seemingly
minor aspects of life: things that were perhaps overlooked or
underestimated at the time of their occurence; but such things turn out to
be infinitely precious.  The unacknowledged hug given while one is alive,
becomes an aspect of life, upon death, that could have been cherished a
little bit more.  To know that the immense potential of one's consciousness
--one's own *self*-- has been abruptly quelled by death, seems to
illustrate all the more vividly how much more life should really be enjoyed.

        Ultimately, this leads to the humanistic reason for extending the
human lifespan.  Logically, the longer one lives, the more time one has to
enjoy his life...the more time one has to create new ideas and explore new
internal and external frontiers --and why not?  I strongly believe that if
everybody cherished their own life more than what they do now, there would
be more respect for life as a whole.  Absolutely nothing on this world has
more value than one's own individual consciousness, and yet so few people
choose to acknowledge this.  Most Christian faiths teach people to blindly
believe in an unproved God, and to await what He has in store for them.  So
how can people love the here and the now if their fates are predetermined
and their earthly lives have no "real" meaning?  No, life is so much more
than that.

        Every choice I make is my own, and the only thing that can hinder
that is death...the lack of life, and lack of individual consciousness.  As
such, I want to live forever; if I can't live forever, I want to live as
long as I possibly can.  Every day will open up new possibilities for me.
Every second I live presents new thoughts and new options.  Though the
probability of life extension lies purely in scientific exploration, how
that life is used is totally in the hands of the individual.  In the words
of Natasha V. More: "I am the architect of my existance."  Can any words be
more beautiful or true?

I was referring to storage density, not storage speed. Nanomechanical
storage systems should require no power unless bits are being read or
written, so power dissipation is a function of I/O speed. Three-dimensional
storage in a nonomechanical system, using 100 atoms per bit alllows
a fair number of extra atoms for "overhead" functions such as support
and heat-conduction. The energy dissipated to read or write a bit
nanomechanically should be very small compared to that needed by current
technology, and diamondoid should be able to operate at much higher
temperatures than silicon-based devices. Diamondoid is a much better conductor
of heat than silicon, also.

Reversable computation may be useful for logic functions, subject to the
problems you describe. As I understand it, it's not relevant for storage.

I think that femtotech is a dead end.  Quantum effects render the
preservation of information at this scale impossible.  However, the same
effects enable the salvation: quantum computing.  Taking advantage of the
many worlds-interpretation of QM, a quantum computer takes advantage of the
enormous combinatorial explosion of combining quantum logic gates.   Each
gate is not merely on or off, but in a superposition of the two states.
Thus all possible computations are performed simultaneously.  A quantum
computer could factor a large prime instantaneously.  That is why the NSA is
funding much of the research.  The last lecture I saw on the subject (about
a year and a half ago) a quantum NOT gate had been successfully produced.
Its a start...so enjoy PGP while you can :)..

On the subject of String Theory, a very informative book is Hyperspace by
Michio Kaku, one of the founders of string theory.  Its a bit out of date
(1994) but String theory is still hot, and getting hotter, although it has
been replaced by manifold theory now.  We no longer have vibrating
10-dimensional strings, but vibrating manifolds instead.  I am certainly a
String (now manifold) convert.  Its where its at...21 century physics that
we accidentally discovered a bit early..but if only we had the math to cope.

Although I'm suffering from a little jet lag right about now, this looks
doomed from the start.  The location for this place looks to me like it's less
than 200 miles offshore from more than one country, and therefore is within
some existing state's "Exclusive Economic Zone" (EEZ) as defined in the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).  "New Utopia" looks like a
fixed platform to me and, under UNCLOS, fixed platforms within an EEZ are
deemed to be the territory of the adjacent coastal state.

'Special prosecutor' always reminds me of the Inquisition, somehow. I 
keep expecting the appearance of 'instruments' to get the subjects 
into the proper frame of mind at any moment.

Such practices as grand juries and congressional inquiries, that 
operate outside of the normal bounds of the legal system as regards 
self incrimination and jailing persons who refuse to testify are 
inmimical to liberty. If someone has not been accused of actively 
breaking a law, and has not been convicted of same, should not be put 
in prison for arbitrary periods just because they decline to answer 
questions.

Freedom of speech implies the freedom to NOT speak, I believe..

Looks like the same folks who proposed the Oceania (Oceana) idea.
All the quotes from Rand and Heinlein, and the links to anti-aging

Klein and Jim Davidson, et al., are at it again. I wish them well.

There may be engineering reasons that with current technology reversible  
computers would make more errors than the irreversible type, but I don't see 
any fundamental physical reason why that should be so. Consider a computer 
with the smallest possible memory, just one bit. The computer could be in two 
states, zero and one. Now record something into the computers memory, for 
example one. You have reduced the states the machine can be in, from 2 to 1 
in this case, and because the entropy of an object is the logarithm of the 
number of ways the parts of the object can be rearranged without changing its 
macroscopic attributes, that means you have reduced the Entropy of the 
machine also.
      
According to the second law of Thermodynamics you can locally reduce the 
Entropy of something but it takes energy to do it. The absolute minimum  
energy it takes to erase one bit of information and record something different 
in its  place is  ln(2)kT , k is Boltzmann's  constant 1.381 X10^-23 J/K, and 
T is the temperature of the computer in degrees Kelvin. This is not a lot of
energy by everyday standards, but it is free energy that must be dissipated
as heat if you want to erase one bit of information. With reversible 
computing, that is where the output uniquely determines the input, nothing is 
erased in computation so you don't have this energy loss and a logical 
operation can be performed with an amount of energy that is arbitrarily close 
to zero.

Landauer, Bennett and Merkle have shown that with  reversible computing the 
amount of energy needed to make a calculation can  be made arbitrarily small, 
by slowing down the calculation a little. Even a small reduction in speed can 
help a lot in energy saving, the power dissipation (per unit of time) falls 
as the SQUARE of the speed. More recently in the June 28 1996 issue of 
Science, Landauer shows (in a interesting but non practical way) how you can 
also communicate and not just compute information with an arbitrarily small 
amount of energy if you are willing to slow things down. 
                           
None of this is an important consideration to chip designers, today's logic
circuits are so huge, and they deal in such a tiny amount of information, 
that the effect is utterly trivial. Chip designers can safely ignore this, 
Nanotechnology engineers can not. In the early days there were some 
embarrassing incidences where people thought they were designing a nano 
computer, but when you looked closely at it and the amount of heat the thing 
would give off if operated at the design speed, you realized that what they 
were really designing was a first rate high explosive. They do a lot better
now.

I wonder what form violence will take on when it
is disassociated with death.  Will we see a
revolution, just as when sex became disassociated
with reproduction?  Perhaps with increasing health
and our impending long lives the revolution has
already begun.

I want one...

The cost for building the country is $216,439,000,
which seems quite cheap to me (although well out
of my price range).  Giving some ingenuity I think
it would be possible to raise enough cash to build
offshore Extropia. Instead of having a
constitutional monarchy, I would have a complete
free market, i.e. you buy your office/house, and
it's yours.  No taxes, no laws, just pure
capitalism.  Start off with the monopoly on PPA
services, etc. and then invite other companies to
join in.  Anyone want to help out?

So it is not rational to take advantage of the

So the question is, will everyone make the

What if the right theory is not the most rational

Hi Bryan, big thanks for the url. I have to do some unofficial
consulting for a big (and rapidly growing!) archive here, to see 
whether it is cost-effective to archive 1.5 Mfiles a la 150 page 
each as 300 dpi facsimile (roughly 0.1 MBytes/page, so currently 
it totals at about 23 TBytes). Since the number of queries is 
<100/day, and the archive is a FIFO (oldest entries currently 
are from 1927) magnetic storage, whether RAID or a tape library 
seems not appropriate, CDR/DVD/WORM jukebox is probably the 
solution. Still, I have to mention the other alternatives in 
the report to explain why a jukebox is best.

To all IT pros out there: any idea which storage medium has the best
price/performance ratio at modest durability (let's say, a decade)?
Since scanning is the bottleneck, progressively better storage devices 
should become available during the conversion, which asks for a moving 
target strategy.

It would be also extremely useful to learn the ballpark price for the
jukebox units. I do not expect them to be cheap, though the technology 
but for cartridge robotics is offshelf. Any ideas?
 
Thanks in advance,

ciao,

Well, what did you expect when trolling for flames? You made a
sweeping assumptions about how we on the list are supposed to feel, 
so sarcasm was an appropriate reply. The reply expressed how I see 
the issue, so it bore at least 1 bit of information. Let's aim for a

Uh, that would be

b) too slow
c) I wouldn't be able to afford all the tape cartridge wear 

Otherwise, the tape archives (or, more likely, a future RAID or
holographic storage) could be of some use in storing the raw
voxel data from small critter scan prior to further processing. 
However, I was looking for a much more mundane application :(

In fact, relatively cheap as it is, you could start a
"country" for much less. Just three platforms or so
and/or some old ships to start you up. If it's mobile,
you can open a floating Las Vegas outfit in just about
any part of the world as long as you stay outside the
20-mile jurisdiction. The ideal combination would be
an artificial island somewhere beyond the 200-mile
EEZs as a permanent, and completely free place to
live, while modified (old) ships (a medium-sized
cruise ship in good condition can sometimes be
bought for 2-3 million $ or less - and you can start
out with for example Russian freighters or navy vessels
which are cheaper still) are used to make money near 
population centers. This way you can have your cake 
and eat it too. As your income grows, the island grows.

In any case there would have to be some agreements regarding 
island defense, pollution & other damaging behaviour etc.
Rudimentary laws, but nothing like modern bureaucracies, of
course. Just the "golden rule" & some practical stuff.

Sure, I'd love to be involved in such a project. As I 
explained in other mails, the advantages of having your
own country are enormous, especially for transhumnists/
cryonicists.

Worse: in Germany the cellular providers have been legally forced to
instain snoopware automagically getting a position fix of 100-200 m
precision. Also, there are now portable cellphone ID sniffers. With this,
you can link spoken history of a phone user to his timespace history. 

Of course all the nice technology installed never gets used on
anybody, and if, it is always a certified villain.

They have a project called "The International University of Advanced 
Studies", see below.

"The International University of Advanced Studies, has been founded
and is dedicated to teaching the disciplines and imparting the 
knowledge that will be needed in the next century for survival 
on Earth, the colonization of the oceans, and the exploration and 
colonization of space. Access to classes taught by the University 
may be obtained over the Internet."

Leaving aside Mr. Starr's politics, his rudeness, boorishness, or what have you,
that he is merely trying to ascertain the truth or falsity of two sworn court
affadavits, which are in direct contradiction to the taped conversations of one
of those swearants, and contradictory to the established pattern of behavior of
the other swearant, seems to be completely ignored by all who see benefit in
ignoring justice, honesty, and integrity in our elected public officials.

Given smart card technology, this too will become possible. I happen to know one
of the pioneers in this technology, he founded Automated Payment Systems, Inc., in
Seattle. The systems they sold were primarily for use in parking and subway/bus
system payments, but the technology is easily transferrable to everyday use for
all financial transactions, and in its present form can be used for tracking
people through public spaces. These cards have a chip in them, and a small radio
transmitter. Unlike some other systems that you need to swipe your card through,
these cards have a range of several feet, such that you could have your parking
card in your wallet, drive through the turnstile, and be charged without ever
taking out your wallet. This technology will be easily usable for tracking with
the wide installation of sensors  that can interface with this card. Not only
could such technology be used for tracking you, but if you are deemed a threat to
public safety, the powers that be could easily seize the financial assets in your
card's chip, making you helpless and easily picked up...

Fortunately, my freind was also working on card technology he calls a 'ghost'
card, that allows you to pass through undetected....

Yes it does, and all the two objects of this investigation have to do is plead
their right to not speak under the Fifth Amendment. That they have not done
this, and have testified that nothing happened, then gone on to be taped by
people saying it did happen and urging people to lie about it is what this
investigation is about. Clinton knows that if he does plead the Fifth , that his
administration is over, which is why liberals have their skirts all up in a
bunch about this, and exposing their own hipocracy...

Yes, the state/media complex always makes sure that everyone 'knows' that the
individual preyed upon is 'definitely' a villain. What was that that Goering said
about lying enough to make it true???

I think we're going in circles here.    For an ethical theory to be true it
has to compared either to the "ends" or a "universal truth" - -

In order for there to be a universal right or wrong, we'd have to ask if
ethics can be derived from the laws of "nature" (18th Century Philosophy) or
"god".   Then we could become natural talmudisists and begin implying  things.

On the other hand, if our ethical system is relative to our percpetion of the
ends, then all ethical systems would be relative.    Obviously the ethical
system of an egoist vs. altruist would be quite different.   The next question
would be, which "value system" is ethical.   Now we're getting into
existentialism...   As for "rationality", I think there are three forms of it
- - 

One - - rationality as implied by an ethical system    (This presumes that
what is right is rational and what is wrong is irrational.)
Two - - rationality as defined by the means vs. ends   (This presumes that
what works and leads to the "sum" is rational.)
Three - - axiomatic rationality as defined by a system of universal truths
(This presumes that the "answer" has already been given, and human logic has
to conform to it, or be lead astray.)

So in conclusion - - you have to qualify the term ethics or rationality by
stating what's the goal of your system of ethics or rationality.    The other
person may then respond by asking why.   If he does, that means there's an
assumption that your system is part of a larger system (be it ethical, the
laws of science, the universe, human nature, etc. etc.) and then you have to
decide whether you wish to accept this presumption, and if so, justify your
own system relative to that.   

In conclusion, I really don't like the world ethics, because it is a loaded
word with little meaning.   I prefer to qualify it with "ethical continuity" -
- thieves and liars too have there own system of ethics.. hence implying, if
they abide by it, they are "ethical".

Yup, that's Jim Davidson, all right.

Also, regarding Burch's comments re autonomy of this "country," it's
very refreshing to hear some solid info on this idea.

I wonder if there is indeed some appropriate location somewhere in the
world, another oil well platform, but one lying outside the 200 mile
jurisdiction of a neighboring country. Considering the recent
developments regarding the Channel Islands, Caymans, etc., perhaps the
time has indeed come for such a libertopia.

Such a libertopia could enhance cryonics research, etc. One could even
be cryopreserved premortem in such a location.

Apparently the founders of New Utopia are of the opinion that 100
miles from the nearest country  is the pertinent distance.
Appended belwo is a letter taken from the New Utopia website that is
addressed to the UN:




<Picture: Principality of New Utopia>

A Letter To
The Secretary General
Of The United Nations
Concerning NEW UTOPIA


------------------------------------------------------------------------





Mr. Kofi Annan
Secretary General 
United Nations
New York, NY 10017 

June 9, 1997 

Dear Mr. Secretary, 

Please consider this letter a formal request to begin the process of
application for The Principality of New Utopia to join The United
Nations. New Utopia, a constitutional monarchy, has existed since
September of 1996, and has 314 citizens at this time, but we look
forward to having many more join us in the very near future. 

New Utopia is a new country in the Caribbean. It is comprised of three
submerged islands on which will be constructed large platforms forming
a base upon which to build the newest most beautiful city/state in the
world. 

We claim as our national territory the area of the Caribbean bound on
the north by 19 degrees 15 minutes North Latitude (19.25 degrees North
Lat.), the southern boundary located at 18 degrees 15 minutes North
Latitude (18.25 degrees North Lat.). The eastern boundary being 83
degrees 30 minutes West Longitude (83.5 degrees West Long.) and the
western boundary at 84 degrees 30 minutes West Longitude (84.5 degrees
Long.). 

Our new country is not within 100 miles of any other nation's 
                                        ***********************
boundaries, therefore we beg the United Nations for their support and
protection, while we are in the crucial development and construction
phase of our new country, which is to begin in April 1998. 

We have studied the Convention on the Law of the Sea as of 16 November
1994; the Rio Declaration, and Agenda 21, all of which are in keeping
with the philosophies and Constitution of New Utopia. 

We pledge to support and assist in every way possible the United
Nations and all other member nations. 

Sincerely, 

(signed)
Richard Stephen Balch
Secretary of State

Yeah, I saw that and, with all due respect, they're completely WRONG.  I have
few claims to distinction, but one of them is having worked on a case for TEN
YEARS that actually turned on the legal regime of the Exclsuive Economic Zone
defined in UNCLOS.  The EEZ is 200 miles:

"Article 57
BREADTH OF THE EXCLUSIVE ECONOMIC ZONE
The exclusive economic zone shall not extend beyond 200 nautical miles from
the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured."

     http://www.antcrc.utas.edu.au/opor/Treaties/unclos2.html

Here's a map clearly showing the U.S. claim to it's EEZ:

     http://www.nwn.noaa.gov/sites/afsc/USEEZ.html

Although there's no scale, it sure looks like 200 miles rather than 100 miles
to me. Here's another source validating the 200 mile figure:

     http://www.tradecompass.com/library/books/terms/ExclusiveEconomicZone.htm
l

And here's Australia's claim to 200 miles:

     http://www.auslig.gov.au/marbound/eez.htm

Finding these citations took me all of about two minutes.  I know of no zone
in the ocean that is set to a 100 mile limit.  Maybe these guys need to get
themselves a lawyer before they start pouring concrete.

The usual hand-waving argument is that using larger systems as basic logical 
elements automatically gives some of the redundancy that is the basis for 
error correction; smaller systems lack this redundancy, and are 
therefore more subject to error. It's simply a problem of the size of 
the potentials involved -- if there is a large potential barrier between 
the two logical states, then they are resilient against fluctuations; if 
not, then they become error prone, due to thermal and quantum 
fluctuations. In specific instances this can actually be made into 
a pretty solid argument, but in general, I doubt it.  So far as I am 
aware, it is certainly empirically true for all known systems.  Our solid 
state computing devices have error rates in the 10^{-18} range, while 
single particle systems are lucky to get down to 10^{-2}. 

Suppose we want to perform 10^{12} operations on 10^{12} bits -- not 
unreasonable, if we want to go beyond the 2020 Moore's Law.  Then we will 
need single particle systems with error rates of 10^{-24}, if we are to 
avoid the need for error correction, and therefore heat dissipation.

An interesting project, I'm looking forward to the summary.

Documents, and people. People spontaneously segregate in virtual
locations, and generate interesting informations streams both
spontaneously, and upon cues. Of course you have to pay for these
resources in the same coin. Documents can be found by searching, both
locally and globally in web spider indexes. Unfortunately, the growth
of both nodes and documents therein has long outstripped the
capabilities of even distributed search engines. If apache was to 
marry webglimpse, and would send the rebuilt index actively, or even 
link up with others to act as a global distributed search engine 
the problem would go away. While we are at that, we can fix the 
backlink problem properly, and take care of stale links (if a document 
is referenced more than once, it is likely to float in some cache 
somewhere, so with proper addressing scheme it could survive even if 
the original site is down -- once all references have vanished, the 
space can be reclaimed by garbage collection). 
 
Apart from documents and people there are interactive, dynamically
generated documents, map servers, e.g. 
http://www.c3.lanl.gov/~bradley/mrsid/bay_area/
structure generators, translators, etc. These are becoming
progressively more important.

 > How did you find those sources?
 
By word of mouth, hotlinks and search engines.

 > How do you make use of those sources?
 
Personally I scan the email, crosspost relevant items to several
persons/mailing lists. The big problem remains mail management. Even
the best mail agents are incapable of handling more than 6k messages,
which forces me to start afresh frequently, leaving the gzipped INBOX 
body in some vault. Once I can set up my home machine properly, I will 
make a giant (well, by now several 100 MBytes of gzipped mail are to
be processed) http://critmail.org of it, and index it with webglimpse.
I think permanent connectivity is not a pipe dream anymore, even
outside of California. Of course having a webcam, and NMEA feed from
a GPS receiver is the logical next step. Relying on cellular is
expensive, and radio modems are not ubiquitously available, not very
cheap. Also, I don't understand why people do not turn fine-grain
providers, linking up with neighbour's housenets, offering mutual
router capabilities. One should think a (even diskless) i386/i486 
8 MByte Linux box with several NICs is not so very expensive.

I read the documents on the web, in the last time frequently abusing 
the local http://xxx.lanl.gov mirror. Let's hope similiar services
will spring up for other fields, I'm missing this particularly for
chemistry and biosciences. Researcher's pages are very useful, but
sometimes hard to find. Almost forgot: mailing list archives are
sometimes very useful. I even made a nightly mirror of CCL archive,
unfortunately my current machine is unavailable for incoming ftp/http
requests so currently I'm the only user. 

 > Do you use filters or robots as an aid to processing material obtained

I distrust robots, though I've never used one. I think I'll wait for
learning neural nets which learn from looking over my shoulder. I
think people are the best filters, and I'd wish more people would
participate in the transhumantech@excelsior.org effort.

Apropos books: my next project is OCRing my entire library, book by
book, and digest my CD collection into mp3. Ideally, these should live 
in a wearable computer. http://www.netwinder.org seems like a good
starting point for a conversion. Particularly built-in networking and
IrDA make it sound ideal for hot-synching with the home unit.

Yes, I checked up on the Seychelles and they have a 200 mile "Exclusive
Economic Maritime Zone", that can hardly be a coincidence. However,
for doing business from a ship only the 20 mile radius is relevant
(as long as you don't fish or mine the bottom).

Okay.  There is still a slight issue in that addressing is a major
overhead in storage architecture, and involves dynamics; the same caveats 
about the need for error correction apply.  You also better make sure 
that your nanomechanical storage is extremely error free.  What happens 
if thermal fluctuations flip your bit?  Sure, this would be a rare event -- 
but you're talking about a scenario where the goal is ~ 10^10 bits or more.

Well, it would need to be. Suppose (conservatively), that you are going 
to have 10^6 layers, each storing bits with a density of 100 atoms / bit; 
a storage density of 1 bit for every few nanometers squared.  Such a 
device will have roughly 10^12 more bits stored on it than current 
commerical chips.  I forget the exact numbers, but the dissipation rate 
per logical operation is something like 10^6 kT in current chips.  That 
means you have a major problem unless everything is done completely 
dissipation free.

These are good points, but they only buy you a tiny amount.

Egoism would say yes.  However, that is another way of saying that egoism
concedes that it is not rational for everyone to accept egoism, which
would mean that egoism is wrong by the generalization principle.  To
accept egoism at that point would be irrational.  Same goes for relying on
the irrationality of others.

If you believe that, then the argument is over.  There's nothing I can do
or say which could prove that rationality is right, because I must
necessarily do so within the boundaries of rationality.  Meanwhile, I
personally am not very likely to be persuaded to accept an irrational
ethical theory, particularly since I *have* a rational ethical theory
which seems to work. 

We cannot debate the merits of utilitarianism against the merits of an
ethical system based on close scrutiny of biblical scriptures, because the
Bible is not derived from well-understood, undeniable axioms.  Though
attempts have been made to prove that God must exist, I have not seen any
which succeed; if God is deniable then the Bible itself is unfounded. 
People believe it anyway, however, because they have faith that it is
true.  How can an argument from rationality argue with that?

This is true.  For this reason, I've been maintaining a consequentialist
rationality.

Not necessarily, and it's because of the generalization principle.  If it
is rational for me to be an egoist, then it is also rational for you to be
an egoist.  However, if we were both egoists, we would both be worse off; 
this is bad, according to egoism and a consequentialist value system.  So
what we find is that egoism fails to meet the requirements of
generalization according to egoism's own value system; for this reason,
egoism is fundamentally irrational. 

It's like the Prisoner's Dilemma: egoism demands that we both incriminate
each other; utilitarianism demands that we both keep silent. 
Utilitarianism provides better results, so it is rational, according to
consequentialism.

This would be circular, as we are attempting to determine what is ethical
by deriving it from rationality.

If we define "well-being" as the "sum," then I think this is the
rationality which I tend to espouse.

Depends on what you mean by axioms.  For example, some axioms really *are*
undeniable while remaining consistent; A=A leaps to mind.  Indeed, I think
the generalization principle may be a similar axiom.

Is consequentialism undeniable?  It may be.  Consider another value
system, based on act types or motivations.  What act types are good?  What
act types are bad?  What's a good/bad motivation?  I can't even imagine a
value system which does not evaluate these in terms of their effects: that
"having a good motive" means that you intend to improve well-being, or
that a bad act type is one which reduces well-being.  These are all
consequentialist value systems, however.  What other sorts of value
systems could we even begin to consider?

OK.  I'm using a rationality which states that an action is rational to
the extent that it is the one most likely to result in improved
well-being.

This is *not* true if we make the presumption I did at the beginning of
this discussion: that the right ethical theory is the rational one. 
Within this context, I don't think that an ethical theory which condones
professional thieves is right; if it is rational for one man to be a
thief, then it is rational for anyone and everyone to be a thief.  Since
it is not rational for everyone to become a thief (because everyone would
be worse off, as measured by themselves), this ethical theory is wrong,
and not rational.

  Pardon me if this is not completely timely. I get the digest version  
of the list once a day.As such, I would appreciate any responses be 
cc'ed to me at barnebee@biosys.net 

  While I agree that the governmental systems that are currently 
invading our privacy, and will increase in doing so, are problematic, 
they are the knee-jerk reaction of people who believe in power-over. The 
Heinlein quote is "Any society populated enough to require ID's is 
headed towards decline". It's very true. I believe you will see magnetic 
strips, centralized Databases, infobuttons (see dallas semiconductor), 
smart cards, and soon, DNA scans and chip implants. Given the state of 
most industrialized societies (especially amerika (sic)) it is 
inevitable that the government will attempt to restrict, and track what 
freedoms are afforded to the masses. The purpose of a government is to 
restrict individual freedoms to insure societal continuation. Given the 
heterogeneous nature of American society, more governmental restriction 
is an inevitability.

   Fortunately, we (I include the members of societies such as 
extropians) are not the masses. Any system that can be designed by 
people, can be overridden by people. If you are concerned that you might 
be one of the individuals in an upcoming pogrom, do something about it. 
Encrypt everything. Join the EFF or other groups dedicated to preserving 
privacy in the system. Write (continuously) to people in power critizing 
them for their actions which hurt privacy in the system, and 
complementing them for making appropriate decisions. As a last resort, 
expatriate yourself to a country or place with strict privacy laws.  

   It is necessary to realize that most of the individuals making 
decisions (particularly in America) don't have a through understanding 
of the issues involved in building an information society/economy. {Newt 
Gingrich has his email printed out so he can read it, and he is one of 
the most cyber-savvy on the hill}

   As we change from an industrial to an information society, the 
socioeconomic stratifications of the society are changing from the 
have/have nots to the knows/know nots. Given that this is true, the 
knows group is going to be the focal group of any power structure 
wishing to control the society. To quote an old friend of mine, Daniel 
Glesenkamp "Be uncomfortable: be sand, not oil, in the machinery of the 
world". As extropians, transhumanists, et all, we are all aware that all 
of life is (should be) based on conscious decisions of will. If you 
disagree with things that your government is doing, work to change it, 
or work around it. As much as repressive totalitarianism frightens me, 
the American government is not one at this time, and mechanisms do exist 
to make your voice heard, especially for the cyber-savvy. Use them. If 
you truly feel that this is unattainable or counter productive, utilize 
the resources available to us to change your situation so that your can 
be perceived to conform while preserving the privacy you so crave. 
Heinlein again (paraphrased )--Rubbing blue mud in your belly button, if 
that is the societal norm, may be necessary. You don't have to believe 
in it--.

   The bottom line is that most of us are smarter than most of them. 
That implies power. If we utilize this empowerment to create power-with 
in our society, the tantalizing possibility exists to create a utopia 
rather than a "Brave New World". 

            I'm sorry if this has been a bit long winded, but I couldn't 
resist getting up on my soap box on this one.

                     Thanks,

The prisoner's dilemma only applies to short-term interactions,
not repeated ones.  This is the mistake many non-egoists make with
their naive refutations of egoism: what they reject is not egoism
per se, but _short term_ egoism.  Most "selfish" acts that seem
evil do so not because they are selfish, but because they are not
selfish _in the long run_.  Criminal behavior, for example, may
lead to short-term gains, but in a world where most values are
achieved by interacting with others multiple times, crimials do
far more poorly than rational long-term egoists, who understand
that cooperative behavior is, in the long run, more profitable.

For extropians, for whom even mortality is a problem to be solved,
should be that much more inclined to think long term, and therefore
value behavior that benefits us throughout our immortal existence
and not just take a buck when we can.  Under these conditions,
egoism is superior to utilitarianism in every respect.

For several reasons, starting your own nation would be the best 
option if you want real change real quick (before the singularity).
Otherwise, prepare for sometimes decades-long struggles for
usually very modest changes.

Yes, it's such a shame that all these people are at the brink
of enlightenment, but for some reason don't make the final step.
Transhumanism linked to a practical (based on facts) socio-political
worldview would be unbeatable, the best ideology ever. For example,
wealth and power are extremely important to reach "higher" goals,
or even to simply survive the coming changes, so let's stop treating 
them as "dirty" words. The meek shall inherit the earth (if they're
lucky) - the bold everything else.

Addressing in a nanomechanical system occurs only as part of a read or write
operation. When no I/O is occurring, no energy is dissipated. Dissipation per
access depends on the size of the memory, O(logN) for random access,
which is negligible and is mitigated further by caching.

I'm not sure that 10^6 layers is conservative. It's nanomechanically conservative
from a static structural standpoint (i.e., we could build it) but not from a
Moore's Law standpoint. We started this discussion with Moore's law in 2020.
Moore's law ( in one form) calls for doubling density every 1.5 years, or roughly
an increase of 16,000 by 2020. I can get this with an areal decrease from the current
10^6 nm^2/bit to 50 nm^2/bit without going into the third dimension at all. It's not
unreasonable to assume a decrease in energy per I/O on the same order, so I don't
have to invoke any of the other mechanisms.

If I operate the memory at the same access rate, the size of the memory is irrelevant.
If I operate the memory a 1000 times faster but using 1000 times less energy per I/O, I
have the same dissipation per volume. If I can sustain temperatures 3 times higher
(measured in degrees Kelvin above ambient) I can dissipate 81 times as much heat per
surface area. If my internal thermal conductivity is four times higher, I can
dissipate an additional four times the power, depending on geometry.

As you see from the above, these points can affect the densities by a factor
of ten to one hundred or so. By contrast, you raise the issue of error correction.
However, even very powerful ECC schemes require less than doubling the amount
of volume needed to store a word. For example, use 13 bits to store a byte, and you
can perform error-correction on any single-bit error. As the word size goes up,
the percentage of extra bits needed goes down.

I believe in the case of grand juries (Clinton's follies aside) that 
one may be jailed for contempt of court for refusing to testify - 
also in the case of some congressional investigations. Perhaps I am 
wrong in this opinion, but seem to remember hearing about someone 
getting canned for trying to take the '5th'.

I know that countless lowlifes and criminals have relied on the 5th 
Amendment to avoid further charges, but the general feeling for the 
last few decades is that anyone taking the 5th is automatically 
guilty, or they would have no problem talking.

Actually, I have not followed the mess in the White House too 
closely. I care not who he is in bed with - as long as he is 
following the Constitution and doing his job otherwise.

Drexler discuses Merkle's work on pages 82-85 in Nanosystems, he also lists 
many other articles by Merkle and others in the field of Reversible Computers. 
There is also a very recent article you may want to look at, in the June 12 
1998 issue of the journal Science there is an article by James R Heath and 
his associates at Hewlett Packard called "A Defect Tolerant Computer
Architecture;  Opportunities for Nanotechnology". They built a parallel 
computer out of slow cheap defective chips, their machine had an ridiculously 
leisurely clock rate of only 1 Meg and had an estimated 220,000 hardware 
defects, yet the computer was reliable and was 100 times faster than a high 
end work station. They specifically say in the article that their new design 
"has significant implications for any future nanometer scale computational 
paradigm".

Only in some cases.  I'd even say in MOST cases.  Indeed, as I pointed out
earlier, egoism and utilitarianism agree at least 80% of the time.
However, I still assert that even if egoists would only hurt people for
profit if/when they could get away with it, (ie when there would be no
long term negative consequences, or when the resulting improvement in long
term well-being would outweigh the long term negative consequences,) we'd
still be worse off if everybody was egoistic.

While I agree with your point re: thinking about the long term, your
argument falls apart unless you are asserting that there are never
situations in which it is profitable (in the long term) to hurt others;
situations in which you could steal and not get caught, defraud people and
not feel the consequences, etc.  In every situation in which we could hurt
people for long-term profit, egoism demands that each player
"incriminate;" since egoism would demand sub-optimal consequences, egoism
demands that we reject egoism under these circumstances.

ok.  suppose i want to explore the other end of the issue: voluntarily
broadcasting to the world (anyone who cares, which i supposed would
be very few) my every movement.  i want to cast all privacy to the
wind!  reason:  i see this as the first step in forming a protoborg.

the reason the borg is such a feared thing (organism, colony, society or
whatever it is) is that it is entirely unclear that one might not
actually
wish to voluntarily join it, especially if one is weak, sick, poor or
outcast from one's own society.  one gives up individuality, but
perhaps one would get something valuable in return, such as being part of
a really
kick butt superorganism.

nowthen, seems to me we have all the necessary technology now to form
a protoborg, but we need a group of people willing to give up all privacy

to all the others in the protoborg.  the individuals would wear some
manner
of headgear that contains a videocamera, a microphone, and
transmitter/receiver,
an earpiece and a (this is the tough part) a video imager of some sort,
so that
anything i see or hear can be seen or heard by any other subunit of the
borg.
likewise i can see or hear anything being seen or heard by any other
subunit.
the subunits could then communicate with each other at all times.
obviously, there is
no privacy whatsoever within the protoborg.  what are the
possibilities?   spike

Yes, there are many flavours of it: Iterated Prisonner's Dilemma, and

In an iterative, evolutionary scenario the strategy is not static. In an
environment whether you can examine the identity of the other party
and keep a record of your past dealing with that party, and can
share the same information among trusted other parties (nondefecting
in that respect) one should intuitively think more benign strategies
would evolve.
 
In fact this would seem to be validated by observing undenaturated
rural societes. As mobility and anonymity in urban environments have
increased, we need to adjust our strategies to a higher level of
defection (you can't prove one's identity reliably, and there are no
easily accessible records, and you're unlikely to deal with that party 
in the future), or make new tools available.

With wearable computing (the Java ring; true wearables) and ubiquitous 
networking authentication as obtaining a track record is a piece of
cake. It is much more difficult to make such technologies immune
against misuse.

Not unless you build them yourself. I'm currently researching
radio modem plans with a view towards building a bundle of them
with about a dozen of my friends, and setting up a city-wide WAN.
The next step is to run this WAN into an internet feed. While
having a high-speed link would be nice, I'm more interested in a
permanent connection than a fast dial-up link. There are some
interestingly fast designs floating around, so hopefully I'll be
able to implement a 100k+ link. I'm in Melbourne, Australia,
fwiw.

If anyone knows of useful spread-spectrum radio designs, or have
any advice, please get in touch with me, and if people are
interested I'll let them know how this works out.

I wonder how much use the corel NC will be for this purpose? This
is basically my plan, I'd like to link up my neighbours, and link
these subnets with my friends' subnets. Economies of scale are
quite useful in this regard, and if I'll I'm providing is access
to the net it's a hell of a lot less hassle than running an ISP.

I've subscribed to this since it started, as far as I know. What
do you mean by the "effort"?

If your ethical system is based of rationality, do
you extend "utility" to include those who are
irrational or only other rational persons?  Would
it be logical for utilitarianism to include only
utilitarians?

Sorry, I think I may have said that wrong.  I do
not mean that rationality is not right, but that
the "right" theory may not be the most rational
choice.  So that the "wrong" theory may be a
rational choice.

Have you had a look at SMS (www.sms.com) for

This would be entirely against the ideals of the
New Utopians but could you realistically steal the
money?  Actually, while I'm out on a
less-than-ethical whim, how about a chemical
weapons factory?  That could bring in some serious
money.  Euthanasia resorts (next door to the
longevity centre!)?  My own private drugs cartel?
Could you hide the island in a sort of
super-villain way?  We could invite homeless
people (or condemned criminals) to experience
paradise in exchange for them acting as human
guinea pigs for our advanced medical research.

I'd rather have contracts between companies than a
centralised system of enforcement.  Although
commanding my own military has a certain appeal
(especially if I get a big control room).

I wonder if it would cost more to have your own
country where you can do things declared unethical
(human cloning, germ line therapy, etc.) or a
research centre and a really good PR guy.

If you're a HAM as are your friends, you're home free. However, the
necessity to approve any RF devices in any civilized surroundings
(frequency space is a valuable resource) and associated costs make
this project impossible in Germany. Can any Europeans comment?

Sounds like a good idea, what does the local legislation say? (In
Germany, I'm not sure even line-of-sight laser diode/LED links are legal), 
heck, probably just operating boosted IrDA across the street will earn 
you a hefty penalty (not that it's detectable, unless somebody rats on 
you).

for me.

I don't know, the box is not very cheap. A salvaged i386/i486 board
with a single-boot/root floppy solution and a few NICs is difficult to 
beat, pricewise. You probably can use the NetWinder's 1 MByte flash,
and take the minimal 16 MByte box for router, also, the IrDA 
functionality is not bad. If diskless, it's very low power, so 
you could run it off battery-buffered photovoltaics (which is 
ideal in Oz). But the 10/100 MBit ports is not much for a router, 
and the box is not _fantastically_ cheap.

Well, it is an effort to contribute ;) Apart from that, there were
supposed to be several contributers, depth-dragging the net for
information filtering/digesting in the process. Otoh, the list as is
already pretty noisy due to yours truly's lack of focus...

Except when a gate requires you to posess a card. The trick is to let the system

Commentary from The Lancet 351: 1598-1599 May 30,1998
By Adrian Harris, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Univerisity of Oxford

Quote from text:

   "In experiments, administration of angiostatin inhibited growth of
primary tumours and metastases. Inhibition of metastases was by a novel
mechanism, prevention of blood-vessel formation, so the tumour cells grew
at the same rate but died much more rapidly by apoptosis, because of lack
of oxygen and nutrients. Endostatin caused nearly complete regression of
established tumours, but tumours regrew when therapy was stopped. However,
surprisingly after several rounds of therapy, residual cells did not regrow
but remained dormant. This effect occurred also in tumours extremely
resistant to chemotherapy. Thus, despite residual cells, endostatin was
highly effective, and its combination with angiostatin may be even more so.
These data have not been published, and a few weeks ago an optimistic
newspaper report based on these findings stimulated a flurry of publicity
and changes in share prices.
  Are angiostatin and endostatin the cure for cancer? There are many
problems to be solved. Initially scale-up of the production of proteins is
necessary, and in the studies with endostatin "unrefolded" protein had to
be used. Recombinant angiostatin has been made on a small scale, and recent
publication of the crystal structure of endostatin may help in the
development  of smaller molecules and peptides with activity. The receptors
or targets are unknown and may not be expressed on human tumour vessels or
to the same extent as in murine vessels. The animal tumours were very small
compared with the tumours in patients eligible for phase I trials. The
human pharmacokinetics may make the proteins difficult to deliver, and if
receptors or mechanisms were known, more appropriate drugs may be
developed. Thus these proteins are far from being ready for clinical use."

As we develop more and more powerful technologies which are more and more
efficient in their potential to be used to interfere or restrain the
individual's rights, the threat of government overreaching becomes even more
amplified, and by neccessity, will force the body of individuals to elect to
discontinue that outmoded practice.

TANSTAAFL: Acronym coined by Robert A. Heinlein in his novel _The Moone is a
Harsh Mistress_ and it means "There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch", which
is also known as the Laws of Thermodynamics, and the central tenet of
Libertarian thought. Heinlein's novel is about a revolution of the Luanr Penal
Colonies against its Earth Opressors, masterminded by a computer technician, a
beautiful young political rabble rouser, a retired rational anarchist, and a
spontaneously born artificial intelligence in the Lunar computer network called
Mike, who thinks its all one big joke...

Fnord (f-nord) n. 1. Mythical Creature representing hidden truth and mind
expanding realizations. First coined by Robert Anton Wilson in his _Illuminatus!
Trilogy_. Exercise for the Reader: Over your bowl of cereal, turn to the
editorial pages of your newspaper. Read Between the Lines. When said fnords come
into focus, shout, "The fnords! The fnords! I see the fnords!"

My statement about fnords is a paraphrase of  "believing 6 impossible things
before breakfast". The correct answer to my question, of course, is 23...

heres a spin on privacy that i dont often see:suppose we wanted to form a
system
that intentionally ended
privacy, for volunteers only.  one could sign up, pay a fee, get
a magnetic chip implanted in or on one's person, that would
allow the government or anyone else to know ones whereabouts
and actions at any time.  this would apply only to those of us who
are hard-line openness advocates.  it would carry medical records,
for instance, financial information for use in purchasing, or for
allowing advertising people to really know what i am interested
in purchasing, etc.  i think i might sign up for something like that,
just to show that for a subset of humanity, total openness is nothing
to fear.  or perhaps i would learn that this is something to be feared?

Although I don't agree with all of his conclusions, David Brin makes a pretty
good survey of issues of privacy and tranparency in his book, "The Transparent
Society".  Also, the Foresight Institute is carrying on a web-based discussion
of Brin's book, and the general subject of privacy and transparency at:

      http://crit.org/http://crit.org/openness

(Note that that IS the right URL -- it looks funny, but you'll see why when
you check the link, if you're not already familiar with Foresight's neat web

In an MTV "performance", Clinton identified the Constituion as a "radical"
document implying that it was meant for another era...too much freedom for
today as he was authorizing room to room weapons searches in public housing.

He also just issued a new Executive Order reversing Reagan's which ordered
the Federal Bureaucracy to respect State rights except when specific
Constitutional authority for Federal supremacy exists.  The new Clinton
Order leaves it up to the Federal bureaucrats to decide for themselves based
on collective "needs" and mentions not the Constitution!

Therefore, Clinton must be removed from Office on whatever technicality or
major crime makes it possible!  Impeach the STATIST CLINTON(S)!

"How to use the internet: a practical guide to intelligence amplification" 
or a similarly titled document will be linked to on my home page

I'll post a link when it's available.

There is an interesting anthropology or economics PhD waiting to be done on 
asymmetry and altruism in information flows.  Why some people act as 
information sinks, while others are sources, and what are the economics 
of the exchanges which take place.

Generically, I'm finding personal homepages a tremendously useful source 
of links.  Search engines are useful, but they rely almost completely on 
my intelligence.  With other people's homepages, I get access to a 
distilled form of their intelligence.

Interesting observation.  A project at present is to develop a nice Perl 
filter program for my email.  This works several ways. I can send myself 
messages, which results in actions being performed (example: I can send 
myself a list of words which need defining; my filter program then 
retrieves definitions from online sources, and puts the relevant 
definitions in my inbox); the other desirable goal is to organize my 
incoming mail much more efficiently.  A lot will be auto-junked; the rest 
ought to be sorted and backlinked to other relevant documents.  Scoring 
email would also be useful.  Unfortunately, only some of these ideas are 
implementable within my current set-up.

It's gradually happening. NSF is funding xxx, and they are expanding 
their coverage slowly into other fields.  I'm hoping that more filter 
sites like Daniel Gottesman's 
(http://qso.lanl.gov/~gottesma/qcreviews/main.html) will appear over time.

Yes. Incidentally, see 
http://wwwcas.phys.unm.edu/~mnielsen/info/info.html for links to the home 
pages of many researchers in quantum computing.

Interesting project. There is an excellent repository of on-line books at 
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/books.html.  The Library of Congress also has some 
superb online sources (http://lcweb.loc.gov/).

    The Grand Jury System and Prosecutorial Powers in general are wrong at
many points from a Libertarian Perspective, but should be used against
government officials....hang-em by their own petard, I say.

It is interesting that hardly anyone was aware of the Prosecutorial Tyranny
in which we live until their beloved Collectivist Clinton became subject to
it!  If there is anyone the system should be used against it is him!

I think all Clinton's assets should be foreited up front.  According to
several reports, it seems that his money was earned primarily by abusing
government power.  Starr should just seize all his assets and leave it up to
Clinton to see if he can get them back!  That ought to get some attention to
the Civil Forfeiture tyranny in which we live!

How about resisting the Biometric ID system?.....both left and right are
opposing it.  Civil Liberties Union on the left and the entire

Fundamentalist Christians will be against this one...mark of the Beast 666

do you mean to discontinue the outmoded practice of using privacy-violating

of hiding in plain sight.  i want to go ahead and offer the government

this time *we* are on top.  if extropians show that privacy violating

*becomes* the government.

solution: get a card.  drive, fly and make purchases.  drivethe technology,
fly to the upper limits of transhumankind, and

Ive heard that the government will soon implant the card in us as super small
chips, like people currently do with animals (my mom was the director for the
Humane Society and they injected a chip into every animal, to scan them for
identification later).  What if they attach some kind of sensor on these chips
that can be detected anywhere in the world by satellite?  You want to find a
specific person you find them very quick.  Imagine theyd have everyone online
at once, people that go into places they shouldnt be wil be caught instantly.
Dont take the chips!

I think we have to include everybody, since there's no easy way to figure

I don't think I understand what you mean.  If the "wrong" theory is a
rational choice, then we have an example where rationality has led us to
an incorrect conclusion.  Rationality can never declare itself wrong,
however, so in order to evaluate it as "wrong" we would have to use some
*other* criteria for evaluating right and wrong besides reason.  Any way
you slice this, it's at least non-rational, if not irrational.

   Well, first of all there's the problem of the 200 mile economic zones 
   _everywhere_, which are an assertion of State sovereignty and 
   jurisdiction

   Your next problem is that your State is probably ahead of you already 
   -- it will assert that _you_, as a subject of its sovereignty, carry 
   its sovereignty to any new territory you discover or create.  You're a 
   US citizen?  Bingo!  You've just helped Uncle Sam to a bigger slice of 
   the world's surface area.
   
   You want to relinquish your nationality?  Chances are your State won't 
   _let_ you, except if you're taking up another nationality.  It's 
   actually quite hard to acquire 'stateless' status.   What will you use 
   for travel documents?

   Then there's the Floating OPEC -- the UN Law of the Sea Treaty...
   
             ------------------- * * * * * ---------------
   
   Still, let's suppose that you (and all of your associates, who will 
   include a secret agent or two, natch!) manage to create Terra Novo.  To 
   every State on Earth, this is Terra Nullius -- it has no recognized 
   standing in the International bodies (including the International 
   Court).  How do you propose to enforce your own claim to sovereignty?  

   If you're attacked by pirates or marauders (perhaps State agents in 
   disguise -- Major-General Ed Lansdale used to dress up Phillipine 
   troops as HUK insurgents and send them off to attack Phillipine 
   villages, so that the terrified villagers would promptly seek 
   government 'protection'...), how do you propose to defend yourself 
   militarily?  If your little kingdom becomes militarily powerful, it 
   becomes veeery attractive to all sorts of other vastly powerful 
   para-statal folk (drug-lords, arms traffickers etc).  How ya gonna keep 
   'em out...

   There's a fine novel by Eugene Vale (author of the magnificent --

   idealistic attempt to set up precisely such an anarchist  "New Utopia."

Sorry, I haven't been following this debate for long, so excuse me if I'm
rehashing old points.

You cannot give the government extra abilities while downsizing the
government.  The two are mutually exclusive.

It is a common belief in democracies that we can make the government do
what we want it to.  People think that if the majority wants a government
which will have tremendous powers but not abuse them, then that's the
government we'll get.  This seems reasonable on some level; common sense
dictates that if the majority wants something to happen, it will happen,
because people vote. 

Unfortunately, this sort of evaluation is faulty in a representative
democracy.  Even imagining that we could convince the majority to agree
with our political philosophy, this would in no way guarantee that the
government would actually change.  It will always be more profitable in
the short term to lobby a politician for special interests than it will be
to research the issues and choose the best candidate.  And if you're the
politician, there's nothing stopping you from saying "OK.  You want a
special tax break for unions/industry/Internet commerce?  I want expanded
powers.  [Remember, the more powers a politician has, the more he/she has
available to sell!] If you support my power grab, I'll get you your tax
break." 

In short, nothing you can do or say can prevent a politican from abusing
his/her powers, even if the majority is opposed to the idea.  The only way
to prevent this is by actually preventing the government from doing its
job: by making it more inefficient, by creating a system by which it is
hard to pass laws, and ultimately by eschewing government entirely.

Then you want anarcho-capitalism, *not* government.  The government forces
people to join.  If you want something voluntary, then go create a private
institution.

This is another of those threads that seem to reincarnate from time to
time. The appeal is obvious: a place where we can be free and do what
we want to do. Great! But then reality intrudes, and we get all the
problems of practicalities of sea engineering, silly laws about
territories, the worry about defenses, and eventually it tend to run
into the perennial libertarian discussion. There have been several
similar projects beside Oceania, and none have succeeded (most never
left the paper). The reason seems to be that while a lot of people
like the idea, few are really wanting to pay a lot to participate, and
you need serious funding and planning for a project like this. This is
actually a worry I have about the Millennial Project, which at least
has thought about making the islands profitable from the start.

Maybe we should rethink the question. Last time this thread of
building an extropia came up people began to discuss various islands
instead. After all, a completely independent new nation might be
overdoing it, it might be enough to have breathing room. Maybe one
could back down even further: the most important thing in order to
really create a working community for this kind of project is of
course the community itself. Where it is and what jurisdiction is
involved is really secondary, since if you don't have the community in
the first place there is no way you could make the floating island
work. It is a good idea to figure out how to build the core community
and test it out first before trying to achieve soverignity.

What form the community might have is interesting. Right now we have
the extropian nexi, and one could imagine something like an
employee-owned transhumanist corporation that grows out from it. If we
can create transhuman communities that have not just social but also
economical potential I think we will be on to something.


To sum up: I want to live in Oceania/New Utopia/Stateless too, but we
need more than a loophole in UN regulations to do it. It might be
better to start with thinking of how to create transhumanist
companies.

Excellent Point!  It is absolutely not necessary to create a new and 
independent country in order to purse goals of transhumanism
or any other ideological, political, or religious movement.  The idea
is just a nostalgic appeal to the disappearing age of state dominated
social and political world order.  A more contemporary organization 
which can easily transcend state lines and provide environment and 
infrastructure will serve muchmore effectively to further the cause without
unnecessary overhead usually associated with a creation of a new 
Utopian state (We still have to see one).  A corporation is one of the
many options.  What is nexi?  Sorry, I am a newbie...

As individuals become as powerful as 20th century national governments, it becomes
silly to allow national governments to continue to repress self government of the
individual.

Cheers Michael (do you have that term in the States? JIC, it means
"thanks").  Forgive me, but its been about 5 years since I last did this
stuff; most of it is a bit vague. 

With regard to the info, I  think the IBM Journal of Research and
Development, 1961, might be a bit tough to get a hold of here in NZ.  I'll
give it a go, though.

This requires both card and gate design, however,

I'm actually an Australian citizen, although I've been living in the US for

Most good University libraries should have it. If you have difficulty, I 
can fax you a copy, although it may take a while -- I am moving house 
over the next week or so, and all my papers are in a very large heap 
in another city.

You can start with a practical mission statement (autonomy, wealth
and [thus] a good starting position for the coming singularity, for
example). A transhuman "order", or mutual aid group. Extropy Institute
is certainly on the right path, but still lacks the clear goal that's
needed to focus your effort, and to actually achieve something 
tangible. If you want to promote a philosophy, what better way is
there then by successful living?

Yes, companies are necessary for the start-up capital (money is 
"the great problem solver"). Any suggestions (personally, I
still think the watch's a good idea ;-)

Chuck, this is what your message to me looks like:


ERROR: Header line added to ASCII armor: "Hash: SHA1"
ASCII armor corrupted.

Error: Transport armor stripping failed for file pgptemp.$00


Sounds to me like you have Eudora putting ASCII armor on files that are
just signed and not actually encrypted. Some versions of PGP will by
default put all files they touch, encrypted or not, into scrambled text
that looks like it was encrypted, and as a result it can only be read
through pgp. So, turn the ASCII armor feature off.

No reason both things couldn't be true, information and facts are connected, 
of course you'll need a language to connect the two, but that doesn't mean 
you'll need a human, consciousness or even intelligence to do it. Consider 
the Genetic code, the nucleotide triplet CAU in messenger RNA is information 
and it means something, the next amino acid in a protein a cell is making 
should be histidine. I grant you this is only true in the context (language) 
of life as it just happen to develop on the planet Earth, the Genetic code is 
as arbitrary as any human language.

The term "Free Will" as is commonly used is not a myth, it's not even wrong, 
it's pure unadulterated gibberish.

I may have an idea on how an extropian nation could be wrangled into existence
with minimal difficulty.  I see it as a political parallel of the common
business practice of buying a shell corporation. In business, there are many
companies which have listings on Stock Exchanges, but no longer operate any
business. The easiest way for a start up company to get listed on a major stock
exchange is to buy one of these shell corporations.

How I would apply this to the political transaction of creating an extropian
state easily is going to involve a bit of environmental science here. I was
watching a program on the Discovery Channel about the West Antarctic Ice Sheet,
and how it is expected to collapse some time in the near future (20-200 years)
due to global warming, or some other unknown cause. When this ice sheet
collapses (they say when, not if), it is expected that sea levels will rise
several tens of meters, which will be enough to flood many existing island
nations around the world. As many of these nations will not want to give up
their national sovereignty, even though they are then no longer dry land, I
expect that the UN will make some special exemption to the 'dry land' clause to
preserve these nations. I also expect that at least one, if not more of these
nations, will simply be abandoned by nations which cannot afford to build sea
platforms. This is where we can step in, buying the country out. We could even
plan ahead on this and work out an agreement with some island nations ahead of
time that we would get the capital to build sea structures in return for
concessions.....

So what?... You can't possibly be serious, and if you are, don't count on my
vote if you ever run for office.  I don't mean for this to sound snotty, Dan,
but think about what you just wrote.   I don't go around commiting crimes left
and right, but that doesn't mean I want some officious snot of a beaurocrat
poking his/her/its nose into where I go or what I buy or who I speak to
anytime they happen to have an urge.

And the sad fact is that both individuals and gov'ts have demonstrated that if
they are given the ability to snoop and use info for private gain, they will
do so.

Michael, I understand the importance of that aspect.  Truly.  But the methods
use to discover the truth in the matter frighten me and I feel they ought to
concern anyone who values their privacy and freedom, as I know you do.  
Starr has gone way past the bounds of diligent public service and has asked
for the ability to get his information using seemingly any methods available,
regardless of the legality or ethicity. ( not sure that is a word, but I think
you know what I mean.)

For the record, I voted for Clinton, but have been consistently disappointed
in him.  
I not a fan nor a defender of the man.  If he's broken the law, I hope he is
caught and punished.  I simply disagree with the means being used to find out
if he has or not.

Starr seems the sort that would have felt right at home in Torquemadas' little
clique.  
No doubt feeling righteous and right the whole time.  The man makes me sick.

 it's something that has beauty you won't be much the wiser, but it's really

Two things.  

First, In your original comments you said that if something is more
fundamental than information we will never understand it.  I replied that
because X allows definitions to exist does not mean that X cannot be defined.
To tie this back in with your original comment, the fact that X makes
information possible does not mean that we can't understand X (assuming that
what we can define we can understand).  So it's quite relevant to your
original comment.  

Second, it's true that people don't require much knowledge at all as they go
about their daily tasks.  We could get along quite well with a series of true
beliefs (acquired, luckily, through false methods) or simply with a series of
beliefs that are practical in the sense that we can use them to manipulate the
world but false in the sense that they don't accurately represent the world.
For those interested in acquiring knowledge, however, the definitions of
concepts are extremely relevant.  To reply to your example regarding beauty,
while I agree that a dictionary definition might not prove very illuminating,
a philosophical discussion aimed at creating and refining a definition might
prove extremely illuminating.

 I think Astronomy is the parent of all Science, philosophers have been big on
 theory but notoriously poor at empirical science, Aristotle was a complete 
 embarrassment as a scientist.>>

As each branch of philosophy became successful and expanded it broke off, in a
sense.  A fairly recent example is psychology.  The fact that when science was
a part of philosophy it was still in its infancy and thus quite poor has
nothing to do with the fact that it sprang from philosophy.  And indeed, I
would venture to say that science is STILL part of philosophy, that neither
can really exist or flourish without the other.

<< And I still maintain we'll never discover 
 anything more fundamental than information, you'll never prove that you and I
 and the entire visible universe aren't just a software program running on a 
 hyper computer somewhere. I'm not saying that's what's happening, I'm saying 
 it could be and we'd never know. Besides, even a hyper computer can't operate
 without information.>>

The principle that we'll never discover anything more fundamental than
information is only true if everything IS information.  I think that it is
more accurate to say that everything could PROVIDE information, while not
everything IS information.  When we ask for information, we really want the
FACTS; we could, if possible and necessary, do without the symbols and such by
means of which we transmit those facts.
As far as skeptical challenges go, like the one you mentioned although I
confess that I've never heard of it, I think that they can be explained away.

communicates with a tree when it cuts it in half.  Both instances merely
involve cause and effect, without any understanding.  To have a language one
must have MEANING and two or more entities who can understand that meaning.
And therefore one must have consciousness.

I think that we're using "information" differently here though.

Presumably, such a card would only make it easier for them to do once an
arrest warrant is issued.  And frankly, I think that overall that's a good and

Well you can get most of the way there by making a lot of money, and
building a wall against society that is made out of lawyers and
accountants. ;-)

It will get you 90% of the way, and it is probably easier than making a
new society fromn scratch.

Wealth will probably always be the only real form of freedom.

You'd better invest in a whole bunch of nukes and other serious weapons,
because no new free country is going to survive without them, regardless
of what international law may say. Read "How To Start Your Own Country"
(Erwin Strauss, Loompanics Unlimited) sometime to see how previous new

Yes, America has become a frightening place to live since the asset
forfeiture laws were passed. Or were you unaware that anyone can have their
assets seized at any time on suspicion of having committed a crime?

Here's a recent example:

Back in 1994 a Syrian immigrant wanted to fly to Syria carrying $350,000
in cash to repay the friends and relatives who'd invested in his profitable
gas station business. Because he was scared that it might be siezed by
corrupt Syrian customs officials he chose not to fill in the mandatory
reporting forms for exports of more than $10,000 in cash.

Sadly, he forgot about all those corrupt US customs officials; they found
the money, and seized it all on the grounds that they thought it might,
possibly, perhaps, maybe have been raised by criminal means.

Four years and many legal bills later later the Supreme Court have finally 
decided that the money didn't come from a crime and returned about $330,000 
to him (keeping the rest as a fine for not filing the report). But, oops! 
The IRS just sent him a bill for $330,000 in back taxes. Not that they've 
done an audit or found any evidence that he owes any, it's just an IRS 
decision based on... uh, um, ah... a hunch, I guess. That it's within a 
few thousand dollars of the amount the Supreme Court returned to him is
just 'one of them coincidences'. Of course.

Now do you see why so many of us find these claims that Clinton's rights
are being abused so laughable? He's getting kid glove treatment compared
to ordinary Americans.

And maybe some of the others on the list will realise why we're so opposed
to letting governments track us at will.

I'd say then that the freedom possibilities for the less-than-wealthy 
look somewhat dim. 

On the other hand, the less-than wealthy also seem to be the one's 
who are the first in line to trade their freedom for some apparent
guarantee of security anyway. In lieu of wealth...

As a matter of fact, I've ordered that book a week or so ago (from
http://www.altbookstore.com btw; loompanics didn't seem to
have it anymore). Right now, I only know about the Minerva
reef settlers being kicked off by the king of Tonga (or something
like that). You don't need any nukes to defend yourself from suckers
like that, for example an old diesel sub with a couple of torpedoes
would blow them out of the water in no-time. Or what about a remotely
controlled plane with a couple of rockets and machine guns? Or a
remotely controlled gunboat? Quite doable for the robotics guys in the
transhuman community, I reckon. Then you can intercept the enemy as
soon as they violate the 20 mile zone without being in direct physical
danger. Nerds with joysticks kick ass. ;-) The most common threat are
probably pirates, which are relatively lightly armed. They rather attack
undefended freigters or pleasure jachts instead of islands with
gun-toting pioneers. Unlike in any regular country, you can use
virtually any means you want to defend yourself successfully, and *not*
be arrested afterwards.

Last but not least: because you're *at least* 200 miles from anywhere,
it is quite unlikely that anyone will take the trouble to go over there,
and kick your ass. Small countries simply don't have the means to do
it, and big ones likely won't be interested And *should* they cause
trouble after all, they're as vulnerable as anyone to retaliatory
attacks (with for example the plague, anthrax, nerve gas or something
more subtle) by the surviving islanders/their comrades in other
countries. Only one needs to get trough...

I think we should distinguish between the transhumanist organizations
we have right now (ExI, Transcedo, Aleph et al), which are mainly
intended to spread the meme and help us get in touch, and the future
transhuman economic organizations. It is probably a good idea to make
the later independent of the former and start out small and
well-defined.

Exactly. The day people see that transhumanism is *useful* and anybody
can use it, then things will start rolling. But we better manage to
live siccessful first, and make sure it doesn't look like magic,
conspiracy or unachievable genius.

The watch is a good idea, I want one for myself. But there is so much
more: wearable computers, intelligence amplification software, mental
training courses, AI applications, medical technology, life extension
treatments, new media, knowledge management, future analysis, you name
it.

Exactly. If I had to choose between buying guns or layers for my
personal nation, I would go for the lawyers. After all, the goal is to
participate in the world system, not to sit like an hedgehog on top of
a small rock shooting at anybody passing by and threatening the world
with homemade weapons of mass destruction if it objects. 

> Wealth will probably always be the only real form of freedom.

Well, I don't buy that completely (pun unintended), but you have a
point. True freedom consists in the ability of make choices for
yourself, and wealth is a great tool to make these choices
practical. It is more easy to live a transhuman life if you are
financially independent and have flexible investments that don't hold
you back, but the most important thing is to be able to think freely
in the first place (a frightening number of people don't allow
themselves that freedom).

I subscribe to a Christian political mailing list; not because I'm a
Christian, but because it's a good source of political news that usually
doesn't make the non-Net media. They are most definitely opposed to any 
kind of mandatory ID system like this, and will fight it with the rest of 
us; possibly more so.

While they disagree with us on many -- if not most -- issues, they agree
with us on this one. Luckily I think they'd still agree even if there was
a Fundamentalist in the White House rather than a Democrat.

At which point, at the request of the Tongan government the US sends over
a few stealth fighters (aka small stealth bombers) with laser-guided bombs
and you don't wake the next morning. Surely you can't honestly believe
that any US president is going to sit by quietly while you set up a free
country anywhere on the planet? Either you stay within their definition of
"freedom" (e.g. no selling drugs, no gun-running, no bioweapons, no "child
porn", no giving haven to "terrorists") or you're going to become Global
Enemy #1. And you can't prevent those things in a free country.

>Unlike in any regular country, you can use

Oh yeah, you can use anthrax and nerve gas on passing warships and no-one
is going to take action against you. Get real.

Exactly. But such tactics are only possible if you already have those
weapons ready to use. The only tactic which will keep the US government
out of your country is to call up the President and say "hey, we've got
nukes in various major cities which will detonate if we don't send them
a valid code every ten minutes. Attack us and they go off." Only immediate,
massive retaliation will stop them, not a vague threat of future attacks.

As Erwin Strauss says, don't even think about it without weapons of mass
destruction at your command, *and* the willingness to use them in defence.

I'm interested in this too... am looking for a way to have
constant connectivity to my car/bike/laptop when away from
home, for purposes of telecommuting and media streaming
(also planning like 'gene to convert my physical media
into bits- anyone know of a cheap hardware MPEG-2 stream
encoder?).

I've investigated the commercial low power (unlicensed)
spread spectrum hardware out there and it looks like
it might be possible to setup a small cell of connectivity
by placing a omni antenna on my apartment roof and a
second one on my car, but I doubt the radius could be
more than a mile...

[Warning: wild handwaving and very theoretical physics follows!]

Even more in the realm of blue sky speculations (ultraviolet sky?) is
sub-Planck computing. It makes femtotech look safe and
well-understood. 

The idea I have is based on reading "Cellular Networks as Models for
Planck-Scale Physics" by Manfred Requardt (hep-th/9806135), where he
plays around a bit with cellular networks of nodes connected by bonds
according to local laws. The hope here is that somehow the local
combinatorial dynamics will in the large scale low energy limit
simplify itself into some reasonable spacetime physics. In the
meantime he derives a kind of discrete functional analysis and
geometry on this kind of stochastic web. Amazing stuff that manages to
become suspiciously like differential geometry.

Anyway, if Requardt (and Penrose before him) is right, then physics is
really sub-Planck CA dynamics in this stochastic network, with our
physics as an emergent phenomenon on top of it. This network dynamics
looks like a great medium for doing computation since it is truly
discrete, and on this level there is no noise. Of course, manipulating
it to set up a computation might turn out to be inefeasible (not just
because our tools may be *way* too large even with femtotech, but also
because the present patterns might erode the computational structure;
we might need to isolate it from the ordinary activity with some kind
of Planck-scale barrier).

to do in 2020 instead :-)]

10^{-18} is an estimate from a condensed matter physicist and 
colleague at IBM. 10^{-2} is from scores of research talks by people 
working on this kind of thing, in many different architectures. Most of 
the talks have been oriented towards quantum computing, but a good 
number have been oriented towards conventional computing as well.  
10^{-2} may be slightly pessimistic; 10^{-3} is not, in my opinion, and 
10^{-4} is wildly optimistic.

I'm not sure what the problem is with "single particle 
systems".  Admittedly, they are not the only subject of 
discussion here, but they provide a convenient reference point 
at one end of the size spectrum.

I'll have a look. Thanks also to Anders Sandberg for the link to Merkle's 
page.  In the "interesting facts" file, I'll mention that while a 1973 
paper by Bennett in the IBM Journal of Research and Development is 
usually credited as the discovery of reversible computation, 
the following paper:

@article{Lecerf63a,
author={Y.~Lecerf},
title={Machines de {Turing} r\'eversibles},
journal={Comptes Rendus},
volume={257},
pages={2597-2600},
year={1963}}

appears to be where reversible computing first appeard.  I say "appears" 
because I don't read French; I have been told that it does contain an 
architecture for a universal, reversible Turing machine.  The Bennett 
article is

@article{Bennett73a,

Indeed.  But the ways in which people have come to terms with death are
perhaps even more personal.  Suggesting that death can be long deferred
threatens the core of many people's being, inspiring fierce opposition.

Death will not go away.  The current causes of death will be replaced by
other causes.  But dramatically increased lifespans are indeed cause for joy.

A vivid example of this is cryonics.  A technology which has a good chance of
lengthing the lives of most people who now "die" by orders of magnitudes is 
taken up by only a few hundred.  What makes those people different is mainly 
their "humanity".  Yes, these people tend to know science better than average,
but millions of others know science much better.  The few hundred cryonics 
customers, in contrast, seem to have taken the science seriously enough to 
let it join with their soul.  They love life strongly enough to face their
deepest fears head on.

Remember that progress in silicon computing hardware to date has been
mostly based on increasing the number of devices per square mm, *not* per
cubic mm.  That is, our computers still occupy a flat surface area perhaps
a few microns thick.  there is no practical incentive to go "up" until we
hit the atomic scale.

And it's interesting that about the same time we'll hit that limit we gain
the tools to build up and out in volume, and probably to make computers
even more cheaply.  Power consumption/cooling becomes a real limit some
time after hitting the molecular scale, though.

Has anyone the numbers handy?  How many TOPS can one get for 100 watts of
power (half a PC's power consumption), without reversible computing?

Why would the US bother to help some little dictator in a far away, 
obscure part of the world? Unless there's oil or tons of white
powder to be had, no-one's interested. Besides, "stealth" is highly
overrated. It can't have rain, and the planes can be made visible
if you tweak your radar a bit. Then they're just billion dollar
sitting ducks. Anyway they're not gonna waste their expensive bombs
on some remote, insignificant little island with a bunch of nerds 
on it.

If you practice some basic discretion he (and others) won't even know
about you, and even if anyone knew, what would they care? They may be
great assholes, but even the US military don't blast private islands at
sight. What if you have lawyers. Oh dear, what bad PR that would be if
it leaked out.

I wouldn't even *try* to prevent such things out of principle. There is
no problem as long as your island is simply a place to live for just
100 - 300 or so individuals, and business is conducted elsewhere from
boats or other platforms. No-one's going to bother a remote retirement
community where consenting adults (no kids in this place) take some
dope or read porn every now and then.

Gassing warships? Really, I don't think that will be necessary. The
only likely problem are pirates, and even those prefer to operate
close to coastlines, not on the high seas where there's no cover etc.
As with regular isolated islands, hardly anyone ever comes by, or
knows that they're there alltogether.

Of course, once you've arrived at this point you've in fact already
failed. I can almost guarantee you that the US, or any other big state,
would take its chances and nuke you out of principle. No way that
you could blackmail them for any significant period of time. Only
massive countries like the former USSR can (could) do that, and even
they came close to open conflict when they got too bold. Nukes are a
quick ticket to your extinction, and too expensive and difficult
to obtain anyway (if you want to get noticed, try to buy a nuke).
Nerve gas or biological agents are considerably easier, but would
probably also cause more trouble than they would solve. Basically,
it's the pure arrogance of countries like the US that gets in the
way. Obscurity is a much better weapon.

In the case of an island, I think that's a bit too extreme. Things will
really get interesting when the space race begins for real. In the case
of a planet, space station or asteroid, nuke defense *does* make sense.
A relatively small group of pioneers could claim Mars for example, and
there wouldn't be much anyone could do about it.

I believe that older people tend to commit fewer violent crimes (and not
just those who are in hospital beds). If true, this might be turned into a
cultural-effects argument in favor of extending our lifespans. If violent
crime primarily comes from youngsters, the more older people there are and
the lower the birth rate, the lower the level of violent crime that we
should expect.

Can anyone point me to a good source of statistics on violent crime broken
down by age? Preferably a resource easily accessible on the web.

Thanks,

Max

While this is true, it seems to me likely that it's less to do with the
wisdom of years than with the cumulative loss of androgens.  I'd hope it
was the former, though.  It willl be interesting to see if HRT boosts crime
in the aged.

I strongly disagree. People need a huge amount of knowledge to live, even 
though most of it is hard to put into words, that's why it's been so 
difficult to program an intelligent machine, it's definitions that are not 
vital. Maybe definitions are handy in simple minded stuff like chess or 
mathematics or formal logic, but not in profoundly intellectual astronomically 
complex things like cleaning a house.

        >(acquired, luckily, through false methods) 
                      

I've heard a wonderful story about this but I haven't checked so it may be  
apocryphal, no matter it's still a good story. On November 7 1918 several 
newspapers in Boston ran a erroneous story that the First World War had ended, 
on the same day two men set sail in a small boat. They arrived in Bermuda on
November 12 1918 certain that the war was  over. They had perfectly 
respectable evidence, copies of the newspapers, and their belief was even 
true (the war ended on Nov. 11) but was it knowledge?  I'm not sure it 
matters what it was because the war was definitely  over and their belief was 
true.                 

        >or simply with a series of beliefs that are practical in the sense         
        >that we can use them to manipulate the world but false in the sense         
        >that they don't accurately represent the world.
                           

Making predictions and manipulating the world is the most we can hope for, 
nobody has seen deep reality. Our brain just reacts to the electro-chemical 
signals from nerves connected to a transducer called an eye. Our computers  
react to the electronic signals from wires connected to a transducer called  
an TV camera. 

Our brain uses theories to explain these signals, so would intelligent  
computers. Theories explain how some sense sensations relate to other sense 
sensations. For example we receive information from our eyes,  we interpret 
that information as a rock moving at high speed and heading toward a large 
plate glass window, we invent a theory that predicts that very soon we will 
receive another sensation, this time from our ears, that we will describe as 
the sound of breaking glass. Soon our prediction is confirmed so the theory 
is successful, but we should remember that the sound of broken glass is not
broken glass, the look of broken glass is not broken glass, the feel of 
broken glass is not broken glass. What "IS" broken glass? It must have stable 
properties of some sort or I wouldn't be able to identify it as a "thing",  
I don't know what those ultimate stable properties are, but I know what they
are not, they are not sense sensations.  I have no idea what glass "IS". 
The sad truth is, I can point to "things" but I don't know what a thing "IS"  
and I 'm not even sure that I  know what "IS" is, and an intelligent computer 
would be in exactly the same boat I am.             
                           

        >For those interested in acquiring knowledge, however, the

Definitions should be consistent and are useful when communicating ideas with 
other people but when it comes down to it, they're just words about words 
that are defined by still more words and round and round we go. Examples are 
far more important.

Give me an example, I don't care how wild or exotic, of a way to prove that 
there is something more fundamental than information.


        >I think that it is more accurate to say that everything could

You are not a brain in a skull as you'd assumed you are a brain in a vat. 
The day after you were born your brain was removed and placed in a artificial 
nutriment bath. You have no sense organs but the parts of your brain that  
would have received information from them now receive input from a vast 
digital computer providing you with a virtual reality. 

Actually now you're not even a brain in a vat, on your first birthday the 
computer examined one particular neuron in your brain and because it had very 
good information on how it operated it used nanotechnology to replace it with 
an electronic neuron that behaved externally in exactly the same way,  
the 10,000 other neurons connected to it saw nothing strange. When the  
computer was satisfied that the neuron was working properly and received no 
complaint from you that you were no longer you it got to work on another  
neuron and then another. After one year all 10^11 neurons and the 10^14 
synapses that connect them together were replaced with computer parts. 
You and the entire universe are just information, a big software program.

Prove I'm wrong and you've proven there is something more fundamental than 
information. But you can't. 
                

        >We often tend to speak of one computer communicating with another,         
        >or DNA communicating with cells via RNA. But this is all just        
        >metaphor. 


Metaphor? I seems just about as exact and concrete as things get. The cell 
certainly acts like it understands what the nucleotide triplet CAU means, 
it does things differently when it receives the message and that's what  
information is supposed to do, we do the same thing. Don't take my word for 
it, go to the laboratory and ask the cell what CAU means and it will always 
tell you exactly the same thing, histidine
                

        >One computer no more communicates with another than the lightning        
        >communicates with a tree when it cuts it in half.  


The effects of lightning are not repeatable, sometimes it blasts the tree in 
3 parts, sometimes 4, sometimes it sets the tree on fire, sometimes it does 
nothing at all, on the other hand CAU always causes the cell to do the same 
thing, add histidine to a protein sequence. There is no evidence lightning 
has ever built something complex, there is plenty of evidence that life and
computers have. Also lightning has only one letter and a language needs at 
least two, the genetic code has 4.
                

        >To have a language one must have MEANING 


Certainly. If I hand you a message that has meaning to you it will do 
something to you, the message CAU means something to the ribosomes in a cell 
making a protein and it does something to it.


        >Both instances merely involve cause and effect, without any

I have nothing against cause and effect, the only alternative is randomness.

Your belief is bolstered by fact.  I remember reading a SA article several
years ago that linked the number of teenagers (as a percentage of
population) with the rise and fall in the incidence of violent crime in the
US.  Unfortunately, I don't remember which issue it was in; you could try
a search on their web-site though.

As the Big Bang theory is popular these days, it is obvious that the

it is difficult for me to explain where i am going with this thread.  my
fault.the notion is that as governments get more technology that makes it easier

for that government to oppress its people, these same people compensate
by voting more libertarian, perhaps as a result of a healthy fear of misuse
of the technology by the government.  circular reasoning?

we have seen some post the notion that we should eschew the technology that
takes away privacy.  i suggest we develop the technology and eschew the
government control.  we can do it!  spike

*Eventually* yes, but not before the singularity, which is at least a

I reccommed that you read "the Transparent Society" (1998), by david Brin. Actually,
you may prefer to read "Earth"(1990), also by Brin, instead, since it's a science
fiction book that incorporates ideas from the other scolarly work.

Basically, Brin states the obvious: the technology of surviellence is advancing
exponentially, and we can't stop it. This means that government, and just about
anybody else with enough money, can find out just about anything they want to
about what an individual does in public. Brin's solution to the problem is
simply to agree that all actions in public places are public, and give access
to the scanners to anybody at all who wants it.

By now, you are probably objecting to this violently as a gross invasion of privacy.
I don't like the consequences either, but I agree with the premise and I cannot
think of a viable alternative that is better. How do you propose to stop an
observer, government or private? by force of law? How? do you propose to make it
illegal for me to hook up a web camera in my car that runs continuously? or carry
a web camera with me all the time? remember, I'm a private citizen, not a policeman.

If you do intend to make it illegal, I must assume that you feel that law enforcement
is a valid concept and that government is necessary. If you to not intend to make it
illegal, you must enforce the law yourself or through a collective. But you will
be attempting to enforce a law against dissemenation of information that I acquired
in a public place. This is ethically unreasonable and technically very difficult.

Brin sympathsizes with and shares our desire for privacy. Both he and I agree that
privacy is desirable. It's just becoming incresingly less feasible. Please don't respond
that "privacy is good, we must must keep it." Instead, please describe an approach to
ensuring privacy that may work.

Brin's solution is to say that since we can't protect our privacy from the government and
other wealthy organizations and individuals, then the government and others should not
have privacy either. This is what is meant by "so what?" When everybody's public activities
are reviewable by everybody else, the range of acceptable activity will get a lot
broader.

When I saw the the thread about the infinite regress of
turtles/particles/explanations, I smiled a very big smile, for it reminded
me of a delightful experience.

Hara Ra and I have been friends for over 25 years, and I was visiting him
some months ago.  He had read Ken Wilbur's "Sex, Mind and Ecology" which
discussed the concept that nature seems to be organized heirarchically
(atoms, molecules, cells, etc.) and defines the essential "unit" of this
hierarchy as a 'holon'. Hara Ra commisioned Thom Atkins to make a sculpture
based on this idea and the
notion of Fractal Turtles ("fracturtle").  

So Thom, the artist, made Hara Ra a marvelous bronze cast sculpture.  It
shows Hara Ra as himself wearing a large turtle shell, spinning the world
on one finger while standing on the back of a large turtle, whose four feet
rested on four smaller turtles, whose 16 feet rested on the backs of 16
smaller turtles, which then stand on 64 yet smaller turtles!

Hara Ra named the sculpture "Fractal Turtles", (Thom calls it "Tortelinni")
since like a fractal, it is self similar, i.e., one can take a small portion
and enlarge it to get the same image as the original.  And he pointed out that
since the turtles are half sized at each level, the bottom level of "turtle
dust" is found at the plane two Big Turtles below Hara Ra on the sculpture.
So, an infinite number of levels of turtles, ever smaller, would converge
at a finite distance below the Original Turtle.

Hara Ra mentioned that Thom Atkins is willing to make more of these if
anyone is interested.

For me, seeing his "Fractal Turtles" was an experience of great delight,
combining beauty with the fascination of a story and a concept marvelously
expressed artistically.

I agree.  Perhaps it also has something to do with the fact that a large
percentage of the  people who commit violent crimes are in prisons by the time
that they're old.  Even if they are not caught the first time they commit a
violent crime, they'll be caught the second or third or fourth time.  Usually
and hopefully, anyway.

     A lovely idea. The problem becomes one of sovereignty. Any nation 
that you are offshore of (even in international waters) will want to 
impose it's form of government on you as soon as you build something 
worth owning, taxing, etc. And, if you have the conventional weaponry to 
defend yourself against such a power, then the power in question's best 
interest lies in destroying what you are attempting to create in the 
building stages. The only real hope I can see for this type of endeavor 
lies in the fact that most governments are extremely ignorant. One 15 
year old with an outmoded commodore and a good brain can do more damage 
to civilian and military infrastructure in most countries than an atomic 
bomb. Maintaining strict neutrality, and reciprocal trade and travel 
agreements probably wouldn't hurt either.

   I agree. 5% think, 5% think they think, and 90% wouldn't think if you 
sat them down and forced them to. If you look at it from a memetical 
point of view, the society creates conditions where hypocrisy, laziness, 
and stupidity are rewarded, and honesty, diligence, and intelligence are 
punished. Fortunately, the empowerment of the information age is 
changing this equation. (Just not quickly enough for us 
elitist-egalitarians) One of the major shifts I see is from a bias 
toward power-over ( Conquistadors, Hierarchal systems) to one of 
power-with (Unions, guilds, mentors, free information). When Nanotech 
gets here full bore, the lack of scarcity of natural resources should 
complete this process, provided the society can be set up to revere 
self-actualization instead of control over, and cruelty towards, others. 



>Transhumanism linked to a practical (based on facts) socio-political
>worldview would be unbeatable, the best ideology ever. 
     
    It's not necessarily Transhumanism (from a technological 
standpoint). Its any non-Hierarchal system of thought and belief that 
allows a placement of the concept of the "collective good" to be 
socialized in an honest, real way will suffice. I know Pagans, and 
Wiccans, and Druids, and Taoists, and Buddhists, Confuscists, et. all, 
who all feel the same way. It's a matter not of ideology, but of 
perception. Given a lack of scarcity of natural resources, it doesn't 
even have to be practical.

    But power and wealth aren't what they used to be. Who has more 
power, in an ideological, world-shaping way- Mahatma Gandhi, or Pol Pot? 
Who has more money, the team that designed Oak (now Java), or Bill 
Gates? Power-with, when correctly applied returns many times over to the 
wielder. Power-over is dissipated, since it is a non-cyclical system. To 
be bold is good, and wonderful. Use that ability to make others bold.

Did it matter much to them after they found out that the war really WAS over?
Probably not.  Did they know the war was over on Nov. 11 before they received
other confirmation of it?  Absolutely not.  The war could've ended several
days later and on November 11th they still would have thought it to be ended
then.  Therefore, they did not know.  I'm not sure what the point of the story
is though.  Like I said, we really don't require knowledge to function, just a
series of luckily true beliefs (like the men in the boat were lucky) or a
series of handy false beliefs.  But perhaps the possession of knowledge is a
good in itself.
                 
 
 << Making predictions and manipulating the world is the most we can hope for,

 an TV camera. >>

Your first statement goes well beyond making predictions and manipulating the
world.  It says something deeper about the reality of the world.  So, I think
simply to make the argument that we can only hope for predictions and theories
of manipulation you must actually refute that argument (rather like the
subjectivist who claims that it's true that there is no objective form of
truth).  And I'm a bit suspicious of comparisons of the brain to the computer,
by the way.  They're well and good up to a point of course.  But every era has
seen its own favorite form of comparison, from a mechanical comparison (in the
18th and 19th centuries) to a "switchboard" comparison (early 20th century)
and now a computer comparison, and all have in one way or another taken the
analogy too far.  Our brains are different from computers not merely in terms
of the quantity of connections but in organization and quality.  They don't
react to stimuli in the same way a computer does, because stimuli to a
computer does not produce any mental content whereas in the brain it sometimes
does.

 << Our brain uses theories to explain these signals, so would intelligent  
 computers. Theories explain how some sense sensations relate to other sense 
 sensations. For example we receive information from our eyes,  we interpret 
 that information as a rock moving at high speed and heading toward a large 
 plate glass window, we invent a theory that predicts that very soon we will 
 receive another sensation, this time from our ears, that we will describe as 
 the sound of breaking glass. Soon our prediction is confirmed so the theory 
 is successful, but we should remember that the sound of broken glass is not
 broken glass, the look of broken glass is not broken glass, the feel of 
 broken glass is not broken glass. What "IS" broken glass? It must have stable
 properties of some sort or I wouldn't be able to identify it as a "thing",  
 I don't know what those ultimate stable properties are, but I know what they
 are not, they are not sense sensations.  I have no idea what glass "IS". 
 The sad truth is, I can point to "things" but I don't know what a thing "IS" 
 and I 'm not even sure that I  know what "IS" is, and an intelligent computer
 would be in exactly the same boat I am.>>             
                            
I think though that physics has taken us a long ways towards understanding
what a thing is, and that we understand the meaning of "is" in its existential
sense rather well; and if we don't then I think that we can understand what it
means, especially given our frequent use of it.   
 

<< Definitions should be consistent and are useful when communicating ideas
with 
 other people but when it comes down to it, they're just words about words 
 that are defined by still more words and round and round we go. Examples are 
 far more important.>>

Definitions are derived ultimately I think from examples, but I also think
that to truly understand why the examples are relevant and important we must
extract definitions and meaning from them on a conscious, not merely
unconscious level.  To not play close attention to the concepts we take for
granted is to fall into a pit of ignorance and stagnation.  Given the many
concepts taken for granted that fell apart when finally subjected to close
scrutiny, I think this only makes sense.
          
 
<< Give me an example, I don't care how wild or exotic, of a way to prove that
 there is something more fundamental than information.>>

Well... we'd proceed from an explanation showing information to really be a
set of facts about something to an explanation showing that facts refer to
aspects of the world to a conclusion that aspects of the world "cause" the
existence of facts and information, and that therefore information is caused
by that which information is about, and that therefore there is something more
fundamental than information.
 
 
 << But nothing can provide anything but information.>>

What about food, or light, or oxygen?
                   
 
 << You are not a brain in a skull as you'd assumed you are a brain in a vat. 
 The day after you were born your brain was removed and placed in a artificial
 nutriment bath. You have no sense organs but the parts of your brain that  
 would have received information from them now receive input from a vast 
 digital computer providing you with a virtual reality. >>

Hilary Putnam's old brain in a vat story eh?  Well here's the thing.  I don't
see how such a story can be disproven.  Not yet anyway.  This doesn't mean
that it's impossible to disprove, only that there doesn't seem to be any way
to do so at the moment.  Perhaps as we become more aware of the assumptions
and structures involved in our thought, we'll stumble upon a contradiction in
it.  In any event, all we really have to show to defeat skepticism is show how
knowledge is possible =despite= stories like the above.  This is along the
lines of Nozick's explanations vs. arguments distinction.  

 
<< Prove I'm wrong and you've proven there is something more fundamental than 
 information. But you can't. >>

Proving the story right or wrong doesn't necessarily have anything to do with
proving anything more fundamental than information.

<< Metaphor? I seems just about as exact and concrete as things get. The cell 
 certainly acts like it understands what the nucleotide triplet CAU means, 
 it does things differently when it receives the message and that's what  
 information is supposed to do, we do the same thing. Don't take my word for 
 it, go to the laboratory and ask the cell what CAU means and it will always 
 tell you exactly the same thing, histidine>>

The cell doesn't really understand anything though.  It's merely responding to
stimuli WITHOUT understanding either the stimuli or anything else.  It's not
conscious.  You may as well talk of a paper "understanding" water when it
blots it up.

                 
  <<        >One computer no more communicates with another than the lightning
         >communicates with a tree when it cuts it in half.  
 
 The effects of lightning are not repeatable, sometimes it blasts the tree in 
 3 parts, sometimes 4, sometimes it sets the tree on fire, sometimes it does 
 nothing at all, on the other hand CAU always causes the cell to do the same 
 thing, add histidine to a protein sequence. There is no evidence lightning 
 has ever built something complex, there is plenty of evidence that life and
 computers have. Also lightning has only one letter and a language needs at 
 least two, the genetic code has 4.>>

The effects are repeatable if the strength and angle of the bolt of lightning
are the same, and the receiver of the "message" is the same, just as the
results of a program (ignoring randomization functions) would be the same if
the input were the same.  Lightning has many letters, formed by the different
angles and strengths.  But obviously lightning does not "communicate" with any
tree.  And, therefore, clearly, neither does any other non-conscious thing.
                 
 
 <<Certainly. If I hand you a message that has meaning to you it will do 
 something to you, the message CAU means something to the ribosomes in a cell 
 making a protein and it does something to it.>>

CAU doesn't mean anything to the ribosomes.  It causes ribosomes to react in a
certain way, but so what?  If you hand me a message, AND I understand it, then
it has meaning to me.  If I do not understand it, it has no meaning to me
despite the fact that it causes certain reactions in my brain.  If meaning
were simply anything that causes a reaction in something else, then I wouldn't
have to understand the message for the message to have meaning.  But I do.
Therefore understanding is necessary for meaning and is necessary for
language.

I will attend the CNS 98 (Computational NeuroScience) conference in
Santa Barbara July 26-30. Afterwards I and my colleauge Mikael have
planned to do some travel through California and likely Arizona for
around a week. Any suggestions on what transhuman and scientific
places in the region are worth a visit?

Help! I've recently developed a web-based survey (multi-page) designed to
assess the general public's familiarity with and attitudes toward the idea
of Cryonics, and I need help writing the CGI script to process the input
data and create a database which could be imported into SPSS or some other
statistical program. I've visited several sites that discuss these scripts
and if it was a simpler form, I'd keep at it but I just don't have the
skills and really don't have the time to learn PERL.  If you're familiar
with CGI and could volunteer the hour or so it would proably take to make
this survey interactive, the cryonics community and I would be appreciative.
If you can help, please e-mail me directly.  I'd also appreciate any ideas
from others on this list regarding how I might get maximum exposure for this
survey with minimum expense.

Once it's on-line and interactive, I'll give out the address and request
feedback from y'all.

Thanks,

Scott Badger

Howdy, 'Tropes,

I seem to remember a moment in Linda Nagata's novel _Tech Heaven_ in which
we are told that the protagonist Katie Kishida has refused to undergo any
kind of cosmetic surgery for fear that it would interfere with
rejuvination protocols in some unspecified way.  Any ideas out there about
what she might have in mind?

Best, Dale

Of the many claims about post-"Breakthrough" technological futures I've
come across, the one that has seemed to me the most outrageously
implausible is Ed Regis's suggestion (following Bernard Williams) that it
would resemble Sunday afternoon in the American suburbs.  The thing I like
least about Jim Halperin's generally fine and very rewarding novels --
especially _FI_ -- is that he provides a vision of the future that comes
close to Regis's suburban singularity.  It is interesting that he manages
to avoid the more plausibly implausible weirdnesses of Vinge, Banks,
Williams, and Nagata by making a few, imho, wildy counter-extropic
stipulations, most conspicuously the ideas that 1, we can keep AI and SI
under wraps by legislative fiat, and 2, that "total honesty" is
technologically enforcable and socially beneficial (not to mention
philosophically coherent in the first place).  I enjoyed Halperin's novels
quite a lot (and of course they make fabulous and sorely needed
immortalist propaganda), but was I alone in thinking that provisos 1 and 2
enabled Halperin to sidestep many of the thornier problems we are likely
to confront in the next five decades?  Best, Dale

Isn't part of the problem with privacy debates that they rely on a
private/public distinction (resonating with the image of the "individual"
confronting the "state") that is getting creaky with age?  What does
privacy mean in the first place when we're talking about hive minds and
globe-girdling competing PPLs?  It does seem that surveillance is only
getting more powerful and more ubiquitous.  If that is the case, we may be
able to preserve functional privacy only by multiplying the perspectives
from which we are monitored.  We are in a sense veiled when we
are multiply surveilled, precisely because the institutions and
individuals that track us are all *interested* ones and so too their
perspectives will be interested.  In other words, "privacy" may come to
mean a space of interpretive indeterminacy produced by the collision of
indefinitely many competing institutional interpreters.  Best, Dale

First, I'll introduce myself as proclus (url below).  

This is something that I've thought about.  I'm trying to track the
effects of my life extension regimen.  Therefore, I don't want to cover
up the short comings of my program.  In other words, if I age, I want to
see it.  I don't want my aging to be hidden like a viper in a bush.

For this reason, I'm avoiding cosmetic surgery, inhibitors, and any
other superficial technique.  Heck, I'm even squeamish about
vasectomy!.  

Whatever we do, we are risking that it will interfere with future
rejuvenating technologies.  Technologies can be incompatible with each
other.  There can be harmful drug interactions.  The less you do, the
better.  You have to balance the risk.  Do I take the risk on
technologies that will give me life extending results today, or do I
risk on technologies that will only give me superficial results (like
viagra).  I agree with Katie K.

proclus
surfing the cryo-stream

BTW, I hate to be a crank, but I find all this talk of cryonics quite
boring.  Fighting entropy with a nitrogen bath is a little extreme,
don't you think?  Can you really live life in a zero entropy
environment?  What about all of the body processes that are entropy
driven, like the life sustaining concentration gradients, and some
important biochemical interactions?  The real fact is, without entropy,
we don't exist.  Life gets pretty monotonous in a nitrogen bath.  ;-}

An idea of mine that's been floating around for a
while: remote bookmarks.  NS Communicator 4.5 will
do one side of it with "Smart Browsing"
(http://home.netscape.com/communicator/v4.5/).
Smart Browsing gives the user a list of related
webpages taken from a central server.  I'd like to
see a way the end user can add to a database of
remote bookmarks. This could be done with a small
plug-in - click the "remote bookmark" button and
you're asked for a brief description, and category
choice of the current page.  If we started a
server for transhuman topics we could use logins
to keep a check on any unwanted abuse of the
system.  I have no experience with plug-ins but I
wouldn't imagine this to be a hard task.

I saw Jim Halperin (The Truth Machine, The First Immortal) speak and he made
this same point.  He seemed to say in The Truth Machine that terrorists and
criminals will have increasingly destructive weapons available to them and
it won't be long before we will be practically forced to create some means
of identifying the crazies (e.g. an infallible truth machine).  He thinks
the price we will have to pay in terms of loss of privacy is the tradeoff we
will have to make.

    You seem to be saying that the more "tidal influence" a body has, the
rarer its atmosphere will be. Is that correct?

Agreed.  Also, the Grand Canyon in northern Arizona.  It's certainly

Yes, it seems that bodies with a higher level of tides from other bodies acting
on them in proportion to their own surface gravity and/or diameter will tend to
have thinner atmospheres, in relation to similarly sized/similar gravity bodies
with lower levels of tidal influence from other bodies. I am sure that there is
another factor invoved in terms of solar flux levels... but that is the main
gist of my argument.

To establish the relationship between age and violence, one would need
to eliminate other age-related factors.  I believe that wealth increases
with age.  I believe that a lack of money is the leading cause of
violence.  Persons with money resort to violence less often to obtain
what they need or desire.

Before promoting advanced age as a PR point, consider the negative PR
that advanced age may bring to mind.

    What exactly makes something unethical is *your* opinion of the act,
even tho
I may feel it to be an ethical act.
    Ethics and morals are totally subjective.
    Why should you care? I don't know WHY you should care, but I'm pretty
damn sure you make ethical judgements every day, so they must be
important for some reason.

You would have a angioplasty or bypass though, one would hope..

	Look, if improvements in your physique, such as face lifts, hip replacements,
cosmetic surgery, Chanel moisturizer,  or any other now-on-the-market-anti-
aging methods actually interfere, in some scientifically-proven way, with
some later medical breakthrough, OK.  I believe that is what the original post
was inquiring about...
	It did happen that certain AIDS medications *did* in fact preclude the use of
later inhibitors, so it is possible...   but  I don't think letting your roots
grow in grey or letting your skin sag has much to do -one way or the other-
with life extension as I understand it.. as well, I think that the medically
enduced efforts of a person to look young, feel young, and remain culturally
attractive, can only enhance how one feels about one's self, enhancing one's
sex life..  job opportunities... all that good stuff...
my take on all of this is that life's length is not ultimately the goal, but
it's quality and amount one can get out of it.  
Plus it's promoting your self as a transhuman..
I favor enhancements of quality and excellence of the human condition of all
type, including surgery and artifice.

Considering the interest that this thread has generated, why don't we get a
late summer  reading club/discussion group going on the topic ?   Perhaps we
could all throw around some suggested readings on the theme of "Self, Others &
The Politics of Immortality", and once we can reach an agreement slate one
week for the discussion of each book...  anybody up for it ???   I'll take it
upon myself to jot down the names of all proposed materials, then post the
list, and we could vote a pre-determined number of selections in or out.   The
reading order would be chronologically.    Perhaps everybody could select 1
"classical" selection and one "contemporary".    Anybody up for it ?

Does anyone have a copy of a two volume book, written in the late 1800's or
around the turn of the century, possibly by one of the Leaky's entitled "A
History of the Warfare between Science & Theology in Christendome" or any
publication history of it ???

'til the Kingdom cometh...  Singularity or not, it is possible to achieve
certain degree of independence and self-regulation in order to pursue
transhumanistic goals.  The point is not to ignore social and political
environment, but to outmaneuver it and use it for your own advantage 
while taking advantage of existing infrastructures without wasting time
and precious resources on building your own.

There is also the factor that crime tends to be higher in welfare states that
limit support to males beyond childhood. Once the boys grow up and can't live off
the welfare trough, which they have been raised to beleive they are 'entitled'
to, they certainly are pissed.

There is also another physiological/environmental factor at work. Lead ingestion
in childhood has been difinitively linked with agressive behaviors and higher
incidence of criminal activity. Since homes that still have lead paint in them
(which children are prone to eat because the lead compound tastes sweet) are
typically occupied by poor people, poor people tend to have a higher incidence of
criminal records than more affluent people. However, there is an additional
factor at work. Researchers have often wondered why rural poor people, though
just as likely to live in lead paint infested dwellings, have a lower incidence
of criminal records than urban poor. One contributing factor may be the use of
fluoridation in drinking water. A recent study shows that flouridated water will
increase the human body's ability to absorb lead from the digestive tract, thus
raising the body's level of lead for a given diet of lead paint. So poor people
growing up in rural lead painted homes with sources of drinking water that are
not flouridated are going to have a lower average lead level in their body than
urban poor people, and thus have a lower agression level, and liklihood of
commiting violence.

As to the age connection, one can simply look at it as a process of elimination.
Young violent offenders typically commit violence against other violent
offenders. By the time they are old, the most violent have been killed off, put
in jail for life, while the smart ones have gotten away with it and might have
learned their lesson. So older folk are less likely to be violent because the
members of their generation that were violent are already dead.

That's far from obvious to me. I agree that exponential growth is involved 
but I come to the opposite  conclusion. If I increase the complexity of my 
encryption algorithm so that it takes me twice as long to encrypt a message, 
I have made my code not twice,  but millions of times more difficult for an 
attacker to break. The government  has access to more powerful computers than 
I do, but not that much more powerful. For the first time in human history 
everybody on Earth will soon  have the ability to communicate with anyone on 
Earth in complete privacy.

Of course there is still the matter of physical privacy, secret cameras,  
microphones and the like, I'm sure they will be used but I see no way they 
could keep everyone under surveillance all the time as Brin thinks, there is  
no enough wireless bandwidth, the signal can be blocked or jammed and due to  
the wave nature of light there is a limit to how small a camera can be made.
          

        >Brin's solution to the problem is simply to agree that all actions

        >anybody at all who wants it.


I haven't read "The Transparent Society" and have absolutely no intention of  
doing so. I don't know if Brin's views have moderated, but I do know that 
when I corresponded with him on this subject a year and a half ago he made no  
distinction between public and private places, there were no private places
and everybody would live every second of their lives in a fishbowl, just as 
Trueman did in the movie.

I must say that corresponding with Brin was  the strangest experience I ever 
had on the net. His first letter was almost friendly and pretty intelligent 
but in each subsequent letter he seemed to drop another 15 IQ  points. 
It was very odd and I have no explanation for it.
          

        >How do you propose to stop an observer, government or private? by         
        >force of law? 


No, I'm willing to take my chances with technology, if you're smarter than me  
and get through my privacy defenses then so be it.
          

        >I must assume that you feel that law enforcement is a valid concept 
          
Yes.
          
        >and that government is necessary. 

No.

        >please describe an approach to ensuring privacy that may work.


I want no special treatment and I certainly don't want privacy laws, I just 
want government to get out of the way, I'll take care of my privacy concerns 
myself.              

        >Brin's solution is to say that since we can't protect our privacy         
        >from the government and other wealthy organizations and individuals,

I guess he hasn't changed much, that's what he was peddling before, but first 
he explained to me how evil capitalists and the "techo-elite" were and how 
enlightened government bureaucrats can be. He told me there was not even one 
example in history were anonymity or as he put it, selling "masks" to the
oppressed, had helped them.  He told me secrecy was always bad because it was 
the enemy of accountability.
 
I told him, politely I think, that all the evil corporations have ever done  
was little more than mischief compared to the horrors governments have 
committed. I told him  that whatever virtues his Transparent Society might 
have were irrelevant because it was inherently unstable and so would never 
happen, the idea of a powerful man like the president of the USA allowing 
anybody on earth to watch his every move 24 hours a day was not realistic. 
I then said those who sold phony ID papers (masks) to the Jews and enabled 
them to escape German murderers in the 1930's and 40's certainly helped them 
and deserve praise. I asked Brin if he opposed the secret ballot used in all 
modern democracies.

Brin responded to my points by calling me a liar, an ignoramus, a paranoid 
little boy, and some other stuff I'd rather not repeat, then he got nasty. 
He implied that I was anti Semitic. I still don't know how on earth he got  
that bizarre idea into his head or why he became so hysterical, but I had the  
strong hunch that if I wrote to him again he would reply by questioning the
marital state of my parents and by telling me to do things that may not be  
anatomically possible. I decided that the very last thing he said to me was 
good advice, he advised that I "SHUT UP!", so I did. 

As I said it was all very odd.

I'd reccomend John Stuart Mill's _Utilitarianism_ and _On Liberty_.  Then
I'd especially reccomend Chapters 41-43 of David Friedman's _Machinery of
Freedom_. All of these are already online at:

Utilitarianism:
gopher://gopher.vt.edu:10010/02/122/3
On Liberty:
ftp://wiretap.area.com/Library/Classic/liberty.jsm
Machinery of Freedom:
http://www.best.com/~ddfr/Libertarian/Machinery_of_Freedom/MofF_Contents.html

These don't relate explicitly to immortality, however, but IMO immortality
isn't particularly a special case: dying is always bad for our well-being,
no matter how old we become.

Also, as I seem to recall, this debate arose from asking ethical questions
about Alife; since I am a utilitarian I must first ascertain how and to
what extent an Alife-form is or isn't made better off before I can begin
to answer questions about dealing with it ethically.  Unfortunately, since
there isn't really a convenient example of Alife that we can point to and
say "This Alife-form is better/worse off," it seems to me impossible to
determine how or even *if* it could be made better or worse off. 
Therefore, if you believe that consequentialism is true, then we must
concede that we have no basis upon which we could even begin to answer
ethical questions about Alife. 

Oh! of course, how silly of me to forget.  The primary argument which is
often levelled against me when I speak out in favor of immortality is
population growth; I definitely want to reccomend Julian Simon's _The
Ultimate Resource 2_, which puts these arguments to shame.  It's also

  IAN: The magic word here is "testosterone."
  A graph showing the rise and fall of test-
  osterone in the male over lifespan maps like
  a glove onto the graph showing violent crimes
  by males. Not only that, women who commit vio-
  lent crimes have been shown to have higher
  levels of, you guessed it, testosterone:

  Violent women have higher testosterone:

  http://pslgroup.com/dg/3a046.htm 

  High testosterone linked to violent crime: 
  http://www.crime-times.org/95c/w95cp4.htm 

  Also see: Journal of the American 
  Medical Association, June 14, 1995.

  There is also the phenomenon known as "roid rage"
  in which steroid users become dangerous violent.

  See: American Journal of Psychiatry: "Domestic violence 
  associated with anabolic steroid abuse." 1993; 150:348. 

  American Journal of Psychiatry: "Violent crime possibly 
  associated with anabolic steroid use." 1989; 146:679. 

  Life extension protocols might actually extend
  the period of life in which testosterone was at
  a high level, since its decline is associated
  with aging. Some Lextension material talks about 
  increasing levels of testosterone in older men.

Absolutely agree ...

I also agree that it is probable that persons with money resort to violence
less often, as there is no material need.  But you have to be careful about
what one defines as a 'leading cause'. For example, the large male
population could be seen as the leading cause of violence.

As a bit of anecdotal evidence for the connection between age and
violent crime, I am acquainted with a number of men who committed
violent crimes in their youth.  Ten years later, despite being monetarily no
better off today, they admit to having 'slowed down' and wouldn't
consider performing the acts today.

Ethics is not my field but I was never of the opinion that something is
unethical because *you* perceive it to be.  I always thought the acid test
boiled down to whether you were doing harm to another person or not.  And
not harm as you may narrowly interpret it, but harm as perceived by the
victim of your actions (or inactions). "Do unto others as you would have
them do unto you" just doesn't hold water anymore.  The new Golden Rule is,
"Do unto others as they would have you do unto them."

S.B.
