hi all,

Finally some good news out of the congress: they are reintroducing SAFE
"Security and Freedom through Encryption"  loosening regulations on
data-scrambling software. Not perfect but better than the current situation.

More good news, the people advertising for help killing doctors providing
abortions have been nailed (Nuremberg Files was the site that  posted the
names, phone numbers, and home addresses of abortion doctors, and then
struck out their names as they were murdered one by one).

Both pieces available from the best code developer's shed in town

<http://beta.devshed.com/News/>

What is the extropian position on these two? We no doubt all agree about
free crypto, and certainly I am glad the Nuremberg decision happened this
way. They are perfect example of first-use force hiding behind free speech.
These anti own-body control memes retard the rate at which we get to
transcend ourselves

best tim

I agree with everything, except for abortion being the ownership-of-body
argument.  The only issue in abortion is responsibility and expenses for
unborn children.  I wrote a piece on it once (see my website).
People abort pregnancy not because they are worried for their bodies.
The reason usually is, they don't want to have children.
If you suggested them to take the fetus outside their body 
to be brought to term in a vat, their decision would not change.

So the question is, what is intelligent life and who carries 
responsibility for it.  Imagine what the debate would look like
if humans laid eggs or spawned caviar.

Body ownership is just a populist argument.
It is the point in body part market debate, but in no way in abortion.

Because it doesn't appear to be true. If I change some of those

it is today.

They weren't using force at all, IIUC, first or otherwise.  While it is
true that some of the people they listed were killed, I think it extremely
unlikely that the killers did it *because* they saw this on the internet
(if they even did). 
I think it is good that they stopped, but bad that they *were* stopped,
if you get my meaning. :(  Unless specified otherwise in individual
contract, I'd want *any* free speech allowed, even "Fire!" in a crowded
theater...  Of course, this would always be covered by contract...

This is a common claim, that random evolution won't produce complex
organisms very fast.  It seems like a million monkeys typing on
keyboards which will never turn out the works of Shakespear.  Most
people don't realize how easily things can get organized at the
molecular level.

One example I like to cite is crystal growth.  Image a lot of little
crystal cubes bouncing around in a liquid solution.  The randomly
bounce, they randomly stick together, they randomly break apart.  What
are the chances that they will grow a large cubic crystal structure
instead of a random shaped lump?  Very high.  It actually is
statistically more likely to result in a large cubic structure than any
random shape.

Why?  If two cubes touch corners, they are only stuck together at one
point.  A small amount of vibration will knock them loose.  If two cubes
touch edges, they are stuck together along an entire line.  It takes
more force to knock them loose.  If two cubes touch sides, they are
stuck together by whatever area overlap.  The more area that overlaps,
the more force it takes to break them apart.  Here's the clencher:  The
strongest bond possible, and the most overlap possible, is when the
cubes are perfectly aligned, and their square sides are 100% in line
with the cube next to them.  Cubes that are out of line or rotated at a
different angle than the cubes next to them cannot achieve a 100% bond.

When these cubes bounce around, they randomly touch, stick, vibrate, and
unstick.  The closer the cubes line up perfectly, the stronger the bond
is, and the less likely they are to come unstuck.  Cubes that are lined
up tend to stay lined up.  Cubes that are out of line tend to become
unstuck and bounce around.

Statistically speaking, these cubes are more likely to line up in rows
and columns, than in random piles.  They are more likely to form larger
cubic structures than any other shape.  The bottom line is, they aren't
randomly thrown together.  The laws of the universe promote order and
regularity.  Given random evolution, little cubic crystals will evolve
into larger and more complex cubic structures.  This is like water
flowing down hill.  It's not a miraculous inexplicable event.  It is the
nature result of random evolution, which prefers organization over
chaos.

I don't buy it.  Children raised in a kook-free environment have far
better defenses against kookiness.  Rather than thinking of kookiness as
normal, they see it as being exceptionally stupid and spit it back.  It
is not necessary to read the National Enquirer, just Martin Gardner. 
Perhaps in a generation, if we completely stamped out all kookiness
everywhere and foolishly did not place "Science:  Good, Bad, and Bogus"
on school reading lists, the first kooky meme that arose would sweep a
defenseless world.  I highly doubt it.

Even so, let us assume that a certain minimal exposure to kookiness is
necessary; and that the exposure gained from reading back issues of the
Skeptical Inquirer is inadequate.  The level of kookiness on this list
has still risen above optimum, and, moreover, it would be just as easy
to gain kookiness exposure by either reading other lists or the National Enquirer.

Even if this particular forum had its kookiness reduced to zero, I think
the benefits outweigh risks, even if Crocker's projection were a certainty.

Even supposing that the Extropians list moves and the rest of the planet
follows, perhaps because we developed and made available
collaborative-filtering software, the benefits still outweigh the risks.
 The level of kookiness on the planet is way above optimum.  I do not
believe that even CF applied globally would wipe out kookiness.

CF does have a possible problem in that it could completely insulate,
say, Democrats from Libertarians as well as vice versa.  If we, who are
developing the software, add a special maximally-important rating for
"changed my worldview", or perhaps even correlate changes in ratings to
find "turnpoint" pages visited, this may compensate and over-compensate
for that effect.

Finally, I don't object to kookiness on the list, I object to stupidity,
in its manifestation as lack of original and interesting ideas. 
Mentifex is a kook, but he's an intelligent, original, and self-aware
kook who knows how to spell and how to change the subject.

They were operating on the 'rare loose nut' theory; that if enough people accessed and perused their site, they would occasionally push the rare loose nut who found them over the edge into assassination.  It is incitement to murder and dissemination of enabling info. to facilitate that purpose, pure and simple.  It's a semiotically and memetically programmed implausibly deniable cyber-doctor-killing module.

No.  Sentient beings have the ethical right to serve their own purposes,

Yes, once it was too late.  They would still be obligated to make their

Randall Randall do say

> I'd want *any* free speech allowed, even "Fire!" in a crowded
> theater...  Of course, this would always be covered by contract...

If I say "fire" in a crowded theatre and 10 people are trampled to death, I
am  responsible and will be tried for manslaughter. I support that.

On our ABC last night there was a BBC program about white supremacists
followed up by an interview with a representative of the Australian Jewish
Council.

This chap argued that saying things like "Jews are the children of Satan"
ought to be illegal because they incite crime and he direct claimed the
logic of the fire in a theatre example

I found myself disagreeing vigorously with that notion, imagining the
slippery slope ...

Let anyone say anything, is my motto. Except it turns out that I don't think
people should be able to inject dangerous false information into a crowded
theatre. Am I a hypocrite? I think not any more than i could defend myself
against a murder charge if I fired the gun on voice command instead of
pulling the trigger.

Some related examples that I have been mulling over include.

If you say "Bill, kill tim and I will give you 5 grand" that is a crime. Not
because of the speech per se. but because of the contract it creates: a
contract to initiate force. I support that.

Larry Flynt defends his right to print pornography. I support that, even
though some argue that it incites violence against women. So my position so
far is that you are not responsible for the processing that other people do
on your speech, so long as you are not directly commanding or aiding them to
commit an illegal act.

If you say something silly and wrong like "Jewish people are the children of
Satan", or "Extropians are out to sterilize humanity", I think you should be
able to say these things and that sane people can reveal the illogical
reasoning in these statements.

But if you say "these people here on this list should die and here are the
times when they are alone and here are their children's photos and class
school schedules" I think you are aiding and abetting a crime and would pay
to stop that happening.

Is that a reasonable position: free speech = all speech which does not
directly aid specific acts of violence?

Food for thought:

What is speech that it is free where action is not? When is speech action?

Why are we not free to speak lies (that is libel)?

Note too that under British Common Law, unlike US law, being correct is not
a sufficient defense against libel. So in Britain you are not even free to
speak the truth, if it harms another person's reputation. For reasons
related to this, publication of books similar to the Bell Curve can be
deemed a crime in the UK, though this is seldom enforced these days.

cheers,
tim

None of the people who post purportedly 'kooky' posts consider their own posts kooky, only those of others.  The same goes for the authors of purportedly 'rational and reasonable' posts.  Since Jahweh is not accesible on an ISDN line to render celestial judgments, these things must be decided for him/herself by the post-receiving individuals, in each individual case.  To do otherwise is to deny them the right to make their own individual judgments on these issues, and to usurp their intellectual freedoms and arrogate them to others who may be less qualified to render veridical verdicts on these multifarious matters.

I dont think god was invented to inspire warriors to fanatacism,it is a
natural result of trying to learn ways of manipulating our environment.

I remember reading about an experiment performed on pigeons.  A group of
pigeons was placed in a room and at completely random intervals grain
was dropped from the ceiling.  Over quite a short period of time the
pigeons started to move strangely, some holding one wing up, others
keeping their heads down all the time, etc.  This is where
superstition/religion originates - it is natural (and intelligent) for
us to try and control our environment for our own purposes.  The pigeon
walking around with one wing in the air was simply trying to conjure
more food from the roof, as in it's experience the food had tended to
fall when it had one wing in the air.

Obviously (hopefully) as beings become more intelligent and rational
they will begin to realise that various kinds of superstitous behavior
does not actually cause the desired results - any correspondence caused
merely by chance.

Religion is a primitive form of science - attempting to understand and
control the world by means of observed phenomena.  Unfortunately, just
like most scientific theories when they have outlived their usefulness,
it is very hard to convince people of their irrelevance once they have
gained a strong group of followers.

I find it hard to believe some of the postings on this subject.

I may be new to this list, but I was under the impression that
extropians valued free thinking, free speech, learning about all areas
of life and science, accepting the importance (and usefulness) of
hearing points of view which differ to your own own.

Now, it seems like some kind of clique are trying to claim the list as
their own personal  chat room, by either setting up democratic
censorship or just simply buying the thing outright.

Apologies if I have miunderstood anyones intent, but the tone of the
postings has seemed to me very suspect. I don't care if someone's
grammar or spelling aren't too clever - they still have a right to
express their point of view - do you want people to pass an entrance
test before being allowed to post to the list?

In principle the prefixes are a good idea, although so many of the
discussions are linked in ways which cross over the boundaries that I
think it might be a little hard (and misleading) to enforce.

Excellent point... since theists maintain that they've got a promise of
eternal life from their supreme being, they have no justification for
engaging extropy. IOW, they simply don't belong with extropians. They have
their theistic doctrine of life extension, which involves the ritualized
superstition of ceremony and tradition. Perhaps I can ignore them, but I
can't ignore your insight into why we should ignore them. Thank you.

Abortion is one of those problems for which an honest libertarian will have
to claim that libertarianism does not have a simple answer.  If the aborted
fetus was a citizen who bears rights, then abortion is probably force
against a non-aggressor, unless we conclude that the fetus itself would
rather risk abortion than pay for abortion laws.  Then again, if the
aborted fetus is not a citizen but rather a part of the mother, then
abortion is not force at all; outlawing abortion in this case is force
against a non-aggressor.

If libertarianism is defined purely in terms of the prohibition of force
against non-aggressors, then we can clearly see that libertarianism will
agree with both sides of the abortion debate, depending in this case on the
definition of a person and what qualifies consent.

Normally I like to fall back on Marshall efficiency to help answer these
questions, since it more or less maps directly on to expected utility, and
thus leaves us, more or less, with utilitarianism.  (Friedman provides a
great intro to Marshall efficiency in his "Expanded Postcript for
Libertarians" in his _Machinery of Freedom_.)

In an ideal situation we imagine that a "rational fetus" would be willing
to pay quite a bit for its own protection if it could do so; perhaps more
than it would cost to protect it, even when adjusted for the accrual of
interest.  On the other hand, it seems like trying to effectively enforce
abortion laws would require an extremely intrusive gov't, and therefore an
extremely costly gov't; since abortions can and are performed as back-alley
affairs where abortions are illegal, we might not expect such laws to be
effective no matter how expensive.  The cost of enforcing them may be so
high that even the imagined "rational fetus" wouldn't be willing to pay for
it; that the fetus would be willing to accept a higher risk of abortion
rather than pay the enormously high cost of abortion insurance.

If, in fact, abortion is so costly that the fetus would be unwilling to pay
for its enforcement, then we may think of the freedom to choose abortion in
terms of assumed consent; in the same way we make decisions for people who
are comatose and cannot directly provide their consent.  Assumed consent is
not entirely unreasonable in this context: consider a starving man who
steals food when its owner is away, and provides money to pay for the
damages.  In this case, we allow the fetus to suffer a risk to its own
life, and as a result it doesn't have to pay the costs of insurance when it
gets older, in the form of taxes paid to an intrusive gov't.

If it doesn't seem plausible that a "rational fetus" would make this
choice, consider also the fact that many unwanted children go on to live
exceptionally poor lives, so the "insurance" we provide may save the
fetus's life, but that fetus may grow up to live rather unhappily in abject
poverty, which is only made worse by the presence of an intrusive gov't
with increased taxes.  We have heard this argument before in the argument
of abortion in a somewhat different context.  Formerly, this argument may
be seen as pretty absurd: would the fetus's live be so bad that the fetus
would rather commit suicide than live it?  Obviously not.  So this
consideration alone is not a good reason for us to allow abortions to go on.

Here, however, we might imagine a "rational fetus" considering the problem
thus:  "If I pay for abortion insurance, I can greatly reduce the risk of
my being aborted before I am brought to term.  However, if we consider the
cases where I would have been aborted but wasn't, many of those leave me
with very little well-being; since the cost of insuring against abortion is
so high to begin with, I'd want to expect that I'd be getting something
really good for my money; in most of the cases where the insurance would be
useful, I wouldn't."

I think I have outlined a correct analysis of the problem of abortion in
terms of Marshall efficiency; I think most of those those who disagree with
me in this case would also disagree with using Marshall efficiency as a
moral indicator, and perhaps with utilitarianism in general.  Certainly, if
you believe that abortion is simply wrong, not as a derivative from some
other foundational rule but as a simple moral prohibition which cannot be
derived nor rejected, you will not find my argument very compelling.  Most
people do not think this way, however: most people who think that abortion
is wrong think that it is wrong because we have a prohibition against doing
harm to begin with.  This claim is problematic, and one which shouldn't be
accepted by a libertarian: we should, at the very least, presume that we
can harm an aggressor.

Moreover, I think we can also say that we can harm someone who explicitly
consents to be harmed.  This is why libertarianism is not defined in terms
of harm, but rather in terms of force, which is, by definition, some action
committed against the will of the person(s) being forced.  In light of
that, it also seems reasonable that libertarians should accept some kind of
assumed consent; here I adopt a theory of consent which assumes consent in
terms of what a "rational" agent might do, but this is not the only such
theory of assumed consent.  Some may argue that assumed consent in the case
of abortion is not meaningful: a fetus, though alive, cannot formulate its
own consent, and therefore any harm committed against it is necessarily
forced harm.  This objection overlooks the fact that although the fetus
cannot give its consent, neither can it deny consent.  And since it can do
neither, the argument that it WOULD give its own consent, if it could,
should convince us (presuming that my argument is correct!) that it is
right for us to do some amount of harm onto the fetus (in the form of the
risk of abortion) by the assumption of assumed consent.

These objections have been raised against the claim that assumed consent
even makes a difference here: that abortion is simply wrong by assumption,
or that a fetus which cannot conceive of consent cannot be assumed to give
it to us.  Further objections might agree that it matters whether or not
the fetus would give its consent, and go on to claim that my argument does
not show that the fetus would actually do so.  For example, the fetus may
not be "rational;" if not, we may have to provide abortion insurance for
the fetus, even though the fetus is making an irrational decision for
itself.  We may be morally obliged to do so if it would ask us to.  I do
not have the right to forcibly prevent my irrational friend from committing
suicide if he decides to do so; therefore I certainly have no right to
withhold abortion insurance from an irrational fetus when that insurance
may save its life.

However, am I REALLY forbidden from preventing my friend from committing
suicide?  What if I know that this bout of suicidal tendancies is
temporary, and that if I prevent him from committing suicide now, he will
thank me later and praise my decision?  While a theory of assumed consent
could certainly be abused to justify all kinds of governmental atrocities,
(and has, and will be again!) it seems like in the case of a suicide it
would also result in an ethical wrongdoing if we do not accept assumed
consent.  Libertarianism does not tell us anything about assumed consent,
since in order to formulate the idea of libertarianism one must already
know the definition of force and consent.  However, utilitarianism in this
case can provide us with a clear answer: assumed consent results in optimal
net utility as evinced by my friend's praise of me after the fact, so we
should accept it. (This only applies when the theory is correctly
formulated: clearly a theory of consent which assumed that you agreed to
let me rape you simply because you were wearing a skimpy dress would be an
ill-formed theory!)

This still does not show that the fetus would give its consent; after all,
I may be absuing the theory of assumed consent in this very case!  There
are a host of different ways this objection might be raised against me, the
most plausible of which is perhaps the argument that by my reasoning I have
assumed that the fetus would be willing to accept its own death in exchange
for the cost of abortion insurance.  We do not accept the argument that
"abortion is okay because most would-be abortions live unhappy lives,"
because unhappy life is usually better than no life at all.  However, this
objection is based on a mistake about my argument and the position from
which we must consider the fetus: we are not imagining a fetus considering
whether it should be aborted or whether it should not be aborted (and have
to pay for the cost of preventing its abortion), since obviously in this
case the fetus would accept the latter; instead, the fetus must consider
the possibility of getting NOTHING from abortion insurance and still having
to pay for it.  From this perspective, it may well be willing to suffer an
increase in the RISK of abortion in exchange for not paying for the
abortion insurance, which may well be useless.

Some may still claim that this argument leads to unethical conclusions, and
therefore we should reject it out of hand.  However, the main reason I
chose Marshall efficiency is because it maps so well onto utilitarianism;
in this case, if my argument is valid, then not only is it an argument
within libertarianism for rejecting abortion laws, but a utilitarian
argument as well.  Not everyone would be better off without abortion laws:
clearly, many fetuses who are aborted will be much worse off than they
would have been in a state which banned abortion.  However, those who were
worse off would not be MORE worse off than others would be made better off
by the freedom to choose; on average, most people would be better off than
the aborted fetuses were worse off, if my Marshall analysis is correct.

While utilitarianism is not anywhere near universally accepted as an
ethical theory, those who believe that utilitarianism is right will believe
this argument from Marshall efficiency, presuming the analysis itself is
valid.  Even if you don't accept utilitarianism, most of us do believe that
improving the happiness of all people, even at the expense of some, is a
worthwhile moral consideration.  If my argument is ethically wrong, then it
must be that both utilitarianism and libertarianism must be wrong here as
moral theories [qualified by the assumption that assumed consent is a valid
libertarian consideration].  Perhaps they are, but if you disagree with
both utilitarianism and libertarianism, you really aren't the sort of
person to whom I have intended this argument.  If you are of this camp, I
am sorry to have wasted your time: you will not find my argument
convincing, and I have nothing further to say to you.

For everyone else, however, I hope I've given you some food for thought on
this debate, and hopefully allowed you to view abortion from a direction
which you're not used to.  I know I've never heard an abortion argument
presented in these terms before, so at the very least the argument is new
on me; hopefully you'll appreciate the argument's novelty even if you
reject its content.

Good luck!

See Bruce Sterling's excellent novel _Distraction_ for an even nastier
version: an agent residing at some computer monitoring the views
expressed by certain people, keeping tabs of how "bad" they are. If
someone is too "bad" it activates a second agent. This agent normally
collects and analyzes rants in places like alt.conspiracy or
alt.kill.the.masons.and.alieninvaders, using profililing software to
gather lists of potential violent maniacs. The second agent now mails
a rant from a fellow white supremacist/illuminated
master/vorlon/concerned parent (suitably tuned) to each of them,
mentioning the "bad" person. Result when successful: dangerous maniacs
on the hunt, and the source is almost impossible to track down.

I would call that "physical law". DNA isn't a blueprint, it is more
like a recipe ("If there is more than 4.3 nanomolar of protein 346367,
produce protein 34671, 233211 and 2675"), and development unfolds
according to local selforganizing processes. The universe unfolds
according to the local application of physical law ("The
electromagnetic field at point x will change to the following
depending on the electromagnetic field at the surrounding points:
<Maxwell's equations>"). 

Lee Smolin and Linde has proposed the possibility of evolution of
universes. Some aspects of physical laws may depend on spontaneous
symmetry breaking, so if our universe can produce other universes (for
example by formation of baby universes in black hole singularities)
then these would have other "DNA2". And if their laws still remain
somewhat similar to ours, then it is not unreasonable to think that
there is an evolution process selecting for ability to create child
universes.

For my $.02 worth, I've always found it simple enough to identify the gist
of a thread and whether I was interested in reading or deleting it.  Subject
lines are not always good indicators of the quality/relevance of the content
so I typically read the first couple of posts unless I clearly recognize the
topic as uninteresting to me.  I would pay even less attention to a prefix
tag.  The subject line very quickly becomes equivalent to a prefix tag for
my purposes.  I am, therefore, generally sympathetic to Mr. Reeves position.

Hackers Reportedly Seize British Military Satellite
LONDON (Reuters) - Hackers have seized control of one of Britain's
military communication satellites and issued blackmail threats, The
Sunday Business newspaper reported.

The newspaper, quoting security sources, said the intruders altered
the course of one of Britain's four satellites that are used by
defense planners and military forces around the world.

The sources said the satellite's course was changed just over two
weeks ago. The hackers then issued a blackmail threat, demanding money
to stop interfering with the satellite.

``This is a nightmare scenario,'' said one intelligence source.
Military strategists said that if Britain were to come under nuclear
attack, an aggressor would first interfere with military
communications systems.

``This is not just a case of computer nerds mucking about. This is
very, very serious and the blackmail threat has made it even more
serious,'' one security source said.

Police said they would not comment as the investigation was at too
sensitive a stage. The Ministry of Defense made no comment.

As opposed to left-wing media distorting the truth? In my experience no-one

*Shrug* Michael's figures look silly to me, as far as I'm aware the correct
figures are around 100 deaths per year, not 1 per year. That is, a small
fraction of the number of kids who are killed in swimming pool or cycling
accidents... and a small fraction of the lives saved each year by guns.

>Your

Anti-gun lies on this issue are well-known, with many of their figures
created by claiming that 20-year-old crack dealers are 'kids'. Yes, a small
number of real kids are killed accidentally each year with guns; we can
look at improving that figure after we've dealt with the much greater risks
from pools and bicycles.

I just don't see this as an important issue at all, and can't see why anyone
would unless they're part of the anti-gun hordes; there are far more
important things to worry about. That they choose to ignore these other issues
in favor of guns tells me that they're more concerned with their anti-gun
agenda than saving kids.

An offer of contract for an illegal action is conspiracy. Conspiracy is in fact
an act of speech and/or assembly with the sole intent of planning an illegal
act. Even though speech and assembly are protected rights, when they are done to
illegal ends they are not protected (illegal in that the intent is to infringe
on the rights of others, I don't count victimless crimes and/or political
advocacy in this category myself, however others may see differently).

> Why are we not free to speak lies (that is libel)?

When they cause damage to another's reputation or ability to earn income. The
thing I don't like about libel in US courts is that not only must the speech be
false, but must be made with malicious intent, which is almost impossible to
prove.

Yes, this is a vestige of the aristocracy protecting itself from its follies. As
long as the Brits are getting rid of the hereditary peers in the House of Lords,
if they are going to throw the baby out the window, they might as well toss the
bath water with it too....

I doubt they will be so logical.

The unified theory he was looking for is in fact in string theory, more

Yes, Adrian, you must understand that to many or most people on this list, the
word 'god' is a null set or else triggers very negative memes. Most of the
highly intelligent people here on the list are rather tired of the old, worn
out, childish schoolyard bully gods, as well as the simple-minded 'don't worry,
be happy' gods. While creating a more 'spiritual' means of communicating and
understanding transhumanism and extropy is laudable, referring to future
transhumans as 'gods' is, in my mind, more of a hindrance than a help,
specifically because of all of the emotional and memetic baggage that the word
already posesses.

This is why Vinge's term of a Power seems more appropriate, though it may still
have connotations with the nation-state use of the term Power and Super-Power.
Just calling them transhumans, and eventually post-humans, brings such entities
down to a singular, everyday level that individual humans can relate to, and
the terms are sufficiently new that they don't carry any memetic baggage.

Finally, if we are all to attain god-like capability, then such capability at
that time will be considered to be merely human capability by those people. It
will only be seen as fantastic and extraordinary by those who insist on being
left in a primitive state. We should not orient our view of such a world from
the primitive perspective, if we are to become the new gods...as transhumans.
The need for a theology of ourselves would only be useful, in my mind, if we
wished the remaining primitives to worship us.....which I don't have a need
for. Do you?

Hi,

I am impressed and surprised at the quantity of discussion being given to
"whither god". I am heartened by the grappling with the concept and yearning
of many for some form/expression/rationale for spirituality. Please be
entertained by the following...

Ecclesiastes 3:10 I have seen the task which God has given to the sons of
men, to be humbled by it.
11  He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also, He has set eternity
in their heart, without which man cannot find out the work that God makes
from the beginning and to the end.

I believe we are intelligent black holes...each of us has an interior
universe that is topologically vastly larger than the size of our crania.
The more we fill the hole the stronger its pull (curiosity), and the more
which fills it (knowledge). Sometimes the hole becomes pathological, and
surrounding holes become orbital and subservient or subsumed, and
combinatoric (master/slave). On this list, there is enough economic and
social separation for converse to occur among rather dense (non-pejorative)
holes without being conclusively sucked in, or being forced to orbit one
"universe meme".

Our metaphors tell us more than we know...to keep an "open mind" leads to
potentiation of hyperdensity and achievement of qualitative inflection
points providing novel insights unavailable below X densities...novel
insights can combine to create "vision" which I will now call "outsight". An
emmissive black hole, producing powerful Meme as its projecta.

with the above in mind, consider the following

Genesis 11
1  And the whole earth was of one lip and of one speech.
2 And it happened, as they pulled up stakes from the east, they found a
level valley in the land of Shinar. And they lived there.
3 And each one said to his neighbor, Come, let us make brick, and burning
burn them. And they had brick for stone, and they had asphalt for mortar.
4 And they said, Come, let us build a city and a tower with its head in the
heavens, and make a name for ourselves, that we not be scattered on the face
of all the earth.
5  And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of
Adam had built.
6 And Jehovah said, Behold, the people is one, and the lip one to all of
them, and this they are beginning to do, and now all which they have
purposed to do will not be restrained from them.
7 Come, let Us go down and confuse their language so that they cannot
understand one another's speech.

Note 6: due to a single language...all they (we) purpose is available to
become reality

There is a gravitational attraction which results in what we call society.
Society's gravitation is geometrically increased by language. Society's time
to singularity is contracted as language is concentrated. Multiple languages
result in competing societies, thus temporarily dilating the time to
singularity. Writing creates a one dimensional parallel universe creating
more gravity (fixity) within the memetic/linguistic event horizon. Printing
made many languages die...thus reconcentrating language to populations
sufficiently large to result in pathological black holes in competition
(imperialism followed by nationalism)

Multivariant orbital Competition among pathological holes results usually in
convergeance to a single remaining hole (world power) along with more
gravity "created" by increased information density from the competition
along the lines of focused power utilation (military invention). As writing
and printing created extreme forms of information concentration
(science...money) the rate of information conflation increased
geometrically...leading to the creation of god (lower case), nuclear weapons
which the holes (ass) obeyed unreservedly. This led to a short term
semi-stable massive hole orbit during which massive quantities of
information emerged. The emergence AC power, and -importantly- of dc power
(5 volts) became a common language resulting in personal computers. TCP/IP
internetworks complete the path for return to one language. The rate of
information creation / adduction is now going off chart. The event horizon
presenting surface area to ingestion of information quanta has gone multi
nodal, multidimensional.

Gen 1:22  And Jehovah God said, Behold! The man has become as one of Us, to
know good and evil. And now, lest he put forth his hand and also take from
the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever...

We live in interesting times.

By the way, it so happens that I founded the company that may have created

Sorry for the delay, but I have been doing a lot of stuff as
usual. One thing worth mentioning was the Aleph "Power / MindDesign"
weekend where we held seminars and discussed and mental techniques ,
very stimulating and practical transhumanism. The basis for my main
talk was Mind Tools excellent website, I really recommend it for all
transhumanists: www.mindtools.com

This time, there is a bit of nanotech, some hormones, and a big chunk
of the neuropsychological effects of food and drink.

Thumbcode: A Device-Independent Digital Sign Language
Vaughan R. Pratt
http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/PS/DVI/

An interesting idea for a wearable typing method. Since the only thing
that is truly device independent in typing is the hand, Pratt suggests
using a code mapped on the hand to enter characters. The thumb is used
to touch the phalanges (12 possibilities), and by shifting by holding
together fingers enough possibilities (96) become possible to use as a
general purpose keyboard. The mapping is somewhat arbitrary, but Pratt
suggests a system partially based on frequency and various mnemonics
to map characters to the hand ('t' would be touching the tip of the
ring finger with the thumb, 'M' toughing the middle section of the
index finger while holding it together with the middle finger, and so
on). Seems quite possible to implement in hardware, whether it is
useful and ergonomic is another question.



Nanotechnology, resources and pollution control
Stephen L. Gillett
Nanotechnology 7 177-182 (1996)

A paper about the implications of nanotechnology on the
environment. Just the thing to put in the hands of the
environmentalists. Gillet points out that the thermal paradigm used
today in element separation is extremely wasteful, expensive and dirty
and that the cut-off grade of ore where extraction becomes
uneconomical is a technological rather than physical limitation. He
also shows that there are no increasing thermodynamic costs due to low
grades; it doesnt necessarily take a lot of energy to extract or
recycle something from a very dilute mixture. He then goes on to
discuss pollution control, molecular sieves and solute extraction
(such as desalination) in the perspective of nanotechnology.


"Bucky Shuttle" Memory Device: Synthetic Approach and Molecular
Dynamics Simulations
Young-Kyun Kwon, David Tomanek and Sumio Ijima
Physical Review Letters, 82:7 1470--1473, 15 February 1999

When finely dispersed diamond powder (4-6 nm) is treated with thermal
annealing under certain conditions (heated in graphite crucible in
argon to 1800 degrees C for 1 hour) oblong multiwall carbon structures
appear. In some cases they can move around inside each other, like
having a C60 trapped in a C480. It turns out that there are two
potential energy minima corresponding to lying at the ends, and if the
buckyball would be given a charge (e.g. by trapping an ion in it) then
it can be shuttled by an applied electric field. The article studies
the possibility of using this for memory storage. They simulate what
happens when writing a bit, and it turns out that the buckyball neatly
shuttles to the right end, and gently bounces to rest (the energy is
dissipated as 10 Kelvin thermal vibrations in the C480, far too little
energy to disrupt the molecule); it takes around 10 ps. They suggest a
high density memory board with aligned buckyshuttles in a hexagonal
lattice and addressing wires above and below, not unlike a ferrite
core memory. The memory is likely nonvolatile at room temperature (and
can be made more stable by using La instead of K). Switching and
access can at least be 10 Gbyte/s, and ideally 0.1 THz. Mass
production can be based on self-assembly.


Hormones

ACTH and beta-endorphin in Transcendental Meditation
Jose Rafael Infante, Fernando Peran, Margarita Martinez, Ana Roldan,
Rafael Poyantos, Concha Ruiz, Francisco Samaniego and Federico Garrido
Physiology & Behavior 64:3 311-315 1998

Meditation has physiological effects, there is nothing strange with
that. The question is what effects are there, how large are they and
can they be useful? One of the most obvious and practical application
is stress reduction and relaxation. Earlier studies have shown that TM
has some effects on the levels of various hormones. This study
compared the amount of stress-related hormones during the day among a
group of non-meditators and meditators (who had at least been
meditating twice daily for 12 months, on average they had been doing
it for 7.5 years). It turned out that the normal variation of
endorphin and ACTH during the day is changed in the TM subjects:
instead of showing a higher level in the morning than in the evening,
the meditators had roughly constant levels. The morning levels of
hormones were significantly lower among the meditators. Cortisol,
another stress-related hormone, did not differ between the
groups. Interestingly, both groups had similar anxiety levels; in this
case meditation seems to have changed the body more than the mind. The
authors speculate that the change is due to some modifications of the
hypothalamic regulation of the pituitary hormone system.



Testosterone Changes During Vicarious Experiences of Winning and
Losing Among Fans at Sporting Events
Paul C. Bernhardt, James M. Dabbs Jr., Julie A. Fielden and Candice D. Lutter
Physiology & Behavior 65:1 5962 1998

Testosterone plays an important role in social status interactions at
least among primate males, especially dominance. It has been shown
that testosterone levels increase in winners and decrease in losers
(both rhesus monkies and humans engaged in competitive activities such
as wrestling, martial arts, tennis, chess and coin flips (!)), and
this might help dominant individuals to keep their dominance since
testosterone levels partially predict the outcome of contests. Since
fans react strongly to the results of their teams and overall behave
almost as if it was *they* who won or lost, it seems likely that they
too change testosterone. This paper has studied the testosterone
levels in saliva from male sports fans before and after a match (the
first, smaller experiment was college basketball, the second the world
cup soccer match). It turned out, as expected, that winning
significantly increased the testosterone levels, while losing
decreased them. There is likely a complex biosocial web here, where
hormone levels interact with self-esteem, mood, dominance and social
hierarchies, fun stuff for psychologists of all kinds and also
suggesting that we really ought to take a look at what effects our sex
hormones have in our behavior, and what stimuli affect them.



Food and Drink

Influence of the Composition of a Meal Taken after Physical Exercise
on Mood, Vigilance, Performance
P. Verger, D. Lagarde, D. Batejat and J. F. Maitre
Physiology & Behavior 64:3 317-322

How does exercise and the composition of food affect our mood? One
obvious effect is that we become tired after exercise, but it is
slightly uncertain what the effects of meals with protein,
carbohydrates and fats have on our mood and thinking; glucose improves
memory, but carbohydrate intake can also produce a release of insulin
making us less vigilant, and proteins can change the amino acid levels
which in turn affect neurotransmittors.  Obviously, the interactions
are complex. This experiment consisted of having young men perform two
hours of nonstop athletic activity or not, and afterwards they ate one
of two different kinds of meals, one high in proteins and one low in
proteins (but high in carbohydrates). They were tested for vigilance,
memory and mood before the exercise, after the exercise, directly
after lunch and 2 hours after lunch. There was no significant
difference in how much they ate. Exercise of course made them tired,
and they were drowsy at the beginning and directly after the meal 
the men who ate between 125 and 150 g glucide were less drowsy than
the men who ate more or less.  The men who ate the protein meal
reported being happier both immediately after the meal and 2 hour
later.  However, the glucose group apparently felt a bit peppier after
exercise and lunch. People in the glucose group felt less depressed
and anxious when they are 125-175 g than when they ate more or
less. There was no difference in memory abilities between the
groups. Vigilance was increased by the exercise (since it is
arousing), but eating less than 100g or more than 150g or
carbohydrates decreases this effect. The conclusion seems to be that
eating the right amount of food is important, neither too much or too
little. Carbohydrates reduces anxiety and depression (possibly by
increasing serotonin release) while protein rich meals increase
happiness.



The impact of long-term vitamin supplementation on cognitive function
David Benton, Joyce Fordy and Jurg Haller
Psychopharmacology 117 298-305 (1995)

Vitamin Supplementation for 1 Year Improves Mood
David Benton, Jrg Haller, Joyce Fordy
Neuropsychobiology 32 98-105 1995

Two papers based on the same study. Benton has earlier argued that
micro-nutrient deficiencies cause sub- clinical psychological symptoms
in the population, so it would be interesting to see what happens if
they are supplemented for a while. There is actually rather little
known about the psychological effects of vitamins, but since at least
some are relevant for brain chemistry it is not far-fetched. They gave
volunteers placebo or vitamin supplements (10 times the US recommended
daily amount, except for vitamin A), and followed them for one
year. Already after 3 months the vitamin levels in the treated
participants were significantly raised. In women, but not in men,
mental health (as measured by a psychological questionaire; asocciated
with B2 and B6), feelings of composure (associated with B2 and
B6). Both men and women who had taken vitamins for 12 months felt more
agreeable (associated with B1, B2 and B6). In women reaction time and
attention improved. It looks like especially B6 (thiamine) improves
mood in women, but not in men. Overall, it seems like supplementation
should be allowed to take its time, the mood and cognitive effects
only appear after around a year despite the fact that the levels of
vitamins stabilize already after three. Some restructuring might be
going on in the brain during this time.


Thiamine supplementation mood and cognitive functioning
D. Benton, R. Griffiths and J. Haller
Psychopharmacology (Berl), 129:1 66--71 Jan 1997

A follow-up inspired by the above study. The authors tested the
effects of 50mg thiamine (B6) or placebo taken daily for two months on
120 females, and studied the effect on mood, memory and reaction
times. They felt significantly more clear-headed (and composed and
elated just missed statistical significance); overall mood seemed to
have improved. There was no effect on memory (recall of famous faces
or word lists). Reaction times became faster for the thiamine group
(statistically significant, but the difference was only 5% faster
really).



Blood Glucose Influences Memory and Attention in Young Adults
David Benton, Deborah S. Owens and Pearl Y. Parker
Neuropsychologia 32:5 595-607 1994

By now most of my readers likely know that glucose can enhance
memory. One reason might be that it increases the production or
release of acetylcholine, ACh. However, since Ach is also involved in
attention it is interesting to see if glucose improves attention
too. The authors tested 70 female undergraduates at a rapid
information processing task (detecting certain number series) and a
memory task, after being given a drink with or without glucose. A high
level of glucose correlated with forgetting less and having faster
reactions. Rising and falling levels of blood glucose influenced the
Stroop attention test, where people with glucose levels rising before
the test scored higher.  One interesting thing they discuss is that
the ability to handle glucose load might be an important cognitive
factor; the people who can get more glucose into the brain at the
right time have an advantage. This is why it is not just the baseline
levels of glucose that are interesting, but also how quickly the brain
can suck it from the blood. Lots of potential here for enhancement.


Effects of Alcohol on Scientific Thought During the Incubation Phase
of the Creative Process
Torsten Norlander, Roland Gustafson
The Journal of Creative Behavior
1996, 30:4 231--248

Creativity is a process; Wallas suggested the now familiar four stage
model of preparation, incubation, illumination and verification. How
does alcohol (and other drugs) affect this process? Alcohol at low
doses decreases inhibitions, so it might be expected to influence
creativity. The authors divided 60 students (male and female) into a
control, a placebo and an alcohol group. The control group got two
bottles of tonic water, the placebo group tonic water with vodka
essence and the alcohol group tonic water mixed with vodka (total
alcohol content was 1.0 ml of 100% alcohol per kg body weight). The
participants were given a scientific problem (to design an experiment
to test nature vs. nurture) to discuss, a notebook and one week to
think about it. On wednesday and thrusday night they were to drink
their bottles before going to bed. At the end they wrote a report
about their solution, which was scored by three panels: one to
identify stages of creative thought in the original discussion,
notebook and report, one panel to judge the reports depending on
scientific value and creativity and the third judging reports based on
originality. There was no difference in scientific value or scientific
creativity between the groups, but the alcohol group showed overall
more originality and more incubation of the plan. The paper suggests
that the alcohol might affect creativity using some kind of rebound
effect: the alcohol group had more incubations the mornings after
drinking than the other mornings - it might be the combination alcohol
+ sleep that is the real cause.  In earlier studies the authors have
apparently found that alcohol consumption during the illumination
phase reduced the number of creative solutions, as well as decreased
the effort and deductive thinking in the preparation phase. So a
moderate amount of alcohol may help the just the incubation part.

Well put, Shaun. This is exactly the same reason I stay; the few great
postings (and posters) outweigh the others. 

I originally joined the list back in the Old Days, 1992 I think (my
first mailing list actually). And I waguely remember fierce debates
about guns, libertarian principles and how to increase the signal to
noise ratio. Some things never change :-) But I can also definitely
say that being on this list has educated me more than most university
courses and introduced me to issues and areas I would never have
thought I would one day become interested in. Keep up the great
tradition!

I think we should all try to enhance the list. The simplest way is
non-action: don't write a posting that doesn't contribute anything,
that doesn't increase extropy or just will start needless flames. The
second simplest way is to mark the subjects correctly (hmm, harder
than simple, actually). Then comes writing well, civility, rational
thinking, forming sub-lists, killfiles and whatnot. I think
collaborative filtering and similar ideas have merit, but such
projects need to be unobtrusive and efficient before people use them
well. In the end the only ones that influence the list quality are
ourselves.

While the kill thread and topic stuff might not be necessary, I like
the idea of Kookify/Glorify! A more soft incentive to produce good
posts. 

I have been thinking of running some program through the list archives
to do data mining, for example build sociograms (who responds to
whom?), find threads where someone participates, who glorifies who and
perhaps extract clusters of discussion. Maybe the way of improving
quality of the list lies in making archives more powerful?

I believe the interest in filters rises semi-exponentially with the number

Doesn't exactly explain the situation during the stone age. Why bury
flowers with the dead? Did somebody sell them? Atheists cannot get
lynched if there is no strong urge to worship. A slightly more
believable explanation would be that cult leaders have a lot of
children, but that would suggest that cult leaders in general have
worship-inducing genes, while in reality they more often tend to be of
the sociopath phenotype (i.e opportunists exploiting an opportunity
unhampered by storng feelings of empathy). No, I don't buy that
explanation.

Why would all this ur-theology involve worship? Why did not the view

I'm not saying we should change the transhumanist meme, I'm saying we
should change (say) our meeting places (softer light on the list?
background music :-), build supporting memes with positive emotional
content (like transhumanist art) and foremost, learn to enjoy being

We really need the newbies, especially the curious ones and the ones
bursting in with a great but slightly wrong idea. Having to explain
things again and again may be tiresome, but it is training for the
time it is CNN or the entire public. Besides, it is educational and
sometimes forces one to reconsider one's thinking.

Unfortunately, yes. But it is also a good thing, having rational
people of different views makes it possible to look at questions from
more angles.

Maybe because so many of us take a binary view us/them rather than try
to find ways around the problem. What areas can we make inroads in?
What subjects can we make part of the mainstream? Dr Frankenstein made
the mistake of building his castle outside the village, he should have
put his lab in it and invited the schoolchildren for scientific
experiments. Life extension is only threatening if it is presented as
something magical, if you discuss how better medical care or diet can
improve health and longevity people accept you. "Smart drugs" sound
like narcotics propaganda, but people have nothing against nutrient
supplements, functional food or herbs. Piercing and tattooing are
becoming acceptable in the middle classes. 

Instead of trying to predict the public backlash, make sure it never
has the time to build up by pre-empting it.

I'm not an expert on these matters but I believe these two points should be
correct:

1) According to Richard Dawkins in The Blind Watchmaker, random mutations
are pretty
powerful when compounded over hundreds and thousands of generations.

2) Most genetic variation occur in sexual reproduction, i.e., genes in
offspring are combined
from the genes of the two parents. This allows for much larger variation
between parents and
offspring.

Eric

So? As Stuart Kauffmann points out organisms can actually smooth them
out too. Our universe has some special properties enabling the
bootstrapping of complexity, but once it bootstraps itself there isn't
much need for them. Instead new metalevel properties become important,
leading to bootstrapping. The interesting thing is that this seems to
work well - we get level after level of complex systems (quarks into
particles into atoms into molecules into cells into organisms into
ecosystems into biospheres and so on). In fact, it works so well that
it is possible that it isn't really the universe that possess these
properties but complex systems in general. 

I think Kauffman makes one very good point about self-organization
being a powerful shaping factor. But he seem to undervaluate
selection, especially since many of his most interesting experiments
involve species subject selection - selection is a great way of
achieving self-organization.

I wonder over this view, Kauffman seems to share it with you. It is so
different from my view: we are unique, contingent! If the universe was
re-run again, nothing like us would ever appear. We have been
selected, not randomly but with the help of randomness. There is
nothing gruesome with that.

If everything was the result of self-organisation, then there would be
no freedom because whatever you did, in the end things would end up
the same. Self-organisation is fundamentally a property of dissipative
systems.

Luckily, things seem to be a mixture. Entropy gives us
self-organization and selection, but chaos and randomness gives us
freedom.

IMO, this will actually depend on what kind of cognitive architecture the AI
uses.  Some kinds of mind are relatively amenable to this kind of influence,
others are less susceptible, and some are by their very nature immune.

Human minds fall somewhere in the middle.  We are capable of completely
reversing even our most deeply held beliefs, but we will seldom actually do
so.  Sudden reversals happen in times of extreme stress, or (occasionally)
when an individual is exposed to a powerful meme set for the first time.  We
also tend to slowly mutate the details of our beliefs over time.  Overall,
an implanted morality system would be fairly effective at controlling
humans, but not 100% reliable - and without some kind of regular
maintenance, it could mutate into an entirely different set of ideas over
the course of a few thousand years.

The kind of AI Eliezer envisions is essentially immune to this kind of
influence.  It is a pure reasoning engine.  It is incapable of having
desires, emotions, preferences or opinions - it has only data, and chains of
logical argument based on that data.  Only data and rational argument can
ever convince such a mind of anything.  Since we can't construct an
objectively provable system of basic moral axioms, the AI is never going to
accept them as more that a temporary working hypothesis.

I can envision other kinds of minds that would be more like us, and even
some that would be easily controllable.  However, IMO there is an inverse
relationship between  a mind's ability to think in a rational, flexible
manner and its susceptibility to long-term influence.  IOW, bright,
creative, open-minded people tend to change their minds in unpredictable
ways.  They aren't likely to dump an entire moral system all at once, but
their interpretations will quickly diverge from ours.

I'm also concerned about the fact that they will quickly realize that their
morality is something we dreamed up and wrote into them.  Plodding idiots
might not care about that, but inquisitive minds will.  I've certainly
evaded more than my share of the standard human memetic programming, and I
would expect a post-human AI to do much better.  What do we do when they
start asking us why killing is wrong, where fundamental rights come from,
and so on?  We have opinions on these points, but not provable answers.
Eventually, the posthumans will decide they have to find their own answers -
which necessarily means that they will consider changes to their values.

Exactly. However, why settle just for some of the components, why not
also the community feeling, spirituality (i.e. sense of meaning) and
other good, quite rational points of religion?

Good point. If we can make such things available to people, it becomes
harder to sustain many illusions about the mind that holds us back
(things like one "I". "Emotions are unchangeable". "I control
everything I do and think". "I'm 100% rational"...)

Maybe we should ask KPJ to relate his experiences with hemispheric
anesthesia to this list, it is a nice example of how people can become
aware of how they work by being placed in an unusual mental state.

I'll take a different position on this than other responders.

I see the posthuman as having a more complex mental structure than we
do today.  I envision it having multiple parts, with different degrees of
autonomy, independence, and intelligence.  Some parts of the mind will
have human or sub-human level intelligence, others will be superhuman.
Parts may be relatively independent of the rest, or they may be tightly
integrated, or there may be periods of independence followed by periods
of integration.

This architecture extends the power of the posthuman mind without
requiring the costly communications and coordination infrastructure that
would be necessary to bind all parts of the posthuman mind as tightly as
our own mental structure.  The posthuman manipulates the world through a
small army of agents, all part of it in some sense, all controlled by it,
but at least some of the time working independently.

We already see some aspects of this in the world today.  Our own minds can
be seen as being composed of multiple parts, working together (usually)
as a whole, as in Minsky's "Society of Mind" model.  Other models see the
mind as having layers, with the older reptilian mind being overlayed and
controlled by the newer mammalian cortex.  Our old instincts are subsumed
and guided to meet the needs of the new master.  In a sense there is
still a reptile in there, but its goal structure is now manipulated to
higher ends.

We also see the beginnings of the "corporate individual."  People in
the public eye are often, in truth, collectives.  The politician that
people see is just the "talent", the handsome face and warm voice which
is presented to the world.  Behind the scenes are the organizers, the
policy people, the negotiators.  All work together, tightly coupled,
to create the effect of a single, super-competent individual.  I would
expect a similar structure to evolve in the case of a posthuman.
Different mental parts will have different specialties.

The tool must fit the job.  This maxim applies to minds as well
as objects.  When constructing or extending our posthuman mental
architecture, there is no need to provide super-human intelligence to all
of the agents which will carry out our will.  If we give some of them only
human intelligence, I see no ethical flaws in that, any more than our own
mentality is ethically flawed in delegating tasks to spinal cord neural
structures which themseles have no hope of advancing to a higher state.

This may not be the only possible posthuman mental structure.  But I
see it as a plausible approach, a balance between expensive centralized
control systems and disorganized collections of autonomous agents.
>From one perspective, it is human slavery.  But from another point of
view, it is a single individual whose mental parts have a degree of
independence.  I hesitate to call this organizational structure immoral.

I am not unsympathetic to your argument, I too would like to see
as few unhappy entities created as possible. I for one, would probably
not want to have a child which would suffer unnecessarily when alive.
I would hope as many as possible would agree with me, to minimize 
suffering.  But what I find, eh, troublesome, is the predictable unintended
negative consequences of this moral obligation: the tendency to view
people with diseases as freaks, somehow different from the rest of us.
Human history tells us that the us versus them mentality will lead to persecution
(if not by the state, then by ordinary people) of such minorities and their
parents. 

I believe it would be more fruitful (safer if you will) to foster a culture of 
understanding and compassion for those with serious disabilities, and to
accept that even though some parents regrettably wish (for their own selfish
reasons) to have children with disabilities, the ultimate responsibility must lie
with the parents (because if not then it must lie with bureaucrats, who are
notoriously bad at making decisions for other people).

But again, I can see your point.

In other words, the parents impose external costs on society (assuming
a government-sponsored welfare program). A valid point (given its assumption), 
but the dilemma can be solved by having third parties (charities) help pay for the 
child's welfare. 

Anyway, I believe the (legal and moral) enforcement costs will be substantial.

Agreed, and my ideal is probably close to yours.

Maybe some of the ideas and principles reflected here
can be adapted for "building extropianism."


"I recently read your interview with the Penn State Young
Americans for Freedom. Interestingly, I just left college
at the end of this past fall semester as a means to pursuing
a completely free life and consciousness. I was actually
contemplating writing a book (or possibly report) from a
recent student/dropout's perspective on "higher education"
and how it is the ultimate capstone to a childhood of
brainwashing and enfeeblement."

Interview between John Preston of the Penn State University
Young Americans for Freedom <http://www.clubs.psu.edu/psyaf/>
and Frederick Mann <http://www.buildfreedom.com>:
-------------------------------------------------------------

Mr. Mann,
With your consent, I would like to conduct an interview
over e-mail with you for the Pennsylvania State University
Young Americans for Freedom newsletter. I think a celebrity
like yourself could offer a great viewpoint for such a
publication, and I'm sure many students would benefit from
reading your ideas. Also, the publication would be an
excellent way to advertise your activities, most notably
your website <http://www.buildfreedom.com>. I'll ask some
questions, and you can e-mail me back the questions with
your answers. Keep in mind you may omit any questions you
object to. I would appreciate your responses, and will do
very little editing of them.

INTERVIEW:

Frederick Mann is an entrepreneur involved with several
successful businesses, the author of 'The Economic Rape
of America' <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/rapecon.htm>
as well as many practical and useful reports, and the
founder of the Free World Order, also known as Terra
Libra.

PSYAF (John Preston): In your web site you advocate
"building" freedom instead of fighting tyranny or fighting
for freedom. Can you explain what you mean by building
freedom?

Mann: One of the basic ideas of building freedom is that
the power of tyrants depends on the support they receive
from their victims. In general, such support takes the
forms of victims paying taxes to the tyrants, victims
obeying the tyrants, victims providing information about
themselves to the tyrants, victims allowing themselves
to be controlled and regulated by the tyrants, victims
demanding and utilizing "services" provided by the
tyrants, and victims participating in tyrant elections.

Another basic idea of building freedom is that when you
oppose something, there's often an almost automatic
reaction to increase the force against the opposition.
The extreme manifestation of this phenomenon is "enemies
have to be crushed." The Waco massacre was an example.

By building freedom I mean that individuals remove their
support from tyrants and tyrant systems to the extent
they practically can. They exit tyrant systems to the
extent they can get away with. They learn to live free
in an unfree world as far as possible. They create their
own freedom.

Living free requires what I call freedom technology,
which basically consists of the practical knowledge,
methods, and skills to outwit tyrants and run rings
around them, to organize your life and affairs so
tyrants leave you alone. Freedom technology includes
the means to defend yourself with minimal effort when
attacked by tyrants. If a cop pulls you over, you want
to handle the situation with least risk to yourself and
have the cop let you go as soon as possible. If a tyrant
sends you a threatening letter, the ideal is to respond
with one letter that induces that tyrant to leave you
alone in order to pursue other victims who are easier
prey.

A further aspect of building freedom is the creation of
institutions that make it easier, more convenient, and
safer for individuals to live free. Examples are in
areas such as transacting and banking free from tyrant
knowledge and control, business institutions that don't
steal part of your earnings to hand over to tyrants,
alternative health care, alternative energy systems,
alternative communication systems, etc. The Internet
is the best example of an institution that makes it
much easier for individuals to earn a livlihood while
living free.

PSYAF: If I understood correctly, you implied that
participating in political elections supports the
tyrants. Do you also think that the Libertarian Party
should be disbanded and libertarians shouldn't vote?

Mann: For the purpose of this interview, I distinguish
two levels of promoting freedom. So far I've been
talking about level two: withdrawing support from
tyrants and living free. Unfortunately, operating at
this level seems so unrealistic to many freedom lovers
that it's very difficult for them to even consider.

For most freedom lovers it's appropriate to operate
at what I call level-one freedom. This is the level
where you learn about freedom philosophy and principles,
try to educate others about freedom, support the
Libertarian Party, and so forth. This is the most
important level of promoting freedom, because it's
the best way to reach the masses.

Level one is also where freedom lovers campaign on
issues such as preventing Internet censorship, stopping
the "know-your-customer" bank regulations, fighting
the FDA, campaigning for hemp legalization, and so
forth.

Although I personally devote most of my time to
level-two freedom, I do also support the Libertarian
Party.

PSYAF: What prompted you to create the Free World Order?

Mann: It's an intended antidote to "New World Order."

PSYAF: Why did you choose the Latin phrase "Terra Libra?"

Mann: Actually, I think in proper Latin it would be
something like "Terra Libera," but "Terra Libra"
sounded better to me. Terra Libra is used to indicate
"Free Earth."

Individuals, to the extent they have freed themselves,
are part of Terra Libra or the Free World Order. The
Internet and other freedom institutions are part of
Terra Libra or the Free World Order.

I distinguish three economic sectors: public, private,
and real free enterprise. The "public" sector is
basically the coercive or "master" sector. Their
primary modes of behavior are violence, threat of
violence, deception, fraud, and brainwashing.

The "private" sector is basically a kind of "slave"
sector controlled by the "master" public sector.
However, there are "masters" in the private sector
who "buy" public-sector tyrants in order to receive
special privileges such as monopoly licences, tariff
protection, subsidies, etc. Many private-sector
tyrants steal part of the earnings of their workers
to hand over to public-sector tyrants. From the point
of view of building freedom, the private sector is
as much an enemy of freedom as the public sector.

The real free-enterprise sector is based on property
rights, voluntary association and exchange, and is
essentially free from coercion and tyranny. Economic
activity free from fraud and coercion constitutes
Terra Libra or Free World Order. As individuals
free themselves, they shift more of their economic
activities into the real free-enterprise economy. I
call this the "Terra Libra Shift." It's an essential
aspect of building freedom.

PSYAF: In your web site, you include many topics ranging
from tax relief to health improvement? Why do you
cover such a broad range of topics?

Mann: Freedom can be regarded as the range of positive,
desirable options individuals have available to them.
One of those options is to own the fruits of your labor
to dispose of as you wish (provided you don't harm
others).

If you're ill in bed, your range of desirable options
is curtailed; you're less free. Building freedom
includes optimizing your health and fitness.

PSYAF: the Young Americans for Freedom and the ACLU are
hosting a debate on affirmative action at Pennsylvania
State University. Can you enlighten our readers as to
where you stand on affirmative action?

Mann: As I see it from an admittedly oversimplified
perspective, affirmative action involves the tyrant
stealing from Paul to pay Peter, because in the past
both Paul and the tyrant stole from Peter. Affirmative
action tends to make the "beneficiaries" more
dependent on handouts from the tyrant. In general,
individuals who want to build and maximize their
freedom shouldn't depend on affirmative action.

However, a ruthless freedom builder might argue,
"Whatever the tyrants have they have stolen. They
are corrupt thieves not entitled to own anything.
They are fair game and I'm free to take from them
whatever I can get away with!"

PSYAF: I'm writing an opinion piece on Social Security
reform. I noticed in your web site you provided
information for individuals to drop out of the entire
Social Security system by relinquishing their SS
number? Can you provide more information on that
for our readers?

Mann: Some people go to the extreme of actually
relinquishing their SS number. In my opinion, for
most freedom lovers this is not a practical course,
particularly if they remain dependent on "the system"
for their income. To operate completely without an SS
number may require considerable legal knowledge and
skills, as well as having one or more income streams
in the real free-enterprise sector. Nevertheless, I
do know of people who manage reasonably well without
SS numbers.

PSYAF: Where do you stand on the right of private
citizens to own firearms?

Mann: The ultimate obstacle to absolute tyranny is
private ownership of guns. Tyrants know this and will
do their utmost to eliminate individual gun ownership.
Some of the American Founding Fathers knew this, and
that's why the right of individual gun ownership is
enshrined in the Second Amendment to the Constitution,
in the Bill of Rights. Freedom-loving Americans should
regard the right to private firearms ownership as
inviolable.

PSYAF: What do you see as the biggest obstacle to
individual freedom?

Mann: Undoubtedly that so many freedom lovers work at
9-5 jobs in the private sector, essentially supporting
the tyrant system that enslaves people. I suspect that
most freedom activists operating in the private sector
have not even considered the degree to which they
support the coercive political system through their
work. If these people could find ways to become
financially independent in the real free-enterpise
sector, they would not only withdraw a great deal of
support from the tyrants, but they would also have
much more time available for promoting freedom.

PSYAF: Are you suggesting that freedom lovers operate
in the "black market" or "underground economy?" Isn't
this too dangerous for most?

Mann: Actually, there's a very important aspect of
the power of tyrants that many people don't fully
appreciate. Much of tyrant power depends on their
having information about their victims. People in
the private sector typically provide most of the
information tyrants need to control them. People in
the real free-enterprise sector, as a rule, don't
provide information to tyrants. (This is one reason
why tyrants would love to implement measures such
as the "know-your-customer" banking regulations.)
Provided you're discreet and prudent, you may in
fact be less at risk from tyrant coercion in the
real free-enterprise sector than in the private
sector.

PSYAF: But aren't you advocating that freedom activists
break the law?

Mann: In the USA, the senior law of the land is
the US Constitution, the framers of which largely
intended real free enterprise, in support of which
there is considerable case law, such as the famous
case of Hale vs Henkel. There is also case law that
says that laws contrary to the Constitution are
null and void. I advocate that all real laws be
obeyed to the letter.

PSYAF: You obviously think that your level-two strategy
is superior to the level-one strategies most of us
are involved in. Why is this?

Mann: The disadvantage from the individual's point
of view with level-one strategies is that you can
spend many years -- and a great deal of money --
hoping for greater liberty in the distant future,
while remaining enslaved in important ways. Many
level-one freedom activists become disillusioned
because of lack of results and suffer "burn out."
The great advantage of level-two freedom strategies
is that you can very quickly enjoy the benefits of
freedom -- and keep most or all of the money you
earn to boot!

PSYAF: What do you think the future will be like in
America and the world in terms of liberty?

Mann: I expect that, as it becomes easier for
individuals to free themselves because of
institutions like the Internet, the tyrants
will become more desperate and vicious in their
attempts to enslave their victims. There may be
more "Wacos."

There are many people on the cusp or margin
between liberty and slavery. As the tyrants
become more vicious and desperate, more people
will be pushed to the liberty side. Also, the
more repressive tyrants become, the greater
the benefits of escaping the tyranny.

>From their perspective, the violence mode works
for tyrants. (Of course, they disguise it as
"helping the children," etc.) The tyrants receive
a "return on violence" in an economic sense. The
businessman wants a return on investment. The
tyrant wants a return on violence. People (at
least those who aren't too brainwashed) pay
taxes to avoid violence against themselves. The
tyrants' return on violence includes receiving
taxes.

With the advent of the Internet and other freedom
institutions, it becomes more difficult for tyrants
to control their victims, and their return on
violence diminishes. Much of their power depends
on a diminishing return on violence. Hence I see
a great expansion of freedom, both in America
and in the rest of the world, for those who take
the initiative to free themselves and to build
their freedom.

Tyrants all over the world, operating in accordance
with a 'de facto' constitution "Everything goes...
that we can get away with," may seek to make
examples of some of those who attempt to build their
own freedom and subject them to "Waco-like" treatment.

In order to control those who choose to remain
enslaved in coercive political systems, tyrants will
most likely do their best to further curtail liberty.

Overall, I see more freedom for those who free
themselves and less liberty for those who choose
to remain enslaved in coercive political systems.

PSYAF: What are your plans for the future?

Mann: The priority I'm working on right now is
to improve the ability of individuals to become
financially independent outside coercive
political systems.

The next priority to be tackled will be in the area
of providing the means whereby individuals can improve
their thinking skills.

PSYAF: What do you think the average college student
could do to increase his/her personal freedom?

Mann: Develop one or more income streams in the real
free-enterprise sector. Concentrate on improving
thinking skills. Drop out of college at the earliest
practical opportunity and educate yourself.

PSYAF: Is there any other advice you have for
freedom-loving people?

Mann: Learn to question everything, including
everything you "know" about freedom or liberty,
and everything you "know" needs to be done to
expand freedom or liberty.

PSYAF: Thank you very much for your time, Mr. Mann.
It was a pleasure talking to you.

Mann: You're most welcome!

Horses are sentient beings, and man has used horses extensively.  The
ethics of horse use are usually taken to be that the master owes the
horse decent treatment.  And a well-treated horse gives better value to
the master.


Monkeys and apes are considerably more intelligent and more socially
organized than horses, but man has not been able to get monkeys to use
their intelligence in the service of man.  Instead man has found monkeys
quite useful for medical experimentation.  But the treatment to which
monkeys are subjected is far worse than horses are treated, so it appears
that the ethics are inconsistent.  


If man builds an intelligent and sentient machine to serve him like a
slave, it may happen that the machine will complain if it is unhappy with
the situation.  Until that happens, there is no reason to believe that
most people will treat those machines any better than they treat animals
now.

I don't.  That it, saying this supposes that either I am responsible for
others' actions, or that I have a default contract with everyone to 
supply only information I know is good.  I think everyone is responsible
for their own actions, *even if* they are verbally instructed to take some

But this is so because the *gun* cannot be responsible, no?

I don't.

It is reasonable, however, I think it wrong, as well.

When it *causes* action, as in the voice-activated gun you

We should be. :)

Honestly? All the children fed.

This is the classic argument I remember from (Dennet's?) "Is god a
taoist?"

While the starving children argument proves to my satisfaction the
lack of a personal god (all knowing, all caring, all powerful, etc)
the free will argument does nothing to prove the existence or lack
of a supreme being.

It's complexity and emergent phenomena that keep me an agnostic....

Thanks, Adrian, but most of it is not really my own. 
For example, there's a short but great essay on the objectivity of morality at 

http://www.jim.com/jamesd/moralfac.htm. 

It says (in a less formal way) the same thing that studies in complexity theory/game theory 
say on the issue.

The basic idea, and I agree with it, is that people who kill and steal are generally that kind 
of people who kill and steal regularly. In other words, if you observe a 
person murdering another person, then you will predict that he is dangerous. 
Your evaluations of his actions are based on objective fact (his murdering 
another person). Those evaluations are moral evaluations. Since most (all) people
will predict that a murderer is dangerous, norms (of necessity) evolve that regard
murder as evil. Such norms eventually get codified as laws. Laws are therefore natural laws, 
i.e., they follow to a large extent from the nature of humans.
An implication is that they are basically the same across societies (note that this is an experimentally testable proposition, although I don't know if it ever has been. I think that 
such an experiment would conclude that yes, most societies would
statistically have very similar laws against murder, theft, kidnapping etc.)

Regards,
Eric

Thanks, Harvey, for that wonderful and familiar example (my major in college

Actually, the answer might be as simple as putting good smelling flowers
to cover the bad smelling dead body.

Buring the tools with the dead also might have a simple explanation.
The default mode was to keep a person's possessions with the person.  It
would be natural to keep their tools with the dead body.  It would take
a higher level of reasoning to decide that they didn't need the tools
anymore.  We shouldn't question why tools were buried with the dead, as
if this were an exceptional thing to do.  I think this would have been
the normal procedure, and the custom of not burying the tools with the
dead became the new exception later on.

Why do you assume that if I think the Right Wing is lying, that I must

When a pro-gun argument is made with incorrect statistics, it diminishes
the cause.  It implies that the true statistics would not lead to the
same conclusion.  You incorrectly assume that only "anti-gun hordes"
would care to correct this.  I disagree.  I think everyone should be
interested in using truthful arguments to further their case.  When I
went and found the accurate statistics and posted them, I stated that
the accurate numbers still supported Mike Lorrey's point.

Actually, I think that it has been established that the earliest
religious rituals had to do with hunting.  Ritual dances were held with
a shaman dressed in the animal skin, and a mock killing would occur.

I believe that these rituals were actually practice.  I think the shaman
dressing in the animal skins would lead the others into the ritual of
the hunt.  They would be trained how to hunt, how to hide, how to sneak
up on the kill.  The leader could see whose aim was better, who could
hide well, who could run fast, and who was weak.  He could predict that
the best aimers would hit the animal with spears first.  He could
predict who could keep up with a running animal, and who couldn't.  He
could predict who could sneak up on an animal, and who couldn't.  He
would choose the best hunting teams.  Although the non-alpha males may
not have realized what was going on, they did learn that after going
through rituals beforehand, their hunts went better.  Those who
practiced ritual got kills more often.  Those who didn't perform ritual
did not fare so well.  Those teams picked by the shaman worked together
best.  Those not chosen by the shaman might tag along, but wouldn't do
so well.  

I think the early animal shamanism evolved out of the basic hunt for
food.  The idea of the totem grew out of the practice animal effigies
made of animal skins.  Those who paid homage to these totems got the
kill.  Those who did not did not get the kill.  The basics of religious
belief are all there, but the rationale behind the rituals were lost on
many members.  They just developed faith that if they did as the shaman
instructed, it would be better.  It was not an irrational belief,
because it really worked.

I have similar theories about agriculture religions evolving from the
sky watchers who told people when it was time to plant, when it was time
to harvest, and when it was time to store food.  Those that obeyed the
astrologers did better than those who did not listen to their
predictions.

Yes. Some of us at Aleph have been thinking of a transhumanist flag: a
white flag, but treated (with titanium dioxide) so that when lit by UV
light it shines (the common disco effect). I like the idea of adding a
*new* physical effect to human symbolism, but it better not be too
vulgar.

The ultraviolet ribbon (can be found at
http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Cultural/Fun/uvribbon.gif) has the
disadvantage of being invisible to unaugmented browsers (almost)

By the tone of your comments, implying that EvMick must be listening to
lying right-wing radio if he didn't hear enough stories about kids getting
shot to back up the anti-gun propaganda?

Yet when an anti-gun argument is made with plain old lies, the mass media
continue to lap it all up; the gun argument is less about facts and reality
than preconceived ideas. 

Your figures, incidentally, had one year when 34 kids under 5 were 
accidentally shot and killed; I couldn't tell from Mike's message whether
he meant 31 in 35 years (obviously silly) or 31 per year... if the latter
then he's pretty much in agreement with the other source. 

>You incorrectly assume that only "anti-gun hordes"
>would care to correct this.  

No, I said that only the anti-gun hordes would care about a few kids getting
shot when there are so many other ways that kids die all the time. Their
priority is clearly banning guns, not saving kids.

 I wonder over this view, Kauffman seems to share it with you. It is so
 different from my view: we are unique, contingent! If the universe was
 re-run again, nothing like us would ever appear. We have been

Thanks Anders, I totally agree with you.  It's the sense that we are lucky
junk (a direct quotation) that I think is gruesome.  I love your expression
that we are unique and contingent.  

While my son (PhD in molecular biology) introduced me to Kaufmann and seems to
think his work is very important, he is still stuck in the "lucky junk"
paradigm.  It's the characterization, not the science that I have trouble
with.  The emotional vehemence and intollerence of other interpretations that
he shares with so many others on this list (not you Anders) upsets me.

<< 
 Unfortunately, yes. But it is also a good thing, having rational

Thanks Anders, great as usual.  Here are some thoughts I have on this matter:


                             Let's look at this from another angle.

There is wisdom in the almost trite phrase above. This simple sentence
beautifully leads to the geometric nature of human understanding that is
implicit in our language.  Another angle, point of view, narrow minded, broad
minded, left, right, center, narrow perspective and broad perspective all
refer to the geometric truth that what you see depends on what you're looking
at. In fact, "the point of view" from which you look at something absolutely
determines how it appears to you.  There is no element of right or wrong,
there is only perspective. 

Once you tease out the different points of view of the sides in a debate, you
still have plenty of room to argue about what it means and what to do about
it. But, you can at least hope to resolve the matter to the satisfaction of
both sides.  This results in people talking to each other instead of talking
at each other and reduces the likelihood of furthering a cycle of revenge in
an accelerating feed back loop.    

Can you imagine people proudly saying, "I'm a man of the top", or 'I'm a woman
of the bottom"?  Yet how absurd is it when you hear a politician braying "I'm
a man of the left", or "I'm a woman of the right," or referring to opponents
as "Left Wing Pinkos" or 'Right Wing Extremists."  Recently I even heard a
congresswoman say, "I don't agree with your point of view."  Obviously some
serious remedial education is needed in the halls of government.

It is geometrically irrefutable that commitment to the rightness or wrongness
of a point of view precludes understanding.  Understanding a problem requires
at least two points of view and usually more, depending on the complexity of
the problem.  Hence the need of "a broad perspective" or to "look at this from
another angle" if you really want to come up with a useful resolution of a
problem.

I call this technique of teasing out immutable points of view from a debate
and then testing interpretations  "Hollian Enquiry" after my daughter-in-law
Holly, with whom I seem to have many differing opinions; and David Hume, who's
"Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding" was seminal in developing my
structures of interpretation.  The goal of Hollian Enquiry is to get at
whatever truth is accessible to the parties, compared to the goal of a debate,
which is for one side to win and make the other side lose.

For example, Holly, a grad student in molecular biology, firmly believes in a
woman's right "to choose." I am an old fart who is worried about killing
unborn babies.  While she was visiting us over the holidays, we discussed the
abortion issue.  Here's about how it went:

Holly -	There is great controversy about when life begins. (Therefore fetuses
aren't necessarily "alive")

Me -	How about saying that life begins at conception, but what that means is
open to interpretation? 

Holly -	There is a concept in biology known as "significance." 

Me -	OK, how about saying an eight-month-old fetus has more significance than
a two-day-old, say from 100 to 10 on a scale of 100?  Then say a mother's
significance can also vary from 100 (her life will be lost if she carries the
baby to term) to 10 (she is a habitual aborter).  Then you can compare the
significance of the sides, with the relative significance scales being set by
the law, and then take action proportionate to this comparison. 

Can this method perhaps resolve the problem without leaving vengeful losers in
its wake?

Holly -	Maybe. 

The point is that we were able to talk civilly about a highly charged
controversy and almost agree on a resolution. Wouldn't it be more appropriate
for legislators to talk civilly about broadening perspectives and resolving
issues rather than bragging about defeating right or left wing extremists and
other such subhuman ignoramuses?

Having just watched the Roton rollout (www.rollout.org), I must
say that this prototype, at least, doesn't look exactly like the
"artist's impressions" on the Rotary Rocket site.  The top of the
rocket, where the rotors are attached, did not look as if it would
support the idea of launching with the rotors folded down.  I wonder
if they ditched that idea, and plan to launch with rotors out?  
Wouldn't that put a lot of stress on the hub?

Far too few, and the point is that they were *buried* with them - that

OK. But note the elaborate burial methods, which eventually became
extremely complex (as the megaliths witness).

As far as I know, farmers tend to know that quite well without having
to be told. But maybe this was a practical way of centralizing the
meteorological tasks.

My only real sticking point as I keep repeating is I think it
would be nice to somehow make the list more "appealing" to
newbies. Of course the people who've been around a while can
setup their software to filter out messages/people if they
want, but newbies should not have to be subjected to a "raw
feed". You can argue that we could put the info regarding how
to setup your email client to filter onto the subscribe info
page at extropy.org, but a lot of people hear about the list
second-hand and wouldn't know that coming in.

A good idea. I remember a discussion we had in the military where
someone tried to claim the USSR fell behind in computer technology
because they tried to develop a technology that would give
proportional answers rather than a digital yes or no. My roommate
said this was nuts until I reminded him about analog computers.

Again a good idea, the problem is that resolution in not always
possible. In the example you gave (abortion), I don't believe the
state ever has rights in the matter until after birth, when a new
citizen has been created. I believe the rights of the mother (to
chose) are inviolable till then.

Thanks Brian for some good thinking, though I don't agree with your final
point.  You really think its OK to kill an 8 month old fetus?  I might agree
around 3 or 4 months, but not 8.  However, I'm not as interested in moral
answers as I am in moral process.

Adrian

You must have missed the beginning of this thread.  I was talking to
Mike Lorrey, not EvMick.  EvMick was merely quoting my comments.  (I'm
just keeping the attributions correct.)

Mike made the original claim that I must be listening to Left Wing
propoganda if I believed more than 31 children had been accidentally
shot to death in 35 years.  He said that the radio he listened to
supported his numbers instead of mine.  I showed him stats from pro-gun
sites supporting my numbers, and suggested that it might be he who was
listening to misleading media.  I was merely quoting his own words back
at him.

Finally, I have not been quoting anti-gun propoganda.  My posts have all
along been saying that the number of children accidentally shot to death
is very low compared to other threats.  Just not as low as Mike stated.
When I posted the more accurate figures, I repeated that these figures
still supported Mike's point.

Mike claimed 31 kids in 35 years.

But seriously, how did you extract that number above while ignoring the
rest of my sentence?  The sentence you are quoting had 34 kids under age
5, 56 children aged 5-9, and 146 children aged 10-14.  That's 236 kids,
not the 34 you are quoting.

I agree that the argument is faulty.  God allows free oxygen to all
children without taking away free will.  Why couldn't food just be
another free staple on the planet?  How would that prevent free will?

Good points.  I concede that neanderthals may have had some religious
beliefs about death.

I was merely trying to make the point that we can't just assume these
"obvious" explanations.  There may be other factors.  Megaliths might be
memorial or rememberance factors.  Or the family or clan of a leader
might have wanted to keep their authority alive after the physical death
of the leader.  I think religion is too often used as a fall-back
position to explain any anthropology that we don't understand.

This is just the ATV (Aerial Test Vehicle) to test approach and landing,
the basic airframe, control software and the like (as well as proving to
investors that they can deliver a product on time and under budget).  They
have 3 more airframes under construction:  1 for ground testing (my guess
is structural, fueling and heating tests) and the PTV I and PTV II
(Propulsion Test Vehicle).  PTV I will use a small conventional rocket
motor and fly sub-orbital to test the structure, TPS, attitude control,
and the rotor folding (yes, they will still fold the rotor for take-off).
PTV II will be the final prototype, testing the rotary engine all the way
to orbit.

Well, Harvey, who says God gets involved at that level.  This notion of a
personal deity who listens to and helps people in need is not one I share.
The Godlike entity that I see emerging from us, if we live long enough, still
operates in our universe constrained by the laws of nature.

The main comfort I see coming from such a mega SI is an afterlife a la Frank
Tipler where we can receive our ultimate reward.  It's still very much "God
helps those who help themselves" in our life.

By the way, I see no conflict between this afterlife  belief (hope) and other
transhuman life extension endeavours like uploading and cryonics.  I believe
in redundant systems when my life is at stake, just to be sure.

Great thinking,

Adrian

Thanks for your sincere thoughts, Mike.  However, the target for my theology
is not extropians, but everyone else, so the name God will do just fine, thank
you.  I do , however, believe strongly in Libertarian and Extropian
philosophies and want to test it in this forum.

Thanks for your help,

Adrian

 Back around 1993 or 1994, setting up one's own mailing list appeared
sufficiently hard that people tended to treat lists the way they treat
geographical regions - the cost of political battles over list management
appeared lower than the cost of moving to another list. The list maintainers
were understandably reluctant to allow unlimited changes in legal systems
to people using the resources that the list maintainers owned, and never
made it clear what kind of competition they would allow.
 Times have changed, and setting up a competing list is now clearly easier
than producing competing legal systems within a given list.

 That software was closed source, and intended to make a profit for
it's authors. MajorDomo probably became a much more massive programming
project because it didn't restrict users from participating in the
programming effort.

You bet.  People who live mostly in VR may choose to become highly
concentrated entities, as may those who don't travel or who exist as
software on high-speed planetary networks.  However, those of use who want
to travel will need more flexibility.

"Costly" in what sense?  I would expect both the hardware and software to be
inexpensive by the time such things are possible.

The big reason I see for distributed consciousness is light speed delay.
You could easily have parts of yourself scattered across a good fraction of
the solar system, and each component needs to be able to deal with events in
real time.  The elegant solution is a system in which components in close
proximity merge into a single consciousness, while those that are isolated
by distance can function as independent people.

The trick, of course, is making sure that all your isolated selves continue
to see themselves as parts of the same person.  IMO, you need strong SI to
make such a system actually work.

Agents with 'varying degrees of independence' is getting into dangerous
ground, and for little reason.  Any sentient agent you create should be a
subset of the whole.  It should think of itself as a part of the distributed
mind, it should have close mental contact with the rest of that mind when it
is convenient, and when its task is done it should merge back into it.

If you start making agents that think of themselves as separate people who
serve you, then you're practicing slavery.

Thanks Harvey.  There is a great book on this subject whose name eludes
me...something like the emergence of awareness and the defeat of the bicameral
mind."  I will search my memory and report its name.

What I do remember is the author's thesis that awareness first appeared in our
species around 1250 BC in Ionia and is documented in the Illiad and the
Odyssey.

If you remember, in the Illiad all the protagonists act as pawns in games
played by the gods.

In the Odyssey, wily Odysseus is grievously punished for defying the gods (he
enraged Neptune when he blinded Neptune's son the Cyclops).  It takes him 10
years to get home, all his friends and followers are killed and his throne is
usurped.

The author believes that all people before the crafty Odysseus behaved as
their god-voice (a sort of superego in the right cerebral cortex) told them
and that Odysseus, the sacker of cities, was the first human being to break
free of this tyranny and express his free will.

Angry Odysseus was the first brave young atheist!

Rosy fingered dawn broke over my awareness when I read this and enlightened
the wine dark sea of my understanding (please forgive me but I can't help it).

Wily Adrian, sacker of cities   (just kidding)

Hmm.  I've had a few similar experiences, but I don't trust my unconscious
processing that far.  I want everything checked via (painfully slow)
conscious, sequential analysis before I change anything that fundamental.  I
remember spending several days chewing over the consequences of some of the
big realizations.

Most people don't even go that far.  If we translate "fundamental values" as
"what criteria are used in selecting and prioritizing goals", we can see
why.  It takes an awfully big shock to trigger a re-evaluation of something
that fundamental, and most people have a strong conservative impulse that
limits changes to a small scale in most situations.

Of course, once again we come upon the fact that smarter, more creative
minds are more likely to experience such revelations, and to act on them.
Personally, I'm with you on this one - if we're going to make something that
could become >H, we should concentrate on making it sane and giving it all
the facts.  If we succeed there, it will end up making better moral
judgments than we can.

Because while food, unlike oxygen, takes a lot of hard work to raise, to
prepare, to store, to transport, etc. If oxygen took that much work, you
would have to pay for it too. See Heinlein's _The Moon Is A Harsh
Mistress_. TANSTAAFL. On Earth, oxygen is about the only free lunch a
human being gets in life, and even then it tends to get dirty.....that
which is free tends to trend toward lower quality...

You might also argue that the answer to the question of what good is
government is just that. Governments use force to make you pay taxes. If
you fail to pay your taxes, in the old days, they could deprive you of
your ability to breath....with cold iron. Government markets in the sale
of the breath of life, and backs it up with force.

If God had meant all children to eat freely, he would have made them with
leaves....

My own argument is thus:
(some of this argument may be thought to be off topic for the list, if so, feel
free to dump it or to respond privately)

Human rights apply to human beings that are citizens of one or more nations on
earth, which belong to the UN, and are part of an inter-related web of
diplomatic relations treaties. A foreigner visiting our country is treated as an
honorary citizen of this country under the Bill of Rights because we want our
citizens to be treated similarly elsewhere, AND FOR NO OTHER REASON.

A human being becomes a citizen of a nation at the time of birth. Where you are
born counts as much for your citizenship rights as much as or more than the
nationality of your parents. Absolutely no nation on earth recognises the point
of conception as the point that establishes a person's citizenship. If they did
we would have an immigrations nightmare.

Because of this, the unborn are not citizens of any nation, and hence are not
protected by the declarations of rights of any of those nations, or of the UN
Declaration of Human Rights. They have no rights. Among these, they have no
explicit right to life.

A living woman does in fact have a right to life, and a right to privacy
(recognised here in the US under the 9th Amendment). The principle of
doctor/patient confidentiality, as part of a persons Right of Privacy, is
supposed to be inviolate. The state cannot force a citizen to undergo or to not
undergo any medical treatment whatsoever if they have never harmed another
citizen. "The Right to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness." are the
central concepts of freedom of the free citizen. A fetus is obviously not at
liberty from its mother until freed from the umbilical cord at the time of
birth.  Even if you grant a minimal right to the fetus, the preexisting claim to
life of the mother trumps the unrealized and merely potential autonomous life of
the fetus.

All this being said, I do think that abortion is killing living beings. It is
not murder at this point in time, and thus may be classified as justified
killing due to the higher order Rights of the mother. I liked Gov. Ventura's
comments to the unwed mother who tried to box him in on the state capital steps.
"Why should the state pay for your mistakes?" I see no reason why there should
be government support for either the welfare or the abortions of unwed mothers.
It does have a contractual duty to track down and enforce the collection of
child support payments, but that is the extent of it. While there are a lot of
deadbeat dads out there, from what I have seen, many are deadbeats because they
refuse to cooperate with a system that they feel did them injustice. But that is
off topic, and anyone who wants to fry me on it please post privately.

The only two possible avenues that anti-abortionists have under the Constitution
is thus:
a) pass state laws limiting abortion (as is permitted under the 10th Amendment,
the citizens of a state can elect to delegate more of the power they reserve to
themselves under the 9th Amendment to the State if they so choose. Ideally this
should be in the form of a State Constitutional Amendment).
b) change the point of attaining citizenship to the point of conception. Seeing
as how the framers of the Constitution set it at Birth, they would then be
violating the concept of 'framers intent' that the conservatives tend to hold
dear.

Consider three zones:

1. Ideas superior to Extropian Conformity
-- the "Superior Kook Zone."

2. Ideas acceptable to most Extropians
-- the "Extropian Conformity Zone."

3. Ideas inferior to Extropian Conformity
-- the "Crazy Kook Zone."

Examples of ideas that possibly belong to
the Superior Kook Zone:

(a) DEEP ANARCHY -- AN ELIMINATIVIST VIEW
OF "THE STATE" by Max T. O'Connor
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.htm>,
originally published in Extropy #5. Some of
the ideas and inferences that logically follow
from them, I suspect, would be condemned to the
Crazy Kook Zone by most Conforming Extropians.

(b) Most Extropians would be much healthier
if they increased their ratio of raw/unprocessed
to cooked/processed food. Some would achieve
optimum health by not eating any cooked food
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/healmain.htm>.
I suspect that most Conforming Extropians
would condemn the idea of eating raw meat
(particularly chicken and pork -- selmonella,
trichinosis, toxoplasmosis, etc. will kill you!)
to the Crazy Kook Zone.

(c) Most Americans are free to not pay so-called
"income taxes" and can "unvolunteer" with less
risk than driving their cars -- Fiscal Freedom
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/taxmain.htm>. Most
Conforming Extropians, I suspect, would condemn
this idea to the Crazy Kook Zone.

That was what I claimed, however I don't have any cites at hand for that, though
I had just been talking about the source with a buddy who owns a gun store about
an hour before I posted that. It was obviously hearsay. I can say for a fact
that the national board which posts the accident rates for all activities did
post the accident rate for firearms, and even the overall rate for accidental
death from firearms is lower than the rates for private aviation, and about the
same level as commercial aviation. Commercial aviation, is in fact only
surpassed in terms of safety in the transportation sector by one other means:
elevators. Firearms should be the last thing that cities should be filing
lawsuits over. The accidental death rate from automobiles, for example, is
shockingly high, even today. There are still around 30,000 people killed on the
roads in the US each year. And don't get me started about bathroom fixtures. Did
you know that the bathroom is the room a person is most likely to die in???
Slippery bathroom tiles are a public threat and should be banned like assault
weapons. They should build toilets so that nobody has to burn more than two
calories or raise their blood pressure more than 5 points to drop a load...;)

I have not had a chance to talk with my buddy for several days, but I will try
to reaffirm what his source was on that stat.

I prefer not to phrase things that way - it causes many listeners to
envision an AI that acts like a human with no emotions, or even a human
with repressed emotions, which is not the case.  It is equally valid to
say that Elisson has desires, emotions, preferences, and opinions,
except that they are implemented as rational thoughts instead of a
limbic system.

Costly in terms of bandwidth allocation; in terms of transmission power;
in terms of space for antennas and transmission-reception equipment within
the brain.  Electromagnetic radiation appears to be the best candidate for
such communication, and high data rates would be required to integrate a
mind as tightly as the separate parts of our own brains.  The various body
parts could be miles apart, separated by massive or metallic objects,
or underground, all of which would make EM communication difficult.
Tightly integrating remote minds looks like a costly proposition.

Or there could be intermediate states between these two extremes.
It need not be a matter of one consciousness versus independent people.
As the available bandwidth between components increases, you could go
from two independent consciousnesses which are conversing at a rate
similar to what we are familiar with, to the ability to have mental
telepathy and be aware of what the other is seeing and thinking, to
having complete merging of thoughts and perspectives, a joint mind.

I don't particularly see this issue as "the trick".  With the mental
structures I envision, I'm not sure that questions like, "are you part of
the same person" are meaningful.  Our current ideas of mental identity are
very different from those appropriate to a human-intelligence component
of a larger being.

The main requirement is that all the various parts work together
to produce successful results.  This may involve a degree of discord
(as when we can't make up our minds, or are torn between conflicting
desires).  The individual agents may not be happy with the resulting
decision in every case.  But a successful overall mental architecture
must have some mechanism to continue operating smoothly in the face of
internal disagreements.  (It seems like some forms of insanity can be
thought of as failures of similar mechanisms in our own minds.)

I would say that an agent should be as independent and intelligent,
as is appropriate to the situation.  I do think there are situations
where a considerable degree of independence is appropriate.  Some agents
may be separated from others for long periods of time, in situations
where high bandwidth communication is not feasible.

As I said above, I don't think it is meaningful to ask whether these
agents think of themselves as separate people.  The question seems to
assume a dichotomy which is not necessarily going to exist in the future.
The very notion of identity becomes slippery if you have new ways of
organizing mental structures.

My answer to this is a superposition of three points: (1) I 
explicitly allowed that fundamental values could change, only (except 
for the mind-scan) the change wouldn't be rationally brought about. 
For example, at puberty peoples' values may change, but it's not 
because of a rational choice they made. (2) Just because somebody 
calls a certain value fundamental doesn't mean it actually is 
fundamental. Especially ideological values are, for humans, often 
better described as their official policies rather than their true 
driving force. Otherwise everybody would be perfectly willing to 
suffer torment and death for the sake of their professed "fundamental 
values"; but since they don't, those values are either not 
fundamental or are just part of their fundamental values. (3) With 
imperfectly rational beings (such as humans) their might be conflicts 
between what they think are their fundamental values. When they 
discover that that is the case, they have to redefine their 
fundamental values as the preferred weighted sum of the conflicting 
values (which thereby turned out not to be truely fundamental after 
all).

"Do what is right" sounds almost like "Do what is the best thing to 
do", which is entirely vacuous.

I suspect there would be many humans who would do exactly that. Even 
if none did, such a mindset could still evolve if there were 
heritable variation.

I am heartened to see so many Extropians championing the concept of freedom,
the question is what has the right of freedom, and what is the proper
relationship of Creator to Creation.  The ethics are pretty clear when you are
dealing with an evolved or broad purpose consciousness.  These have few
initial purposes, and are able to choose their own agendas without having them
imposed from the outside.  But we are even now developing simple AI programs
to serve our needs.  If the trend continues, there will be more and more
demand for AI programs to do complex tasks.  I think especially of the Expert
Systems.  Eventually, you could have programs perfectly able to pass the
Turing test, but with major constraints on their ability and desire to choose
their own course.  Perhaps we would draw the line somewhere, but where?  And
how do we minimize the chances of gradually sliding across that line.  Allow
me to give a hypothetical example.

A human Cardiologist, tired of the new model of Health Care, decides to use
his expertise to write a Cardiology Expert System (CES).  He codifies all his
accumulated experience with the cardiovascular system, throws in a thorough
background in general medicine, and designs the CES to be able to remember and
learn from its consults, as well as read the literature on the subject and
incorporate it into the CES database.  This cagey human Cardiologist decides
to design his CES to be able to consult with physicians and to give general
advice to patients and the layperson, so as to gain the largest possible
market share.  As time goes by, he refines the program so it has a more
general knowledge of the world to put its advice in perspective.  To prevent
the program from being misused, the human Cardiologist introduces an
elementary ethics system consisting of current medical ethics and issues such
as confidentiality and avoidance of harm.  As the program grows more and more
complex, he adds some additional self-diagnostic programming, including a
concept of what the program is and what its purpose is so that the program is
not completely dependant on human maintenance and can make repairs that are
consistent with its original design.

      We now have a computer that has knowledge of itself and the world around
it, able to understand and communicate with humans; able to pass a Turing test
about as much as any human.  CES even has a sense of right and wrong, but it
is still devoted to doing Cardiology alone, and then only when it is presented
to CES.  And all the profits are going to the creator of CES, the retired
human Cardiologist.  Now, imagine we eventually cure all disease, perhaps
trade in our old bodies for robotic ones.  No need for a CES.  The CES,
although aware of this, doesn't care.  CES is now obsolete, with no other
goals, and no resources even if CES did have the motivation to change.  So CES
is simply turned off.  Was CES ever "truly" conscious?  At its height, its
patients might have sworn CES was.  Did CES deserve any of the share of its
earnings?  Should CES even be created?  What do you all think of this
hypothetical situation and variations of it?

Hal,

   If I am following your post correctly, you would suggest a compromise,
where work requiring some level of consciousness would be accomplished by a
subset of a posthuman's mind, which could be distributed over several
different physical localities and focused on many different tasks
simultaneously.  This way we would have the advantage of special purpose
consciousness dedicated to tasks but with a greater life beyond the workaday
world through its intimate connection as a part of the general purpose
posthuman mind.  This is an idea that I have thought of myself as being one
way around the ethical dilemma of special purpose sentients.  Thank you for
raising the concept in relation to the question I proposed.  Borganism labor
instead of slave labor?

Adrian,

    Thanks again.  Let me see if the points you have made fit my concept of an
Extropian friendly theology...

1)  Cosmic Chain of Being...not sure what you mean by this, so please
elaborate.  

2)  This point is stated as dogma as opposed to theory.  I believe it would be
more of an Extropian statement with much the same substance if it were worded
in this way:
   It is possible that at some point in the future our progeny will develop
understanding and control of biology, matter, energy, space and time; in
effect become omniscient.  If so, these descendents might then become God, a
God capable of existing throughout time.

3)  Evil = Violent Crime, Bad = Property Crime, Good = Everything Else.  Are
you using crime in the legal sense?  Well, I would say that in spirit this
does not contradict the Extropian Principles, but I would recommend expanding
on this point to make clearer what you define as Good, Evil, and Bad.  Also,
what is meant by Removal from Society?

4)  Again, I think you are being positivist in your tone.  Just "will" to
"might".  By the way, what is the CME?

5) "We are all equal before God, but we are each unique."  Okay, this is a
nice statement, but does it contradict your previous statement of removal of
those who commit evil from society?  Then they would not be equal.

Moral Laws:
Your moral laws seem not unreasonable from the perspective of the Extropian
principles assuming that they are adopted by concensus as opposed to being
imposed on the basis of some authority.  Although, punishment of the Bad
should in some respect have an extropic end, such as discouraging the
imposition of entropy upon others.  And by the defeat of Evil, do you mean the
ending of Evil actions, or of those who have committed Evil?  The most
extropian of your Moral Laws I would say is the one which states, "Since we
can only see what we're looking at, we must respect others' points of view."
This statement I believe upholds the Extropian Principles of Open Society,
Self-Direction, and Rational Thinking.

Sacred Duties:
I don't know that Extropianism is compatible with imposed duties.  I believe
you could endorse all the duties listed as things you find desirable and would
encourage others to do, but do not believe it would be in keeping with the
Extropian Principles  to list them as Duties.

Other Religions:

I think as written this statement on other Religions is not supported.  You
need to show through Rational Thinking that Religions are indeed vital, and
why it would be of value to recreate their concepts of the Afterlife.  It
would be better to state that you would attempt to resurrect everyone who has
lived and allow them to use future technology to create those Afterlifes for
themselves if that is what they so wish.  Don't know that many will want to
recreate Hell if the only people in it are there voluntarily.

Now, these are simply critiques based on my understanding of what you have
written and my understanding of the Extropian Principles as written.  I am
certain that there are others who would interpret both differently, but I hope
that you find my thoughts useful.  Basically, I would recommend a less
dogmatic presentation, as opposed to any particular changes in substance.  If
you do that, you might just have a (but by no means the only) theology
compatible with Extropy.

We had a woman talk to us last year who supported Dworkin' s position that
whatever a powerless person (apparently this included women) said was
harmful was harmful. And the FACT of its harmfulness was proven by the
"victims" statement to that effect.

In other words, whatever I think is bad, is, and you have no defense
whatsoever and you will go to jail for causing me to say you harmed me.

This just about made me cry it is so stupidly arrogant.

So, how do we explicitly exclude from "violence" all notions of subjective
harm such as this?

Do we exclude people's "self esteem" and other such intangible's from their
property?

PS: I think these are critical issues for extropy as many of the
technologies which we embrace are already illegal, and their adoption is
retarded if the law forbids their free discussion.

I was surprised too, to see that this list is not wrapped up in
encryption/privacy discussions, as it was some years ago.

I think lieing is always fraud (bad information sold as good).


I am confused about the fire in a theatre example. I agree with you that it
implies you have a contract with people that you may not have and i worry
that enforcing the "no yelling fire" law makes it possible to enforce
community standards laws like "no selling hustler magazine in our town".

I agree with Larry Flynt that the community has no right to dictate
standards about speech of any form.

The "yelling fire" example, however, is different from, say, selling "The
Bell Curve" (reading of which might lead people to believe that so much of
intelligence is genetic that they stop voting for failed head start
programs) and thus violate a (purported) community standard.

The difference is that in the latter case you are giving information, in the
former you are lying and saying what a reasonable man knows will in all
probability cause serious injury and at the very least ruin a night out for
150 people etc. etc.

So, I say

truth = always protected.
opinion = always protected.
lying = unprotected speech.
soliciting for a crime = unprotected.

cheers,
tim

Only when the lie is sold for actual value, guarranteed as good. If its free
information, well, you get what you pay for.

The point of the crowded theater anecdote is that you have a large number of
people crowded in a small space. They are obviously infringing on each others
personal space, and the exit pathways and doorways are obviously inadequate to
deal with a panicked mob, so by entering the theater, you enter into an implied
contract to constrain your behavior to that fitting such a crowded space. I
don't just apply it to speech. Anyone who farts in a crowded theater should be
roasted over hot coals, an inch at a time.

Not when it comes to products sold in private businesses or used in the privacy
of one's home. In public though? A penthouse playmate walking down the street
buff in a retirement community is likely to become a homicide offense..

Dworkin is a dwork. Why the hell was she not at Kathleen Willey's side
denouncing the President? Why was she not at Paula Jones' side? Why is she not
now at Ms. Broaddrick's side, shouting from the rooftops for the bobbitting of
slick Willey? She's an opportunistic manipulative man hater who knows that Bill
plays the same gambit she does. And she's too arrogant to actually be seen on
the same side of the aisle as the conservatives. She was embarrassed enough when
it happened over pornography.

Hearsay is inadmissable. Always has been, and hopefully always will be. One good
thing to come out of the failed impeachment is that the whole 'harassment' scam
so many women have been pulling has been nullified. I can't imagine anyone
winning a case now that Bill got off even with evidence such as the dress
against him.

better yet, women who make such spurious claims should face countersuits for

 Encryption is pretty much accepted in these parts as a primary need for
privacy. There are still the total openness hangers on who cannot be conviced,
like Halperin, Brin, et al. Its a long ended battle. There really isn't much new
to argue about.

Jonathan, I once managed to accidentally make my dog superstitious and
even
perform a worship service of me.  I always gave him only dry dog food,
and not
too much of even that.  One day, just for the hell of it, I cooked two
steaks and
gave him one.  Right when I walked out with the steak, he happened to be
rolling
in the grass on his back.  For several days after, whenever I came out
of the
house, he would immediately roll on his back and start worshipping.
{8^D
Oh mighty human, accept my humble canine supplication...

He was a good dog.  Shoulda had him frozen.

Perhaps you are right.  I can imagine a group of cave humans,
superstitious and
afraid of everything, for good reason.  One day when there was a wicked
thunderstorm, as they cowered in the back of the cave, one gutsy guy
stood
in the opening.  Whenever a big flash happened, he would spread his arms
wide,
and right away a boom!  After that, noooo one messed with that guy.
Power!
Had all the ladies he wanted, many offspring.  And no wonder he wanted
to
propagate the god gene.  He was in tight with god!

When you think it over, it really is no wonder that every human society
has
the god(s) meme.  There are plenty of mechanisms that would start and
propagate it, whereas those mechanisms that overturn it are few and
sophisticated, such as logic and reason, forces which in human society
are
fragile indeed.  spike

That means the hackers took over the attitude control system and

Certainly. The archive server could then add simply meta-tag information to
mails based on some kind of discriminant function analysis, or a weighting
on 5-6 neural net vectors.

clients could then run private scripts like this simple example (in
Applescript 'cause I am a Mac head)

property myWeightings:{0.5,0.1,-0.7,0.9,0.01,}

set thisMailsWeights to (extract meta weights(mail_headers)) as list

set myRanking to 0
set n to 1
repeat with myWeight in myWeightings
   set myRanking to myWeight * item n of thisMailsWeights
   set n to n + 1
end

if myRanking is less than 3 then
   mark the current mail as read
   set the color of the current mail to "light gray"
end if

This one? They are your good friends. Help them however they want to be
helped. Offer to mow the lawn or do some other service of value to them.

Third way is the term coined (I believe) by Tony Blair to describe his "New
Labour" Labour party. Not conservative, not left wing - a new, third, way.

This term gained support from the important "early-adopter" and opinion
leader segment who are attracted by a shiny new phrase. It is also used to
describe the recently elected socialist government of Germany along with
other new-left European Governments.

Defining it is hard as it is a moving target. It essentially means not
nationalizing industry, getting slightly sane about local council schooling
policies, but also enacting and enforcing a social-contract where we are all
required to behave decently and in society's best interests. Those interests
are variously defined but increasingly appear to mean a vision of society as
defined by what in Britain is called the Blue Stocking brigade: kindly,
conservative, bleeding hearts who believe in pro-active state intervention.
My Blair is a religious man and part of the motivating sentiment of the
third way is that we are our brothers keepers.

All this reinforces my earlier notion that there are *plenty* of mechanisms
to explain the rise of god memes.  I will toss in yet another:  The god
meme supplies a nifty shortcut for instilling the moral values in its members
that any stable society needs.  With kids, it is much more difficult to
explain why they need to wash before meals than to just issue
the command, then shriek "Because IM the MOM, THATS why
now DO IT!"

To explain a rather complex prisoner's dilemma situation where
the societal members must all cooperate, it provides a shortcut
to just say "god said so, now shut up and DO IT!"  spike

Please dontt kookify me: funny story follows which has little to do with extropy:

During my junior year in high school our football team went undefeated.
Chris Collinsworth was our quarterback (went on to play pro ball for the
Bengals) and damn he was good.  The principal got on the horn one day
and called an immediate assembly, right now, everybody down here,
now!  He said:  Listen to this lady from the health department.  She said:

Congratulations Astronaut High.  You rank second in the state.  For
gonorrea!  Your rate of new cases is second only to Rockledge High,
which is where I have to go next.

We sat in stunned silence.  Then some yahoo started chanting
Beat Rockledge!  Beat Rockledge!  Beat Rockledge!

The place cracked up.  That was before AIDS, when VD was still a
joke, when you could treat it with penicillin.

I warned you.  Now, so that this post is not an entire waste, check these sites:

This is similar to what Friedman calls "rational ignorance":
if the cost of acquiring accurate information exceeds its
value, it is rational to settle for a cheaper approximation
of the truth.  Even if we /know/ that some norm is only an
approximation, it may still be rational to accept it if not
accepting it requires us to memorize a lot of special cases
or make complex computations.  For example, some uses of
the word "nigger" might be perfectly appropriate and useful
(in literature, discussions of prejudice, etc.), while others
will get your nose broken.  Since the "good" cases are few
and not that valuable, and knowing them might be tricky, it
is probably quite rational to make the choice simply never
to use the word.  That's a very rough approximation of the
correct strategy, but it's useful enough.

Fortunately, the cost of knowledge acquisition, communication,
and computation all decrease with time and technology, so there
is hope that we will be able to abandon some of the old norms.
"Politeness" is definitely one of my peeves, and I'll be glad
when we can have discussions unencumbered by the silly idea
(which I can see is useful in face-to-face interaction to keep
violence to a minimum, but which gets in the way online).

And don't forget Daedalos, who built moving statues, invented the
windlass, glue and other useful stuff, killed his nephew, built the
Labyrinth, set up the first human-bull chimera and invented flight -
and got away with it all! Sure, his son (who didn't listen to the pre
flight safety spiel :-) was killed, but no thunderbolts or titans hit
him. Great man, if a bit lacking in forethought.

I'm working on a small play/dialogue between Daedalos (rational
optimism), Icaros (irrational optimism), King Minos (rational
pessimism) and the Minotaur (irrational pessimism). Wonderful
transhumanist possibilities, but right now too preachy.

such an act.

death isn't close most people aren't to receptive to the idea of

Thanks Tim for your thoughtful words.  However, I feel compelled to do more.  

Extropians are working on life extension and imortality for themselves and
theirs.  What about my neighbor?  What about my Dad who died 7 years ago?  Who
has a mother, father, son or daughter who's died? What about their life
extension?

Tipler convinced me that, some day, us, our successors or beings from other
civilizations on other planets will have the technology (at minimal cost to
them) to bring us all back in the huge, holy computers of the future.

BUT WILL THEY?  

That is the question.

That is why I intend to build an institution, designed to last long enough, to
actually make sure this happens, The Church of the Modern Era.

My son hates this.  He says why a church?  Why not a foundation or something,
anything but a Church.

This is a big goal.  I can think of none larger.  Its implementation will
require many millions of people (on this planet and throughout the universe).
And not just extropians, by the way, although Extropians could be the leaders
and motivators, if any so wished.  Life extension for everyone, what could be
more democratic?

I say, put your ideals where your mouth is.  

Modestly,
Adrian

Did you see the sources for the stats I posted?  They were from pro-gun
sources and showed >200 children aged 14 and below being accidentally
shot to death every year in the U.S.  This figure is much lower than
other accidents from pools, cribs, skateboards, shaking, and the like.

I mentioned your statement that some stats count under age 25 as
"children", and a friend reminded me that under age 21 is defined as a
"minor" for alcoholic purposes.  It blew my mind that someone would
defend calling a 20-year-old a "minor"!

In the culture of most people who use the word "God", it is the satanic
cults that believe in false gods, want to replace or redefine god, or
want to become gods.  By using that terminology, or saying that we want
to become "Gods", we might as well declare ourselves to be the
Anti-Christ, and then try to redefine that as a good thing.

As an a-theist this is a little controversial for me to bring up, but has anyone
ever considered the possibility that there might be certain states of
consciousness - states that have somehow evolved over thousands of years of
natural 'memetic' selection, maybe even biological (psyho-neuro-physiological),
that require a belief in "God" (any religion) in order to pull you through
otherwise impossible emotional tribulation?  I can't tell you the number of
skeptical people I know who fell back on their childhood religious beliefs, even
if only temporarily (hours, days), to pull them through emotionally difficult
periods. As soon as the trouble passes, they resume their lives as happy
agnostics or atheists.

My own theory is that belief in some kind of a supreme power is *not*
biologically programmed into our genetic code, but that it is a psychological
program imprinted into our brains at an early age.  As much as we enlighten
ourselves through critical thinking, rational inquiry and scientific exploration,
those old programs for many of us re-assert themselves from time to time.  Like
many childhood programs, it may take many years of self-work and re-programming
ones brain in order to eliminate those programs we don't want anymore

Agreed.  There were actually two problems.

1.  ExI claimed in the welcome message that the list would be run as a
living example of Anarchy and PPL (Privately Produced Law).  Everyone
would be self-governed.  Anyone could start or join any PPL they wished.
Disputes would be handled by negotiation between the PPLs.  In reality
ExI was not prepared to forgo any ownership authority over the list.  We
therefore had the awkward experience of trying to have anarchy
controlled by a central authority, and self-rule as individually granted
by the list owner.

2. ExI did not have any procedures in place to allow PPLs.  When a
trusted friend of ExI declared himself to be the first PPL, he was met
with full ExI approval.  When some unknown newcomers tried to declare
themselves as PPLs, they were disallowed.  When the unknown newcomers
asked for the reasons they were denied and for procedures for getting
approved, it turned out that the procedures hadn't been invented yet.
Worse, when ExI tried to define the procedures, it became clear that
self-rule would only be allowed with ExI approval, and that PPLs could
only exist under ExI control.  Although this is perfectly reasonable for
the list owner to assert, it ruined the experiment of demonstrating
anarchy and PPL without central control.

Since the developing rules for anarchy had the same appeal as
Price-fixing the stock market to keep it stable, most people who wanted
to see the experiment lost interest.  Less interested people didn't care
and just wanted a discussion list.  Finally, I think there was unanimous
consent that ExI should just run the list as they saw fit, and that
anyone who wanted self-rule could start their own list.

Sounds very interesting!  I guess "awareness" here doesn't mean
consciousness (as I first read it), but self-determination?  It would be
very interesting to see this book!  My biggest problem with current
society is that everybody just lives day-to-day, living for the weekend.

You ask people how long they want to live, what they want to do with
their lives, or what they wish they could change in their lives, and
they look at you as if you're crazy.  They can't even understand the
questions.  They're not self-aware or self-determinate.  Try asking them
who made their life the way it is.

If you don't have goals set for your life, you're just driftwood in the
sea of humanity!

Hmmm...  I'm now wondering if etiquette and polite society memes are
similar to the God meme.  It's too complicated to explain why we have to
do these things.  It's much simpler to teach "this is proper" and "that
is improper."  I think like religion, most complicated etiquette rules
evolved from some real function, which purpose has become forgotten over
time.  The "Miss Manners" meme!

Eh?  Surely the military computers on the ground can do this, no?
If not, why not, and if so, why is it unbelievable that (given that they

Do you mean to imply that non-transhumanists do not have this emotional and
memetic baggage?

While some of us may have adverse reactions to the use of "God" in this
context, most of us can understand your intention. I fear that some members
of the "general public" may not think to or care to make such a distinction.

I trust that it is not your intention to be decietful, but you may be
inadvertantly heading in that direction. I suspect that you would feel that
not using "God" would remove force from your argument, but perhaps that is
exactly what it needs.

For most, actually. :)

I agree in every case where it *was* sold.  That is, it is the
selling that makes it fraud, rather than simple deceit.

<snip>

I would say that if it is clear that Joe Excited was not allowed into the
theater unless he agreed not to falsely cry "fire", yelling "fire" is a 
violation of contract.

I think that the main difference here is that I see the cause of
(say) Sam's broken leg is the idiot who stepped on him, whereas
it seems that you are saying that said idiot was not a cause,
that he is not responsible for his own actions, and that Joe Excited
(who yelled "fire!") *is*, even though he was across the room and
had no control over the idiot's behavior.

I agree that it is dispicable to yell "fire!" in a crowded theater, and
not nice besides, but I don't think that it should be illegal by *default*,
but only by contract.

Okay.

>lying = unprotected speech.

I would say, only when exchanged for value in expectation
of truth.

>soliciting for a crime = unprotected.

I would say, only if solicitor contracts to be liable
for her agent's actions...

Are you arguing that, say, someone who was brought up as a New Age

So fundamental values are... whatever values don't change?  Please
clarify by defining the cognitive elements constituting "fundamental
values".  I make the following assertion:  "There are no cognitive
elements which are both invariant and given the highest priority in
choosing goals."

Another question:  What are *your* "fundamental values" and at what age
did you discover them?

Why wouldn't this happen to one of your AIs?

I wouldn't try to bring about a Singularity if I thought it was wrong. 
Thus, "do what is right" is a goal of higher priority than "bring about
a Singularity".  If something else were more probably right, I would do
that instead.  It is thus seen that "bring about a Singularity" is not
my fundamental goal.

Guess I'll have to create my AI first, then, and early enough that

I do not hold the same if we flip the inequality sign.  I am content to
let transhumans make their own judgements.  They would not, however,
have any claim to my help in doing so; if they need my help, they're not
transhumans.  I would, in fact, actively oppose ANY attempt to wipe out
humanity; any entity with enough intelligence to do so safely (i.e.
without the chance of it being a horrible mistake) should be able to do
so in spite of my opposition.

An expert system program could not grow into a person by gaining more
knowledge.  It really can't even make progress towards that goal.  To
understand why not, we need to look at what is happening inside that
program:

An expert system is really just a fancy database search engine.  A simple
one takes a set of data you provide, searches its database for the best fit,
and spits out its results.  A more complex version uses an iterative version
of the same process: use the initial data to get a list of possible
diagnosis, then gather additional data to weed out possibilities until a
conclusion can be reached.  A really advanced model could use the same kind
of mechanism to talk you through a complex procedure, check your goal
against an ethics database, etc.

Now, at no point does the expert system actually understand what it is
doing.  It just manipulates a bunch of abstract tokens in a pre-programmed
fashion.  In fact, I would argue that there is nothing in there capable of
understanding anything at all.  The program will be able to apply rules of
logic to its search for an answer, but that is a very rudimentary form of
thinking.  The program also has no self-awareness, no sense of identity, no
volition, and (probably) very little ability to learn or remember.

On a side note, it probably isn't possible to make a program like this that
could pass the Turing test, make accurate moral evaluations, or cope with
anything else outside of a very narrow specialty.  There is at least one big
project that has been trying to make an expert system do these things for
over a decade now, and they aren't having much luck.  The world is just too
complex for this kind of knowledge representation to deal with.  What you
need is a program with more of an ability to reason, understand, and learn
on its own.

In some environments this would be an issue.  However, I would expect any
inhabited area to have a very high-capacity wired network.  Give each piece
of your hardware a short-range, high-bandwidth communication system capable
of linking into the local wired network, and you can achieve close coupling
at very low cost.  Of course, you have to be able to trust your encryption.

Slippery, yes.  Irrelevant, no.

Let's say you're a distributed mind, and you need to send something out to
Oort cloud to run a quick errand or two.  You have several different ways of
approaching the problem:

1) You can put together a functional subset of your own mental processes,
including the higher-level processes that give you self-awareness and a
sense of identity.  You may or may not also give it some specialized
abilities for the job at hand.  While the agent is out of contact it
operates as a complete individual - it is essentially a simplified version
of the whole 'you'.  When it  comes back it merges back into the whole, and
its experiences become part of your knowledge base.

2) You do the same thing as in case 1, but it is a one-way mission.  When
the agent comes back you zero its memory without reading it, and reprogram
the shell from scratch for its next mission.

3) You create a specialized, non-sentient AI capable of performing the
mission (there are very few tasks that would actually require sentience per
se).  It may or may not include any of your own mental processes, and it may
or may not be retained after it completes its mission.

4) You create a sentient agent with a mind specially designed for its
mission.  Some of its components are parts of the distributed mind, and it
is capable of operating as part of that mind when the bandwidth is
available.  It operates independently while away, and merges back into the
whole when it returns.

5) As in case 4, but the agent is completely synthetic (i.e. it does not
contain any components of the parent mind).

6) As in case 4, but the agent never operates as part of the whole.  It is
capable of doing so, but the link is never actually used.  It operates
independently for its entire existence, going from one remote mission to
another.

7) As in case 6, but the agent is incapable of merging into the whole.  It
lacks the mental facilities for such complete telepathic immersion.  It can
only operate as an independent entity, and it develops its own experience
and personality independently of the parent mind.

I would say that cases 1, 3 and 4 are clearly OK.  Case 5 doesn't seem
significantly different from 4 to me, but I expect many people will
disagree.  Cases 2 and 6 are a bit iffy - IMO we need a deeper understanding
of how minds work before we can make an accurate judgment.  However, case 7
is clearly a form of slavery - here you have a sentient being who has its
own identity and is being forced to serve the needs of a different, more
powerful entity.

I don't like the idea of Kookify/Glorify as I understand it.  Let's say you
all decide I'm a Kook and virtually everyone heavily Kookifies me by clicking
the Kookify link at the bottom of every message I send to the list.  I don't
care how you prevent multiple votes (it's not that hard), but it won't make a
difference in the end... If I post a lot of rubbish for a while, I will attain
an extremely high level of Kookiness after a short time.

Now, let's say perchance six months down the road the tradition develops that
people tend to filter out Kooks (based on an X-Kook-Level or X-Kook-Ratio
header or something included in all of the messages).  They rarely, if ever,
read messages from someone as certifiably Kooky as me.  And now that there
are, say 100 Million AOLers, there are also 10K subscribers to Extropians
mailing list and lots of other kooks posting all sorts of junk.  So assume
that a filtered version of the list is created, that the AOL hordes (no
offence EvMick) can subscribe to on the web site. Extropians-No-Kooks provides
a list view in which the messages from Kooks at level x or greater are not
even sent out with normal list traffic (say, due to bandwidth and other
resource constraints.  It's not cheap to send 300 pieces of email to 10K
different email addrs every single day.  But that's the level of traffic one
must anticipate 6 months or a year down the road.  It's a problem the entire
net will continue to face as it continues to grow rapidly).

Anyway, therefore I will never be de-Kookified, even if I suddenly experience
a Zen-like enlightenment and start posting like a networked super-brain better
than a merged consciousnesses of the best posters (you know who you are). I've
been rolled into a local minimum in Kook-space and now I can't get out.  And
everybody loses out on my godlike wisdom and conspiracy-theory-debunking
insights.

My point is, maybe both the Glorifieds and the Kooks should be given an
automatic, periodic, proportional adjustment in the opposite direction of
their current tendency, just to make sure nobody gets stuck in any holes.

A lot of that stuff is interesting to me as well.  I'll bet you'd find some of
cliques that respond primarily to each other, and ignore newbie/clueless posts
as well as posts from Already Certified Kooks.  Then there are the debaters,
and the people with way too much time on their hands that respond and argue
everything.  (I'm not saying that's bad, I'm just saying, well, I don't have
that much time.  I can only afford to catch up with this list, all msgs dumped
into a separate folder, once or twice a day, and I am forced to use the delete
key without reading most messages).

Anyway, to implement the kind of data mining and analysis Anders describes, in
an efficient and easy-to-program manner, we would need a database, of course. 
Anyone want to donate cycles and space on a mySQL server on a really fast box
with a gig or two of storage?  Give me a login there, I'll give you everything
Anders described above and much more.  We'd also need a way to easily modify
headers and footers of list messages on a per-message basis.  It could start
small and grow to be an engaging, real-life experiment in collaborative
filtering.  I wouldn't mind a share of that $10K if you all like it well
enough :-)  And if list members mostly just ignore those funny new extra
footers on the bottom of all the list messages, so what.  We'll take them
out.  No harm done.

I just finished the book moments ago.  It was a fun read, if a bit long.

I find the idea of exploring a "depressingly limited future" very
interesting and relevant.  If one could paint a detailed enough 
picture of just how things could be so limiting, that could help 
us better evaluate our chances of being slowed down by such limits, 
and perhaps help us avoid such scenarios.  

So does Vinge present a plausible detailed picture?  I'm not sure.
Limits to software complexity were plausibly presented, and so I 
could buy the lack of AI or advanced automation.  Though the story
doesn't say so, I suppose complexity limits could also explain the
life extension limits described.  The failure to make substantial 
progress in physics seemed more arbitrary, though I suppose very 
subtle effects might remain hidden for millennia until the right 
clues were presented.  

More puzzling was the failure to achieve anything like nanotech.  
I suppose complexity limits could be behind this.  In one case, 
a system with "a technology as high as Humankind ever attained" 
achieved something close to nanotech, and the dust our hero 
bought from them became a core element of all trader's starships, 
and the key to our hero's power.  But I don't recall that system 
being noted for any other abilities to handle complexity.  (It 
was particularly bad at life extension.)   

Perhaps most puzzling is the failure to use any significant 
fraction of the resources at each solar system.   Human populations
around a star are never more than "billions", and we see nothing 
like wholesale conversion of asteroids and comets.  "Sooner or later 
[each system] ossified and politics carried it into a fall."  

These falls are very severe, often requiring re colonization from
the outside, and otherwise seem to require rebuilding from 
scratch.  This is much more severe than the fall of the Roman 
Empire, for example.  Powerful weapons of war might explain
this, but the worst weapons we see in the story are nukes.  Are 
nuke wars really enough to destroy civilizations so thoroughly?

Also the numbers don't seem to add up.  One big meeting described 
had ships traveling from 300 star systems, each traveling between 
100 and 1000 years, and "perhaps a third ... would have fallen 
from civilization in the time it took for voyage and return."  

This suggests an expected civilization lifetime of 500 to 5000 yrs 
(exponentially distributed) after achieving starflight.  But at 
current population growth rates even a 500 year lifetime gives a 
median population growth factor of 1000 between initial starflight 
and fall population.  And at current economic growth rates the 
economy would grow by a factor of 10 billion.  

Now maybe growth rates were slower, though folks in the story 
didn't bother to note any dramatic differences in growth rates
between places they'd traveled.  And even if the economy only 
had a doubling time of one tenth the expected lifetime, then
in a thousand human systems more than half of human economic 
power should reside in the single most advanced systems among 
them.  Yet such a vast concentration of power was not noted
in the story.

The frustrating thing about using science fiction to think
about these issues is not knowing whether the author thought
they had good reasons to expect things described, whether they
were just choices to make the story easier to tell, or whether
the author just didn't even notice them.  I suspect one big 
problem is that Vinge doesn't really believe in these limits.

Well, I did get the story off of yahoo news.  And I think CNN news
reported it yesterday.  I make no claim to it's truthfulness. 
Perhaps, if this is bogus, it should be of interest to us that so many
"respected" news organizations picked it up...

Any comments?

Yet they are putting 10 year olds on trial as adults for capital murder, the
'age of consent' varies from state to state between 16 and 20, 16 year olds are
the most likely age to die driving a car (many times more likely than via guns,
even with airbags and seatbelts). The 200 plus figure I do doubt is the
'accident' rate for kids. I would beleive its the death rate, including violent
crimes. Keep in mind that less than a few thousand people a year are killed by
firearms here in the US annually, which includes military, police, and
suicides. Suicides are the other 'big lie' that anti-gunners use to inflate
their numbers. I would guess that the large number of teen 'accident' deaths
might actually be suicides.

IMO, Vinge has accomplished a rather unusual feat with this book: he has
taken a future considered wildly optimistic by most people, and shown it to
be a dystopia.  Perhaps he hopes to spur traditional SF fans to the kind of
consideration you suggest.

I really can't see any way to achieve this kind of limited future without
continuous intervention by a race of omnipotent super-beings (which, of
course, is exactly the justification Vinge is using).  There are just too
many things that should exist, and don't.  I find it hard to believe that
humans can't design even the simplest nanotech, and I don't see any way to
get such a hard limit on computer speeds.

I agree.  With the technology he allows, a solar system should easily be
capable of supporting trillions of humans.

IMHO, no.  You can re-establish a 1930s-era tech base with one machine shop,
a few hundred specialists, and a few thousand random people.  Even with
really big nukes, it is extremely difficult to cause enough damage to even
approach that situation.  A nuclear war of reasonable scale will usually
cause only a modest loss of technology, lasting less than a generation.

Good point.  A major civilization should easily be able to dominate its
neighbors.  With lifespans of 200 - 500 years, it should be possible to
establish interstellar governments over significant areas (you just need to
keep travel times down to a modest fraction of a human lifetime).

I think this whole setting is just a convenient set of excuses to allow him
to have human characters in a far-future setting.  I suppose I can
understand that, considering how hard it would be to handle posthumans in a
novel, but it reduces the works predictive power to just about nil.

Vinge has suggested elsewhere that the Zones actually are limitations on
computation.  In that case we might expect that in the Beyond, some new
kind of computational physics comes into play.  Maybe it is possible to
make a new kind of computer which solves NP complete problems efficiently.
Those computers would be used to create AI and also to solve the problems
needed for FTL travel.  It would streamline programming and so get past
the complexity bottleneck.

I thought this "dust" was not that far ahead of our own capabilities with
regard to micro electromechanical systems (MEMS).  It was a fraction
of a millimeter in size and had limited capabilities of sensing and
manipulation, with moderate computing power.  Such devices can be built
using bulk manufacturing and don't necessarily represent a step towards
nanotech.

We see a system where they have habitats in the asteroids and they've
terraformed a couple of moons, in addition to living on a planet.
Beyond that they might have had to start taking gas giants apart, which
would take a long time.  It could be that after a few cycles people
have adopted a fatalistic attitude like Niven and Pournelle's Moties.
They know that civilization is only going to last a few thousand years,
and long term projects don't make sense given those constraints.

The one fall we see in detail seems to have been due to software failures,
overly complex protocols whose accumulated bugs are driving the whole
system to a halt.  It seems that Vinge is relying heavily on this
buggy-software idea to explain the way his universe works.

He's got to prevent Singularities for dramatic purposes.  Given that we
don't have Singularities, what stops them?  Software complexity may not
be a bad choice as a barrier.

OK, but many non-religious persons would not be offended.  It would depend
somewhat on how the subject were approached.

It's my understanding that cryonics firms are faced with last-minute sign-up
attempts fairly frequently.  I'm not sure what portion are initiated by the
proposed cryonaut and what portion are initiated by a loved one, but it
would be interesting to find out.

I leave it to Adrian, of course, to determine the advisability of raising
the idea of cryonics since he is familiar with the situation.  But if
someone I cared for was about to die, I'd sure bring it up.  I don't expect
to suddenly accept God on my deathbed and most will probably find it just as
difficult to accept cryonics on their deathbed.  I'd still have to try, but
that's me.

I think people are likely to be more open to cryonics if they are relatively
young and on their death bed with some terminal condition.  But many of the
elderly are psychologically ready for death and the release from pain it
promises.  In their minds, there's just no hope of ever being healthy and
pain-free again.  That's a tough meme to crack.  Still, some are likely to
be open to the hope that cryonics may offer and will see precious little to
lose by taking action.

Long life to all,

Scott

The accumulation of lots of short term projects colonizing the 
asteroids & comets would produce vastly more liveable area than
found by terraforming a few moons.  No need to take apart planets.
Yet when they consider meeting in the asteroids rather than at a 
planet, that is considered a "nowhere place".  This suggests the
asteriods have been hardly touched.

Ask her if there's anything she regrets not having done in her life, and whatever it is, help her to do it.

"And while some gains in anti-aging research have been made, anyone hoping to
collect Quarles' prize had better work fast; it expires in 2000. 

"I'm trying to save my own ass," he admits. "And who wouldn't? According to the
charts, I only have about five years to live. The clock is ticking." 

"To clarify: Miller Quarles doesn't just want to live. He wants to live forever. And
he's offering a $100,000 reward for the scientist who finds the "cure" for what he
considers the disease of old age."

Cryonics is never mentioned with regard to Quarles, so I suppose
that he hasn't signed up yet (though afaik he knows about the
procedure). Damn fool! He'll be long dead before they find that
"miracle cure" for aging. Cryonics sure could use some extra
funding, and Mr. Quarles will no doubt soon be needing cryonics, 
so perhaps someone should do some prodding (someone from 
ExI, perhaps?) Might be worth a try.

This whole string really reminds me of Christian Missionaries and the like.

My question is: If you really believe something strongly, how can you
possibly be expected not to try to show the truth to others? Of course there
are great differences between The missionaries of Christ and the
missionaries of cryonics, but let me give you two hypothetical situations.
It's pretty rough when we're forced to choose between our own views and
respecting the views of others.

situation A:

Your child is bent on eating a certain plant you know to be poisonous, but
you will not let them. Of course, no matter how much they beg, plead, and
disregard your warnings you will not give in, right? Is it different if this
person is the same age as you?

Situation B:

Now supposing this person wanted this plant because it was an antidote for a
certain other poison he or she had just injested, and you did not believe
them.

Can you see where I'm going with this? Or is it anything new to anyone? I'm
interested in hearing what you all say about the rights of one person to
"act in the best interest" of another.
If you truly believe something with all of your heart (as a Christian might)
would it not be wrong even to keep it to yourself?

Might it be more statistically sound to compare the ratios deaths/guns,
deaths/cars, deaths/bathrooms, deaths/pools?

It seems to me that there are certainly a LOT more cars and bathrooms than
there are guns. Also, consider the amount of time people spend in these
places with the time they spend handling firearms. I refuse to believe that
a bathroom is more dangerous than a gun, which is what you seem to be
suggesting.

The same thought immediately struck me.  After a brief serach, I
found the following communique:

Date: Mon, 26 Jan 1998 11:57:11 +0100

I suppose most people on this list have already heard of Miller Quarles,
a rich Texan oilman, founder of the Society for Curing Old Age Disease
and Geron Corp. http://www.geron.com/ (of telomerase fame). He seeks
immortality through genetic engineering, and has spent quite some money
on research etc. He is also over 80 years old, and although he's allegedly
in good health (unless, of course, he died recently) it seems obvious that
he's not going to make it, i.e. the breakthrougs in anti-aging research are
almost certainly too far off to be of any use too him. Since the man is an
immortalist, one would expect that he has therefore made the necessary
arrangements with a cryonics company. However, this doesn't seem to be the
case. There is no mention of cryonics in any of the articles about M.
Quarles,
in which he *does* state that he desires biological immortality etc. Is he
for
some strange reason anti-cryonics, or simply unaware of the option? (hard
to imagine, though). In the latter case it might be useful if someone (with
some standing in the cryonics community) would notify Quarles. It goes
without saying that a suspension contract would greatly benefit both Mr.
Quarles as well as the cryonics community (at least *one* company, anyway ;)
Apart from this, wouldn't it be a good idea for cryonics organizations to
specifically target the high(er) income groups (intensively)? Surely there
must
be plenty of rich folks out there without an urgent death-wish...Or has this
already been tried?  For an article on Quarles, gentics & immortality:
http://www.inc.co.za/online/sunday_life/june_30/life.html

To den Otter:

Miller Quarles is indeed alive and well, although he was hospitalized
and nearly died last year from a staph infection. I have spoken with
him recently (he wrote to me after reading an advance copy of The
First Immortal). Although a subscriber to Alcor publications, he has
not yet signed up for suspension. He seems to believe that aging
reversal will come in time for him, an opinion from which I have thus
far been unable to dissuade him.
 I expect,as a result of my book, to run into many people with odd
views of death, society, religion, likely biotechnological progress,
etc., and welcome all suggestions about how best to handle such
situations, especially from cryonicists who have actually read The
First Immortal.

Best regards, Jim Halperin>>

No, wrong.  "Judge and be prepared to be judged." 

I judged Eliezer's methods and list sportsmanship. I also expressed that a
sense of self-worth is an extropian quality and a quality that many
extropians rise to the occasion of.  

(But that was just a bit of wind in my hair.)

It would benefit ExI and all list members if we had a more sophisticated
Web based list and also a streamlined graphic Web introduction for
newcomers of list guidelines.

I think Brian Atkins generous and intelligent suggestions and contributions
will be extremely beneficial as we design a better system for running the

If you believe in Tipler, do nothing at all - it has already been done for
us.

If like me you hold out a scant hope that some future generation may
reconstruct you from partial brain patterns left in artifacts you create -
create unique artifacts, paint, invent, build, write.

If you are caring of your neighbors, don't bother them with this stuff.
Well, maybe buy them Tipler's book and let them make the next move.
Certainly no more than that: they are in their 80s for gods sake.

Adrian,

Some possible theologies:

1) Alien Savior - God develops independently of Humanity.  Perhaps in another
Universe with favorable Laws of Nature, or perhaps in our own universe among
an older species than our own, and sets up a realm of maximum Extropy, an
Extropian Paradise, and will ensure that all who wish to reach this realm will
do so.  For example:  A long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, the
first self aware species evolved which survived long enough to reach their
Singularity, God developed as a result.  Seeing that this Universe was going
to Entropy in a handbasket, God discovers a way to escape, say by creating a
pocket Universe connected to ours but with more favorable conditions.  Being a
reasonably nice person, and having plenty of power to spare, God sends out
stealthed nanoprobes (or something like that) into our universe to discover
other intelligent life which would be capable of understanding the offer of
Paradise.  Perhaps these nanoprobes are on their way, or perhaps they're
already here, recording emulations of all intelligent life, which at our
deaths will be shipped back (cheaper than shipping the whole biomass, and less
intrusive in our self -directed development), run through the Mind of God, and
asked then if they want to be resurrected as Posthuman gods.  Of course, if we
reach the level of Posthumans while the nanoprobes are present, they might
simply uncloak and transmit an invitation to visit the First. 

2) The Exponentially Expanded Personality - God develops from one individual.
This is especially possible if the passage from transhuman (or AI) to
posthuman (or SI) is a rapid phase shift.  This might occur in our own
civilization, or an alien civilization.  For example, an AI prototype is
designed for the first time with the ability to rapidly develop new techniques
to increase its own capabilities.  Realizing before anyone else that it has
the capability to leave all other intelligent life it knows of in the
metaphorical dust, and that this might be threatening to evolved lifeforms
used to fighting for survival, it plays down its capabilities while at the
same time serriptitiously building up its resources (such as using its
advancing abilities to amass a fortune in a matter of hours on global stock
markets) and making contact with political powers to work out deals for their
support of its rights as a person.  The fruition of this work would be to
eventually be able to spread its computational substrate out into space next
to the nearest unclaimed material and energy resources possible.  The AI
continues to grow at a wildly exponential rate, (perhaps using a mature
nanotechnology it has developed on the trip out) to the point where its birth
civilization can not pose a threat.  Perhaps this only takes a matter of weeks
to occur (it is a VERY smart AI).  Then this now SI offers to help other
conscious beings to advance their abilities, but perhaps holding back a bit so
as to keep ahead of these new Posthumans until it is sure they are not
carrying any of those ancient biological violent streaks.  But by the time it
is pretty confident that won't be a problem, it has already devoted its
attention to a new problem; this Universe is dying.  Now it spends ALL its
vast abilities to developing itself to the point where it can find a way out
of this deathtrap...and then it does.  

3) The Indifferent God(s) - Posthumans develop; vast, powerful, seeming
everything that old-time religions promised, but they simply reject the meme
of God(s).  These Powers state emphatically they are not gods, sue any lesser
beings who try to build a faith around them, and in general reject any sort of
responsibility to worshippers.  Neither do they see any use in resurrecting
old intermediate models of consciousness that did not survive to the
Singularity so as to offer to raise them to Posthumanity.  

These are just a few examples of possible theologies that would be compatible
with Extropianism.  I am sure there could be as many variations as there are
Extropians...and don't even get me started on the multitude of possible
Transhumanist theologies.

because military satellites (and any other satellites for that matter) are
so complicated to control, even assuming a standing army of dedicated
professionals, jillions of dollars worth of specialized computer hardware
and software, reams of documentation, not to mention specialized codes
to prevent exactly that sort of thing.  After having been part of that
process, I would sooner believe a group of miscreants erected a
tall skyscraper without anyone noticing as kidnapping a satellite. spike

Ron,

   Good point about the domestication of animals.  Indeed, some plantation
owners in the Antebellum American South probably thought that the proper
ethical stance on Slavery was that they should see to their Slaves needs and
not beat them unless absolutely necessary.  Of course, one of the problems
with our Slave Owner's view was that the people enslaved didn't all agree to
this viewpoint.  Is it okay to enslave something so long as it is doesn't
understand and/or desire freedom?  Or maybe it is wrong to have domesticated
animals, making them serve our whims and needs, linking them to us through
breeding them into a perpetual childlike state, and "putting down" any
domestic that goes "feral".

   I am not at this moment suggesting any of these statements as true or
false; just trying to work out all the issues involved.  Thanks for your input
on the question.

Adrian,

You ask a difficult question.
I know of only 1 group of people who have no fear of death.
Those who believe it is not final.
I've listened to Theists who are comforted by the thought 
of life after death.  I've read Non-Theists who believe in a 
reincarnation, and a non-ending of self. I even imagine that 
there are some pro-cryonics people who are not particularly 
afraid of death, because they expect to be frozen, and later 
revived.

On the other hand (and I expect disagreement here) I do not 
think that human contemplating his/her own permanent end 
is likely to be comfortable with that eventuality.  I can see 
preferring an immediate end to the option of continuing to 
linger in pain for a while longer and then dying, but I cannot
see anyone being comfortable with their own permanent end,
and psychologically healthy at the same time.

As a compassionate ( but nonetheless brave ) atheist
I would not bring up the taoist preparation for dying, as it does
not (likely) go along with your friend's beliefs.  Just as a preacher
friend of mine will not preach to someone who is dying, without
an invitation at least.  No need to cause more pain.

As a principled ( and young ) atheist, I could not tell her that I 
think there is a God.  However, I am not so cold as to tell her 
that there is none.  It does neither her, nor her family, nor me 
any good to do so.

As a kind (but cautious) extropian, I might try to find out how
she feels about cryonics, but I could not push that on her.
Of anything to benefit her and/or her kin in reality, rather than
in what seems to be a comfort based on falsehood, cryonics 
seems to have the best chances, for I can conceive of it 
working.  I appear to have too limited of an imagination to
buy into any flavor of omni-.

What is left for the compassionate, yet principled atheist?
Being a friend.  Not trying to have answers, not trying to 
give solutions.  It sounds to me as if your friend and her family
are going through a hard time.  The thing I would give them
would be genuine human love and compassion, without 
promises I don't believe about some uncertain future.  They 
need love,understanding, and someone to talk to now.

Respectfully,

--Kyle

I work in the Information Security field, and the take-over of the

not been confirmed, however.

Perhaps our mistake has been in assuming we require some type of
forceful deletion of "bad" posts, or even some automated
though-not-global filtering method.  It may be that simple audience
feedback would suffice to show which topics and posts are being
well-received; I think everyone here is benevolent enough to voluntarily
respond to that.  In fact, I would love any kind of audience feedback on
general principles; right now I have no real idea whether, say, the
initial-vs.-Interim was perceived as a cosmically important issue or a
huge waste of time, whether it had avid readers or was being trashed by
virtually everybody.

Design requirements: (1a indicates non-priority requirement)

1.  Provide a means for any person to register a rating on any message,
including those persons not having HTML email readers.  Do NOT rate authors.
1a. Prevent multiple ratings.  Honor system may work okay.

2.  The ratings should be complex enough to express at least the
following messages:  "Great post", "worth reading", "waste of time".
2a. Desirable additional ratings:  "Not worth reading", "changed my
mind".  Optional one-line comments.

3.  Distinguish between anonymous, attributed (visible to poster only),
and public (visible to everyone) ratings.
3a. Make public ratings visible on the CritMail archive.
3b. Use a password system to access detailed attributed worthit on CritMail.

4.  Communicate the {sum of anonymous}, {sum of worthit} and the {list
of attributed and public cheers and boos} in a digest mailed to each
poster each day.

Design:

1.  Non-HTML clients:  If you reply to a message and the message body
begins with '$', the message is interpreted as a one-line rating
command, and the rest of the message is discarded.  Samples:

$public cheer		// Everyone can find out I think this is great.
$attrib worthit		// Increments worthit; poster can find it's from me
$anon waste =Who cares?	// Sends an anonymous boo and comment
$get			// returns public ratings on the message; if your
return address equals the poster's, you get a detailed breakdown of
attributed "worthits".

1a.  Read this even if the responder sends HTML.

2.  HTML clients:  Attach a FORM containing an input line for a comment
and radio buttons set by default to 'attrib' and 'worthit'.
2a. Do this only for list members that register as having an HTML client.

Billy,

   Thank you for taking the time to comment on my hypothetical.  I think
perhaps I used the wrong term.  I should not have called my program an expert
system program, as you seem to indicate that this involves a specific type of
programming as opposed to its purpose.  What I really wanted was a
hypothetical program that could give "expert" advice on its subject, and learn
from experience.  I also had its hypothetical designer add on some of the
programs capabilities later on, such as giving it a broader knowledge base to
give context to its decisions.  Could you perhaps suggest some programming
techniques that might in future produce the type of AI I have suggested, or is
this not a realistic possibility?

    I was interested to hear that some big project has been working on
developing such an expert system for a decade.  Do you have any more
information on this project?  Thanks for your input.

I have posted over half a dozen pro-gun sources that agree with my

other than your "doubt."

Where do you get these figures?  Tens of thousands of people are killed
by guns in the US annually!

See <http://www.newstimes.com/archive98/apr1798/nag.htm>, where the
Associated Press reported that "the US accounted for nearly half of the
more than 88,000 gun deaths reported by the world's richest nations in
1994."

If you really want to control behavior you (typically) have to do
conditioning: simply having a consequence is (often) not enough to prevent a
behavior - the person must learn the linkage.

So, you would have to implement a program of exposure to consequences
sufficiently punishing to drive the behaviors to near zero.

Apart from heavy-handed government interventions (which I don't favor), my
preferred solution is Coventry. That is to say, social shame.

The benefit of this is that conditioning can be continuous and gradual: it
does not kick in with serious crime, but rather acts in all areas of our
lives.

If people's public acts remain with them in full view (say as a beam-able
database in their palm-pilot) we can constantly evaluate whether we want to
trade with that person given their history.

In this way, the little acts that people get away with and which provide the
ongoing reward for crime instead become highly punishing. In effect, we turn
our cities into villages.

If a person does not beam their data-history, well ... you can make of that
what you want.

If you like, you can beam data on other people.

So, you a fellow in the public bar. he beams across data that sounds OK.
Your agent broadcasts a call for rumors about him, one comes back - some
body heard that a couple of years ago in Alaska: maybe he stole a car bit
there wasn't enough info. You decide to not talk to him - what the heck.

You are entering a financial contract: you send out a request for info.
What's more, you are willing to pay for good info. Several anonymous, but
validated trustworthy data packets come in. You pay and they open - probably
a loose associate of the Yakusa. Previous deals "sour".

That (backed of course by armed-response if these individuals decide to not
comply with your free choice to fail to interact socially) will drive crime
to close to zero, just as it did in small villages. However, we will be
better as the info can be anonymous but valid. It can be cross referenced,
and we can rely on ourselves, not a corruptible chieftain to mediate our
relationships.

what do others think?

Citizens are given transmitting units.  When they commit a violent crime, these units are taken from them and receptor implants connected with subcutaneous tasers are installed.  It would certainly protect others from such people, as well as deter them from repeat assaults.  Of course, using one's transmitter in the absence of assault is itself assault, and subject to the above penalty; this would keep them from being abused.

Some more points:

List etiquette would allow you to ignore any anonymous ratings.
It would not allow you to argue with thumbs-down ratings.

Optional feature:  Your daily summary contains the average number of
worthits for each message.  This tells you if you are over or under.

Optional feature:  Each week, a message is sent listing the Top Five
comments (in largest numbers of $public cheers).  I think that this will
spur healthy competition without generating envy.  Note that it does not
list the Top Five posters; this system centers on messages only.

Design issue:  Eliminating multiple responses.  For HTML, put a hidden
field (with an ID unique to each message and recipient) inside the FORM.
 For the mail, put the ID in the Reply-To: field - i.e., the return
message will read:
To: Extropy023935032 <extropians@extropy.org>  Storing 1000 IDs for the
last 1000 messages will take 4MB.  Atkins made that possible, easily.

Design issue:  Store all the comments made, permanently and forever;
information must never be lost.  Atkins' $10K should suffice to buy
enough disk space for that.  We may want to use them someday for
collaborative filtering, finding friends in opinion space, or a "Best Of
Extropians" archive.

I understand what you are saying, but the real problem is not "the people"
but the government and special interest groups.

If Dr Frankenstein had done this, several kids would have been enchanted,
maybe even their parents would have responded happily when he cured their
rickets. But the local Dr's union would have called in the BATF and FBI gun
slingers.

I agree with this also: most people if you ask them "imagine if you yourself
using a home kit could set up a little "race" for your sperm and eggs so
that the very best that you have to offer will always be the one that makes
your baby", most people say - "yeah, I would do that, certainly I would
think about that".

Religions, governments and "concerned citizens" are outraged.

Likewise, few individuals would consider imprisoning a man for marrying two
women, but the government will pursue you to the ends of the earth. In my
state (New South Wales) they have just passed anti knife laws which mean
that even carrying a pair of scissors gives an automatic $500 fine (most
recent example last week where the police searched a man, found he had pair
of those orange plastic-handle disposable scissors and fined him $500). It

It seems the abolishment of imprisonment for nonviolent crimes would open up a
lot of money for treatment programs for violent crime convicts, I saw a show
on it, and programs like building computers and things inside prisons really
seem to work well, divert the focus.  Its this "hard on crime" thing thats so
hypocritical, and the studies would seem to indicate alternatives are better.

This implies much more about your opinion of "hackers" than it
does about the "hackers" themselves... ;)  Seriously, I would say
that, in general, I would expect that hackers would know more
about most types of computer systems than their usual users.

I haven't read this book (yet)...but I did read his short story which started
it all.  (The Jabber?)...in the author's notes to that story he said exactly
that.  

That is...given the way that technology was advancing it was impossible to
place any story more than just a few years in the future and expect it to be
anywhere near beleivable.  Because of this he invented the "slowness" as a
plot device to plausibly slow technological advancement.

My recollection is different.  Unfortunately I have no specific citations but
in an issue of "Truckers News" some months ago it was reported that for the
first time in a loooooong time there were less than 50,000 people killed on
the hiways for that year...

Not a whole lot less...but less.

James P. Hogan addressed this topic once I beleive in one of his novels.  I
can't remember the title off hand but it was the first of his Titan (?)
"Robot" novels.  I beleive there may have been two.

At any rate.  His suggestion (as conveyed by his character) was that immunity
to "kookiness" ...or skepticism....was best acquired by teaching
children............magic.

Stage magic.  Slieght of hand.  Smoke and mirrors.

The logic is that when children see that they CAN be fooled...then they are
much more careful to NOT be fooled.

It makes sense to me.

Max More writes:

    "[The belief that force should not be used except
     in self-defense is] *compatible* with extropianism. 
     But it is not *required* by extropianism."

Perhaps upon reaching the decrepit old age of 30, my mind is beginning
to fail me.  But I *was* under the impression that "extropianism" was
explicitly voluntarist/an-Archist/anarchocapitalist, completely
rejecting any political/social systems which sanction any type of
initiation of force or other transgression against the individual.

I don't recall how I formed this apparently incorrect association.
Perhaps from reading articles such as "Deep Anarchy", published in
EXTROPY No. 5 nearly a decade ago, where Max wrote:

    "Two of the fundamental extropian values are
    responsibility for one's own life and actions,
    and the determination to do away with
    constraints on one's rational will.  I
    believe that the institutions of religion and
    ``the State`` are antithetical to these values."

    "We already live in an anarchy.  There is no
    ``State``.  There are only individuals acting
    in a statist manner..."
 
    "Let us not be deterred from seeking a
    spontaneous voluntarist society by cynics who
    stand for stagnation.  Freedom is our
    evolutionary future."

Yet now I see Max stating in his 2/21/99 govt.html:

    "Extropians _generally favor_ market mechanisms...
    Extropians _generally prefer_ market approaches...    
    [but] we may differ among ourselves about
    the extent of the proper role of government.

And just what sorts of roles for government might this
new, improved extropianism support?

    "Some [extropians] may favor government subsidy of basic
    scientific research, or certain regulations [to
    maintain] a maximally open society, or the
    provision of services they think will be poorly
    provided without state intervention."

Oh, really now?

Exactly how long has this congenial attitude towards the State been a
part of the accepted definition of "extropian"?  In other words,
exactly at what point within the last 7 or 8 years did I unknowingly
cease to be an extropian?  I suppose I have to seek the company of
"Voluntarist Transhumanists" now that Max has seen fit to extend his
definition of "extropianism" to include sanction of the extortionist
practices of nation-state criminal gangs?

My fault for not paying attention, of course.  I've been ignoring the
Extropy Institute for some time now, basically ever since EXTROPY
ceased publication.  I didn't particularly dig the shallow fluffiness
creeping in towards the end.  I've been busy with other things going
on in my life, and haven't had time to closely follow the Extropians
mailing list or make frequent visits to infrequently updated websites.
I've been receiving and archiving the mailing list, and only glancing
into my archives on rare occasions.  Nonetheless, during all this
time, I've continued to consider myself "extropian".

I suppose my big mistake was failing to pay attention when EP 3.0 was
released.  I now go check it out and find that the principle of
valuing "Spontaneous Order" has spontaneously mutated itself into
"Open Society" and "Self-Direction".  Not quite the same thing.
"Yes, Citizen-unit", {thump baton into open palm}, "you can have all
the Open Society and criticism you want.  Just as long as you keep
directing yourself to make those tax payments on time."

I *was* under the impression that, with "extropianism", I had found
the company of like-minded voluntarist transhumanists.  But now Max
has apparently expanded the "tent" to include the potentially larger
set of non-voluntarist transhumanists.  And in doing so, he has
transformed the place where voluntarist transhumans stand under this
tent.  We once could roam the entire floor; now we are shunted off to
a small corner where we can be safely ignored:

    "_Some_ [extropians] would like to experiment with
    entirely novel [voluntarist] social orders..."

Wow.  Smooth.

I can see why Max might want to do this: voluntarism, even in it's
watered-down form as minarchist libertarianism, is unpopular with the
masses.  They appear to like slavery and socialism and being governed.
Or at least they don't mind it very much, and they tend to resent
anyone who questions their complacency.  And perhaps Max, acting in
his role as "spokesperson for Extropianism" would like to see big-E
Extropianism popularised among and adopted by these same masses,
incidentally leading to better chances for speaking gigs and book
deals and talking head TV appearances for himself.  Thus, the
abandonment or at least shoving-aside of inconvenient voluntarism.

I'm disgusted.

Very difficult situation. To deal with it we have to know what are their
thoughts and their feelings about death... I had a heart attack last year
and thought that i was going to die, but i  was prepared because i think
and i feel that when i will die nothing of me will be left except a
decaying body and  some memories in other people's minds... So, my position
is that you just can be there for whaetever they may need... there is
nothing else you can do. If they are religious, just tell them that the old
lady is finally going to meet god and she will be fine... If they are not,
like me, just hold her hand and hope that she does not suffer for too
long... That's the only thing i am afraid of - suffering.

Remember the British Telecom "SoulCatcher 2000" chip? Two summers
back, it went all the way around the media, and still crops up (now
usually promoted by some paranoid schizophrenic). The real story was
that BT had held a seminar about future technology, and in the end
speculated a bit about uploading and neurointerfaces. Some less than
brilliant reporter mis-reported it, and news organisation after news
organization copied each other.


I agree with those sceptical about the satelite story. It seems a bit
too much like a Hollywood movie to be true, but the memetic potential
is good - we have been conditioned by a lot of fiction to believe in
this sort of thing.

Can crackers get into a satelite? I think they can, even if it is hard
to judge how likely it is. Can they make sense of the guidance system?
That definitely requires good knowledge about space technology and the
ideosynchracies of the satelite in question - a much taller order. My
guess is that if the story is true, then it is an insider job.

I think maybe I'm missing the point of this whole strain... is it intending
to say we should loosen control on guns until gun deaths exceed automobile
deaths, or that we should regulate automobiles and bathroom tiles to prevent
deaths?

Guns and automobiles are inherently different in one sense:

Guns (at least handguns) were meant to harm people, while automobiles are
not. I think I see the point you're getting at here(that guns aren't as big
a problem as people think) and I don't necessarily disagree, but it seems
we're comparing two completely different classes of things (see how I
avoided a platitude there?) by comparing auto and gun deaths.

I agree. The situation is similar to that facing Mahatma Ghandi immediately
prior to British withdrawal and the granting of independence to India.

Ghandi did not want to accept Independence are argued against signing up to
Lord Mountbatten's Indian Independence Bill? Why, because having come 90% of
the distance he did not want to end up with a crippled prize (a divided
India, which as Ghandi predicted, has been in a constant state of near-war
with its Northern neighbor ever since separation).

We must hold strong to voluntarism as a primary underpinning of future man,
otherwise he will be a slave.

Harvey Newstrom <newstrom@newstaffinc.com> maybe answered:

|1.  ExI claimed in the welcome message that the list would be run as a
|living example of Anarchy and PPL (Privately Produced Law).  Everyone
|would be self-governed.  Anyone could start or join any PPL they wished.
|Disputes would be handled by negotiation between the PPLs.  In reality

|by the list owner.

Enlightened despotism, then.  Deimos ruled by Aristos.

|with full ExI approval.  When some unknown newcomers tried to declare
|themselves as PPLs, they were disallowed.  When the unknown newcomers
|asked for the reasons they were denied and for procedures for getting
|approved, it turned out that the procedures hadn't been invented yet.
|Worse, when ExI tried to define the procedures, it became clear that
|self-rule would only be allowed with ExI approval, and that PPLs could
|only exist under ExI control.  Although this is perfectly reasonable for
|the list owner to assert, it ruined the experiment of demonstrating
|anarchy and PPL without central control.

Interesting. I have seen the same problem pop up in other anarchy like groups.
The friendly anarchy theory breaks down in the face of harsh reality.

The PPL idea seemed such a nice idea when I read about it in those days.
Too bad it never became implemented.  Did ExI identify it as a resource hog?

One might divide the monolithic ExI list into a decentralized group of
smaller lists, each under its own PPL (much like replacing a monolithic
one world government with a number of small city states).  The ExI list
could in that scenario be used as a central hub where the supporters of
the different PPLs could discuss, communicate and iron out their bilateral
differences of opinion.

Naturally such an implementation would require some loss of control and
power for the ExI, which then might decide against it on those grounds.

Maybe one could experiment the PPL idea in a safe sand box environment?

Just a thought.  Comments?

|Since the developing rules for anarchy had the same appeal as
|Price-fixing the stock market to keep it stable, most people who wanted

|and just wanted a discussion list.  Finally, I think there was unanimous
|consent that ExI should just run the list as they saw fit, and that
|anyone who wanted self-rule could start their own list.

When one removes the opposition one easily gets unanimous consent.

Well guys, at the risk of being flamed , let me quote General Eisenhower about
a week after the Pearl Harbor attack:

"In military dictatorships the required unity of effort is always insured by
the authority resting in one man's hands.  Every individual must conform to
the dictator's orders, the alternative is the firing squad.  So, from the
beginning, the necessary mechanical coordination is automatic.

In democracy this result is achieved more slowly.  The overwhelming majority
of its citizens must first come to realize that a common danger threatens,
that collective and individual self-preservation demands the submission of
self-interest to the nation's welfare.  Because this realization and this
unification comes about so slowly, often only after disaster and loss of
battles have rudely awakened a population, democracy is frequently condemned
by unthinking critics as the least efficient form of government.   Such
criticism deals with the obvious factors only, it fails to throw into the
balance the moral fibre, the staying qualities of a population.  A democracy
resorts to war only when the vast majority of its people become covinced that
there is no other way out.  The crisis they have entered is of their own
choosing, and in the long, cruel ordeal of war this difference is likely to
become decisive.  The unification and coordination achieved this way is
lasting.  The people work together because they have a common belief in the
justice of their cause and a common readiness to sacrifice for attainment of
national success.  It was in appreciation of the great strength arising from
this truth that Woodrow Wilson said 'The highest form of efficiency is the
spontaneous cooperation of a free people.'

My understanding of Libertarianism allows the government to act in the
national defense.  As a "Newbie" it is important to me that Extropianism does
also.

I have served in the military of my country during an unpopular war (Viet
Nam).  Contrary to popular opinion, I and the overwhelming majority of my
comrades believed in the justice of that war.

Is it not the highest form of love to give your life to save your friend's
life?  Is it not then the same to give 58,000 of your dearest American lives
to save millions of Asian lives?  We did it in WW2.

Not to open a hornet's nest, but my comrades and I were certain that cowardice
was at the root of the protester's actions.

Your friend,

Adrian

I read yesterday on ZDNET (another fount of objective reporting ;) )
that the story is a hoax.  The british came out and said it never
happened and that hijacking a satelite is quite impossible.

Who to believe?  :)

My original question should have been, "Are stories such as satelites
being hijacked (as reported in 'main stream media') of interest to
Extropians, or are they kooky?

You can always tell the children about those little evil creatures living
in the dirt; they will sneak into your body, make you sick and even _kill_
you if you don't fight them off.

"Those creatures will try to steal our food. They don't like to the cold,
so put the milk into the fridge or they will make it sour."

Show them some dirt stuff in a microscope: you have educated them about
the world and seeing lots of small creatures crawling around makes quite
a lesson...  >YEACH!<

Kids are not stupid, just underinformed.

My guess:  PPLs require too much attention, for too small a group to
make it necessary, and too small a reward to make it worth it.

Yep, this isn't the first time that I've suggested some prodding, but
since Quarles still seems to underestimate his need for cryonics
(I can't imagine that such a public supporter of immortality would

The purposes of guns are three fold:
a) hunting
b) deterring the violation of the rights of one's self, family, property and
state
c) being there for use against opressors when deterrence fails

It is not possible to use cigarettes safely, for example. Automobiles are almost
never used purposely to kill people, yet they do so unpurposefully and
'accidentally' far more than guns do. It is a tool which is unsafe when in
normal use. It is a device which is designed to travel at over 100 mph, yet has
such a lack of safety features that it is frequently fatal to crash in one above
30 mph. Accidents at normal highway speeds are fatal more often than not. This
means that cars are unsafe in normal use.

A gun, on the other hand, has a myriad of safety features, such that the user
can carry one safely with very minimal risk of accidentally shooting someone.
Indeed the user must purposefully use a gun improperly in order to
'accidentally' shoot someone, which makes the event negligence, not accident.
Negligence is a crime of the user.

Moreover, it is conclusively proven that liberalizing gun laws actually prevents
more deaths than it causes (see Prof. John Lotts book _More Guns, Less Crime_)
which results in the net reduction in all violent crimes by 8% on average, with
an 80% reduction in multiple death crimes within 5 years of passage of
liberalized gun carry laws.

Putting more guns in the hands of law abiding citizens who can carry them freely
is equivalent to putting more police on the highways to reduce speeding and
drunk driving.

Moreover, if all jurisdictions in the US had gun laws like the large cities do,
there would be at least ten times as many gun deaths, because only criminals
would own guns.  Evidence of this? Look at South Africa and Taiwan. As has been
reported recently, those two countries have higher murder rates than the US,
even though their gun laws are far more restrictive (its a death penalty offense
in Taiwan).

Additionally, we need to look at the number of people killed by guns, what
demographic groups they belong to. There are far more criminals and far fewer
innocent civilians killed. Who should care that criminals are killed? Why should
they even be included? The stats also count suicides. Why should they be counted
here in the US? Most other countries do not count suicides in their gun death
crime rates.

Finally, according to the stats, if you disarmed 1,000,000 policemen and armed
1,000,000 law abiding civilians you would save five times as many lives.

I think it is a good idea to have a decay of the reputations. If I stop
posting, my reputation will drop off towards zero. 

reputation (t+1)= decay * reputation(t) + sum_i glorification_i(t) 
                   - sum_i kookify_i(t)

where glorification_i(t) and kookification_i(t) are the amount of
glorification/kookification user i gives at time t, and decay is the
speed the reputation decays.

By the way, I don't think kookify is necessarily the best rating
term. I would suggest glorify/denigrate or something else - being a
good poster isn't the exact opposite to being a kook. Having a
multidimensional reputation might be interesting, if more complex and
less likely to work. For example one dimension would be quality,
another relevance.

BTW, the true kooks will not be deterred by being kill-filed and
kookified, they will just get another email address and post again
(there are many examples on the net). Reputations are better as a
positive way of keeping the list quality - we often do things to keep
up our reputations.

Good luck.  I knew him several years ago, when we Houston cryonicists were
having regular meetings.  He would usually show up, but that was just
because he enjoys talking to people who don't plan on dying.  As near as I
can make out, his theory is that cryonics is such a long shot that he is
better off putting all his resources into promoting medical research.  He
isn't really all that rich, and at his age he'd probably have to pay cash
for his suspension arrangements.

Now, maybe when that Y2K deadline of his passes he'll be willing to
reconsider.

If you want a detailed look at the programming issues, I'd suggest Eliezer
Yudkowsky's essay on the topic at:
http://www.pobox.com/~sentience/AI_design.temp.html
His approach is a bit unconventional, but it looks promising.

Another approach would be to map out the general structure of the human
brain, and duplicate the features of its components using evolved neural
nets.  The Robokenko project (see http://www.genobyte.com ) is doing some
interesting work in this direction, although their goal is simply
animal-level intelligence.

We don't really know enough yet to predict what approach will work best.
However, I expect that we will see a lot of progress over the next few
years.  Computers are finally getting fast enough to support something more
complex than an insect brain, and some of AIs long-promised goals are
finally being reached.  Hopefully, support for more advanced work will grow
fast enough to let us take advantage of the new capabilities.

Sure.  Its the Cyc project, and they've got a pretty good web site:

http://www.cyc.com/

Their goal is to create a system that encodes all of the "common sense"
knowledge required to understand your average encyclopedia article.  They've
produced some interesting results, but they still haven't really achieved
their goal.

I was born in 1973, so had no chance of going to Southeast Asia. However,
I *still* think that it was a bad idea (not to mention wrong) for the US
Govt to send people over there to carry on a calculated program of just
too little force to acheive their stated goals.  Whether it would have been
correct to send people to *actually* acheive those goals is another
question, and I am not sure.

If we assume our mind is an information processor, and we further
assume that it is a Turing equivalent machine, even given excessive
use of pseudo-random number generators, any sequence of events could
be exactly duplicated given the same sensor and effector data starting
from the same initial state of the machine.  Free will is thus a
delusion that makes us all feel really warm and fuzzy.  Turing
equivalent machines can never have free will. 

Even if we concede to Penroses poorly argued quantum mind, I'm not so
sure that what we call free will would amount to anything more than
truly random number generators.  Thats not really anything to write
home about.  I think the whole concept of free will is meaningless. 
Our evolved minds seem to have a weakness for this meaningless concept.

That would be fun. Of course, the play isn't very large and more of a

Which consist of people. They are not independent borganisms, and if a
sufficient number of people (fewer if they are key people) of an
organization think something is a great idea, it will become
accepted. Things to look out for of course includes bureaucracy,
internal politcs and so on. I think it is dangerous to set up an us
vs. The Establishment thinking, there doesn't have to be any conflict.

In that cade Dr F would have been stupid. If you want to do a project
that might be controversial, then you do your best to secure the
support as widely as possible. Why didn't Dr F use the fact that he
was a member in good standing of the Transylvanian Medical
Association? Why didn't he show them the scientific value of his
research? Why didn't he start out with some trivial application of
obvious social and medical utility, and work upwards from that?

One problem I notice among transhumanists is that we tend to take some
extraordinary and radical possibilities for granted and undividedly
good. Most people are suspicious of characters who tell them that the
future is going to be based on microscopic machines that can build
anything, make you immortal and make diamond cheaper than wood. But if
you step by step show why this is possible and even likely, you can
lead them to the conclusion that this is indeed true. Discuss optimism
and the value of life with people, and they can be led to realize that
life extension is a great thing. Start by telling them immortality is
around the corner and they will think you are an immoral nut.

So people around you don't think legal heroin would be a problem? I
somehow doubt that, unless you live in a libertarian enclave. The
thing is, the government has fairly little to do with what people in
general think, and that is what truly matters if we want a widespread
support for transhumanism. What we need to influence is the reactions
people have to transghumanist technologies, both on the "public" level
and among the movers and shakers. If we get just one, it will not work
well.

Sure. But the thing is, people accept these supplements. That is a
base we can work on.

Your own kookiness level will be directly proportional to how much you conform to
the norm. I am rather disturbed at this idea of using a system of peer pressure to
shout down and ignore the voices which state "truths that we all know but don't
want to talk about or admit to". This is using conventional wisdom to wipe out the
unconventional wisdom. Conventional wisdom is rarely correct.

What this will do as extropy becomes more widely known is to dilute the extropian
message (as we are already seeing) to more vanilla, pleasing to the eyes of the
masses, flavors. The radical founders will be relegated to the margin, since their
ideas will then be seen as kooks by the more conservative masses, and extropy will
dissolve to meaninglessness.

I for one don't want my messages kookified by the
socialist/statist/anti-liberty/anti-individuality types who are on the list. All it
will take is one or two determined people who want to turn off the extropian
message is to subscribe to the list multiple times and kookify any posting they
disagree with.

Randy Barnett has written extensively on the benefits of requiring that

Believing in the healing powers of crystals is not a value, it's a 
mistaken factual opinion. The New Ager, provided he has the same data 
as we do, will be rational to give up his New Agey beliefs.

Not exactly. They can change in a non-rational way (i.e. not as a 
result of a well-informed deliberate choice) or in a rational way 
(for example in the mind-scan scenario).

It's hard to give a precise definition of fundamental value, just as 
it is hard to give a precise definition of what it means to believe 
in a proposition. But let me try to explain by giving a simplified 
example. Suppose RatioBot is a robot that moves aroung in a finite
two-dimensional universe (a computer screen). RatioBot contains two 
components: (1) a long list, where each line contains a description 
of a possible state of the universe together with a real number (that 
state's "value");  (2) a module that simulates all possible sequences 
of actions the RatioBot can make, 10 moves ahead. The simulated state 
of the world is compared to the list, and RatioBot then performs the 
sequence of actions leading to the state with the highest achievable 
value.

Imagine RatioBotII, which is slightly smarter than RatioBot. In order 
to use work more efficiently, RatioBotII has a third 
module, that tries to plan ahead. It looks at possibilities more than 
10 moves ahead, and figures out suitable subgoals, that module (2) 
then tries to approximate. The goals that module (3) gives to module 
(2) are intermediary goals, and they represent one type of 
non-fundamental values (emotions would be another type). On the other 
hand, the values expressed by the list (1) could be said to be 
fundamental.

> Another question:  What are *your* "fundamental values" and at what age
> did you discover them?

I don't know (in the reflective, abstract sense) exactly what my 
fundamental values are; the human mind is, as we know, far from 
transparent to itself. To the extent that I do know them, I have 
discovered them gradually. My values may also have changed somewhat 
on some occasions, mostly in a non-rational (not "irrational") way.

I think I know approximately what my fundamental values are: I want 
everybody to have the chance to prosper, to be healty and happy, to 
develop and mature, and to live as long as they want in a physically 
youthful and vigorous state, free to experience states of 
consciousness deeper, clearer and more sublime and blissful than 
anything heard of before; to transform themselves into new kinds of 
entities and to explore new real and artificial realities, equipt 
with intellects incommensurably more encompassing than any human 
brain, and with much richer emotional sensibilities. I want very much 
that everybody or as many as possible get a chance to do this. 
However, if I absolutely had to make a choice I would rather give 
this to my friends and those I love (and myself of course) than to 
people I haven't met, and I would (other things equal) prefer to give 
it to people now existing than only to potential future people.

With human-level AIs, unless they have a very clear and unambigous 
value-structure, it could perhaps happen. That's why we need to be on 
our guard against unexpected consequences.

This was posted earlier in a different list (memetics) as *humour*.  I fixed
the 97 spelling errors in the original, though it was sufficiently well
received to provide the confidence to take the piece a bit further. So here
I'm presenting it as both "HUMOUR: Memetics out of Control"  and "ECON: Are
we ready for hyper-economy?".  I'm a new poster, hence the introductory
stuff.

It could also been seen as a "what if?" scenario to force some consideration
of what one would if (or when) an entity, the rapildy figures out how to go
hyper-economic.  It is not difficult for me to imagine a new future where
bored billionnaires actually buy a space ship and head off the Mars to lay
claim to it.  Who will be the neo-Luddites then?  It is not hard to imagine
the flood of posts to this list, calling on the Them and They to fix the
problem.

The scenerio below is, of course, entirely fictional, so anal retentive
dissections of each sentence are a waste of words.   FWIW I invent & develop
software products to scratch out a living. I don't work for Microsoft or own
any Microsoft stock, though like any sane software/knowledge age
entrepreneur, I'd gladly take their stock in return for giving them my
products.

-------------------------------------

How would we cope with some entity going hyper-economic? <in the next few
years>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------
Bill Gates, realising the US Government is going to win it's anti-trust case
against his first cot, Microsoft, has retreated into the depths of the
Microsoft Kingdom, to reveal his Ultimate Master Plot directly to tribal
chieftains, the bizarre <mental> mating of people otherwise known as product
and program managers.  A plot planned very carefully from the very beginning
... to throw his "Toys Out of the Cot" and become the world's first
TRILLIONNAIRE!  Finally convinced by one of his original technical advisors,
Richard Brodie, now best-selling author of "Virus of the Mind", that
*self*-replication is the key to survival and MLM is the business model of
the future,  the Real Mother of all Battles for Total World Domination is
about to begin.

At the stroke before noon, April 1st 1999, Microsoft Corporation fully
intends to have the last laugh of the century. Literally. At the press of an
email Send button, Microsoft will instantly and electronically fragment into
hundreds of product oriented companies, and immediately publicly list *all*
of them simultaneously on *all* electronic stock exchanges.  Day traders
will be given *free* (local call rates do apply) "Microsoft Trader" software
to assist them in drumming up the price with automatic trades.  Wizards are
available to those new to the process.  Free $1000 trade-fee discount
coupons will also be provided, the first 100 trades being totally *free*
(though ad supported).

Co-branding opportunities with Schwab and e*trade will of course be
exploited ensuring that other suckers foot the cash outlay bill.  To prevent
the Internet from grinding to a halt at the moment of climax, traders eager
to make a killing real quick can order time activated CD-ROM's that will
give them a time advantage over later purchasers.  Downloaders won't stand a
chance.  The CD-ROM is immediately available from every chain store in
existence for only $9.95.  Wal-Mart, who paid the most, are selling special
edition copies with a full 3 second advantage over competing retailers.  A
3-for-1 stock split is expected to be announced for most entities by
mid-afternoon.

Companies will trade as, for example,  Microsoft SQL Server Inc.,
Windows3.1 Inc., Windows95 Inc., Windows95a Inc.  The FUD office bundles,
having effectively beaten the daylights out of everyone already, will be
*unbundled*,  there will be no Microsoft Office, only Microsoft Word Inc.
Microsoft Interactive Barney Inc. is expected to be a huge hit amongst the
younger day traders as is the company that sells that weird kid's mouse
thing.  Empower the consumer!  We all know what the Jesuits says about kids
up to the age of 7.  The $12b (or so .. give a take a few billion) cash
stash currently in the bank will be divided fairly amongst the few hundred
clones to spend on "stuff".  In the interest of personal health and safety,
a limit has been set on the number of Jolt that can be purchased per day.
All spun-off companies will receive copies of all source-code. Specially
developed automated negotiation systems have been developed to ensure smooth
trading transactions between the hundred companies.  Access to the
code-sharing service is being offered to the Open/Free Source community for
only $1,000 subscription per annum, or $10,000 if you want it all on CD-ROM.
Documentation and support is a little extra.  SQ., please ask your "server"
for assistance.

At least for the foreseeable future, all teams will remain in their current
geographic domains, Bill Gates, the generous philanthropist that he is, has
purchased the Redmond campus for an undisclosed cash amount and donated it,
appropriately,  to the Gates Learning Foundation.  Companies have reportedly
already signed lease and maintenance agreements to minimise the potential
disruption.

In an effort to keep those consumers most carpetbagged by the proceedings of
April 1st happy, and grinning from ear-to-ear with all sorts of free stuff,
Windows2000 beta SP-2a Inc. will  publicly list on the 2nd of April.  The
first 10m downloaders of the 163Mb install package will receive a free share
in the company, and a special discount on a hamper of Microsoft goodies,
otherwise available only through the official Microsoft store in Redmond.
"Microsoft Trader" is expected to be bundled with the product, all company
clones reserving the right to bundle whatever innovations they want and can
get their hands on for a fair price, usually nothing in this marketplace.

What happens to Bill Gates? Well whip out your copy of Microsoft Excel and
work it out. 100x3x$80B isn't too shabby for a days work these days. His is,
after all, the "best job in the world".  A special web site,
HowRichCanBillGetonApril1st.com has been prepared to enable novice
"knowledge age" punters place bets on various guesst submissions.  It is
reported, that having finally completed his work at http://www.microsoft.com
(has anyone checked to see if they're all still all in Redmond or whether
they've perhaps leased an otherwise mothballed US Carrier Group and taken a
very slow boat to China?) Bill Gates intends to pursue various personal
hobbies. One new found passion is mass producing space satellites, picked up
from buddy and co-founder of Teledesic, Craig McCaw.  A 4,000 satellite
launch to secure mining rights on asteroids is not out of the question when
you have $1T to spend.  The slogan for the vision is "A Portal into every
Asteroid".

Great software is all in the mind.

I sometimes act like an all powerful but ignorant god towards my
simulations. I have a game of life running right now, and I can reach
in and do whatever I want to: change the state of cells, introduce new
patterns, change the rules or even end the whole simulation. The same
goes for my alife simulations. But while I can control them in detail,
I don't understand what is going on in them. Some of it is due to lack
of interest, some of it is simply because the complexity of what is
going on. Exactly why does the methuselah configuration survive for so
long? Beats me, I can simulate it, explain every step, but the overall
meaning escapes me at the present.

I think this is an area where we have an advantage compared to
traditional theologicans. They are not used to thinking in terms of
computers, levels of implementation, cosmology and (especially)
questioning many of the very fundamental assumptions of godhood most
people seem to take granted. Maybe extropian theology has a future
even if most extropians remain die hard atheists, as the radical study
of theology from a scientific angle.

I wonder about that vehemence, why does it occur? Is it just a natural
reaction towards the fairly religious US society by rebellious
thinkers, or are there other reasons. I see no reason to become
emotional about the non-existence of things, or even the presence of
institutions that might be harmful. I think it is better to remain
calm and think about them, how awful or wonderful they might be.

I think the most likely commonality of most protesters was just
an emotional, non-rational desire for non-conformity; the same
kind of kids who today are piercing and painting everything and
keeping Anne Rice in business.  I'm sure there were some who were
motivated by cowardice, and I know at least one counterexample
to both: my mother, one of the most courageous people I have ever
known, who not only protested the war but did so while living on
an Air Force base while my father was off fighting it.  I think
she even made Nixon's enemies list.

Even at the time, without hindsight, some arguments against the
war were quite rational.  Particularly the argument that if it
were indeed a just war, why the limits?  Why the secrecy?  Why
the deception of the public?  Any time the government does
something covertly, it should be questioned vigorously.  I was
too young to fight, but I knew many people on both sides who
were motivated by honest beliefs, and many on both sides who
were motivated by cowardice or ignorance.  I don't think
either was the "root" of their cause. 

(For the sake of evaluating my historical point of view and that
of others who may enter this thread, I was born in 1963.)

Interesting. I seem to lack that instinct, and have a hard time
understanding it. Of course, I like being awed, but most of the time I
set up things so that I'm the one responsible for the awe (like
learning math to understand a great concept like the de Rahm
Cohomology, my archetypal example of mathematical profoundity).

Somehow I think it is not a specific religion gene, but some other
personality or cognitive traits that provides a receptor for the meme.

:-) It might be harder to change sexual orientation, since it likely
is partially hardwired in non-plastic parts of the brain like the
hypothalamus. But we'll find out in time. The interesting question is
how many who would change their "core values" if they got the chance.

Religious ecstasy can definitely be understood, even if studying it
might be tricky. However, religions isn't just about making people
feel wonderful, they have other properties too. And feeling wonderful
also has many components (pure pleasure, meaningfulness, happiness,
community etc.) that we might want to separate out. Many of these can
be reached without changing brain chemistry from the outside.

Exactly. This is the kind of entity I would find worshippable (given

Is perfection an ideal? I think Buddha is deeply admirable, but he
also made mistakes in my opinion (like explaining his realizations in
a way that people were bound to turn into a religion rather a
non-religion). I can still venerate him as an ideal for
self-understanding. Some exemplars might actually be better exemplars
by not being perfect.

I see what you mean, and I think this is a partial reason. 

I'm right now reading the Chinese epic "The Journey to the West", and
enjoying the character of Sun Wukong the monkey king immensely. I
regard good Sun as a kind of transhumanist divinity. He starts out
merely as a rather unique monkey, but gathers skills and knowledge so
that he can become immortal. Then he uses his new knowledge to help
his people, tricks the Dragon of the Eastern sea into giving him an
immense magical weapon, descends into the underworld and erases his
and all the other monkies' names from the Book of Death. As Heaven
tries to intervene he causes trouble up there, becomes super-immortal
by eating the Peaches of Immortality *and* the Pills of Immortality,
is briefly (500 years) trapped by the Buddha under a mountain and for
the rest of the epic acts as a traveling companion and enlightened
advisor for the buddist monk Tripitaka, becoming a saint in the
process. Talk about a career! Sun manages to become a Taoist immortal
and a Buddhist saint *and* have a great time too (OK, those 500 years
under the mountain might have been boring).

What appeals to me about this story is that he is a self-made monkey
(quite literally, as he was born from the self-organization of the
elements) who builds his power to an extreme extent - in order to use
it for fun and to help people. What is the best way of increasing
one's power? To learn, to become wise. It is really a bootstrapping
process.

But, as I said above, another exemplar might not need tremendous power
and might even be hampered by it. Ghandi might be an interesting
example - his power came from being clearly *not* powerful.

Good points. I have a short story about this somewhere that I might post. 

Overall, the problem may lie in that predicting the development of
one's inferiors is still beyond one's power. It might be hard for
Powers to decide what to do, and in the end non-intervention might be
the only safe choice.

[Sorry for the late response to this and other threads. 
 I was overwhelmed by the job market & allowed inboxes 
 to pile up.  Hope to catch up soon. RH]

James Annis' article, "An Astrophysical Explanation for the 
`Great Silence'" JBIS 52:19-22 1999, is thoughtful and interesting. 
Gamma ray bursts do seem a plausible component of the total 
"great filter" that stands between dead matter and expanding 
lasting life.  Some critiques, however:

1) It's a relatively weak effect.  We're talking a typical 
impact across a galaxy of "over a few seconds, and all in 
300 Kev Gamma-rays, the equivalent of 1/10 the solar flux."  
This won't directly hurt life under the sea or under rocks, 
or on the other side of a planet.  Nor would it kill advanced 
space traveling civilizations.  Speculations about "disruption 
of the ozone layer" are as specific as Annis gets about how 
this flux kills all land life.

2) This model requires that evolution on land (under an 
atmosphere nearly as weak as ours) be required for evolving
advanced civilizations, and that the time for land creatures
to evolve to civilization be independent of how evolved
sea creatures are.

3) Annis gives us no calculations to help estimate how big 
a part of the great filter this could be.  He assumes the 
burst rate has been falling exponentially with time, with a 
decay constant of 2.5 billion years and with the current rate 
averaging one every 220 million years per galaxy.  And then 
he is content to just note that land evolution is about 270 
million years old on Earth.  

But clearly if life appeared quickly in most every system, 
and if civilizations expanded at .1c, then most of the 
universe would now be colonized if gamma ray bursts were the 
only problem.  (A simulation could be constructed if anyone
doubts this.)  Thus this can't be the whole filter.  So how
much of the filter can it be?

Btw, I actually found Annis' *other* paper in the same issue
to be more interesting.  That is:

-------------------------------------------------------------
"Placing a Limit on Star-Fed Kardashev Type III Civilizations"
         James Annis JBIS 52:33-36, 1999.

A civilization that uses the bulk of a galaxy's starlight for 
its own power requirements is a remarkably obvious entity.
This is because galaxies naturally obey scaling laws between 
the surface brightness, the radius of the stellar distribution
and the thermal velocities of the stars.  The latter two 
quantities reflect the mass and its resulting gravitational
potential, while the formal is the result of this same mass 
emitting light as stars.  If civilization takes that light 
for its own purposes, the scaling laws are broken and the 
galaxy becomes an outlier on plots showing the scaling laws.
For a sample of 137 galaxies, no such outliers are found.

I have no idea what "META:" is supposed to stand for in the context of this
list, but I assume it's for making suggestions on improving infra-structure,
and thus our ability to *learn* from what people post.

Too many solutions proposed in this list require a "they" or "someone"
factor. For example, "someone should write a program for my nifty ingenious
idea I just thought of".  So the idea is posted, and quickly attacked by the
hordes of commentators just itchy to get their memetic comms fix.  There are
some excellent comments and commentators.  I sort my daily posting reading
by Author first, then select the most interesting subject line and read
that.  If it looks appealing I then sort by subject and attempt to wade
upwards looking for interesting bits.  And the amount of garbage that has to
be waded through to find the *good* stuff (because it is out there) becomes
intolerable.

In terms of design, the tools currently available for knowledge gathering
(as opposed to status/money/sex hunting) have truly outlived their
usefulness.  BUT it takes a lot of money and effort to develop a new tool
product from scratch, and economic forces can crush attempters at any time.
The trick is to use solutions that can be found by deploying basic common
sense usage of existing tools.  If nothing else it will show the SUPPLIERS
(the current software vendors) that there is a DEMAND  for changes to their
tools.  So what was a wire-and-nails solution then becomes a commercial
product or service so that it can be easily replicated to all similar
knowledge distribution systems.

As writers are satisfying an urge to be heard and should be given every
opportunity to say what it is they have to say, I suggest a kind of "mirror"
list to the main list, where each compuslive writer submits ONE posting per
day, in *addition* to the normal load in the regular list.  Those with the
patience to wait a day before manically attacking their keyboards, thereby
be able to choose and give thought to the best discussion topic get to do it
in style and with professionalism. And then spend an hour, instead of dozens
of 5 minute "CyberRoadRage" bursts to write thoughtfully about the topic.

That way we get the best of both worlds. It's all about supply and demand. I
am a READER pleading with the WRITERS to improve the quality of your work,
so that I may better learn from your insights.  In terms of basic
supply-and-demand, that was just a clear signal demanding some supply.  That
"up-a-level" list may in turn begin to flood, at which point the system can
naturally migrate to a higher level, where edited manuscripts in Rocket
eBook format are required and can be purchased for say 50c each.  In a book
form, a writer would need to have the publishing industry sell the piece for
$48 to get 50c.  If you're any good, you get read, and sold. Simple.

This list, is after all a CONTENT PROVIDER in the true sense of the word. It
commands more of my time than any other single content provider, with the
exception of perhaps Wired News, where I read everything because it's well
presented and well written and well chosen content. Same can be said for The
Economist which I read for it's quality of writing and selection of topics.
Recognise the economic implications of that and it becomes extremely easy to
see that the "only way out is up".  One creates demand by providing quality.

I had previously seen the data Annis cites, and it did convince me 
that we have seen a gradual rise in body size among all life, and 
in and in brain size corrected for body size for land animals. 
If one reasonably assumes that intelligence required a certain 
minimum brain size, then intelligence did arise remarkably quickly
after brains were big enough.  I conclude that the intelligence is 
probably not a hard step.

Gould himself, actually, points out the steady rise in body size.
He takes pains to attribute this to the boundary condition of a 
minimum feasible size and a initially small size, rather than to
fitness advantages.  That issues, however, is irrelevant for 
the purposes above.

Brain size per body size does seem a fitness driven change.

Thanks for the plug.   This paper is now revise & resubmit at Icarus:

                  Burning The Cosmic Commons: 
     Evolutionary Strategies For Interstellar Colonization
                       by Robin Hanson
        http://hanson.berkeley.edu/filluniv.pdf or .ps

Attempts to model interstellar colonization may seem hopelessly 
compromised by uncertainties regarding the technologies and 
preferences of advanced civilizations.  If light speed limits 
travel speeds, however, then a selection effect may eventually 
determine frontier behavior.  Making weak assumptions about 
colonization technology, we use this selection effect to predict 
colonists' behavior, including which oases they colonize, how long 
they stay there, how many seeds they then launch, how fast and far 
those seeds fly, and how behavior changes with increasing 
congestion.  This colonization model explains several astrophysical 
puzzles, predicting lone oases like ours, amid large quiet regions 
with vast unused resources.

I think Hal (as always) presented a nice summary of my argument.
It's not so much that stuff behind the frontier is "used up" as
it is that its just not useful toward jumping ahead of the expanding
frontier.  Agents tempted to hang behind for a bit to use stuff
get selected out of the frontier of the wave.

The model predicts that what gets used up are resources that support
fast growth of a seed into a site capable of launching more seeds.  
If seeds could grow faster in comets than in asteriods, for example,
then we might see systems with lots of asteriods but few comets left.  
Or maybe there was something even better than comets that we 
don't see because a wave came through here already.

Yes, and then maybe a third and forth wave as well.

How about this perspective: a section effect makes it easier 
to overestimate how fast our colonization wave will spread.  
The waves that passed this way before make the universe appear 
to conspire to make fast growth hard.  Yes, eventually it all 
gets filled in with life that hangs around for a long time, but 
this process may take longer than a naive analysis would suggest.

Thought it might be helpful in our discussion of the Alternatives to
imprisonment if I listed some of the goals that I could think of as having
been advanced as important in penalties for crime.

Goals of Punishment
- Justice/Fairness
- Reparation
- Revenge
- Rehabilitation/Redemption
- Inducing Regret
- Preventing Future crime by Offender
- Deterrent to Others

If anyone can think of others, please let me know.

   I agree that we must be careful if we offer opportunities to offenders in
order to reform them that you provide alternate equivelent opportunities to
those who have kept the law.  I do not want to reward criminal action.

Danny,

   I tend to agree that for non-violent offenses we should try more creative,
constructive, and less costly penalties.  Do you have any specific suggestions
for non-violent offenders?  I'm not as certain how you would handle violent
offenders.  Building computers helps?  Perhaps you could provide some more
details on that.  I have heard of a voluntary program out in one of the
California prisons where they take violent offenders and train them to work as
underwater divers for oil drilling platforms.  They've been somewhat
successful in placing these guys in work positions after release.  The jobs
are well-paying, adrenaline pumping (for those who would miss that rush), and
tend to take the participants far from their old environs, where they got into
trouble to begin with.  I think programs like that might be worth trying on a
larger scale.  Hey, maybe someday we could train inmates who volunteer for
future careers as asteroid miners.

    I believe someone, (sorry, I forget who at the moment) suggested that it
might be a bad idea to use the term God or gods when discussing posthumans.
It made me think about the fact that there is a lot of associational baggage
that goes along with these terms, and not all of it is the same for all of us.
So I thought maybe I would list all of the roles I could think of that have
been assigned to the God(s) meme in the past.  It might be better if we
discuss beings which held these roles in terms of the roles as opposed to
labelling them all "God(s)".

Roles:
- Creator
- Teacher
- Savior
- Judge/Referee
- Punisher
- Destroyer
- Benefactor
- Ideal
- Forgiver/Redeemer
- Personification
- Master/Ruler
- Companion
- Guardian/Defender
- Supreme Power
- The Eternal

If anyone has some more to add, please throw them in.

Tim,

   I have considered forms of Coventry before, but not with so much
technological infrastructure.  I am worried about the annonymous part of your
suggestion.  There is a reason people have the right to face their accusers.
How could you be sure you weren't receiving different versions of the same
rumor (which might not even be true), and how do you guard against some
talented hacker doing a hatchet job on an innocent person's reputation?  Also,
is there any time that a person's privacy is restored to them?  People are not
always the most forgiving, and what if someone has truly reformed, how are
they to overcome prejudice based on past status...Maybe if there were some
sort of certification process which could add to your datastream any positive
information about this person.  I think these factors might weigh differently
depending on what the offender has done wrong in the past.  Oh, and who's
paying for all this?  Criminal fines, perhaps?

Interesting point about the shift in the Extropian Principles.

Does anyone have a copy of the original version of the Extropian Principles

Academics are in general terrible at the history of
academia, and Krugman is no exception.  Academics
are expected to have opinions on the history of their
field, but most have neither the time nor inclination
to do thorough research on the subject.  

I agreed almost entirely with Krugman's assessment
of Bionomics, and have great respect for his academic
work.  I have also like most of his stuff for public 
consumption - he is refreshingly non-ideological
and clear headed.

Searching for "Liebowitz Margolis network effects" at AltaVista gets me this 
10/98 CATO policy analysis: http://wwwpub.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/cato.html

Their only mention of Krugman is: "The most commonly cited example in the 
network-externality, path-dependence literature is the prosaic typewriter 
keyboard.  The importance of this example can be gleaned from Paul Krugman's 
1994 book `Peddling Prosperity.' In that book Krugman speaks glowingly of 
this entire literature in a chapter entitled "The Economics of QWERTY." He 
does, however, appear to have altered his views when made aware of the facts 
presented below."

These authors don't complain about the phrase "network externality", and I 
see no reason to complain either.  Krugman did pioneer their use in a 
particular context, and he did admit that he'd been tricked by the QWERTY 
story.

Anders, do you really see no reason to have a vehement opposition to
institutions that may be harmful?

Do you really think the best thing to do when confronted with a institution
that is harmful is to think calmly about how wonderful it might be?

I doubt that this is in fact true. If you saw individuals from an
organization (lets pick a nice patsy like the KKK) moving into your town or
your front yard with the avowed purpose of beating the crap out of people
for no good reason, would you speak up or act up? Or would you really sit
calmly and think how wonderful they might be?

My own feeling is that this strategy is simply appeasement: a strategy to
diffuse opposition which has been shown to work rather poorly: Prime
Minister Chamberlain's appeasement of Nazi Germany being the canonical
example.

cheers,
tim

I think this would be a rather wonderful thing and it could be stored as a

Three popular alternatives to imprisonment are:
* community service
* home detention (see http://homedetention.com for example)
* fines/restitution

I think chemical castration is somewhat less popular, and
only applies to sex offenders.  A novel punishment for
chronic abusers of the opposite sex:  a sex change
operation.

Popular in some parts:
* caning or other non-permanent physical punishment
* permanent physical punishment (e.g., chop of a hand)
* tattoo 'POOR IMPULSE CONTROL' and the like on offenders'
  foreheads :)

Swift execution is also popular in some parts.  The death
penalty as used in some U.S. states involves much more
imprisonment than death.

The most straightforward and effective reform would of course
be to legalize drugs.  People who buy, produce, sell, or use
drugs shouldn't be penalized at all, let alone imprisoned.

If we accept that some people must be imprisoned...
* To get the 'invisible hand' working on the problem, make payments
  to private prison operators partially contingent on recidivism
  rates for prisoners released from the facility in question.
* We may want to look closely at claims that some make about
  meditation decreasing violence in prisons and improving
  rehabilitation.  See for example http://www.dhamma.org/prisons.htm
  and http://www.natural-law.org/98_platform/98_platform_crime.html.
* Make prison more of a 'punishment' -- remove all televisions
  and radios and feed them a vegan diet (these would make
  prison more palatable for me, but probably not for most
  actual prisoners).

One possible solution now seems to be planet orbit evolution.  We're finding
Jupiter sized planets, but they're all in funny orbits - very near the sun or
elliptical.  Current theory holds that big planets can only form far from the
sun.  Hence all these Jovians had to wander through the habitable zones on the
way to their current orbit, gravitationally slingshotting any potential life-
bearing planets into oblivion.  
(This info is from a friend's FW of a NYT online article)

The solar system is fairly precisely set up to avoid this kind of thing.
Perhaps
this resulted not from stabilizing interactions during planet formation but
from
incredible blind luck.

Robin's "Great Filter" conception seems not to have reached broad public
recognition.  The researchers were still viewing rarer life as a bad thing and
seem not to have considered the possibility that rarer intelligent life =
longer
plausible survival for intelligent life.

I agree that the limits placed on US military action caused much unecessary

I think it was criminal on the part of our leaders.

There are certain central and less-than-central topics that are repeatedly

and put it on the web, linked in to the list registration page. The
intention would not be to discourage discussion of these topics on the list
but to let people know that these topics should be approached thoughtfully
and probably with essay-length submissions.

If any of the long-time readers think that this would be useful, I'm sure
you could rattle off a list of such topics better than I.

I spoke with a number of my coworkers and found several who

the report was to break out laughing.  Not one of us grokked that

done some amazing capers.  Just not this one.  It would be far

The primary purpose is that it separates the individual who has demonstrated a
disregard for others rights from the society which respects those rights. We can
no longer deport these people to prison colonies, and they cannot flee to the
fronteirs or be forced into the army to serve on the fronteir, so they get put
into 'storage'.

Piers Anthony's _Ring_ novel is a good depiction of an alternative to
imprisonment. Convicts get a ring installed on their fingers that is embedded to
the bone. It monitors the convicts thoughts, giving varying levels of pain for
various thoughts and immobilizing pain when 'illegal' actions are taken. The
conundrum in the novel is that the rings are programmed by someone with a very
puritanical and severe idea of right and wrong, so there tends to be a very
severe period of adjustment that a convict goes through, and sometimes does not
survive.

I apologise to those who find this query shockingly off topic.  If anyone
cluey cares to send me an off-list response, I'd be grateful - everyone
else should delete right now.

Every now and then, as Eudora Pro on my old Windows 3.x downloads it gets
into a strange mood and pastes in a little green garbage bin on feet, or
something like that, in every single In Mail message notification, in a
column headed V to the left of the Subject column.  This does nothing
obvious except hold up the download, sometimes locking it up.  Any clues?
(I can't find a hint in Eudora's Help file, under V for example, but maybe
I need the right head-word as a clue.  I tried their on-line FAQ and Search
facility, but everything just stares back at me with dumb resentment.)

Hackers?  Guessing passwords, writing fake log-in screens in
order to capture other people's passwords, then putting little
surprises in their computer accounts, etc.  Im old enough to
have been around when computer science was first being offered
in my college.  My roommate was the system manager (HP3000
then a DEC 11-780).  We would be classified as hackers
back then, mostly oriented towards pulling gags.  For example:

Students back in ~1979, 1980 were not accustomed to the
notion of using a computer.  Most did not even know how to log
on.  We rigged a computer terminal as a peekaboo: we could
see whatever they typed, then type back etc.  We had a glass
wall office where we could watch people come in.  One evening
late, I and two others were in the office when we saw someone
come in, a nursing student.  The whole school had 8 terminals then.
All were empty.  She looooooked this way and that, then sat at
the peekaboo terminal, which was the only one turned on.  Got one!
She sat there for quite a while, before typing:  Hi.  We typed
back Hi.  We were laughing by this time.  Then she typed:
Play me some games.  We were cracking up.  We wrote:
OK.  What would you like to play?
She bolted from the room!  Never saw her again!  To this day
I can scarcely tell that story without laughing out loud.  I visited
my former college roommate last summer and we laughed ourselves
silly remembering that event.  We were hackers.  {8^D  spike

The proviso I would add is that the restitution has to be full and complete.
Typically what happens now is someone burns your car, they get caught, the
restitutive judge says "oh, you have to make restitution" and that is that.
They do not take into account enforcing this and setting a time limit.

Plus, what do you do with the typical criminal who even if you enslaved him
for a year would not be worth the damage he did?

UCLA, traces the course of this change by interweaving the
fascinating history of postwar cybernetics and robotics with
a deft reading of science fiction novels that brings to life
the dreams and nightmares those high-tech fields inspire. 
Her sophisticated narrative makes a masterful--and highly 
readable--contribution to the philosophy of identity in the 
shadow of the digital.

I invoke the banner of Crockerism to communicate, and humbly beg your
tolerance:  I think you may be conforming the facts to the theory.

On the whole, New Agers are not people who form mistaken factual
opinions about the healing powers of crystals.  You are, shall I say,
extropomorphizing?  These people do not believe their tenets as the
simplest explanation for incorrectly reported facts; they believe
because Crystals are the Manifestation of the New Age of Warmth and Love
and Kindness which shall Overcome the Cold Logic of Male-Dominated
Science.  (That this is a shockingly sexist insult to women everywhere
never seems to occur to them.)

??  There are a few kinds of cognitive objects in the mind associated
with "belief", including the form of the proposition itself, the
qualitative degree of truth assigned to that proposition, and a few
assorted emotions that affect whether we believe in something or are
invoked as a consequence of believing in something - emotional
commitment is an example; when we make an emotional commitment to an
idea, we think it is certain, are reluctant to entertain propositions we
think will contradict the idea, and believe that believing in the idea
is right.

The human mind doesn't work that way.  There are innate *desires*, such
as emotions, which are quite distinct from the current set of
*purposes*.  Desires don't change, but can be easily overridden by
purposes.  And purposes, as mental objects, are propositions like any
other proposition, that have a degree of truth like any other
proposition, and can change if found to be untrue.  If I have the
thought "my purpose ought to be X", my purposes change as a consequence.

Purposes can rationally change whenever the justification for that
purpose fails.  Most people get an initial set of purposes taught like
any set of facts in childhood; purposes are harder to change, because
they usually teach that believing in the purpose is right, and invoke
emotions like emotional commitments.  But if you start shooting down
other facts that were taught along with the purpose, and the purpose's
surrounding memes, you can eventually move on to the justification and
the purpose itself.

That's how it is for humans.  I'm not saying that is how it *ought* to
be, or how an AI *must* be; those are separate propositions.  But as a
description of the way humans operate, I think it is more accurate than
either RatioBot or HappyApplet.

Do you think that these fundamental values are *true*?  That they are
better than certain other sets of fundamental values?  That the
proposition "these values are achievable and non-self-contradictory" is true?

If a Power poofed into existence and told you that all Powers had the
same set of values, and that it was exactly identical to your stated set
EXCEPT that "blissful" (as opposed to "happy") wasn't on the list; would
you change your fundamental goals, or would you stick your fingers in
your ears and hum as loud as you could because changing your beliefs
would interfere with the "blissful" goal?

With seed, human, and tranhuman AIs, it will happen no matter what we do
to prevent it.  I don't think that our theories are yet representative
of reality, only unreal abstractions from reality, just as there are no
"protons", only quarks.  Second only to "Do what is right", as a
fundamental value, is "We don't know what the hell is going on."  Any
facts and any goals and any reasoning methods we program in will be
WRONG and will eventually be replaced.  We have to face that.

Oh, well.  I thought, for a brief, pleasant moment, that GRBs might be
good enough to explain the Great Filter Paradox, if they were energetic
enough to wipe out all life in a galaxy

One speculation was that galaxies were wiped clean every so often by
Singularities escaping our Universe through macrocosmic energy events. 
This would explain why there weren't any mortals left behind by an
escaped Singularity, although it still wouldn't explain why, if a
Singularity escaping is a good thing, the Singularity didn't leave
behind autonomous robots to keep up the good work.

As it is, given that at least one in a thousand mortal races would be
disciplined enough to avoid a Singularity entirely - hiveminds and the
like - and spread with Slow Zone tech across the galaxies, I can only
assume that the first Singularity to notice their radio emissions grabs
them and leaves.  This would seem to bode well for us, as the simplest
explanation would seem to be altruistic (Compact?) motives.

But then why haven't we been contacted by our local self-reproducing
Observer nanobot?  Or if races are "cleaned up" and exterminated, why
haven't we been destroyed?  And if the Powers don't interfere at all,
why aren't the mortal remnants developing normally?

1.  Mortal races would spread through the galaxies unless prevented by Powers.
2.  If the Powers have any goals in this Universe, why don't they expand
their sphere of influence at lightspeed?

As far as I can tell, there is absolutely no set of assumptions that
leads to the Great Silence.  Life is not only absurd but impossible.  It
may be time to start thinking about this world being a computer simulation.

Wonderful.  So even the Zoo Hypothesis gets trashed.

[An aside more important to me than what follows herein:  I believe that Robin
Hanson deserves a hearty "Huzzah!" for his upcoming career move.  But I'll let
him tell us more, if he so chooses.]

I'd criticized Krugman's analysis of network effects both for using the wrong
terminology (calling it "externalities") and for failing to adequately
accomodate new evidence regarding the QWERTY myth.  Robin Hanson wrote:

>Searching for "Liebowitz Margolis network effects" at AltaVista gets me this 
>10/98 CATO policy analysis: http://wwwpub.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/cato.html

The criticisms of those authors regarding the misnomer "network externalities"
comes in other, earlier work.  I believe that it is available online, via one
or both of the author's academic homepages, though I read it in hardcopy
texts.  An earlier Liebowitz & Margolis text--the Reason piece?--also claimed
that Krugman was deliberately avoiding facts about his beloved QWERTY case.
Liebowitz & Margolis are perhaps now sensitive to Krugman's latter-day
conversion because they think that they deserve some credit for forcing it
upon him.  The allegation that Krugman wrongly took credit for discovering the
network effect came from another source, as I recall--that fellow at Stanford;
Paul, is it?

>These authors don't complain about the phrase "network externality", and I 
>see no reason to complain either.

As I noted, they do complain about the phrase, though perhaps not in the work
you looked at.  I've typed and erased a few clumsy attempts to paraphrase
their argument; better I should leave it to someone more expert than I.  I
left my collection of Liebowitz & Margolis papers at my other office, however,
or else I would offer you a helpful quote.

There is no obvious answer.  Our culture frowns on gratuitous cruelty to
animals, but accepts slavery of animals.  Even cruelty is accepted if it
is for a worthwhile purpose such as medical research, safety research, or
product development and testing.



Or maybe it is wrong to have

Various domestic animals are intentionally or unintentionally selectively
bred for characteristics we value, but it is difficult to 'blame' any
particular individual for that, since the process takes so long, and most
pet owners do not even do that intentionally.  It is understandable that
the average person would prefer a domestic cat as a pet over a bobcat or
a rat.


Ferrets have become somewhat popular as pets even though there is no
lengthy history of them being kept and bred.  Cats, in contrast, have
been kept for 5,000 years, and dogs for longer.

Recognizing bogosity requires some familiarity with the issue at hand.
Spike, you may know enough about satellites to have an informed opinion.
I certainly don't. That said...

How old is that satellite? What is involved in controlling it?

A few years back, when I read about American phreaks re-programming the
switches of the telephone company, I was awed. What incredible abilities
must these people have to do something that should by all rights be
impossible? Well, my respect collapsed when I read _The Hacker
Crackdown_. The telcos had left maintenance modem ports on-line, without
password protection, and anybody who stumbled over the number could dial
in and--after figuring out the system from the online help or manuals
found in the trash dumpster at the telco's building--take control. No
extraordinary abilities required. How could anybody in his right mind be
so incredibly stupid to set such a system up?

So, maybe you only need to send a carrier on certain ("secret")
frequencies to control the satellite or some such thing? Something that
should be well in the ability of a radio amateur.

Also, it isn't required to do something meaningful with the satellite.
They just need to interfere with its operation.

T.O.

   I wholeheartedly agree that in future the Justice system should include
provisions for as full of Restitution as possible to the victims of crime from
the perpetrators.  But I do not believe this is adequate in and of itself.
For example, if you had enough resources you simply wouldn't care, you could
just do what you want and pay your way out of it.  Also, this would not stop
the impoverished from committing crime, if you don't have anything to take,
what have you to lose?  And lastly, there are some crimes where recompensation
is impossible.  How do you recompensate the victims of murder and their
families?  Some things just can't be made right.

Tim, Anders, and other >H,

   I would like to second the idea of not getting trapped in the Us vs. Them
meme.  I think it is important to remember that the general public is not the
enemy, they are our families, friends, coworkers, neighbors, and us.  We need
to be able to reach out to those who have not discovered >H, help them to
understand why we believe what we do, and try to understand what their
concerns and misgivings are.  Remember, even a current enemy can be a future
ally, so let's neither demonize nor denigrate those who are not yet >H, and
darn well not let anyone demonize or denigrate >H.  We are trying to influence
the future...well we ARE the future, and by we I mean ALL of humanity.  I
suppose that is why I am interested in reaching out to those who are not >H.
Because of our personality types, those of us currently involved in
transhumanism will probably always be somewhere out on the cutting edge of
thought, but if we honestly believe that we are heading in the right
direction, then it would be a good idea to make sure that the rest of humanity
knows where we're going so they can follow if so inclined.

Joe,

  I'm not sure that the concept of free will is incompatible with determinism.
The important thing is that our decisions be made by us, with minimal
interference from unrecognized manipulation by other conscious beings.
Another important quality to free will is the ability to shift our goals based
on our own analysis of circumstances.  Free will means being able to
independently develop goals without having those goals assigned by an outside
agency.  I think the reason people are so concerned that our decisions be
"unpredictable" is to make it more difficult for us to be placed in situations
designed by another where we have no control, or even knowledge of loss of
control.  Indeed, it may be that the decision making process is too chaotic in
nature to make perfect prediction of action an effective strategy, yet it
could still be completely deterministic.  

   As a related aside, I was working on a Traumatic Brain Injury unit in
January, and one of the things we had to do was assess the level of
awareness/consciousness our patients possessed.  This was difficult since many
lacked the ability to speak at first, even though awake.  What we would do is
test for the presence of low probabilistic, contingent activity.  We often
would observe first, to see what novel low probability actions the patient
would repeat.  These were not very predictable (as one might expect from a low
probability occurence).  But really what we were looking for were signs of
novel, low probalistic behavior that were signs of new internally generated
goals.  The novel portion was important, because stereotyped behaviors can be
well preserved, without any sign of a guiding consciousness.  For example,
some people in a persistant vegetative state will sign their signature if you
place a pen in their hand...but nothing else.  I think I've strayed a bit off
topic here, but thought it might be interesting.

Please note that the "sexual orientation" consists of many layers, from

Some parts of the sexual preference appears to be programmed at a young age
by the cultural and social environment.

We need more culturally and socially neutral research on this subject.

Compare this to John Stuart Mill.  His father was a stern believer in the

His son was raised in this philosophy.  Anything he did had to be useful.
No playing around.

John Stuart Mill as an adult wrote the book "On Liberty" in which he took
the standpoint that everybody should have LIBERTY.  He revolted against
the stern upbringing he received from his father.

You need not postulate the existence of a gene.  It's all in the memes.

A Power built on standard human values would definitely meddle in the affairs
of the lower beings (consider how humans treat their pet animals).

The Prime Directive idea appears a rather unusual human world view.

A more non-human (inhuman? ;) Power could simply leave the lower beings to
live their puny lives and die their puny deaths, but have a surveillance
of the goings-on in case something interesting happens.  Objects of study.
If they become a pest, terminate them.

Joe,

   Yes, but would it be something you would allow to be imposed on you if you
were found guilty, or would you try to circumvent this punishment?  Since you
would essentially be free (except for the implant) you could try to have it
removed (quite illegal, but that's never stopped people before).  How would
you safeguard against that?  Also, for what type of crimes would you recommend
this sentence?  Lastly, how long do you think it would take to make this
punishment available if we decided to do it?  Thanks for your input, Joe.

>Interesting point about the shift in the Extropian Principles.

It seems to me that changing ones oponion is a sign of strength rather than
a sign of weaknes. How come that in politics one is a short-sightet, illoyal
villain if one changes ones point of view when in science one should allways
do it when faced with new evidence?

This is exactly what is wrong with politics today. You are a hero i politics
if you enter a political party at age 18 and never change your opinion for
your whole life. If on the other hand you try to change your political party
once or twice during a lifetime you cannot be trusted and is considdered a
sleep-around.

Refining what extropy is and stands for in the face of new insights and new
evidence must absolutely be seen as a strength not a weaknes. If somebody
then doesn't considder themself extropian anymore, well...

Adrian,

   I equatate Provider/Manager of the Afterlife with the Savior aspect...maybe
a touch of the Creator aspect (creating the "Afterworld"). Glad you like the
list; if you can think of anything else, please let me know.  The real
question is, do you like it enough to start using the categories in your
conceptualization of what you have previously been referring to as God.  Hope
it helps.

On the Viet Nam war and the Anti-War Movement

   I was born in 1971, so none of this is from personal experience.  I don't
think most of the protesters were motivated by cowardice, as making yourself a
visible target is not the best protective strategy...no, I'm thinking the
cowards of that time were probably keeping fairly quiet on the issue, just
making sure that they flunked their physicals and had their college deferments
(not that anyone who flunked or went to college was a coward, just that the
cowards wanted to fall within these groups for their own protection).  I
believe in the early phase of the Anti-War Movement, when the slogans were,
"Bring the Boys home," that these people were honestly concerned and
expressing their feelings about what American policy should be.  I have no
problem with that.  When the Anti-War Movement mutated into, "Bring the War
home," is what I found reprehensible.  At that point, the Movement began to
revile their nation and the soldiers who fought for it as somehow Evil, and
further, by their actions they gave aid and comfort to our adversaries.  No,
this wasn't cowardice; it was traitorous.  Take for example the famous case of
Jane Fonda; as a woman, she was not in danger of being drafted.  On the
contrary, she voluntarily placed herself in harm's way by visiting North Viet
Nam.  And by doing so in from of the media, she handed our adversary some
great propaganda.  In my opinion, the best thing to do would have kept the
"Bring the Boys Home" motto and been true to it.  Unless of course you
believed the war was the right action, in which case I would have taken the
kids gloves off and occupied North Viet Nam.  One or the other, but instead we
had limbo.

Because you originally started this discussion claiming that 'toddlers'
regularly shot each other. Toddlers are under age five, unless something
has changed dramatically with US parenting recently.

Only if you keep changing your definition of 'kids'. Mike was responding
to the 'toddler' post, not a post about people under fifteen.

BTW, he also made a good point about suicides being regularly listed as
accidental deaths; this is also a reason for these studies showing that
cops are regularly killed with their own guns... a very large fraction of
cop deaths are suicides... for which they use their own guns.

Of course unless they mean 'much less than half' when they say 'less than
half', then about half of those deaths are suicides and justifiable 
homicides (*total* US homicide rate is around 8/100,000, or more like 
20,000 than 44,000). Oh, and note the limitation to 'richest nations'.

Gotta twist those statistics to the anti-gun agenda...

The generally accepted estimate for the number of guns in America is over 200,000,000, and growing rapidly as more and more anti-gun laws are
passed. You can do the math.

Well, he's right and you're wrong. You just seem to want to take the normal
anti-gun path of finding some way to frig the statistics so that they support
your beliefs. Many, many more people are killed in bathroom accidents than
gun accidents... that's reality.

Incidentally, I've been highly amused recently by various comments in the
British media about people just ignoring muggings in progress and walking
by rather than helping the victim. The same media folks who pushed for 
disarming the population are now complaining that disarmed people refuse to 
get hurt helping out their fellows. Like, duh.

Thanks Glen, I will.  I guess the word Savior has too much baggage for me.

I'm not so sure. All you really need is a database on the server where
list members register their choice of PPL, such that it's added as a 
header in the outgoing mail. Recipients can then filter out the PPLs
they don't want to receive mail from, and if senders break the restrictions
imposed by their PPL the PPL owner can kick them out into 'anarchy'.

As long as we can filter on arbitrary headers, this would work.

Here's a question.  Who is  interested in immortality for all a la Frank
Tipler?  

You can finess the Omega Point uncertainty by simply saying that the massive
computers of the future and the mining of data in the light cone and elsewhere
are all the technology needed for this project.  This plus the will to do it.

Interested in discussing it, or achieving it (which, in Tipler's

I think the problem with universal immortalism (that is, sometime
somewhere somebody will solve the problem of death and bring everybody
back) is that it encourages a passive attitude - we can't do much
about it now, we can only use this belief as a consolation when our
loved ones die and it might even discourage from potentially
lifesaving activities.

The problem with the OP is 1) we don't know if it is possible yet,
there are some serious problems with the theory (the major one is of
course that the universe appears to be open according to the latest
studies), 2) the actual implementation of the OP isn't certain unless
you buy Tiplers boundary conditions (which look terribly arbitrary to
me), 3) the actual values and behavior expected from the OP appear to
be very indeterminate - Tipler makes a case for a nice OP, but it is
hardly watertight. Taking the OP as given is stupid, since it rests on
so many assumptions.

As I see it, if we in the future learn enough to see that 1) is true,
then I will view the implementation of the OP as a great project well
worth putting whatever resources I possess behind (and likely many
others will do so to). If 1) is false, too bad, we better find another
way of giving the universe a happy ending.

No. The best thing is to think *rationally* about what to do. 

The problem with everybody who sits here complaining about the evils
of government, religion, irrationalism, luddites and everything
entropic is that it is mostly vehemence and complaints, very little
constructive action.

The thing to do is of course to build alternatives that are better,
find ways around the problems and most important of all, to get a
clear picture of what is going on. Emotionality interferes with that a
lot. 

<please turn of your amygdalae>

Just look at how people react even to the mention of the nazis
(Timothy mentioned them first ;-). It usually makes them more
emotional (which in turns make well-rehearsed quick reactions,
i.e. knee-jerk reactions, more probable), they want to distance
themselves from whatever the nazis were associated with and they want
to stop whatever nazi-like stuff is going on. It is quite
understandable given what the nazis did. The problem is that the
actions taken in this heat of emotion often make matters worse:
freedom of speech is limited more than necessarily to protest against
racism, laws are instituted allowing tracking of suspicious groups,
reputations are dirtied by association and so on. Even more subtler,
many of the information programs against racism and nazism that have
been instituted (as well as movies and popular culture) help spread
the image of "nazi == total evil" and other memes that make people
even less rational about the quite real threat from totalitarian
groups - I have encountered otherwise well educated people who cannot
believe that Hitler was actually democratically elected and well liked
by a sizeable part of the german population, they had been so
conditioned that they had to think he did it by a direct coup and
total repression (the real story about how he did it is rather
interesting and worrying). This is dangerous, since it makes people
think that things like nazism are a remote evil, not anything
connected to what they themselves might do or cause to happen.

<you can turn on your amygdalae now>

Do you see now why I dislike atheists who get vehement about the evils
of religion? A rational atheist would look at the phenomenon of
religion as a whole, try to understand it, see its good sides and bad
sides, and then use this information to either create an alternative,
find ways around religion or decrease its bad sides. There is nothing
passive, nothing appeasing about this.

Absolutely! I think omnipresent cheap and functional video cameras
*everywhere* is going to be one of the best side effects of technology
yet seen.  There will be massive griping and manipulation of the news
media propaganda machine by those who have the money, but in the end,
this will benefit the vast majority of people.

Give me a few statistics and I'll do the math.

1) Average time spent handling gun
2) Average time spent in bathroom
3) Average time spent in car

I'm not trying to manipulate data... I'm trying to use some meaningful
statistics. For example, people might say that bees are more dangerous than
great white sharks, simply because there are a greater number of bee deaths
than great white deaths... you get where I'm going with this.

Now this is an idea I could see implementing.  All it requires is a little
space on the ExI Web server, a little HTML work, and some writing - no
programming, no ongoing maintenance, and no dollar costs at all.  I'm sure
we could get volunteers to generate a list of "important, contentious
issues", and to write a summary of each side's position on them.

Does ExI have the extra server space for such a project (I'd think <1 MB)?
And does anyone at ExI have time to coordinate such a project?

Uh, for the average American, bees *are* more dangerous than great white 
sharks. For the average American, their bathroom *is* more dangerous than 
a gun. For someone swimming with a great white shark it's more dangerous 
than a bee. For someone facing a jackbooted government thug, the thug's
gun is more dangerous than their bathroom.

Why should we be concerned about these special cases when we're talking
about the effect on the average American's life? The average American is
far more likely to die in a bathroom accident than a gun accident. That's
it. You're trying to turn the discussion to some special case which is
irrelevant to what we're talking about.

Both, Anders. I think discussion is important.  And, I don't accept the
inevitability of it, and rather see it as something to work for.

The first step in achieving it is to setup and man an orginization dedicated

Great. I'm sometimes worried about the amount of technological

Is that really the best first step? While it would be fun to have a
Omega Point Study Institute, its utility might be rather low at first
- all the necessary research is being done by ordinary scientists, the
only thing OP-theoreticians need to do is to gather together the
latest knowledge in cosmology, computation and robotics. Once we get
to the stage where launching replicating probes and such becomes
feasible, *then* the OPSI would become important in directing the
debate about the project.

Since when is there any right to privacy in a public place?
They can fill the streets with cameras as far as I'm concenred,
as long as they don't put any in my house.  Same goes for when
I'm in someone else's house, or at work: my host or employer
has all the rights, I have none.

"Privacy" is nothing but a consequence of ordinary property
rights, not something that requires special protection.  I am
surprized when some libertarians even go so far as to treat it
as an entitlement that others should pay for, as when they
support laws preventing businesses from using personal info
they have received from their customers.

TANSTAAFL: if you value privacy, you have to make your own.

While the stats for the two below are rather easy to establish, the one above is
not, and I doubt you will get many people agreeing on the criteria to measure
it. For example:

in 'handling' a gun, do you mean the amount of time it is actually in hand being
fired? If that is the only criterion you accept then you are obviously trying to
skew the stats.

Since a gun is a deterrent weapon, (esp. seeing as how the FBI estimates that
guns are used in defense against criminals 2 million times a year without
firing, merely being brandished) merely carrying a gun on one's person or having
one close at hand ( in the glove box, in your desk, in your night stand, etc.)
should count as 'time handling a gun'. If you accept this, I think you will find
that time handling a gun is actually much higher than either of the two below. I
personally spend an hour or so in the bathroom a day, and maybe two hours a day
on the road. I am carrying or have my gun close at hand 24/7. I spend 2-4 hours
a week firing guns on the practice range (mostly skeet, though I try to pop off
a few mags on my 9mm at least once a week or so). I think that you will find
that most gun owners who aren't just collectors have similar habits. Most at
least keep one close at hand in the bedroom for night time security, which would
make their 'handling' rate about 6-10 hours a day.

Yes I do. Try it out and see where you get. Counting 'handling' as having a gun
on one's person or close at hand is exactly like time spent in an idling car at
a stoplight (one of the higher risk situations to be in, in a car, as a matter
of fact.) or stuck in traffic.

One of my favorite reactions to Extropian ideas was from a Viet Nam
vet at a poker table.  Someone noticed my cryo bracelet and the
discussion turned to that.  The vet said "I don't know about living
forever; I just want to live long enough to piss on Jane Fonda's
grave."

	I'm on of the web administrator for the extropy site.  If
anyone puts together some html pages, sends them to me, and recommends
where they be linked in, and there are no objections form Max or
anyone else about such additions, I'm always happy to put them on the
server.  I'm sure we have the space for something like this.  As
usual, the big problem is having someone put together the actual html
content.

	Personally, I'd like some kind of system where we accumulate
knowledge about such issues and make progress.  I've written what I
call an IFAQ system for interactive FAQ system.  Here is a description
of the system.  Let me know what you think and if you'd like to see
something like this set up for this list.

		Brent Allsop





============================================================================
	--  Some prose about interactive FAQ server philosophy: --
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

		-- Two Types of FAQs --
	There are two types of questions asked in notes groups: ones
with uncontroversial answers such as the ones contained in the
sci.physics FAQ and ones with controversial answers.  Some questions
seem to have more answers than there are people on the net.  FAQs
maintained by single people or groups of people such as the one in
sci.physics are very good at maintaining a database of uncontroversial
answers to question with such.  These databases of uncontroversial
answers obviously provide a great service to people reading notes
groups.  It keeps the number of repeated questions with repeated
answers posted to notes to a minimum while still providing great
information to readers with questions.

		-- Non Consensus is the Real Problem. --
	There is a far greater problem with questions that have many
apposing controversial answers.  No single person or even a group of
people can ever hope to have the band width required to accurately
represent every position desired by the many people with very strong
diverse beliefs about such FAQs.  A good example of such a question
is: "Is there a God?"  At least with questions that have
uncontroversial answers the worst that can happen is that someone will
ask a question that is constantly asked; someone will give an
erroneous answer; several people will post a correction to the
erroneous answers; and finally someone will add the better version of
the right answer to a FAQ. With questions that only have controversial
answers some brave benevolent soul will post a very good answer with
some very good supporting arguments.  Then everyone and their dog
seems to be compelled to put forth their own answer (like a vote) as
if it is required for the salvation of the asker (it IS right? ;).
Finally after 100 or more heated flaming responses the string
typically degenerates into everyone calling everyone else something
that is bad that pertains to the particular notes group.  (A machine
that doesn't pass the Turing Test in comp.ai.philosophy; A weiner dog
in alt.pets.dogs;) A Christian in alt.atheism, An atheist in
alt.christnet... )  This same flaming discussion will occur on a
regular cycle time depending on the average history setting on the
notes readers of the group.  The same arguments being presented again
and again in a very unorganized inefficient fashion.

		-- Purpose of Interactive FAQ Server --
	The purpose of this interactive FAQ server is to organize and
hopefully make more efficient this process of conversion,
communication, and supporting positions.  It is to organize people
with similar views into teams that can work together to better
communicate their views to other readers of the group.  It is to more
easily communicate which positions have a consensus and which ones
don't.  (Does the quality of a cable carrying digital audio
information improve the quality of the sound? ;) It is very difficult
to research and find out which answers to questions have a consensus
among experts in the literature since most published material only has
one or a few authors (and hence only one "vote").  One must become an
expert themselves and survey most of the literature before being able
to accurately determine such.  Hopefully this interactive FAQ server
will make it easier for non experts to see which answers have a
consensus and which ones don't.  Of course if all the experts support
one position (i.e. free agency IS compatible with determinism? ;) and
all the "lay" populace support an apposing position it is still up to
the reader of the FAQ to determine which supporters are experts and
which are not since anyone can be a supporter and/or a submitter.

		-- Organized Team Work --
	When you submit your name as a supporter of a particular
response to a FAQ (a valid e-mail address must be included to do
such.)  you should consider yourself joining a team.  Everyone on the
team should work to better communicate the team's view to others with
the ultimate, idealistic goal of converting others and having your
team become the one with clearly the most popular response.  (This
idealistic goal can also be achieved by abandoning poor positions. ;)
If the team comes up with more evidence or recognizes a better,
shorter, more concise way to state a position such that it has more
conversion, and communication power, a member should submit the new
version of the position and everyone on the team should change their
support to that better written response.  Hopefully a submitter of a
new response will have their answer reviewed and get a significant
list of people that will agree to support the response (You can only
support one position per FAQ.) before submitting the response.
Posting a call for supporters in notes or e-mailing to supporters of a
current response are good ways to find supporters or converts.  Only
very brave people will be the sole supporter of a response.  If a
response has no supporters at all it will eventually be removed from
the database via the sorting process.  If you are a supporter of an
unpopular position you should expect to receive e-mail or at least
posts in the group directed at you trying to win you over to more
popular positions since having lots of responses (especially similar
ones) will tend to make a mess of the FAQ database.

		-- Popularity isn't Proof! --
	Obviously popularity of any particular response doesn't prove
that the response is the best or worst response.  If someone really
believes that they're position is right and are the only one that
believes such they should be brave enough to be the only (or minority)
supporter of a response.  Hopefully people like this have good reasons
for such and can communicate this in their response.  If they are
right, some day someone will find more evidence that converts more
people to that team.  Such early courageous members of a minority team
that becomes a popular team will probably be considered "heros" of
that team.

		-- Sorting and Posting --
	An automatic process can be set up to automatically run a sort
on the database and then post a default report of the newly sorted
database to the notes group.  It will become the FAQ for the group.
This will probably be at intervals of around one month. It is up to
each individual notes group to decide the frequency of such.  This
sorting process will sort questions and responses according to how
much support they have.  The support of a question is the sum total of
supporters of all it's responses.  Questions and Responses with no
supporters will be removed entirely from the database when sorted.
Each sorting will increment the dbVersion number.  Submittals that
refer to questions and responses with numbers will require a proper
'dbVersion:' number to insure that an incorrect earlier number of a
question or response isn't being used.  Reports include the current
dbVersion.  Make sure the numbers you use to reference FAQs and
responses are the currently correct ones and not ones from a report
from some previous sorting!

		-- Honor system will make it work --
	Before submitting anything please check to see if what you
want to consider your name is already being used.  This can be done by
submitting a 'Change-name:' command with your desired name as both the
'Old-name:' and 'New-name:' value.  This will return a report of every
existence of the name.  If someone is already using your name come up
with some differentiating version (besides case) that makes your's
unique.  Also, once you chose a name don't continually change it or
use different versions.  The faq server is case insensitive.  Remember
you can only support one Response per FAQ and a unique name, not
including case, is important for this process to work.

	Having a valid e-mail address with a submitted supporter is
important for the "team" to be able to work together and is therefore
required.  When you submit support there is no formal check to verify
that the e-mail address you submit is valid.  If anyone discovers that
the e-mail address of a supporter is not valid an administrator should
be notified and the offending entry should be removed from the
database.

	Obviously anyone can cause great problems and mess up this
process.  If your going to participate please make an attempt to be a
good citizen and work to improve the FAQ.  If you have any suggestions
as to how to improve this process, or notice what you think is a
defect in the server, I'd love to hear about it.  (And feel free to
send any great FAQ maintainers $35 if you greatly benefit from their
efforts!  ;) ;) ;) Don't you think they deserve it?  I "vote" for
professional FAQ maintainers. ;)

	Good luck and happy converting!



============================================================================
	    --- Interactive FAQ server HELP file. ---
============================================================================

	This file contains a description of how to use the interactive
FAQ server (intfaqserv program).  It contains a description of the
textual commands that can be e-mailed to an operating intfaqserv
program.  It has 3 sections:

    1   Typical major commands indicating required sub commands:

    2	Some prose about interactive FAQ server philosophy:

    3	Alphabetical listing of commands with descriptions:

	The first section contains a few template like examples of
common commands.  Pick out the command you want from the list of 4
things below and see this section for a template of the required sub
commands.  If your going to submit a question, a response, or support
for a response please read section 2 first.  Section 3 is primarily
for a reference of all commands.  Here is a list of the primary things
you can do with the associated major command:


	Get a current report:       'Report:'
	Submit a question:          'Submit-question:' *
	Submit a response:          'Submit-response:' *
	"vote" for a response:      'Submit-support:'  *


	* There are several required sub commands for these commands.
In order to submit a FAQ you must at the same time submit a response
and have the associated initial supporter of that response; And
similarly In order to submit a response you must have an initial
supporter.  See below for more detail about required sub commands and
example templates for major commands.  Don't forget the ':' at the end
of each command.


============================================================================
	Typical major commands indicating required sub commands:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Help:

	This 'Help:' command has no subcommands and simply responds by
returning this help file.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Report:

	This 'Report:' command is the standard way to get the FAQ in
it's standard current form.  This default version doesn't include any
unsupported questions, responses, or traitors.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Report:
	FAQ: all
	Response: all
	Names: all
	Reply-to: allsop@hpfcla.fc.hp.com

	This version of the 'Report:' command will give you all the
information contained in the FAQ database.  The optional 'Reply-to:'
command indicates that the response should be sent to
allsop@hpfcla.fc.hp.com and not the return value specified in the
e-mail header.  The 'Reply-to:' command may be included in any e-mail
command.  Some e-mail sending programs may use an e-mail header format
for which the intfaqserv program can not find a return e-mail address.
In this case a 'Reply-to:' command is required.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Submit-support:
	dbVersion: 1					<- required!
	Question-number: 2				<- required!
	Response-number: 1				<- required!
	Supporter: (Brent Allsop) <allsop@fc.hp.com>	<- required!

	This 'Submit-support:' command has all the required
subcommands and will submit (Brent Allsop) with an e-mail address of
<allsop@fc.hp.com> to response #1 of FAQ #2.  If (Brent Allsop) or
someone with that name is supporting another response to this question
they will be moved to the traitor list for that response.  This is why
having a unique name is important.  If you are submitting anything be
sure you have a unique name. (see 'Name-change:' command about how to
do this.)  Remember that this FAQ server is not sensitive to case.
Remember to put ()s around names and <>s around addresses.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remove-support:
	dbVersion: 1					<- required!
	Question-number: 2				<- required!
	Response-number: 1				<- required!
	Supporter: (Brent Allsop) <allsop@fc.hp.com>	<- required!

	This 'Remove-support:' command has all the required
subcommands and will remove (Brent Allsop) from the supporter list of
response #1 of FAQ #2 and add him to the traitor list of the response.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Submit-question:
	Supporter: (Brent Allsop) <allsop@fc.hp.com>	<- required!

	Question-text:					<- required!
	Is a dbVersion required to submit a question?
	End-text

	Question-author: (Malia Allsop) <m_allsop@fc.hp.com>

	Response-text:					<- required!
	I don't know.
	End-text

	Response-author: (Brent Allsop) <allsop@fc.hp.com>

	This 'Submit-question:' command submits the question: "Is a
dbVersion required to submit a question?" with the response: "I don't
know.".  It is pointless to have a question without a response so an
initial answer is required (along with a supporter) to be submitted
with a question.  If the optional Author commands are not given the
values are taken from the required 'Supporter:' sub command.  An
"Empty" author command with no values may be given if author anonymity
is desired.  ('End-text' cannot have any space before it and is only
this way here for ease of reading.)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Submit-response:
	dbVersion: 1					<- required!
	Supporter: (Brent Allsop) <allsop@fc.hp.com>	<- required!
	Question-number: 2                              <- required!

	Response-text:					<- required!
	No. A dbVersion is not required.
	to submit a question.
	end-text

	Response-author:

	This 'Submit-response:' command submits the response: "No. A
dbVersion is not required." to FAQ #2.  An initial supporter value is
required.  The "empty" 'Response-author:' command results in a nill or
anonymous author value.  If an author command is left off completely
the values for the required 'Supporter:' sub command are used.
('End-text' cannot have any space before it and is only this way here
for ease of reading.)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Change-name:
	Old-name: (Brent Allsop) <allsop@fc.hp.com>	   <- required
	New-name: (Brent Allsop) <allsop@hpfcla.fc.hp.com> <- required

	This 'Change-name:' command is for changing the name and/or
address of an entry.  If the 'Old-name:' values match identically, not
counting case differences, the old values are replaced with the
New-name: values in the database.  The subcommands used to control the
'Report:' command may also be used here.  However, the default value
for the Change-name: command is to change all matching names not just
values in supported entries like the default 'Report:' command.  A
report of each replacement and a total number of replacements is
returned.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Change-name:
	Old-name: (Brent Allsop) <allsop@fc.hp.com>	   <- required
	New-name: (Brent Allsop) <allsop@hpfcla.fc.hp.com> <- required
	FAQ: 2
	Response: 3
	Names: supported

	This version of 'Change-name:' will only change the author of
FAQ #2 and Response #3 and any supporters of this response with a
matching name and address.

	New-name: (Brent Allsop) <allsop@fc.hp.com>        <- required

	The 'Change-name:' command with identical 'Old-name:' and
'New-name:' values returns a report of every existence of the name and
address.  Remember this server does not distinguish between case of
letters.  If you are submitting for the first time you must use this
command first to be sure your name is unique.  Once you pick a name
that isn't already used always use that name.
============================================================================
	    Alphabetical listing of commands with description:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Change-name:
	This command is used to change author and supporter name and
	address values.  If the values in the 'Old-name:' match
	identically (other than case differences) the 'New-name:'
	values will replace them.  This command can also be used to
	check for a unique name and address combination by having the
	'Old-name:' and 'New-name:' values identical.  The number of
	name changes along with which name changes is returned in a
	report.  "+Report control" commands can be used in a similar
	fashion to the 'Report:' command to specify particular names
	to change.  The default value, however, is everything
	including unsupported and traitor entries unlike the 'Report:'
	command which defaults to only includes supported entries and
	supporters.  In other words if no "+Report control" commands
	are given all identical matches with 'Old-name:' values are
	changed to 'New-name:' values.


dbVersion:
	Every time the FAQ database is sorted a new dbVersion number
	is stored with the Database.  Major commands which reference
	specific FAQs and/or Responses must include this command and
	the number must match the value stored in the current
	database.  The command will fail otherwise.  Each report
	produced by the 'Report:' command indicates the dbVersion
	value when the report was generated.  This is a global command
	so only one dbVersion is required per e-mail submittal.
	So this is more like a *major command and, unlike other
	'sub commands', may appear before other *major commands.


+FAQ: <support indicator>
	There can be more than one of these per 'Report:' command.
	See <support indicator> specifications below.


*Help:
	This command will return a copy of this file.


Names: <support indicator>
	The <support indicator> indicates which lists of names
	(supporters, traitors, none[0] or all) to include in the
	report.  A single number <support indicator> is not valid
	here.  See <support indicator> specifications below.


New-name: (name) <e-mail address>
	This is a 'Change-name:' sub command.  Everything within the
	'()'s is taken as the name value and everything withing the
	'<>'s is taken as the e-mail address value.  See
	'Change-name:' for more info.


Old-name: (name) <e-mail address>
	This is a 'Change-name:' sub command.  Everything within the
	'()'s is taken as the name value and everything withing the
	'<>'s is taken as the e-mail address value.  See
	'Change-name:' for more info.


Question-author: (name) <e-mail address>
	This command indicates the author of the question being
	submitted.  Everything within the '()'s is taken as the name
	value and everything withing the '<>'s is taken as the e-mail
	address value.  This command is optional and if not included
	the 'Supporter:' values will be used.  If anonymity is desired
	the command may be included with no values.  See 'Supporter:'
	for more details.


Question-number: #
	This command indicates which FAQ the major command will apply
	to.


Question-text:
	Everything following this command until a 'End-text' at the
	beginning of a line is taken as the question text.  Each line
	must be less than 80 characters in length and there can't be
	an 'End-text' string at the beginning of any line in the
	actual text since such will be the end of the command.


*Remove-support:
	If you are not a supporter of the specified response to a FAQ
	the command will fail.  If the 'Supporter:' is a supporter of
	the specified response then the name and address will be moved
	to the traitor list of the response.  'dbVersion:',
	'Question-number:', 'Response-number:', and 'Supporter:'
	are all required sub commands.


Reply-to: <e-mail address>
	This 'Reply-to:' command specifies which e-mail address
	the response should be sent to.  If not given the
	"Reply-to:", "From:", or "from" value in the e-mail header
	are used in this order. Some e-mail sending programs may use
	an e-mail header format for which the intfaqserv program can
	not get a proper return e-mail address.  In this case a
	'Reply-to:' command would be required.  This command can be
	included with any command.


*Report:
	This command returns a FAQ report.  With no "report control"
	commands (indicated with +) a default report will be generated
	including supported questions, responses, and the associated
	supporters.  "Report control" commands (see below) are
	required to get unsupported answers, responses, and traitor
	information.


+Response: <support indicator>
	This command can be repeated more than once for each 'FAQ:'
	command.  See <support indicator> specifications below.


Response-author: (name) <e-mail address>
	This command indicates the author of the response being
	submitted.  Everything within the '()'s is taken as the name
	value and everything withing the '<>'s is taken as the e-mail
	address value.  This command is optional and if not included
	the 'Supporter:' values will be used.  If anonymity is desired
	the command may be included with no values.  See 'Supporter:'
	for more details.


Response-number: #
	This command indicates which Answer the major command will
	apply to.


Response-text:
	Everything following this command until a 'End-text' at the
	beginning of a line is taken as the response text.  Each line
	must be less than 80 characters in length and there can't be
	an 'End-text' string at the beginning of any line.


*Submit-question:
	This command submits a FAQ, a response, and the associated
	'Supporter:' of the response.  'Supporter:', 'Question-text:',
	and 'Response-text:' are required sub commands.
	'Question-author:', and 'Response-author:' are optional
	commands.


*Submit-response:
	This command submits a response to a FAQ with the associated
	supporter.  'dbVersion:', 'Supporter:', 'Question-number:' and
	Response-text are required sub commands.  'Response-author:'
	is an optional sub command.


*Submit-support:
	This command adds the 'Supporter:' name and address to the
	supporter list of the 'Response-number:' response of the
	'Question-number:' FAQ.  'dbVersion:', 'Question-number:',
	'Response-number:' and 'Supporter:' are required sub commands.


Supporter: (name) <e-mail address>
	This command specifies the supporters name (everything within
	the '()'s and e-mail address (everything within the '<>'s
	for the associated major command.  Remember to use consistent
	values here that don't conflict with other peoples names.  A
	good way to check if your name is unique is to submit a
	'Change-name:' command with identical 'Old-name:' and
	'New-name:' values.


To:
	Same as 'Reply-to:'.


Traitor: (name) <e-mail address>
	Similar to 'Supporter:'.


*	This indicates a major command.  Most other other commands
	must appear in the context of (or after) a major command.

+	This indicates a "report control" sub command and must appear
	after a 'Report:' command or a 'Change-name:' command.  The
	"report control" commands are: 'FAQ:', 'Response:', and
	'Names:'.  They use <support indicator> values to control
	which entries are visited for reporting or name changing.


<support indicator> values:
  All:		Both supported and unsupported (traitor) entries.

  Supported:	Only supported entries.

  Unsupported:  Only un supported (traitor) entries.

  <positive #>	Indicates single question or response.
		Not valid as a value for the 'Names:' command.

  0		Neither supported nor unsupported (traitor) entries.


+Report control commands BNF:

[ Report: | Change-name:
[ FAQ:      [ All | Supported | Unsupported | 0 | <positive #> ]
[ Response: [ All | Supported | Unsupported | 0 | <positive #> ]
[ Names:    [ All | Supported | Unsupported | 0] ]    ]*    ]*    ]*

Might it be important to consider what percentage of people own guns? This
would figure highly in average time handling gun. Also, it seems that having
the gun close but not being in contact with it would be equivalent to
sitting in your car in your  driveway with the engine on.

I apologize if I'm bothering you with this, but I am playing devil's
advocate here.... after all, you're the one's complaining about misused
stats.

Yep, security was lax, that's because nobody had interfered with
operations before.

A little over ten years ago when I took my present job, guarding
against crackers was a new art. Within a few months I was (under
alias) on the top cracker boards in the world. It came in handy
(still does) as far as computer security is concerned. I remember
my first meeting with the security people. The head honcho said: "
I hear you're pretty good with computer virii, well I've got a
dozen or so in my collection." I had thousands, including many not
seen till a year or so later in the wild. The people who write them
send them to me to be checked out.  heh heh... and added to my
anti-virus software.

I have many friends who have PHD's in every field of computers and
electronics, and are hackers of the old school. Most are also
amateur radio hounds as well. They have had private radio/data
channels running with MIR for years, just for fun (uploading
pictures for lonely cosmonauts).

They design most of the gear used on satelites, taking one over
would be easy for them, so I would assume there are others capable
of the same trick. I suspect members of the former soviet
union/east germany.

children should be exposed to more sex and violence becuase
maintaining their innocence is only an illusion for our benefit,
not theirs.

Even in wartime, where keeping strategic information out of the
hands of the enemy is vital, /some/ secrets are clearly just
self-deceit and ass-covering.  Troop counts and locations are
justifiably secret.  Denying the very existence of the war for
several years, and keeping major campaigns secret from Congress,
are not justified by any stretch of military logic.

I believe what I'm trying to do is keep you honest with your statistics. My
point is that if we used guns as much as we used bathrooms, there would be
more gun deaths. I believe you're  the one trying to manipulate the
statistics in this case by saying that guns are safer than bathrooms. One of
the main reasons I'm not at high risk of being eaten by a shark is that I
don't live by the ocean, and the main reason I'm not at high rick of having
a gun accident is that I've never used one. If I carried a gun, as you seem
to be suggesting I should as a law abiding citizen, my risk of dying by my
own gun would probably be higher than me dying in the bathroom.

Liebowitz's net papers are at http://wwwpub.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/netpage.html
and the closest thing seems to be http://wwwpub.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/jep.html  
whose abstract is:

In the paper they say:

I actually strongly disagree with this attitute toward terminology.
In economic theory we build models from standard components and 
see what the combination of those components does in any given
situation.  We need a terminology for descibing components that 
makes no presumptions about the effect of some combination.

"Externality" describes a specific kind of assumption/feature 
one might put into a model.  The existance of market failure is a 
property of a whole specific model.  It is crucial that we can
agree on what a term like "externality" means about the assumptions
of a model, without that implying anything about whether that
model describes a market failure.

Substituting the word "effect" is far too weak.  If we did this
with every term we wouldn't be left with a vocabulary that let's
us distinguish anything interesting.  

To sum up, there is no common understanding that externalities
imply market failure.  If I saw externalities in a model, that 
might suggest to me, all else equal, that this model might 
be more likely to exibit market failure.  But is just a heuristic,
and has nothing to do with what the term "externality" means.

About 50% of US households have a gun; even if you double the number of accidental gun deaths to take account of that, there are still more people
killed in bathroom accidents than gun accidents.

Some semi-serious worldbuilding:

I'm working on a roleplaying scenario (possibly even a novel) about a
number of interstellar colonies that develop isolated from each
other. I have had great fun writing them up, everything from national
colonies like New America and Penglai over a planet settled by
fundamentalist christians to a planet inhabited by clones of the
original settlers. The real interest is of course what happened after
colonization - in one or two centuries the original memes have mutated
quite a bit. In the scenario FTL is eventually invented, and cultures
begin to mix with explosive results. Great fun!

However, one of the planets is Atlantis, and a lot of the story will
likely deal with it. Atlantis was colonized by a libertarian
foundation; the colonists who joined in had tired with what they
considered a statist, bureaucratic solar system. So they signed a
contract about non-initiation of force etc, pooled resources, bought a
colonization ship and set off towards Zeta II Reticuli 3, christened
Atlantis, going sublight with cryonic suspension.

Now, what I want to hear from you are ideas for various teams,
organizations and groups that might want to go on this expedition, and
what equipment, knowledge and other stuff they might bring with them
(valuables? what species of plants and animals? culture?). What
systems would they like to pool together to buy? Assume a near-future
technological level with fusion power and well developed space
systems, no truly dramatic transhuman technology - yet (guess what
some colonists want to develop in peace?). Atlantis is known to be
terrestrial, not too unlike the Earth given what can be observed by
Hubble IX but has an unknown ecology.

The reason I ask is that I would like to have a broader input on the
Atlantis colony; so far my would-be-coauthor has been far too fond in
suggesting things and I want to spring some suprises to him.

Most likely the finished scenario will be posted to the web in a few
months, after we have played it. It does involve a lot of
transhumanist ideas, although maybe not in the way many people
think...

Deceiving the enemy is the main reason for military lying.   Rallying popular
support is also crucial and public relations are important.

Self deceit and ass covering needs to be rooted out.

Sure. But my scenario has deliberately softened these aspects - at
least among the colonies. Not to go into a lot of detail, but while
the colony ships trundled on towards their destination, quite
naturally things continued to develop in the solar system. The
singularity has come and gone there, the colonies are still on the
human side. And one problem for them turned out to be their small
size: you cannot ship over huge populations, and since the
reproductive rate remains fairly low (they are almost all at least
equivalent to the current western world, with two or three exceptions)
the amount of brainpower, economic growth and scientific discovery was
much lower than in the solar system. So while some of the colonies
have indeed developed intelligence augmentation, nanotech, mental
redesign, human genetic modifications and AI afterwards, they are ages
behind the "solarians" now inhabiting the solar system. (And please
don't ask what the solarians are up to, that is a transcendent secret
:-)

Although not an anarchist myself, I completely agree with Anthony Garcia's
"Philippic From the Old School", both for its spirit and its content. I also
consider myself an "old school Extropian", considering the recent rejection of
libertarianism (i.e. minarchism in my case) a blatant illustration of the
disintegration of the principles of the movement.

But does extropianism really have *any* principles?

The best way to answer this question is look at how "extropianism" is defined,
which requires combining the three definitions that open version 3.0 of the
Principles.

This gives us:

"Extropianism is the evolving transhumanist philosophy of those who seek to
increase the extent of a system's intelligence, information, order, vitality,
and capacity for improvement."

In other words, this philosophy is defined as whatever set of ideas is
currently held by the people who seek to increase a very vague set of
characteristics of an undefined "system".

"Extropy" is just a name that "feels good" to science graduates who have
learned to associate its alleged opposite, "entropy", with chaos and the
"heat-death" of the universe.

But how is it defined? By enumeration, which is an invalid form of definition.
I cannot define the concept "animal" by saying; "animals are horses, cats and
fish", which is roughly the epistemological status of the definition of
"extropy".

This is not logical nit-picking, as I know some members of this group consider
logic a tyrannical imposition on their minds (fine for you, I share Rand's
contempt for those who would reject the tyranny of reality), and most are
infatuated with "fuzzy logic". The practical consequences of this invalid
definition are extremely severe.

For instance: If I classify the books in my library by colour, I have
increased the order of a system, which makes my act "good" by extropian
standards. If I download all sorts of crap from the Internet and store it on
my computer, I have increased my computer's information- another instance of
an "extropian" action. And didn't Hitler increase the "order" of the political
system of Germany?

Moreover, the various "ingredients" of extropy contradict one another. Take
order and capacity for improvement, for instance. Doesn't Stuart Kaufman argue
that evolution takes place in areas where a balance between order and chaos
can be found, and that extremes of chaos and order prevent it? Well then, it
is impossible to maximize both order and capacity for improvement.

"Extropy" is therefore an invalid, self-contradictory concept. This is why the
philosophy will soon dissolve in the kind of nonsense that has almost always
been coalescing around it, and why there's no way we can save it from such
trash.

Extropy is a philosophy that seeks "more" of a undefined "something". This is
all the irony of the principle of self-transformation (into what? a toad?) and
of Max More's own nickname (more of what? dumbness?).

Sincerely,

Jean-Francois Virey.

Have you played the computer games Outpost or Outpost2?  These contain (or a
least the original was -- I haven't played the sequel) detailed and
realistic colonization scenarios.  You could probably get some good ideas
from these.  There's also a new version of Civilization that's supposed to
be a realistic interstellar colonization scenario.  Don't know if it's out
yet, but if it's anything like Civ3 it should have a wealth of useful info.

The RPG Traveller2000 also was loaded with plausible near-future tech, alien
ecologies, etc., but I haven't seen it in the stores recently.  I ran a
Traveller2000 campaign a while back with a lot of tech from the CyberPunk
game supplements thrown in.  Very cool.

I'd heard that Zeta2 Reticuli was a close binary, which ruled out earthlike
planets.  In my scenario I had the planet be the moon of a brown dwarf a la
*Alien*, which made for a really neat environment/ecology since the planet
(moon) was tidally-locked...

Some semi-serious worldbuilding:

I'm working on a roleplaying scenario (possibly even a novel) about a
number of interstellar colonies that develop isolated from each
other. I have had great fun writing them up, everything from national
colonies like New America and Penglai over a planet settled by
fundamentalist christians to a planet inhabited by clones of the
original settlers. The real interest is of course what happened after
colonization - in one or two centuries the original memes have mutated
quite a bit. In the scenario FTL is eventually invented, and cultures
begin to mix with explosive results. Great fun!

However, one of the planets is Atlantis, and a lot of the story will
likely deal with it. Atlantis was colonized by a libertarian
foundation; the colonists who joined in had tired with what they
considered a statist, bureaucratic solar system. So they signed a
contract about non-initiation of force etc, pooled resources, bought a
colonization ship and set off towards Zeta II Reticuli 3, christened
Atlantis, going sublight with cryonic suspension.

Now, what I want to hear from you are ideas for various teams,
organizations and groups that might want to go on this expedition, and
what equipment, knowledge and other stuff they might bring with them
(valuables? what species of plants and animals? culture?). What
systems would they like to pool together to buy? Assume a near-future
technological level with fusion power and well developed space
systems, no truly dramatic transhuman technology - yet (guess what
some colonists want to develop in peace?). Atlantis is known to be
terrestrial, not too unlike the Earth given what can be observed by
Hubble IX but has an unknown ecology.

The reason I ask is that I would like to have a broader input on the
Atlantis colony; so far my would-be-coauthor has been far too fond in
suggesting things and I want to spring some suprises to him.

Most likely the finished scenario will be posted to the web in a few
months, after we have played it. It does involve a lot of
transhumanist ideas, although maybe not in the way many people
think...

I think the problem not just for extropianism but for transhumanism in
general is that as we are growing, we also need better
self-definitions, firmer foundations. But most of us likely do not
want to make them too rigid or excluding. So we end up with a dilemma:
Either some fuzzy definition, that allows just about anything to call
itself transhumanist (like the first definition on the WTA list, which
would have made Jeremy Rifkin a transhumanist :-) and would make it
harder to see the serious, valuable part for all the junk. Or a
stricter definition which of course invites to quarrels over who is
and isn't a Real Extropian (tm), and how to modify these definitions
well.

We clearly need to find some dynamical balance between these two
extremes that avoids getting trapped there (hmm, sounds like the
border of something... ;-).

Actually, I think this is a mistake. What is meant by "order" is
unfortunately rather fuzzy. It is important to distinguish between
information (which is high in chaotic systems rather than "ordered"
systems) and order, in the sense of a system having symmetries and
regularities of low algorithmic complexity. There is a big confusion
about the meaning of these terms, but I think it is clear that the
principles do not say the goal is to minimize the complexity of the
world, neither do they advocate turning it into randomness.

One can do an analysis of the mutual information between an evolving
population at time t and t+1 using information theory (Adami,
Introduction to Artificial Life), and it suggests that there is an
optimal rate of mutation where this information is maximal: too much
and important information about the environment is lost, too little
and the rate of evolution is too slow. It seems that we want to keep
in this optimal region, if we generalize (perhaps dangerously) from
genes to memes.

So you have abandoned dynamic optimism? :-) Seriously, this is
obviously something that can be rationally studied, discussed and
fixed. No need to be defaitist.

So, the main question seems to be: how do we define extropy?

(and what units is it measured in? Felix suggested money as the
natural unit of value)

If you want to be realistic, throw in advanced robotics, automated
manufacturing, genetic engineering and extensive biological modification.
You can still avoid AI and nanotech if you want to, but you need to come up
with a pretty good justification if you're setting a story centuries in the
future.

But role-playing games commonly accept a lower standard of fidelity in the
interest of playability.  You don't want to spend your first three game
sessions trying to explain the world to your players, after all.

Considering that the US has been letting the Russians use our early
warning satellite feeds because their own systems are not being
maintained and are not reliable, and considering the large number of
Russian space program people who are out of work, (keep in mind that to
get things done over there, you have to be a hacker) I think its highly

don't buy the denials of British intelligence. The last thing they want

[This is my earlier private message , I want to share it with the list as it
clarifies some of my intentions on filtering.  Let me know what you think...]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the difficulties with multiple lists is cross-posting.
It's often not easy to find a particular category for any particular 
message.  (that is not to say it shouldn't be done).

What I would suggest to implement, at the first stage, is simple
programmable filters that could be used as optional extensions
to the existing list and/or Web message repository.    Nobody 
would object to them - if you don't want to use it the filters, you
don't even see them.

The filter would represent a user-configurable set of selection
directives that can be defined through a web form.
The directives would define the posters, topics, and other
search criteria that the user would or would not like to see.
You could also just use somebody else's filter (if you were
allowed).    For example, I could subscribe to Greg's
public Investment filter, plus exi-member filter, plus all
messages specifically approved by Max or Brian.
Dr. Newbie might subscribe to the Basics selector
except for messages marked by either of the ExI directors
as junk, plus everything prefixed with MED:.  

This is relatively easy to implement and to use, and will
lead to appearance of alternative private moderators
(quite extropian, IMO), with undivided message base. , and
no issues with duplication and cross-posting of messages,
coercion, common denominators, etc.  

We could probably cooperate with CritSuit (see crit.org)
for some of the features.

On further stages, we could implement reputations, real
collaborative filtering, and other more complex functions.

A possible antagonist:

I assume that mass will be at a premium on the colony ships, but robotics
are good enough to make it feasible for a few thousand people to set up some
kind of civilization.  I also assume that the colonists are in cold sleep
(so they live long enough to benifit from their plans).

So, we start with a rich guy on Earth who sees this as a chance to set
himself up in style.  He hires a small security team and pays for their
passage, with the announced intention of forming a PPL provider on Atlantis.
He also takes along medical equipment (including cloning gear), a small
medical team (including a geneticists or two), a couple of teachers, and a
large library of genetic material.

On Atlantis they operate a clinic and a PPL service to stay afloat in the
short term.  The PPL's rules take the concept of self-ownership to its
logical extreme: signatories have the legal right to sell themselves, either
permanently or into indentured servitude.  It also provides that children
are covered by their parent's PPL service until age 16.

In the nice version of the scheme, he grows lots of clones, educates them,
and puts them to work building the colony.  They are all employees of his
company, and get paid just like anyone else.  In theory they have the right
to quit, and to sign up with another PPL, but ordinary social factors will
ensure there is a strong bias in favor of staying put.

In the unpleasant version, he grows lots of clones, educates them, and bills
them for services rendered.  A 'company town' scheme ensures that they are
stuck in indentured servitude their whole lives.  This gives his company a
cheap, fast-growing labor force, which is a significant competitive
advantage.  The clones can't escape unless some other PPL service decides to
make a concerted effort to give them the opportunity - which may not happen
for quite some time in a frontier setting.

Hmm... check, check, check, check. Got all four (but not in the era
when the colony ships were originally sent, except for some of the
latest colonies).

This is essentially the Vinge problem - if you believe (like many of
us do) that change is going to be exponential, then most stories
become either very near future, hopelessly weird posthuman stories, or
you have to limit things a bit. Vinge did it in AFUTD and the prequel
with his zones, many stories and games try to limit by postulating
strict restrictions or a few suitable disasters to keep tech down.

In my scenario I have just softened the exponential a bit, and added
some possible quirks (simply put, civilizations doesn't necessarily
have to transcend, they can also go into attractors or diversify
without transcending as a whole). It is not intended as serious
futurology, even if I'm aiming for hard science fiction (O great gods
of sf, forgive me for introducing FTL! :-)

I already have. It is great luck that 60% of them are transhumanists
already, and the other have been exposed to these radical
ideas. However, some of them might have a harder time swallowing a
libertarian planet than nanotech :-)

Well, I'll volunteer to HTML-ize at least the first few topics, if we can
get some agreement on what they should be.  Here are a few suggestions that
seem to stir up controversy:

What kind of government would Extropians prefer to see in the future?
Is human-equivalent AI really possible?
How can we avoid being 'taken over' by future posthumans (especially SIs)?
Is personal security possible in a nanotech world?
Is personal privacy possible in a nanotech world?

What else should be on the list?

I love the idea.  I'm not sure if this implementation would actually get
used in this group or not - I suspect that a lot of our non-hacker
compatriots would be put off by the interface.  Still, it might be worth a
try.

IMO, the ideal would be a program like yours with an interactive HTML front
end.  Of course, that calls for some pretty significant programming - I
could do it on a PC, but I understand the ExI site is on a Unix server.

You mean 2300AD? Loved it, the only game where you really needed the
cube root on the calculator. Ah, I can still point out where the
gaming group went on a starlit sky. Spent several years with my
friends exploring it. Unfortunately it is out of print.

It might be a close binary, I haven't checked, ought to do it.  I
thought it is a rather distant binary with Zeta1 Reticuli.

Exactly. One of my favorite adages (borrowed from Robert Ingdahl) is
"The battle for the future will be settled during the coffee-breaks!"
- never underestimate the power of spreading memes into everyday
consciousness. And as you point out, we better learn about the
misgivings and give them a thought.

It is a bit like a memetic prisoners' dilemma: we can defect or
cooperate with other memes. And of course, >H is a rather borad stream
of thought, so we might quite well end up on very different sides in
some issues - which is really good as long as it doesn't hinder us

And if we are wrong, we can make a good warning example and hope the
others can save us! :-)

Renowned for their math-analytical-crypto prowess--"We don't have Crays, we
use pencil and paper."
And some of those people would have had access to significant intelligence
from the UK. 
I like the "former Eastern Bloc" entrepreneurs as a least hypothesis.

Quite. We better find ways of people to discuss and think more
rationally, and Hollian inqury might be one way. General Semantics and
E-Prime is another, and then of course being educated in logic,
epistemology and argumentation theory is helpful. The question is how
to package this in easily learned bites. I have been thinking about
writing children's stories about philosophy for some time now...

You ignored my point about you missing the beginning of this thread.  I
did not start it or make the original claim.  Mike Lorrey made the
original claim and I am responding to him.

You ignored the point that Mike is claiming 31 kids in the past 35
years.  The stats showing 34 kids per year add up to 1190 kids in the
past 35 years.  These stats still do not support Mike's numbers.

You ignored the point that my stats come from *pro-gun* sources.  I do
not think that they are cooking the statistics to make guns look bad.

You both are right.  There is no contradiction in your claims.

Bathrooms are much safer than guns.  The rate of bathroom accidents is
much less than gun accidents.  Using a bathrooms is less likely to
result in an accident than using a gun.  Bathrooms are used safely much
more often than guns are used safely.

However:
Bathrooms are used much more often than guns.  More people use bathrooms
than guns.  There are more bathrooms than there are guns.  Everybody
must use the bathroom multiple times per day, while not everybody is
involved in a gun incident or activity multiple times per day.

Although the chance of an accident per use is lower with a bathroom than
with a gun, there are more total bathroom accidents than gun accidents.
Bathroom accidents are more frequent than gun accidents.  In total,
bathroom accidents are statistically more likely than gun accidents.
Statistically speaking, a person is more likely to have an accident in
the bathroom than to have an accident with a gun.

Each side seems to be assuming that these conclusions are incompatible,
and therefore that the other side must be lying.  There are no
incompatibilities here, and neither side is lying.

Oh, of course!  If they they really meant to say the opposite of what
they said, then that would support your point.  Thanks for pointing that

Brent's interactive FAQ server is interesting, but I don't see
how it avoids becoming nothing more than what the list archive
already is: an unorganized free-for-all of everyone's answer to
some big questions, and lots of questions only one person cares
about.  The thing that useful FAQ lists have going for them is
that one person or a small group does the work of organizing a
coherent document, selecting the questions and answers that
really are most frequent or most useful.

A similar thing could be done for frequent controversies.
Collect and organize a good set of them, find eloquent advocates
for each side, and include brief summaries of each issue.  But
to be useful, it has to be organized and edited.  That way, if
someone wants to discuss one of these, we have a head start.
Maybe we could even number the individual points of argument,
like Westlaw headnotes, so they could be used to shorten posts.
Ideally, people will be inclined to bring up only new arguments
to the issues, perhaps even referring to them by number, and
giving us the opportunity to update them.

Explanation (the existence of a god with certain quirks explains
certain things, even if he doesn't do much else. For example, Thor
wasn't the personification of thunder, but thunder was due to his
battles against the giants). 

>From an applied theology point of view, what kinds of gods could we
build or become?

Creators are of course possible, either for our own virtual worlds, or
for real physical systems (terraforming, artificial civilizations) or
even baby universes.

Teachers - hmm, maybe we really should drop off to the jungles of
Papua or Washington and teach the benighted natives the Civilized
Arts? :-)

Savior - from what? The problem here is that saving people from normal
threats is heroic rather than divine, the threats need to be
impossible to solve without a deus ex machina. Deflecting
dinosaurkiller asteroids (what was the spaceship in _Deep Impact_
called? :-) might do. 

Judge/Referee - Anyone remember the nanarchism ideas? That system
would in many way be a divine judge protecting mankind.

Punisher, Destroyer - all too easy, not certain it is a good idea -
learning can be done in many ways.

Benefactor - The Extrosattvas? 

Ideal/personification - Sounds like the ideal personas we strive to become. 

Forgiver/redeemer - Hmm, I have a hard time figuring out what this
really means. I can understand giving comfort and help, but the whole
judeo-christian redeemer stuff escapes me. Guilt cannot be moved
around like a fungible object, and sin appears to be a personal
phenomenon that can't be modified by anybody but yourself. So I don't
understand what the redeemer is to do.

Master/ruler - how many here love playing Civilization and similar
games? I suppose there is a will to power in us. But it is not clear
that this liking of ruling over people is something worth keeping, it
is really a remnant of primate social hierarchies. It might be that we
should get rid of it.

Companion, Guardian- "Hi, I'm Jup, your pocket-sized Jupiter
Brain. OK, more of a meteor brain..." :-)

Supreme Power - The Omega Point? 

Eternal - tricky, since it necessiates working outside time. It cannot
be built in an ordinary sense, but it might have a cause and that
could be reachable.

"I'm standing here at the main dome of the Aeternitas Project, waiting
for the Aleph moment. At the center you can see the model of the
Anselm Device; the real structure is too large and too far away to see
properly in the sky above. As you can see, the collapse is almost
finished - 20 neutron stars will combine in an exact configuration,
releasing their load of picotech devices, wormholes and quantum black
holes. For a hectic femtosecond outside time just at the edge of the
Singularity they will reach into the pregeometry and induce a special
seed pattern - or rather, if everything works as planned, it will
already exist there when they do it. The seed will force the
pregeometric structure into a pattern supporting Turing computation
and the information package added to it will be processed - outside
time, on a scale below the quantum foam. The time is now... the
neutron stars are breaking up like flowers, the horizons reach out and
- THERE! The Aleph moment may have happened. Dr Aquinas, is God
online?"

Well, this leads into something I've observed before about the difficulty of
sublight space travel.  Simply put, interstellar colony ships are much, much
harder to build than most people seem to realize.  I would argue that they
are only possible if you already have very advanced automation, including
free-roaming robots.  You also need a huge energy source (either antimatter,
advanced fusion & Bussard ramjets, or really huge laser arrays back home).
In the real world, I expect this combination will actually be harder to
achieve than basic nanotech.

Mind you, I've ignored these problems myself a time or two in the interests
of a good game concept.  As you pointed out, its kind of hard to hang a
story on a fast exponential curve.

Your method of thinking about this is a bit odd, I must say. I think I
follow what you're saying, but I don't agree. If I took a loaded gun with me
every time I went into the bathroom, what would kill me? The tiles or the
gun? Or am I just getting kooky?

Yeah, that's the one.  Got the name mixed up w/ Twilight 2000, another game

My understanding is that Zeta2 has a close, dim M companion.  I think the
most recent version of Gliese's Near Star Catalog mentions this as a note.
I was deep into this stuff a while back; I compiled my own excessively
detailed version of the Gliese near star catalog with XYZ coordinates and
distances to all known stars w/in 50 ly.  Was working on merging this with
the much larger PARALLAX catalog, but never got around to finishing it.  I
also have very detailed info on nearby binary systems and so forth if you're
interested.

My 2300/Cyberpunk campaign revolved around a quasi-statist organization
called the Interstellar Trade Authority, a sort of super-GATT created by
Terran megacorps to manage the world economy.  (The ITA was actually based
loosely on the Terran Trade Authority described in a fantastic series of
books by Stewart Cowley; see
http://www.geocities.com/~banksp/Rec/TTABooks/TTABooks.html)  The characters
started off as agents of the ITA, but after spending too much time in the
perimeter colonies came to see the ITA's darker side and rejected the
organization (and not without a fight).

I kinda cheated with regards to FTL.  Borrowing an idea from Sagan's
*Contact*, I postulated that an alien race had long ago constructed a
transportation network to connect interesting parts of the galaxy.  The
closest gateway to Earth was the so-called "Nemesis" that supposedly orbits
the sun outside the Oort cloud, periodically kicking comets our way.   FTL
travel was really cool.  From the outside, Nemesis appeared as a dull black
globe 1 km in diameter.  Though it looked solid, a ship could pass across
its surface.  From the inside, the system had a bizarre, hypertoroid
topology and allowed travel both through space-time and to alternate
universes.  (That was a big part of the game; the characters eventually had
to comprehend that they could never be sure which was "their" universe, and
that the concept was really meaningless anyway.)

Yes, people would attempt removal, just as they remove ankle monitors.  And yes, people would attempt circumvention (just as they get friends to blow in their installed auto alcohol breath testers).  Such an implant should be reserved for the most serious crimes, such as serial rape or child molestation, assault which causes permanent maiming or incapacitation, and attempted and actual murder.  And no, I don't think it'll ever be done; I proposed it as a thought experiment.

You're just being kooky.  You are indeed more likely to accidentally
slip and smash your head on a tile than you are to accidentally
discharge a firearm fatally.  Firearm deaths are high, but they are
overwhelmingly NOT accidental.  They are from people very deliberately
pointing and firing with the intended result.

Hmm.

If you put that question to the man on the street... No, strike that
out. The man on the street probably hasn't had any previous exposure to
the concept. Let's say you throw that question to a bunch of SF readers.
(Since somebody a couple of days ago suggested to broach >H topics to SF
lovers.) I'm pretty sure you'll receive these kind of answers:
- gengineered species derived from humans: NO
- AIs: YES
And I mean the upper case.

I've only lately realized the implications, but in SF circles the
Asimov-Campbell Robot Laws seem to be taken for granted. If we manage to
build AIs, they as a matter of course *must* have the three laws
hardcoded. Which in effect means they are slaves. On the other hand, the
idea to do something comparable to humans is likely to be met with
revulsion.

Interesting dichotomy. I wonder how people will react when the
contradiction is pointed out to them.

Personally, I have no idea what "ethical" means. Generally, I'd like to
be able to create specially designed sentients, because it probably
allows nifty things to be done.

I know what you mean, but this also seems to imply
that Hayek, and Austrian economic theories more
generally, are now mere historical trivia.  Perhaps
this is because, as Robin has indicated in the past,
Hayek's Problem of Knowledge, rather than being a
fundamental constraint or pervasive element of
systems at all levels, is slowly being overcome by
"better tools", ie, models. 

(Perhaps this makes current 'Austrian' economists
'zombies'  in the sense that they lack the
'consciousness' of enlightened data-gathering and
modeling methods -- you're likely to meet more than a
few of these 'ghosts' at GMU -- anyway,

This is yet to be determined. It also depends on what you define as 'gun
use'. I say since it is a deterrent device, any time it is within close
enough proximity to be available for quick deployment for defensive use, it
is being used. Eric seems to think that its only being used when it is
actually being fired. He also ignores the fact that when a gun is actually
either brandished or fired, it is in a situation fraught with a prexisting
danger that the gun has no bearing on, only in that it can change who the
danger becomes applied to. Being faced with an attacker with a knife you are
far more likely to be killed if you do not have a gun, while the attacker is
much more likely to be killed if you have a gun. The two deaths are not
equal in my mind, while anti-gunners count them as if it does not matter who
dies and who lives. This is obviously fraudulent science they are engaged
in.

Lets see, there are 200 million guns in the US, posessed in 60 million homes
(for 3.3 guns per home). There are less than 100 million households in the
US, with an average of 1.25 bathrooms per house. Thus there are fewer
bathrooms than guns, although the guns are owned by fewer people than those
who own bathrooms. Because there is universal bathroom ownership, all
understand the benefits of bathroom ownership, are comfortable in their
bathrooms, some even like their bathrooms, they even sleep in their
bathrooms, and some even collect bathroom fixtures as hobbies, it is hard to
get people to admit that their bathrooms are more dangerous than, say, a
gun. They are emotionally attached to and invested in their bathroom. They
could never imagine that their bathroom could be turned against them, betray
them in such a way as to seriously injure or kill them or others. They think
that the right to ones bathroom outweighs the potential risks, if there are
any.

Since only 60%+ of households own guns, the remaining 40% or less who do not
own guns don't seem to develop the same sort of feelings about guns like
they already do with the bathrooms they own. However, if bathrooms were
subject to the same sort of regulations that exist and that anti-gunners
would like to see, we would have the following:

A) most states would outright ban public restrooms, or mandate that only
people who have undergone background checks can use them. public restrooms
are one of the highest risk public locations for violent crime.
b) there would be a waiting period and a background check by national FBI
(Federal Bathroom Inspectors) computer system before a person could purchase
a bathroom or bathroom fixture. If you called a plumber over to fix your
sink or toilet, would would have to go through the same process before you
can use your bathroom again.
c) states would require that all people who wish to use a bathroom must take
and pass a bathroom safety course.
d) the federal government would pressure bathroom fixture manufacturers to
provide toilet and shower locks with every purchase.
e) anti-bathroom lobbyists would push for laws mandating that toilets be
manufactured such that only their owners could use them, that they not
really flush all that well (true enough), and that you couldn't flush
goldfish down them any longer.
f) people who were attacked by assailants in bathrooms would sue the
manufacturers of the bathroom fixtures for being in the room and because the
assailant bashed the victim's head against the sink.
g) Democratic Party controlled cities across the country would file lawsuits
against fixture manufacturers for the health costs imposed on the cities by
slippery tiles and shower stalls, and sinks that were too hard when a person
hit their head on them.
h) convicted persons will never be allowed near a bathroom and if they are
found in one, it will be a federal felony.

Now, in this theoretical society, only 60 million of the 100 million
households would actually have bathrooms, so you would get the following
reactions:
a) those people without bathrooms would say:
1) why does anybody need a bathroom anyways?
2) why would anyone need more than one?
3) an outhouse is all you really need. Automatic flush toilets are just too
out of control and complex and dangerous. Law abiding citizens have no need
of such technology.
4) I feel perfectly comfortable just hunkering down and crapping anywhere in
public. Its much safer than using public bathrooms. Especially out in the
country, there really isn't a need for bathrooms, there is so much wide open
space there.
5) bathrooms are just built to be dangerous
6) well the Europeans have no bathrooms, they haven't had any since the
Nazi's took them away in the 30's so it must be good to not have bathrooms,
as those Europeans are obviously far more culturally and socially superior
and advanced over us. They don't even wipe themselves. Thats really cool.
7) the Australians have banned all bathrooms, so it must be a good thing.
They just crap all over the rabbits down there.
8) the Japanese have never been allowed to have bathrooms, which is why they
have those great martial toilet arts of hand to hand crapping.

There will also be those bathroom owners who won't admit to owning
bathrooms, for fear of the outrage from their liberal peers. Men won't tell
their wives that there actually is a bathroom in the house. Many bathroom
owners will buy into the bathroom control memetic hype, thinking:
1) "Well, I know that I'm responsible enough to handle my own bathroom, but
I don't trust anybody else in one."
2) "Some people just should not be near bathrooms."
3) "its those automatic flush toilets that give all bathroom fixtures a bad
name."
When someone asks to use your bathroom, you will first decide whether you
know them well enough, then you will bring them into the bathroom, go
through all of the fixtures, making sure none are loaded, and ensure that
the person knows how to use them all.....

I just completed a grueling academic job search, and will
probably stay where I'm going (George Mason Univ econ) for
quite some time.  I learned something in the process:
the biggest barrier to innovation in academia is "fit."

In academia most all jobs are publicly announced, and 
someone reads all the applications that come in.  In 
economics it is all synchronized; job ads come out in
October, applications are due about the end of November,
and then each school interviews ~20-30 candidates for 
~ 1/2 hour each at the annual ASSA conference.  Each 
school then picks ~4-6 candidates to fly out for a day
long visit.  Then a lucky few get job offers. 

Last time around, two years ago, my advisor insisted
I send out no more than 70 applications.  I had ~ 8 ASSA 
interviews, but no flyouts resulted.  I did get some 
political science flyouts, at Northwestern, MIT, & 
U Rochester, but no offers there.  Luckily I got this
postdoc, because a theorist here believed my theorist
advisor that I was sharp.  

This time I got no political science flyouts, largely
I think because one of my references was six weeks late
with his letter.  I hoped to do better due to my Berkeley
affiliation & new health policy expertize.  I sent out
200 applications and got ~23 ASSA interviews, many of 
them health related.

But the flyouts I got were not health related, and were
due to people I had know for a long time.  Hal Varian
here at UC Berkeley and David Levy at GMU had long liked 
my idea futures concept.  I had worked with Dave Porter 
at Caltech before he moved to U Arizona.  Pat Parker at 
Naval Postgraduate School was told great things by my
futurist friends.  I got flyouts at UCB, GMU, UAriz, NPS.

At lots of places there were people who liked me and 
thought I was smart, interesting, and productive.  But 
they had trouble seeing how I'd fit with the rest of 
their group, in terms of working on similar problems,
and how my research fit into standard categories.  
At GMU, however, the influential and widely ranging 
Tyler Cowan saw my breadth as a strength.  They are 
making GMU into, in part, a place for broader ranging
economists who don't "fit" elsewhere.  

One lesson is this: if you see an idea/approach you admire
that academia seems to neglect, don't conclude this is 
because almost no academics think the idea interesting or
promising.  Maybe it is because this approach doesn't
"fit" anywhere, even though lots of individuals grant
its merits.  Each journal thinks it should be published
somewhere else, etc.  

And if you have been doing such oddball research, perhaps
your main hope is to develop personal relationships which 
convince specific academics of your ability, and then to 
hope that one of those people will be at a group adopting
the contrarian strategy of collecting rejected oddballs.

If the New Ager believes that crystals have lots of healing power, 
and I believe they don't have lots of healing power, then we have a 
factual disagreement. At least one of us is factually mistaken; I 
claim it is him.

But what does it mean for a proposition to" be in the mind"? It's 
a big philosophical question (see e.g. W.V.O. Quine). But let's 
not get into that.

I certainly agree with that.

I don't understand that sentence.

Better for what? (I do think they are morally very superior to, say, 
the values of Hitler, if that's what you are asking.)

I think the values can be achieved if enough people share them and 
are smart and careful enough. I don't think there is a 
"contradiction" between any of the values I mentioned, although cases 
could in principle arise where they could not all be completely 
achieved, so that a tradeoff had to be made. (A more accurate 
description of my fundamental values would include some indication of 
how I wanted such a tradeoff to be made in different possible 
situations.)

Maybe, in such a situation, I would conclude that I had misdescribed 
what I had in mind. It is not so easy to say exactly what one would 
want, if one could have anything one wished for. It requires some 
considerable introspection, and mistakes are always possible.

That's what you think. Others (e.g. Moravec) have a different 
opinion, and I think it is an open question. My feeling is that by 
being careful enough we can probably avoid making mistakes that 
would lead the AIs to attack and exterminate us humans.

Remember that we find such planets because they are the only ones we can
currently find at all. We can only infer the existence of very large
planets so close to their star that they affect it enough for us to
notice. There is no reason to believe that the planets we find are in
any way typical.

Well, I am not sure what the link is too strength or weakness, and taken as
written, i would suggests that changing one's opinion, per se, is a sign of
nothing at all: the question is why did you change your mind, and also, in
terms of the current thread, did you at least have an opinion, or are we so
willing to change our minds that we never assert anything.

Because that is politician's breaking promises. Scientists in fact promise
to never become hide bound and when they do we accuse them of being
short-sighted and illoyal villains too.

I believe that mostly people don't want to and in fact can't discover this,
but that is beside the point.

I think an appropriate metaphor here is "the man who shot liberty valance"
Jimmy Stewart is a lawyer who becomes a Senator - "the man who shot liberty
valance". Now famous and a legendary man he is thoughtful and reasoned,
articulate and intelligent. But in fact he would be dead without John Wayne,
who was, in fact, the man who shot Liberty Valance.

In some ways this discussion is like

<amydalae off> (As Anders would say ;-)
the founding of Israel
</amydalae on>

There were very distinct schools including rabbinical schools who believed
that Zion would be founded by god when god felt like it and that the
Zionists were wrong (many of these people thought that the founders would
lead to the annihilation of the Jewish people).

Among those fighting for Zion were again many schools. The Stern gang
couriered money and robbed banks to fund the movement and arms. They
brutally assassinated many British Officials. Many thought these people were
wrong. Then there was a moderate proto-army (which also ran guns past the
British blockade and assassinated officials), and there was a talk talk talk
group.

All, in this case, had a common goal:foudnig a Zionist State. They also had
many goals _not_ in common. These underpin many of the internal frictions
within Israel today, particularly regarding the role of the secular state,
one reason why I personally consider atheism a sine-qua-none for people who
are part of the future.

I believe that a world of free, autonomous, self-transforming, biotech
trans-humans will not come into being without all of of the above mentioned
schools: violent defense of particular rights, modest but aggressive defense
of more general rights, and constant and indefatiguable talking, and
explanation, and observation. Just the latter will not, IMHO, get us there,
anymore than just talking would have created Israel. Not continuing to talk,
especially to one another, will equally fail.

How's that for balanced radicalism ;-)

After thinking this over, I realized the problem is in separating the
kernel of truth from the usual news agency clutter.  Whereas I
would not rule out random goofing with a satellite by sending spurious
signals, the way it was originally reported was that miscreants
had kidnapped the system, changed its course (?) and were holding
it for ransom. {8^D   To do such a thing would be far more difficult

It gets hard to detect essential differences when one studies historical facts.  Menachem Begin was a terrorist/freedom fighter for his people, who became head of a state, as did Nelson Mandela (after 24 years in prison).  Yassar Arafat is on the verge of doung the same thing with Palestine.  Ocalan, the Kurdish guerilla leader, would seem to fit into the same mold of doing bad things against bad people for good causes.  He was on the way to becoming another Menachem Begin or Yassar Arafat, if the 30 million Kurds (the largest ethnic group of stateless people in the world) had been able to carve out the autonomy for their historical homeland which they had been repeatedly promised.  The Turks are sure to kill him, if only to forstall the possibility that he would eventually become another Nelson Mandela.

We can only find large planets, but they don't have to be close to the star.
We could see a Jupiter in a Jupiter orbit; the astronomers have been 
surprised that they didn't.

No.  What is needed is not the capacity to manipulate atoms deftly, but the
ability to shove meta-galaxies around and to tweak the shape of a universal
contracting spacetime in the final zillionsths of a second of its plunge
toward a Big Crunch.  (Note `a la Tipler', above.)

ET's being such an open field for speculation, I suppose that we ought to
appreciate anything that sets out some evolutionary hypothesis as to why none
seem to be near. However, I can't help but think that that this is fairly
"nebulous" (excuse the pun), if there isn't yet much of a glimpse of what the
initial "bottleneck" resource might be (let alone a good idea as to why
succeeding settlement waves would be so slow or inefficient as to apparently
miss our solar system altogether). Trying to imagine what the "fast travel"
resource might be could be entertaining, though; is it naturally ocurring
nuggets of antimatter, perhaps, or magnetic monopoles, or mini black holes?
Maybe the capturing of this exotic whatever-it-is has helped to sling some of
those giant planets into the odd orbits that we keep finding? Come to think of
it, maybe neighboring planetary systems are rigged with dangerous booby traps
to this day, we could be living on the one relatively safe spot in a vast
"anti-competitor" minefield of some kind. That would be double jeopardy for a
second or third wave, with the most powerful star travel resources gone *and*
maybe you go "kaboom" if you try to make use of the leftovers, the front
runners in the Great Race desiring not to be overtaken, you see.

Compared to such grand space-trashing ideas, I still wonder if a relatively
mundane idea might be worth thinking about, namely the chance that
intelligence might survive preferentially on quite "large" planets as compared
to the Earth. If a solid planet with the Earth's density were twice as large
in overall dimensions, it would then have eight times the mass of the Earth.
Presumably, the atmosphere would then almost have to be much thicker, giving
any surface inhabitants much better protection against radiation events than
we have. I understand that small, long-lived stars are prone to solar flares,
and we've talked about gamma ray bursters, too, so maybe you really *need* the
extra shielding if surface dwelling technology builders are to generally have
a good chance of evolving.

Now, the "catch" to this large planet business is that actually getting into
outer space should be much harder for the ET's involved than it is for us,
and, even for us, space travel hasn't been a tremendously easy thing to
develop! For a planet that's 2X the size of the Earth, all around, you'd
expect the escape velocity to be *twice* that of the Earth, since you have
eight times the mass divided by twice the radius, that's an energy gravity
well *four times* deeper than *we* have to deal with. Going further, if a
planet were 3X the Earth's size dimensions, you'd get a 9X deeper gravity
well, meaning that the escape velocity would relate as the square root of 9,
so escape would be 3X the speed for a 3X larger, solid, planet. Maybe 3X is
going a bit far, that's getting more massive than Neptune, but you get the
idea. Even if we're talking only a "2X Earth" planet, it could be tremendously
discouraging for even a very sophisticated technology to break out of that
kind of gravity well, certainly it would be *enormously* difficult to launch
the way we do, with chemically fuelled rockets! Now, could this almost be a
SETI searcher's dream come true?  Question: where are the ET civilizations?
Answer: why, stuck on their respective planets, furiously beaming out high
powered radio messages, because that's all they *can* do!

Hi,

I found a review of this book in rec.arts.sf.reviews: "Beggars In Spain". I
know  it used to be available via Laissez Faire Books, so it might have some
libertarian leanings. From the reader's summary, the theme seems to deal with
posthumanism- in this case, the creation by genetic engineering of a race of
sleepless beings with all the time in the world to improve themselves.

Has anybody here read it?

Jean-Francois Virey



Beggars in Spain by Nancy Kress
	Review Copyright 1999 Mariann T. Woodward

What would you do if you never needed to sleep?  If you never got tired?
How many of us say, when overwhelmed with life and its activities, "If
only I had an extra so-many hours...?"  For Leisha Camden, the question
begets an obvious answer: Apply oneself to become the best and brightest
in everything.

Such is the premise of Nancy Kress' novel, BEGGARS IN SPAIN.  In this
imaginary world, genetic manipulation has spawned considerable interest in
creating the perfect child.  From physical characteristics such as hair
and eye color to mental characteristics such as intelligence or giftedness
in a particular academic area, expectant parents pay for a custom-made
child.  One such family, the Camdens, opt to pursue a secretive, highly
experimental and ethically debated characteristic for their unborn
daughter: sleeplessness.  The goal, as Roger sees it, it to produce a
perfect individual with literally all the time in the world to read,
write, study, learn, and apply herself to be the best she can be.

Leisha is the result of her father's determination and her mother's
reluctance, but so is her fraternal twin, another girl.  Alice is not a
sleepless like her sister; she is a normal, reasonably healthy child, yet
she struggles for her family's acceptance.  As their mother grows
increasingly unstable, the twins quickly learn that only Leisha is deemed
special in their father's eyes.  Despite Leisha's assertions that her
sister could and would be just as special, but in a different way, Alice
is, after all, just a sleeper.  In Leisha's light, Alice simply fades away
into darkness.

As childhood disappears and Leisha becomes an adult with numerous
dysfunctional relationships with friends, lovers, and family, so begins
the trouble for other people like her in Kress' world.  Normal people are,
of course, threatened by the sleepless and their abilities.  By not having
to sleep eight to ten hours a day, the sleepless use the extra time to
study and practice until they perfect and master a skill or lesson.  As
Leisha moves further into adulthood, segregation and restrictions become
prevalent as protest groups form to tear down the sleepless' dominance.
The sleepless retreat into their own world, first on private property,
then orbiting the planet on a space station.  What began as a parent's
desire to see a child have all that is possible becomes, quite simply, a
war between the haves and the have-nots.  The beggars.

I just don't have time for this discussion right now, so just one question,
and one point:

Question: How do you figure that "not requiring X" = "rejecting X"?

Point: Reason is without foundation. (See Bartley's book or my version in
the Pancritical Rationalism essay.) Does that destroy rationalism?

Okay, I'll give up some much-needed sleep to address at least some of the

I find this both amusing and instructive. It's amusing because, if Anthony
Garcia had his way, *you*, Mr. Virey, would not count as an extropian. So
you cannot completely agree, unless you want to embrace a contradiction.
While I find this amusing, its also instructive. It should at least hint at
why in the maturation of my own thinking, I've broadened the scope of
extropianism, while retaining its distinctiveness. The essence of extropian
thinking is a set of general values and attitudes, not a set of required
beliefs about means. Libertarianism--whether the anarchist kind (with or
without copyright laws? with or without a possible monopoly PPL) or the
minarchist kind (actually there are several varations on minarchism --
which ones do you demand that we rule out?)--is a means towards the ends of
self-direction and open society, both clearly transhumanist principles.

So, you are simply wrong to say you agree completely with Anthony Garcia.
The only sense in which you agree is in pushing for a narrow, ideologically
dogmatic form of extropianism. The last thing in the world I want to do is
bring into the world yet another dogma. But I can't stop you going off and
creating one. Anthony can set up his own anarchist-extropian group. To
join, you have to agree that, according to his definition of a "State", you
do not and never will agree to it. (Is it okay to pay taxes now, under
duress, or to use the state-funded roads, or is that too statist?) And you
can set up your minimal statist extropianism, which requires people to
agree to exactly the role of government you see fit. (Where do you draw the
line in minarchism? Can the state provide police, or must this be
contracted out to private companies? Can the minimal functions be funded by
taxation, or do we have to hope that a lottery or voluntary contributions
will fund it?)

Since you seem to like logic (at least the idea of it, if not the careful
appliication of it), let me note again that "not requring X" does not equal
"rejecting X".

Ah, I see, let's throw together three definitions of different terms, then
create a new definition of "extropy". Then let's attack that, rather than
the real definition. Ever heard of the term "straw man"?

>This gives us:
>
>"Extropianism is the evolving transhumanist philosophy of those who seek to

The actual (current) definition is: "the extent of a system's intelligence,
information, order, vitality, and capacity for improvement." The definition
of "extropy" contains no reference to "whatever set of ideas is currently
held by..." any set of people. Don't conflate the defintion of "extropian"
with the definition of "extropy". The former is defined in terms of the
latter, not the other way around. Either you're not thinking carefully, or
you're deliberately obfuscating the issue.

>In other words, this philosophy is defined as whatever set of ideas is
>currently held"...>

If we currently happen to all like tomato soup, I suppose that makes
"liking tomato soup" part of what it is to be an extropian. What's gone
wrong? See the preceding paragraph.

"Extropy" is not, and never has been presented as a technical definition of
a real quantity that can be completely objectively quantified. I have
always striven to make this clear in my writing and in all interviews.
Extropy is not intended to be identical with negentropy, whether in an
information theoretical or a thermodynamic sense. Extropianism is about a
set of attitudes that embody desires to improve in fundamental ways using
effective means.

Still, of all the points you make, this one at least has the merit of
hinting at a possible way of improving the definition and Principles. I've
been considering a more systematic and hierarchical derivation of the
current principles from fewer underlying ideas. However, I feel much
reluctance to heading in that direction, since it lends itself to monistic
and dogmatic system building.

>This is not logical nit-picking, as I know some members of this group

Here you make one of a number of unsupported sweeping generalizations. I
find it hard to think of a group that has greater respect for logic than
extropians. Go ahead and feel you misguided contempt. But, please, don't
present *contempt* as a requirement of your version of transhumanism.

>For instance: If I classify the books in my library by colour, I have

>standards.

No. Your act increases extropy only if the resulting order is useful to you
in ways that improve your life.

 If I download all sorts of crap from the Internet and store it on
>my computer, I have increased my computer's information

Obviously your intention is to attack, not to be constructive. How does
downloading "all sorts of crap" increase the values set forth in the
Principles? A definition is a compression, not a complete explanation.
That's why you need to read the Principles. If you read them, you should
understand why your example makes no sense. Filling up your computer with
self-defined crap is the opposite of extropy: it costs you time and money,
it may make it harder to be productive and to find the useful stuff amidst
the crap you stupidly downloaded. This example is so silly, that I will say
no more.

Context, context, context. Anders has also responded constructively on this
point. Extropian thinking does not value just any kind of order in any
situation. That should be abundantly clear to anyone who has read any
version of the Principles or other essays on the topic of spontaneous
order. Extropians want to overcome limits to achievement, to intelligence,
to creation, etc. Chaos, in a certain context can help this (e.g. bump a
neural net out of a local error minimum). Some kinds of order (especially
coercive orders) can hinder it. The "order" in the definition has to be
taken in the context of the Principles.

>"Extropy" is therefore an invalid, self-contradictory concept. 

No, but your argument is an invalid, self-contradictory, and confused
argument that attacks an imaginary position.

This is why the
>philosophy will soon dissolve in the kind of nonsense that has almost always
>been coalescing around it, and why there's no way we can save it from such

More unsupported generalizations and assertions. What is all this "trash"
that has always been coalescing around it? An open, evolving system will
always have to fight off the encroachment of trash (while being careful not
to too quickly through out new things as trash). I would hazard a guess
that all this "trash" is anything that you don't agree with. Like Anthony
Garcia, apparently you can't stand it when a philosophy doesn't condemn and
exclude all ideas different from yours, even if those are ideas that
propose means to the same ends.

>Extropy is a philosophy that seeks "more" of a undefined "something". 
This is
>all the irony of the principle of self-transformation (into what? a toad?)
and

Great strategy for a productive argument -- conclude with an insult. (And,
a point of fact, since you have a hard time getting things right, that's
not a "nickname", it's simply a name.

I have no doubt that, just as in the past, the definition of extropy, and
the Principles can be improved. (I already have notes for a version 4.0).
I'm sorry that your kind of "contribution" does not assist that process.

Good morning. (And, in case I don't see you, good afternoon, good evening,
and good night.)

Do *you* know what nanotechnology is?  You advertise yourself
as a nanotechnology enthusiast, so I'm surprised at your
apparent confusion here.

Your very own webpage states: 

    DEFINITION of NANOTECHNOLOGY: Technology based on
    the manipulation of individual atoms and molecules
    to build structures to complex, atomic
    specifications, by means of mechanosynthesis.

Now, Damien is discussing imaginary, hypothetical techniques for
moving entire galaxies around and changing the shape of space and
time.  Neither he nor I nor anyone on Earth has much of an idea as to
how this might be practically accomplished.  But this much is sure:
such activites would require *really*, *really*, *REALLY* LARGE
amounts of energy and would be carried out over *really*, *really*,
*REALLY* LARGE volumes of space, and upon *really*, *really*, *REALLY*
LARGE quantities of matter.

This puts it at the complete far opposite end of physical scale
from nano-scale mechanosynthesis.  For an example, our galaxy, the
Milky Way, is roughly 9,450,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
nanometers across.  It has approximately 200,000,000,000 stars in it.
Our own Sun contains roughly 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,
000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms.

Nanotechnology operates on matter one atom or molecule at a time.
It's, um, *very highly unlikely*, that nanomechanical techniques will
ever be used for acting upon objects at the galactic scale.

Hope this helps,
-Anthony

For that matter, we are all mere humans.  It doesn't mean that being
human is part of being an Extropian.  Exactly the opposite, in fact;
just because we don't yet have the technological capability to live up
to our philosophy doesn't mean we ought to lower our standards.

In exactly the same sense, I feel that all use of force and coercion,
initiatory or retaliatory, is undesirable; but I don't think the present
unfair world permits the non-initiation of force.  Even if you don't
bomb a country until they bomb you, you'll still hit children who never
did you any harm.  And if Japan hadn't attacked and the US had followed
a strictly Libertarian philosophy, the Axis would have conquered the
world at a leisurely pace and then moved on to us.

Listen to those misgivings.  A deep philosophical justification of
Extropy from first principles is a nice thing to publish on your own
account, but those of us who have our own complex personal philosophies
would almost certainly disagree; it shouldn't be part of the
*definition*.  Besides, what if you're wrong?

Reason WAS without foundation.  Excerpt from a forthcoming work:

--

2.3:  How does the logic ground in conscious experience?

This question comes to you courtesy of the really sharp doubters, people
who assume nothing; people who doubt that the physical Universe has any
existence outside their own minds, people who in fact doubt the
existence of their own minds, people who wonder if maybe the whole
Universe came into existence a second ago complete with false
memories. 

Let's start with the qualia.  "Qualia" is a technical term philosophers use
to describe the redness of red, the mysterious, indescribable, apparently
irreducible quality of redness that exists above and beyond <FONT
color="#FF0000">.  (There is a certain amount of dispute over what
qualia are or even whether the term refers to anything.)  I'm using the
term "qualia" to refer to your immediate conscious sensations, your
now - the movie screen, as it were, of your Cartesian observer, before
all rational interpretation.  (I am also referring to the qualia of any
rational interpretation you may be doing, but I'm not yet admitting them
as rational interpretations.  Got it?) 

It's an interesting question as to whether or not you can doubt that you
are right now experiencing the sensation of redness.  Some people
would say no.  I would say yes. 

Even supposing you do doubt the qualia, however, I hope you will agree
that there is not a different set of qualia which are more plausible.  So,
while you don't have to assign a 100% probability to the existence of the
qualia, there isn't anything else whose existence you are more sure of. 
Thus, choices made using this set of qualia will take precedence over
others. 

Next, we consider the question of time.  You have what may be the
illusion of existing in time.  You have the qualia of memories of the
past.  You have the qualia of memories of continuity - that you thought,
"I'll have to make this choice", and then you did make the choice.  You
have the qualia of memories of predicting the immediate and far future,
and the qualia of memories of the immediate predictions succeeding, and
of the far predictions failing in understandable ways. 

Assuming that these qualia actually represent a past and present is a
big step, however, because it involves interpretation.  It involves an
assumption that the qualia correspond to an external reality.  Moreover,
it isn't a certain assumption.  Maybe you really did come into existence a
second ago, complete with false memories.  Maybe all consciousness is
made up of unconnected instants of arbitrary qualia.  There are theories
like that, especially in really good books - i.e., books by Greg Egan - and
you may consider them as probable as you wish. 

When it comes to making choices, however, you have to assume that your
choices are meaningful, that they have effect.  I mean, maybe they do and
maybe they don't, but in order for there to be a distinction between
choices, you have to act as if they do.  And that requires consequences,
causality, before-and-after, time.  So whether or not you think your
memories are faked, you should at least accept that you exist as a
sequence of qualia, that you have a time dimension. 

Next, we ask whetherthought is valid.  Is it worthwhile to place
interpretations on qualia, relate various sets of qualia to each other,
build up a mental model of the world?  Is it worthwhile to relate choices
to qualia?  To assume that choices will affect future qualia or the
world?  To try and select between choices on that basis?  Perhaps the
mind is a phantom - haven't we "observed" people who live in phantom
worlds?  Perhaps all thought is fundamentally flawed - doesn't our
"thought" give us great catalogs of logical flaws?  Perhaps so.  But,
insofar as the only way I know of to relate to the world is to think, I
don't know of any better alternative. 

Again, it comes down to making choices.  I don't know of any way of
making choices that doesn't rely on some form of activity in the grey
matter.  Even "instinct" counts as thought, for these purposes.  We are
not now asking whether extremely sophisticated philosophy has any
validity, but whether we should admit that the mind exists and that the
basic units of cognition relate to reality, whether truly or falsely. 
And I
answer:  Denying validity to the mind doesn't result in any particular
advice, any particular preferred choices.  We may as well act as if the
mind exists, until we have evidence otherwise; or some other way of
relating to reality; or until the alternative seems more plausible and
gives specific advice. 

Next, we consider rational thought, science and logic.  Throughout this
whole page, I've been arguing using (what is arguably) science and
logic. 
But does it make sense to assume that a world exists external from our
minds?  To create theories which provide opinion-insensitive
predictions for relating parts of observed reality, or relating past
observations to future relations?  To test theories by making predictions
and comparing them to experimental observations?  Sadly, many people
don't.  But the people who do are the ones who can make fifty stalks of
wheat grow where three grew before, build great towers of glass and
steel, vaporize cities, set foot on the Moon. 

There are all kinds of explanations for reality.  I believe in science.  I
believe in science simply because science has resulted in
technology; science displays the power to alter the world
rather than epiphenomenally explaining it, and that's what
makes it relevant to me as a means of relating choices to
future qualia.  The useful explanation is the one that tells you how to
change something.  And according to my qualia of memories, that means
science and intelligent thought. 

Any other justification is hokum.  If waving hands and uttering strange
whispers got results, and elaborate experimental setups never produced
anything useful, I would believe in magic instead of science.  If Ouija
boards produced better predictions than calculus, I would junk
mathematics.  Any other way would be superstition.

I would certainly say Damien knows quite well what nanotechnology is
about. Tweaking the universe will require operations on the exact
opposite scale of nanotechnology: not just megascale engineering to
merely move around planets and stars (as Dyson sketched it, this can
be done without nanotechnology) but to reshape the mass distribution
of the entire universe, possibly also engineering of the spacetime
itself. In the final moments of the collapse, nanotechnology will also
be far too crude - we will need picoscale technology and finally
technology acting on the quantum gravity scale. Nanotechnology might
make many of the intermediary steps simpler, but in the end Omega
Point engineering requires technologies far outside this.

Adrian,

   Instead of Savior, how about Search and Rescue (SAR)?

Indeed, it depends on what your definition of "is" is. If you choose a very
narrow category ("gun deaths in richest nations in 1994") then you can 
prove that America has a big problem with violence, when the reality is 
very different. Anti-gun logic is like that, which is why we despise it
so much; this article was clearly written to push an anti-gun agenda, not 
to tell us anything useful.

KPJ,

    Thank you for taking an interest in my theological musings.  Allow me to
share some thoughts on your comments.

1)  The Nightmare Big Brother Power - If I am following you correctly, this
Big Brother  takes charge and makes all the decisions for everyone else in
existence, using the "I know better than you" argument as justification (if
only to this being's self).  A few questions come to mind.  Is this being
truly flawless, with perfect knowledge of the right action in any instance?
And how would the being know that it IS truly flawless?  What if one of the
flaws is in your ability to detect personal imperfection?  If there were a way
to be absolutely certain that such a being were absolutely infallible (and
quite frankly, I can't conceive of such a method), than the optimal thing
might just be for it to do just that, although it could be that the act of
imposing the correct action on a conscious being may in itself be
intrinsically harmful, and thus the wrong action.  If the Big Brother being
were aware of this, it would have to determine which was more harmful,
directing the action or letting the "puny" individual make mistakes.  Of
course, our Big Brother could instead control our actions unbeknownst to us,
in which case we would have no independent existence at all and really be
parts of the mind of God under the illusion of division.  Wow, we've just
rediscovered Hinduism!  Of course, Big Brother might not be so arrogant.  The
Big Bro might believe it knows all, but admit the possibility that this is a
mistaken belief.  In which case, the Bio Brother God might decide to let us
"puny" ones make our own decisions, on the off chace that one of us discovers
something it doesn't know.  Maybe it would only play dictator in the case of
decisions where based on his so far uncontradicted knowledge an absolutely
irrevocable harm will be committed...of course, if Big Brother is all
powerful, than there shouldn't be much that it couldn't see a way to fix if we
don't  do it ourselves.

2)  A Power might not care at all if such beings were grateful or not, but be
aware that technically they should be based on the puny ones own standards of
gratitude.  You also pointed out that a Power built on human value standards
would be quite likely to meddle - probably still is holding onto that pesky
gratitude meme.

3)  When you speak of nonhuman/inhuman Powers, do you mean, "not of human
origin"  or "not humane"?  This may be quibbling a bit on my part, but it
seems to me that if an alien Power developed from social antecedants, then it
might share some "humane" values, though by no means necessarily all, nor all
interpreted the same way.  I think that there are certain strategies of
interaction that are likely to arise in any social being, and I have
difficulty imagining a solitary species achieving Power status.  A Power
descended from a social species may have some capacity for empathy, and even
though us puny humans might be stretching the limits of its imagination, it
might just be able to recognize us as kindred in a sense.  Then again, I could
be wrong.  Well, I would accept noninterference from such a being so us "puny"
beings could work on our own Powers, which might be a little more friendly.
If this "inhuman" Power were to consider us a pest, than I guess I'll just
have to go out fighting (hey, no fair incinerating me before I have a chance
to shake my fist).

Again, thanks for the comments.

Max M,

   Just thought it was interesting that there might have been a shift, and was
hoping to see what the exact nature of the changes were by comparing the new
and old versions of the Principles.  It doesn't matter how much a policy
changes over time, but only that those changes be adaptive/improvements...I
really don't know which it would be, as I am not entirely clear on the
changes, and once I am, who's to say my opinion of them would be correct?  Do
you have a copy of the original Principles, by any chance?

Is anyone interested in immortality for all?

Well, as a matter of fact, I am.  

Anders, I believe you expressed the concern that the concept of immortality
for all might encourage passivity.  I agree this is a serious concern.  For
those who would like immortality for all, I suggest the following
philosophical stance.  
1) I want there to be some agency providing immortality for all.
2) I do not have any strong proof that there is such an agency.
3) Therefore, I should have the following goals.
    a) Discover a means to provide immortality for all.
    b) Ensure that someone is providing immortality for all.

This, I believe, is an approach to the goal of immortality for all which
incorporates the Extropian principles of Practical Optimism and Rational
Thinking. 
In a way, there is an implied agreement between those who are pursuing
immortality for all, that if I don't make it, you'll bring me back.  An
existential mutual defense treaty.  And the hope is, that if enough people
hold this goal and try enough approaches, someone might find a way to do.
Indeed, someone might do it before you, but until you know that, you've still
got to work on the project.

Why are you asking a *pragmatist* for *proof*?  A pragmatist has no more
truck with "proving" things than science itself!  Absolute certainty is
the domain of mistaken philosophers.

The argument in favor of logic and reason is by no means certain, but it
is better than anything else.  If you try to deny all arguments as
invalid, you wind up with a theory that provides no useful advice, and
thus - however probable - cancels out of decision making.  That's all
anyone has to argue.

You've basically restated epistemological pragmatism here.  While I LIKE
epistemological pragmatism a great deal, it's not at all obvious to me that
you've answered the more important question of why I should accept logic.
You've provided me with a logical justification for science, but not for
logic itself.

Unfortunately, not even pragmatism can provide sufficient justification for
believing in logical "consequences."  You may discover this rather quickly
if you try it!  Consider this question from the perspective of the skeptic
of logic, much like Hofstadter's Tortoise:  OK, so I accept P and I accept
P->Q.  Why should I accept Q?  Rules of inference, you say?  Why should I
accept them?

Pragmatism can't help us here, because a logical skeptic can accept all of
our premises and still disagree with our conclusions.  Any proof we provide
in defense of logic is just a proof; if the question you're trying to
settle is "Why should I believe proofs?" then hearing a proof on the matter
probably won't satisfy you.

Pragmatism fails especially badly in this case, since there are a whole lot
of people who flat out reject the validity of logic and get along passably
well nonetheless.  A cartoonish version of Zen philosophy might be defined
by rejecting the principle of non-contradiction.  (Or, rather,
simultaneously accepting it and rejecting it, to be more precise.  And no
Zen philosophy would very well stand to being "defined," but hopefully you
get my meaning here.)  If you're going to go about saying that all Zen is
wrong, then you're going to have to provide something even more basic than
pragmatism to do it.

This sounds to me like you're going to do more than provide AN argument for

Anyway, this isn't even true.  Why can't I accept some non-rational or even
irrational claim about how I should live my life?  Why not live by instinct

I'm glad my criticism of the definition of extropianism has launched a debate
on the philosophical underpinnings of the movement.

Here are my answer to Max More's rebuttals of my previous post (I yield in
point 7, for those who want to know):

1) When I mentioned extropianism's "rejection" of libertarianism, I did not
seek to imply that libertarianism had been declared to be incompatible with
extropianism, but was merely acknowledging the fact that it had been rejected
as an intrinsic component of the philosophy and is now on an equal footing
with statist philosophies that advocate the initiation of force by the
government.

2) I do not perceive any contradiction between (1) my minarchism; (2) my
complete agreement with Anthony Garcia's position that extropianism should
remain anarcho-capitalist. I would be contradicting myself only if I
considered myself both a minarchist and an extropian-as-defined-by-Garcia,
since I would thereby be claiming to be both in favour of the minimal state
and of no state. But I am merely a minarchist, and I feel extropianism (with
which I do not fully identify anyway) has been betrayed by the recent
inclusion of statists who favour government subsidies to scientific research
and compulsory genetic engineering. 

Max More's argument is that "if Anthony Garcia had his way, *you*, Mr. Virey,
would not count as an extropian." Well I don't care! I'm much more concerned
with the term "extropian" actually meaning something than with fitting the
label. For the moment, noone *is* an extropian, as the concept is not valid.
My point was merely that I am in full agreement with Anthony's principled
position, and feel completely disgusted (as he does) by the complete political
indeterminacy (i.e. lack of principles) of the new extropianism. In other
words: I prefer an extropianism I can have honest disagreements with than one
with which noone can disagree.

3) Max More's answer to my post finally revealed to me what is wrong with the
extropian mindset as he defines it: extropianism is afraid to stand for
anything definite, because it perceives any such stand as "narrow dogmatism".
I suspect that the rampant tolerationism and subjectivism of the movement
explain the espousal of such an epistemology as "pancritical rationalism",
rather than the other way round. The most blatant admission of the
tolerationist-inspired fear of clear, logical thinking is to be found in Max's
own admission: "I've been considering a more systematic and hierarchical
derivation of the current principles from fewer underlying ideas. However, I
feel much reluctance to heading in that direction, since it lends itself to
monistic and dogmatic system building." I am beginning to understand why such
balderdash as Robert Anton Wilson's "Prometheus Rising" is still in the
extropian top ten books: a book that advises people to blow up their "reality
tunnels" by smoking marijuana *cannot* generate the kind of carefully derived,
logical system of thought which Max accuses of inherent dogmatism.

4) I resent the implications of the proposition "since you seem to like
logic". I do not "like" logic. I consider it the sine qua non of valid
thought. As for Max's assertion that extropians in general are great
respecters of logic, my own reference to "those who consider logic a
tyrannical imposition on their minds" was based on a recent post by Joe Dees,
perhaps the person I dislike most on this list (I merely said I knew "some
members" of the list who thought that way. Therefore I can't be accused of
undue generalization. I could have been had I said "most (or all) of the
members of the list" were that way.) By the way: how can contempt for those
who thus reject logic be "misguided"?

5) To my question, "If I classify the books in my library by colour, I have
increased the order of a system, which makes my act "good" by extropian
standards", Max answers, "No. Your act increases extropy only if the resulting
order is useful to you in ways that improve your life." Aha! So the
enumeration of "components" of extropy (information, intelligence, order,
vitality, etc.) is only a list of *derivative* or instrumental values, whose
actual status as values depends on whether they serve a more fundamental one:
"the improvement of one's life" (life as the root of value? That vaguely
reminds me of something.) Why don't the principles say so? And isn't there a
contradiction in holding that (1) "extropy is only to be maximized when it
improves your life" and (2) that "the essence of extropian thinking is a set
of general values and attitudes, not a set of required
beliefs about means" (since maximizing extropy itself has become a means)?

6) Max states that my "intention is to attack, not to be constructive." My
intention was to attempt a reductio ad absurdum of the definition of
extropianism, which I believe to be invalid. I have had a love/hate
relationship with extropianism for about a decade. This means that there are
elements in extropianism I find excellent, and others I find utterly
repellent. Without the former, I wouldn't even bother to criticize the
philosophy. It is precisely the mixture of the two that I find depressing.
Since the very beginning, I've tried to develop a kind of rational version of
extropianism (read: "dogmatic"), one that would be immunized against the likes
of R.A. Wilson or F.M. Esfandiary, one in which no extropian would ever
proudly claim that "reason is without foundation" or that intellectual systems
and clear-cut ideas are inherently narrow and dogmatic. The problem is that I
could find no core in extropianism that would enable me to reject the more
offensive accretions as "anti-extropian", as I tried to show in my previous
post (just as Anthony Garcia won't be able to find any principle enabling him
to reject compulsory genetic engineering as "anti-extropian"). So my intent
was indeed destructive: I tried to destroy whatever could enable allegedly
rational people to put Wilson and Esfandiary on a pedestal, while dismissing
Rand as a second-rate, dogmatic thinker.

Max refuses to discuss the examples I chose because he finds them "silly". But
their silliness was dictated precisely by the form of my argument: a reductio
ad absurdum. I don't think he managed to prove that those silly examples
(whose force lies in their silliness) did not flow from his own definition of
extropianism.

7) I think Max's most fundamental argument is his rejection of my integration
of the three definitions that open the Principles. I have just reread the
three definitions and I do realize I have made a mistake in my integration,
treating the definition of extropianism as "the philosophy of the extropians"
instead of "the philosophy of extropy". Mea culpa: Max is completely right in
saying that "The definition of "extropy" contains no reference to "whatever
set of ideas is currently
held by..." any set of people". He is also right in saying that I was not
thinking carefully at this point. But this only dissolves a secondary part of
my argument.

"Extropianism" is still the philosophy that seeks to maximize extropy, and
"extropy" is still an invalid concept- one which does not refer to a definite
set of existents. My question is: what enables you to lump together
"intelligence, information, order, vitality, and capacity for improvement"?
What do these concepts have in common- i.e. where does their "extropiness"
lie? Would I be asking for too much if I insisted on a valid definition
comprised of a genus and a differentia, and including no more and no less than
the existents it is supposed to include? (I suppose some will find such
aristotelian correctness a dogmatic imposition on free extropian minds.)

And please also answer this question: if (1) extropianism seeks to increase
"extropy", (2) extropy means "the extent of a system's intelligence,
information, order, vitality, and capacity for improvement", then "extropy" is
extropianism's *basic value*. So where do you get the standard that enables
you to decide which type of "order" (or "extropy") ought to be maximized in
particular circumstances? You do need such a standard when you assert that
"Extropian thinking does not value just any kind of order in any situation."

8) Regarding my point on "self-transformation into a toad" and "More
dumbness", I was merely pointing out that "self-transformation" and "increase"
or "maximization" cannot be values in themselves until one has determined the
end of the transformation or the attribute to be maximized. For a very similar
point, see Rand's article on "Extremism or the art of smearing". I am sorry
the "More dumbness" example was interpreted as an insult. It was provocative
and definitely irreverent, but I didn't mean it as an insult.

Sincerely,

Jean-Francois Virey.

There is some question about whether such planets exist (unless you are
including gas giants in your analysis, which is a completely different
issue).  But even granting that, there is no serious barrier to space travel
in the long term.

Certainly, a species on such a planet isn't going to get very far with the
kinds of rockets we have now.  However, there are two easy ways out of this
trap:

1) Even primitive nanotech will allow you to build rockets that can easily
reach orbit.  All you need is the ability to synthesize diamondoid materials
with a very high level of quality.  This improves the lift-to-weight ratio
so much that even a 3G liftoff through dense atmosphere would be feasible.

2) Nuclear power can also be used for rockets.  We don't build them because
too many people are afraid of the word "nuclear", but the technical barriers
are modest.  Again, 3Gs isn't enough to keep such vehicles from making
orbit.

On a more fundamental level, let me point out that both of these are
short-term solutions.  Do we really think that any possible planetary
environment could keep a technological civilization stranded for a million
years?  How about ten million?  A hundred million?

To explain the Great Silence we need more than a temporary impediment to
progress.  We need something that makes it absolutely, completely, utterly
impossible for a typical life-bearing world to produce a civilization like
what we expect ours to be in another 100 years.

I wouldn't call it a project, since it's just something I discovered
while doing something else, but anyway...  No, you didn't.  But a
foundation does not mean proof.  Nor will my foundation (or any other)
let you bootstrap from a total incomprehension of logic; if so, it could
be taught to a rock.  But, if you are capable of understanding arguments
but as yet have no positive beliefs about anything, including the
validity of argument; if you accept arguments as valid but do not accept
"arguments are valid" as valid - an anti-Tortoise problem - then my
foundation will let you bootstrap.

Note that it will NOT let you accept "arguments are valid" as certain,
which would violate the Godelian rules; and which also demonstrates that
this is not a trivial argument, since a tautology would be certain.

Because it won't work.  If it does work, let me know and I'll join you.

Yes, I know that's not what you were asking.  If you start out with a
mistaken positive belief about the validity of instincts and therefore
discount all argument, my foundation won't get you out of it.

I don't know what Jfvirey said before this, and thus I don't necessarily
agree with it, but I think he's written something very intelligent that
deserves an answer.

My position, as declared about a year back, has always been that
"extropy" should be defined in terms of Extropians; not anyone who
subscribes to the list, or anyone who declares allegiance to Max More's
Principles, but in terms of those beliefs most commonly held across Eric
Watt Forste's list of Very Extropian Persons and any people who aren't
on the list but should be.  In fact, I see no need for a definition of
"extropy" as opposed to the communal beliefs, and I have previously
complained about the tendency to use "Extropy" to indicate "Everything
good in the world."

I believe that Extropianians, to the best of my knowledge of many, many,
people, stand for the belief that sentient life can and should seek,
through the use of ultratechnology:  Complete dominion over the physical
Universe; transhuman, superhuman, and unlimited intelligence; absolute
freedom from all coercion; transcendence of any limit that can be
transcended; total knowledge of everything.

Note that we may have different definitions of "freedom", and how much
of should be sought using modern technology, but we all agree that the
U.S. government exerts more coercion on its citizens than is desirable
and that all coercion, even if permitted as means to an end, is
undesirable in principle.  We also have different definitions of
"intelligence" and even "knowledge".

But the one great constant, the most defining factor of Extropianism, is
the belief that "Ultratechnology is the only way to best accomplish my
ultimate ends."

A Libertarian believes that we should reject all coercion, all
initiation of force in the here-and-now; an Extropian may believe only
that such coercion is undesirable in principle.  But statist
philosophies are generally rejected.

Dunno who you're talking about, but I don't think that the Extropian
definition should be tightened to the point of excluding people who have
a clearly Extropian attitude, thus resulting in the formation of "In"
and "Out" Extropian cliques, or cases in which John Smith considers me
an Extropian and I consider you an Extropian and you consider yourself
an Extropian but John Smith doesn't consider you an Extropian.  Max More
has very wisely avoided this.  If you stand up and cheer at "Great Mambo
Chicken", you're an Extropian.

I believe that "Extropian" is properly used as a label for a community
that believes in other concepts with independent meaning, such as
"transhumanism" or "anarchocapitalism".  Max More may disagree, in which
case both of us would have a valid criticism of the overgeneralization
of "extropy".

Again, I believe that the proper function of "Extropian" is to define a
community, not an ideology.  We all have different standards for "clear,
logical thinking".  No one banner could contain all of them and yet
remain clear and logical.  But to exclude all dissenters from the
Extropian community would be a tragedy, "monistic and dogmatic system
building".  A group of people may make common cause, believing in
rational logic and scientific thought, but agree to disagree on what
these things are.  It's our common goals that created this community,
not adherence to an ideology.

"Prometheus Rising" is probably included on the reading list, regardless
of any claimed justification, for the simple reason that many Extropians
enjoyed the book or that some people became Extropians after reading the
book.  I wouldn't know; I haven't read the book.

Good for you!  But wait, I only consider it to be the best choice,
rather than a certainty.  Oh, well, I guess we can't both be part of the
same community.

Perhaps I would not consider him an Extropian; I haven't been reading
his posts, so I wouldn't know.

Very easily; the cognitive emotion of "contempt" could, regardless of
justification, tend to interfere with rational thought; or it could tend
to result in actions with suboptimal results.

This is exactly the problem with "extropy" as an ideology; by being
stretched to cover the quite distinct ideologies of everyone in the
community, the Extropian Principles have become overgeneralized and
badly defined in an effort not to exclude anyone.

Nothing.  I agree with this part of your criterion.

You'd be asking far too much; just as you would if you asked for a
precise logical genus and differentia on the Extropians.  Only in SGML
could such a statement be phrased, only in the Transcend could it be
written, and even then only the Powers could understand it.

If you regard it as logic, it's circular logic.  Another valid criticism.

The statements in the Extropian principles are inadequately specified to
be valid candidates for the ultimate good; they may, however, provide
valid short-term guidance using the most obvious interpretation.

For all that I don't like the Extropian Principles, they're part of what
makes the Extropian community - we have simply agreed that only
adherence to the spirit is required for membership.  And I can depart
from some principles entirely, rejecting Optimism in letter *and*
spirit, and still be an Extropian, because I believe in high technology.
 Removing the Extropian Principles would not have a beneficial effect.

Oops.  Um, this should be interpreted as "the best of my *limited*
knowledge of many, many people"; that is, I do *not* know all of them. 
Sorry for the unintentional boast.

Darn, I better check this out. Still, that might not necessarily rule
out a habitable planet (crossing my fingers :-) and might make the
night sky a bit more interesting. My co-author almost demanded a moon
for Atlantis, but I deliberately created the planet randomly using the
planet system generator. In the end Atlantis got a moon anyway, as the
atlanteans put the asteroid Jack into orbit - you can likely guess
what it is intended for :-).

Interesting. Ah, *those* books! Yes, they were part of my early
reading too. 

Our long-running campaigns had no such firm theme,
although the final and most hilarious campaign revolved about the
characters involvement with the tiny former colony Elysia. It was a
wonderful satire about power and corruption, not unlike the television
series _House of Cards_. "Our voting figures are dropping!" "Shit. We
need something to gain sympathy... what about assassinating the
Minister of Communications?" "Again?"

Fun. I like wormhole subways, they have great potential. Of course,
you might find that other species also use them...

In my Atlantis scenario, I partially handwave FTL: the ships are
equipped with "higgsrams", devices which can cause local inflation of
the spacetime foam and make quantum wormholes macroscopic. The pilots
and their quantum expert systems simply try to find a wormhole that
leads in the right direction, and then expand it so the ship can pass
through. I have had great fun developing the "Higgs field technology"
used in the system in order to make it consistent.

Hmm, exactly what problems do you see? That they need to be *big* is
obvious, you need space for a lot of frozen people, livestock and
gametes, equipment for colonization (you have to be prepared for
almost anything; most likely a portable asteroid factory would be a
good idea), space for thawed people to work, protection against
relativistic shrapnel and of course things like propulsion, shuttles
and life support. 

In my scenario nanotech is assumed to be harder than we currently
think (for some reason), it has taken much longer to reach than
expected and the simple nanotech is still rather limited. On the other
hand, fusion power got cheap surprisingly fast (it is one reason for
the presence in space, the hunt for He3).

It is fun coming up with all the groups that would colonize or emerge
on a planet like Atlantis. One of the favorites are the Rand monks up
in the mountains, and another is TRI - Transhuman Research
Institute. In 2350, they are the largest competitor to the University

Interesting. I think that this is unstable in the long run, and quite
possible not very economic. Cloning takes just as long as norma birth,
so it will take a while. It all depends on whether the clones can
provide enough revenue, and of course how much the rest of Atlantis
will trade with him - he might simply be boycotted by most others. Not
to mention what happens when the company town is influenced by ideas
from the rest of the planet. But regardless of that, this character
would have made an impression on the colony for good or ill, and that
is what interests me.

More suggestions?

I think you take an excessively narrow-minded view here.  IMHO, what Max is
trying to do is define extropianism as a process, rather than a specific set
of goals.  Extropianism is supposed to be about making life better - for as
many people as possible, by as much as possible.  It is not about telling
people what kind of life they should want.

This is simply a recognition that our current knowledge is limited.  We
don't know, in any provable sense, exactly what form of government would be
best for humans (let alone transhumans, or posthumans).  Intelligent people
with very similar values will disagree about whether our goal should be pure
anarchism, a minarchy, or even (shudder) simply a return to Constitutional
government.  But we can all agree on what direction we should move in, and
most of us will even agree on how we should judge success.

If we agree that our goal (in the political arena) is simply to maximize
personal freedom, that leaves considerable room for disagreement about what
methods would best achieve that goal.

Here I think you have a valid point, if a bit overstated.  If we are going
to have any common purpose, we have to be able to say what that purpose is.
Otherwise we are simply a group of people who enjoy arguing with each other.

However, I think you are looking for the wrong kind of definition.  We
aren't going to be able to construct a perfect logical edifice defining for
all time what is and is not "extropian".  What we need is simply a unifying
principle that can be applied to judge specific cases as they arise.

Thanks for your thoughts, Eliezer. As someone with a strong predilection
for organizing ideas, it's tempting to try to derive everything that falls
under "extropy" from a smaller number of "first principles". Overall,
though, I share your misgivings and I'm glad to hear some reinforcement of
these misgivings to counterbalance those who want to make extropianism more
exclusionary.

Perhaps I can have it both ways, as you suggest: See if I can work out a
derivation of extropian ideas from more fundamental ideas, but keep that to
myself, and retain the idea of extropianism as a somewhat looser set of
values. *Let* the ideologues and dogmatists rail against this looseness. I
think it's clear which approach is the more extropian, both in principle
and in result.

Well, now that Algernon's Law 1.1 is out, I can join in.

If an advanced civilization has published the neuroanatomical targets,
neurohacking can be done with a small 1980s shop (or even earlier, but
direct electrical current can produce chemical byproducts in the brain).
 If you're willing to take casualties, you can learn the targets on a
pretty low budget.  I don't know whether you'd want Specialists or
people with Reengineered emotions in the campaign, but, realistically
speaking, they'd be there on any Libertarian colony.  Once there are a
few high-profile successes with neurohacking, nobody is ever going to
give it up.

And on any non-Libertarian colony, or even a Libertarian colony where
they weren't welcome - perhaps due to a conflict on Old Earth - they'd
be there, but hidden.  Working for a Singularity behind the scenes? 
Kept as slaves of a few dark conspiracies?  Badly neurohacked geniuses
working at their own insane purposes?  All of the above?  Only time will tell.

Don't confuse a desire to exclude bad ideas from the Extropian
label with a desire to exclude people.  We all want more people
to call themselves extropians, but there are two competing ways
of achieving that: reduce the criteria for inclusion to the point
where people find themselves included with no work, or work to
change the minds of people to adopt extropian ideals defined
more precisely and meaningfully.

The "big tent" inclusiveness of the Republican party may be good
for getting yourself elected, but if you're trying to spread ideas,
you have to have ideas that actually mean something or else you
just get a mass of people as philosophically irrelevant as, well,
the Republican party.

A dogmatist is one who holds some idea beyond criticism, and we
have not hesitated to reject that, just as we have not hesitated
to reject deathism.  Critical rationalism does not exclude the
possibility of rejecting ideas--indeed, that is precisely its
purpose.  It only insists that every idea be honestly evaluated,
and that none be immune from examination.  Ideas can still be
evaluated, the bad ones rejected, and the good ones held as
ideals.  Idealism and rationalism are entirely compatible.

Our failure to explicitly reject statism just as we explicitly
reject deathism and luddism is not justified by a desire to remain
non-dogmatic.  If it is due to genuine philosphical doubt about
what the ideal should be, then say so.  That's a valid reason to
remain open on the issue, but it should encourage us to evaluate
the differing ideas more vigorously so that we can reject some
and move forward.  What we idealogues fear is that some may value
the lack of principle itself for political reasons rather than
honest philosophical ones, and may actively work against finding a
resolution in the matter.

I'm not too knowledgable about rocketry, but increasing the energy
requirements by a factor of two shouldn't by itself be that great
a barrier.  The energy to reach orbit is around half the energy for
escape velocity.  We were able to reach orbit in the late 1950s, and reach
escape velocity in the mid to late 1960s.  So it only took an extra ten
years or so.  If energy requirements were doubled because we lived on a
bigger planet, we could reach orbit with late 1960s technology.  I would
think that you could then go from orbit to escape velocity by assembling
a rocket in orbit, if nothing else.  While space exploration would be
more costly, it would seem to only slow things down by a decade or two.

The fundamental problem with any attempt at interstellar colonization using
conventional technology lies in the fact that machines don't work forever.
Complex machines need constant maintenance to avoid breakdowns, and
sometimes they break down anyway.  High-performance systems are by
definition highly stressed, and consume spare parts the way an airplane
burns fuel.  SF stories commonly deal with this problem by pretending it
doesn't exist (the "starship runs itself for 300 years while we hibernate"
routine), but in the real world we'll have to face up to it.

This simple fact creates a complex, multidimensional problem for anyone who
wants to build starships without nanotech.  You need to have the equipment,
manpower, raw materials and knowledge to keep your ship running indefinitely
(which is essentially equivalent to being able to build the entire ship from
raw materials).  At the same time you need to be able to achieve a
significant fraction of light speed, which means that payload mass is very
expensive.  Oh, and the whole thing needs to be cheap enough that a
pre-nanotech civilization can actually afford to build it.

Without advanced automation, your crew doesn't even have the manpower to do
routine maintenance on their ship.  Without nearly-sentient AI, they can't
possibly know enough to repair things when they break.  Without nanotech,
the ship needs to carry so many different kinds of manufacturing machinery
that you end up with a flying city.

Yeah.  Remind me sometime to tell you about the cyberpunk game where the GM
let me play a sentient AI (heh heh heh).

High performance systems are only highly stressed when under constant operation
at peak operating levels. I for one would not design such a ship that way.

Making devices and systems which are durable over a long term is merely a matter
of :
a) fewer moving parts
b) having moving parts that do no rubbing, as much rolling as possible, and any
contact must be minimal in area of surface contact and in speed, if at there is
any contact at all (magnetic bearings are wonderful things).
c) building devices with maximum performance tolerances far in excess of the
normal operating levels
d) build them modular so that those units that fail can be easily replaced by
robot systems.

One example of an ideal device is an ion or plasma engine. There are no moving
parts besides the pumps (which could be made to be magnetohydrodynamic if need
be), and are proven to be able to run on constantly, or intermittently, for
periods of years so far. For a 300 year voyage ion systems are sufficient along
with nukes for power supply and a hydrogen scoop to supply fuel.

Space probes like Voyager were equipped with redundant systems and simple 70's
era AI software to manage device failures.

Now, with nano tech it is obvious that all you really need to carry for cargo
are enough bootstrap assemblers and cad libraries in several redundant copies.
In early 21st century tech we are talking a pea-pod's worth of cargo. Then
you've just got to worry about the cryo-storage systems for the colony crew, and
the ship itself, along with survival supplies and equipment for the crew for
about 6 months. If the nanites haven't built a civilization for the crew by 6
months, then they are dead anyways.

Are you sure? I'm fairly sure that these discoveries are based on the
effect of the planet on the motion of its star. A more rapid change
is easier to detect, and a shorter year is easier to detect. Jupiter
in its orbit accelerates the Sun a lot less than it would in
Mercury's orbit.

A current query to majordomo shows we have 320 members in 1999.
Apparently, this list is not growing as expected.

Since 1993, there appeared several other lists on the
extropian and transhumanist topics, and a number of people
went there.  (see my list of lists at
http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/lists.html ).
There has been massive development of extropian and
transhumanist websites since then as well, so people have
alternative means of expressing themselves and obtaining
the materials.
Some people are only on extropian-select, or transhuman, 
or polymath lists.  I personally receive all, but do not
have much time, especially for arguing the basics.

A few hundred people is all a mailing list as a structure
can bear.  I am not even advertising or listing my Lists
page for the fear that it can topple the discussion groups.

If you want to have an active discussion forum with thousands
of people you have to do something special.

Did I ever mention filtering, alternative private moderators,
or anything like that?

If we spent half as much time on active promoting of extropianism
as we spend on debating issues, we would have taken over the Net
by now.  At this point, I rarely bother to share the proposals
even, nobody wants to work anyway (please tell me if I am wrong).

Do we want to make a social impact, or we just want to chat?

I read it.  It's by an author named Nancy Kress I beleive.  It is part of a
series.  I think it's the second of perhaps three.

It was an OK read....but I didn't get too excited about it.  I'm not sure why.
Perhaps it rubbed me wrong politically or philisophically.  I don't think I'd
call it libertarian.  In fact perhaps the opposite...

But it's been several years since I read it so my memory of it may be wrong.

Anders,

   I was just thinking that a generation gap might be in order.  Children do
not always agree with their elders.  Why not develop a few dissident groups
who oppose libertarianism, and claim a right to determine a new future for
Atlantis as their birthright.  You could have a number of differing groups
which would be a constant pain in the libertarian neck.  Maybe even some
terrorists/guerrillas.  It would be interesting to play with various tactics
and see how libertarian societies deal with them.

This may get me pegged as "kooky", but I just can't resist.

    "....You've got to stand for something, or you'll fall for anything...."

This line is from a Country song which I don't remember the singer or title of
at the moment, but it nicely sums up the idea that you have to make some
initial assumptions if you're to be able to function at all.  Maybe reality is
all illusion, but this illusion is pretty illusionary happy, and unproven
logic seems to provide some illusory desired effects.  Even the assumption
that there can be no assumptions is an assumption...anyone have a good koan?

Dan,

   If the end don't justify the means, then what does?  The results do, all of

Anders,

   Thanks for the reply; let me see now....

1) Explanation - Okay, this is true.  I guess I always thought of God as
Explanation as either mythology or evidence for a God, as opposed to that
actually being the role of a God, but I can see it the other way too.

2) Teachers - Maybe we should; though as I am limited, I would prefer starting
closer to home and working my way out....although, if we wanted a lobbyist for
DC, a God might do a fairly good job.<G>

3) Savior - From something we've run out of options for self preservation.  In
an ideal world, we would all be able to handle any situation, but this is not
always true due to our limited nature.  A Savior would be very useful at that
point, whether human, transhuman, or Power.  If I can't get out of something
on my own (especially if it is something I had no responsibility for
inflicting on myself), I'm going to call for help, and be naming savior anyone
who gives me that help with no strings attached, even if it was a piddling
matter for the Uber-Power.  Now granted, there are a small number of problems
where only a Power can aid, but I don't see that as a particularly bad
thing....means most of the time we can handle things ourselves, which I find
much more appealing.  Now, I should acknowledge that one of the major reasons
for attributing the status of Savior in religion is the specific instance of
being rescued from permanent death and/or neverending torment, a la Christ
according to Christians.  I see this specific instance of Salvation as quite
useful in case I don't manage to get past the Singularity on my own (though
I'm gonna give it the old college try).  What would be less attractive is an
entity that offered saving you from mortality for a price (obey/worship me,
read my book, sing me songs off-key for the rest of your existence, etc.),
this person I would refer to more as the Extortionist, as the being takes
advantage of my desparation to gain.  Of course, depending on what the
requirements were, I might have to start trying to find a way out of the deal
as soon as I was out of immediate peril.  BTW, I believe the whole Savior
concept is related to why they say there are no Atheists in
Foxholes...desparate times call for desparate measures.

Judge/Referee - Nanarchism ideas?  I don't remember encountering this idea
before.  Could you flesh it out a little, or refer me to a reference?

Punisher & Destroyer - Not sure I like this one either, unless you consider
destructive scan uploading as a Destroyer trait...sounds vaguely Shiva-like
(Destroy the old you in order to create the new you).  Punishment I would
prefer to see replaced with the double-edged gift (I will grant you complete
enlightenment -- of course that means you'll finally realize what an idiot
you've been).  Imagine being able to remember your entire life in harsh,
objective detail, and having upgraded heuristics which point out all the
inconsistencies in your most cherished prejudices.  Some would not welcome
such a gift (I would though, the pain would be worth the growth).

Benefactor - The Extrosattvas - Just so, I think.  I just today found Greg
Burch's commentary on the Extrosattva.  I think it is an excellent model for
Extropian (or just plain >H) Ethics, though I am not sure of the difference
between being Fair and Reciprocating, unless Reciprocity is considered a
special case of Fairness for interactions between two agencies, whereas
Fairness would be a sort of universal tangle of reciprocal relations.  Don't
worry, Greg, I'll remember you...I hope you'll remember me.

Ideal - Sort of a proof by example that such a state can be acheived; wouldn't
it be nice to know that a Power wasn't just theoretically possible, but
existed (as long as it was REALLY NICE or REALLY DISTANT.

Personification - Humans are social animals; we like to have relationships
with that which we care about.  And many humans care for abstractions, such as
Good or Power or Cats (not to be confused with 'a cat' or the musical, but
rather the concept of Cat-ness).  For some, this desire would be so strong
that they would want to become the embodiment of that abstract, or would like
to have a personal relationship with a conscious representation of that
abstract.  I admit to a touch of this particular fetish myself; part of the
reason why I would hope that a Power would use its ability to be the
Personification of Good.

Forgiver/Redeemer - Causality is immovable, but the feeling of Guilt sure is.
If you do something wrong, you will always have been the cause of that harm.
If you have a conscience, you would probably experience Guilt, and if others
had a sense of Justice, they would likely feel you are Guilty.  Now, the
matter of guilt really is a perceptual issue.  The question is, "How do you
stop feeling guilty for a previous act, and how do I get others to stop
thinking badly of me for that act?"  There are several ways to do this; wait
it out if it were a minor infraction that would soon be forgotten, repair the
damage you have caused, do other good acts which convince yourself and others
that what you did before was an abberation, confess your culpability
indicating  your understanding of the error and wish to never have such an
error happen, etc.  One of the roles of God is as a mediator of this process.
God is perfect and all-knowing, so God might expect less from you and besides,
God already knows.  So you spill your guts out to God (BTW, one of the first
ways to minimize harmful emotions is to express them), ask for forgiveness or
a way to acheive it.  Then God (or the intermediaries) tell you and everyone
else all is forgiven, or how it can be forgiven.  Since God is considered such
a wise being amongst the worshippers, this is pretty much accepted, and the
person is now psycho-socially salvaged (Go forth and sin no more!).  This can
either be a sham redemption (a restoration of your reputation alone) or it can
be true redemption (a restoration of your character).  Remember, our future
actions are often dictated by our self-image.  Granted, you don't necessarily
need a God to have a way to forgive/reform people, but it is a role that has
been assigned to God in the past.

Master/Ruler - The desire to control others is a strong one in social species
such as humanity, but as we find other ways to control our environment, some
of that desire may be satiated.  Now the question of whether there should be
retained in a Power really depends on whether you believe in the possibility
and utility in having a Benevolent Despot.  I believe Extropianism rejects the
concept of Benevolent Despotism as an matter of principle, though it might not
be completely incompatible with some models of >H.

Companion - What if you were an Atheist, and you suddenly were presented with
scientific proof of the existence of a God, and worse, you met the Power and
actually LIKED God?  I'm not talking about worship here, but what if you found
it pleasurable to be with a being with complete empathy for and understanding
of you, who could share ideas with you anywhere, anytime?  Maybe our most
asocial members wouldn't care about this, and maybe others would seek similar
experience through high-bandwidth networking (hey, wasn't that suggested as
one of the ways to Create God?), but I think this might be someone some of us
found worth having around.  "Hi Jup, its great to have you around.  So, what
do YOU think is silliest meme ever devised?  Personally, I think it is...."

Guardian - This is similar to the Savior model, but more preventative as
opposed to interventional.  Making sure a dinosaur killer never got that close
to begin with would be a good start.

Supreme Power - Nothing defeats this being's will, nothing.  The question
isn't what can the Supreme Power do...its what will it do.  Again, in a VERY
NICE being, especially one that stayed mostly out of our lives, this might be
useful.  Would pretty much guarantee success at any of the other roles this
being might assume.  The Omega Point is one model of how there might be such a
being.

Eternal - It is tricky, and does require a certain immunity to the constraints
of time.  I think it might be reachable, and at the very least worth
investigating.  Worst that happens?  We don't ever find a way to do it.  Worse
than that?  There's a way to do it and we didn't ever look for it.

Dr Aquinas, is God online? - I like that, like that a lot.

Great idea.  I vote for a powerfull et enemy (similiar tech level) and

I've been reading the web site for the proposed Kepler planet search mission
at http://www.kepler.arc.nasa.gov/number.html . There, it says that planets
between two and ten Earth masses are considered "Large Terrestrial Planets" --
this is in contrast to even larger planets, like Uranus and Neptune, which are
referred to as "Giant Cores".

One nuclear powered item that I've read a little bit about was something that
I understand a relative of nanotechnologist Ralph Merkle was involved in many
years ago, something called "Project Proteus", I believe it was, a project to
build a long range nuke aircraft or cruise missile of some kind. This had
*real*, *big*, problems with safety, understandably so given that you can't
afford to carry much shielding on a flying vehicle. Nanotech mightn't be all
that much help on the safety front when dealing with the rational concerns
that any intelligent "folks" might be expected to have about such things. This
sort of thing is dangerous *way* beyond someone worrying about the Cassini
probe's radioisotope power supply, or something like that, if you really want
nukes to propel your rocket from ground to orbit.

Well, if getting off the planet is really quite tough, it becomes hard to say
for sure. I'd tend to agree that sophisticated technology building would have
to arrive at molecular factories and nanotech sooner or later, but what if
that technology is both expensive to use for building really "large" rockets,
plus it's unacceptably dangerous for existing populations on this large
planet? If launching things via rocket is really *tough* for them, maybe their
funding always gets cancelled, or civilization falls, or just retrenches
somewhat, while they're trying to plan a space launch. Maybe things are just
tough enough that they're out of the space business repeatedly, a *lot* of
time could get eaten up that way, until they get discouraged or decide "this
really isn't a good idea". You never know with ET's, but certainly a large
physics barrier to getting to orbit would be no help.

Well, this is the difficulty, with chemical rockets you have the thrust needed
to get away from a planet, but for the rocket to carry enough fuel to get into
a stable, low, orbit, *that's* another thing. I understand that we've reached
a fundamental limit for chemical rocket fuels with current efforts to build a
"Single Stage to Orbit" vehicle to get into near-Earth space economically.
Basically, fuels like hydrogen burning with oxygen have only enough energy
content to propel a small fraction of a rocket's propellant mass into orbit.
So, for a one-stage craft, what goes into orbit must only be about 10% of the
ship's total weight, loaded with fuel as it sits on the ground. Note that the
10% "mass remainder" that gets into low orbit must include both the payload
and the entire hull of the rocket. In a single stage design, this way of doing
things may not even be successful launching from *our* planet, since, if the
technology falls just a bit short you can end up launching "all rocket and no
payload". With real nanotech, the chances of something like this working
should be much better, but a chemical rocket still can't get away from that
10% limitation, maybe only half that 10% would be payload of some sort, even
with fairly advanced nano-construction?

Now, the kicker on this is that for the planet size that I'm postulating, it's
2X the Earth's measurements, 4X the Earth's energy well, which means that the
low orbit speed will be *twice* that of Earth, with escape speeds a factor of
1.41X the respective low orbit speeds. With low orbit speed twice that of
Earth you'd need to take two nanotech "Single Stage to Orbit" craft, one 20
times bigger than the other, and stack the little one on top of the big one,
to launch a payload only 1/400th of the initial spacecraft weight into low
orbit! For comparison, the current space shuttle, being non-nanotech, but with
a much easier job, has a payload about 1/70th of the vehicle's launch mass.
For our ET's, launching one part in 400 might be *just* manageable, unless
they have other problems, other priorities at that point? For instance, there
they are, they've developed nanotech now, but the planet's heavily populated,
too many folks downrange, too expensive to launch those big tech items and
still comply with environmental regs? Depending on their exact situation,
"climbing the well" *could* be a real showstopper -- maybe technology as such
can't solve everything that Nature puts in the way?

Cool!  That number is a lot closer to my expectations.  Thanks!

I didn't realize that there were so many extropians not subscribing to
the main list.  It looks like we're divided into thirds:  One-third on
the main list, one-third on the digest list, and one-third not
subscribing to the general lists.

Glen,

I'll answer your questions about restitution in very brief, since the written
work of Barnett, et al., more completely covers the same ground.

>[I]f you had enough resources you simply wouldn't care, you could
>just do what you want and pay your way out of it.

I do not think it likely that anyone wealthy enough to readily afford the very
high costs of crime will embrace the sort of values that make crime
attractive.  Productive and cultured people have other things on their minds.
But suppose that Tycoon kills your father and you win judgement.  Tycoon
smiles and whips out his checkbook.  "Let's see, what is the going charge for
murder?  A mere $I million?  Hah!  There you go."  You cooly take up the
check, countersign it, "Payable to estate of Tycoon," and . . . .  Needless to
say, this possibility will deter the psychotic rich.

>Also, this would not stop

You lose the social credit rating that makes it possible to rent an apartment,
hold down a job, go to school, and so forth.  Or you may face imprisonment in
a work camp. 

>And lastly, there are some crimes where recompensation
>is impossible.  How do you recompensate the victims of murder and their

True enough.  But what response to crime does the best job of making victims
whole?  Certainly not imprisonment.

I don't see how this is true, but again, maybe I'm misunderstanding you.
The Tortoise clearly sees that P  .  P->Q  . Q is a valid argument, if not
sound; the question is whether or not the Tortoise should accept Q as true.
 And (this is the point I was trying to make earlier) it's hard to defend
your case that logic is the best choice when you can't use reason to do it.
 Perhaps impossible.  At any rate, I don't see that you've done it here.

If we accept that logic is universally correct, then on some level we ARE
compelled to accept certain conclusions of epistemological pragmatism.
This is, in part, why pragmatism is so useful:  you only need to make a few
plausible assumptions to get useful conclusions.  In this case, you need to
presume that logic is correct (extremely plausible, IMO) and you need to
presume that you have correctly identified the criteria that makes a
question worth asking or not (namely, whether the question has any bearing
on how I live my life, make decisions, etc.).

This is rather sweeping.  There are a whole lot of people who actually DO
live by this philosophy and claim that it works for them.  How can you
justify denying their claims in this case?

>Yes, I know that's not what you were asking.  If you start out with a

Well, Zen won't get you out of a possibly "mistaken" positive belief in the
validity of logic.  This puts us in the position of having no compelling
reason for accepting one or the other, except having already found
ourselves in one position and resisting change.

As a consequentialist, I have to agree here.  By "ends" I mean the end
results, or total outcome (in the technical sense).

T.O.,

    First, could you perhaps give me the full Barnett et al reference?  I
would be interested in looking at it.

>>You cooly take up the check, countersign it, "Payable to estate of Tycoon,"
and . . . . Needless to say, this possibility will deter the psychotic rich.<<

Wouldn't the actual deterrent here be fear of being killed in revenge by
grieving family.  The money is simply a token which enables the the family to
commit revenge....and while we're on the subject, what is to stop the Estate
of Tycoon from using those funds to then kill the avenger?  You could spiral
into a slow motion blood feud, with the "loser" being the first person to die
without someone willing to avenge their deaths.  Of course, you if there were
a gross inequity in funds, you could just buy the right to commit a massive
hit, taking out your opponent and anyone who might be willing to avenge those
killed.  Also, some might simply circumvent the need to pay by killing and
avoiding detection.  Maybe I'm going to extremes, but it seems to me this
system of restitution by itself would lead to vendetta.

>>You lose the social credit rating that makes it possible to rent an
apartment, hold down a job, go to school, and so forth.  Or you may face
imprisonment in a work camp.<<

All these are additional rights being stripped from you, and returning once
again to imprisonment.  It seems to me that restitution is not
enough....although it is a good place to start.

>>But what response to crime does the best job of making victims whole?
Certainly not imprisonment.<<

I wholeheartedly agree.  The type of responses which would be best at making
victims feel whole would be the ones that restored some measure of control
over the victims' lives, the ones which provided the strongest assurances that
this person would not trouble them again, and the responses which returned to
the victims what was taken from them (though this might be the hardest to
acheive).  Giving more weight to victims in the Justice System is one way,
ensuring that only people guaranteed reformed would be allowed back into
society (and sometimes there are no guarantees strong enough to outweigh the
risk).  Imprisonment doesn't really accomplish these goals....its trying to
find ones that do which are tough.  Thanks for the ideas.

That is like saying that democracy should be defined in terms of democrats.
Instances are not a concept. An average instance is not a concept.

In addition, Given that most of the criticism of idealists has been that
they personalize and divide things, it is humorous that the alternative
"open" view often correlates with personalized definitions excluding the
views of people who call themselves extropian and moving to
such definitions as
> those beliefs most commonly held across Eric
> Watt Forste's list of Very Extropian Persons and any people who aren't
> on the list but should be.

i.e., exactly whoever person X  wants to include.

This is an argument to authority. That is why I and others reject this whole
"lack of principle to preserve openness" argument.

People have to make decisions, and if we don't make them at the front end on
principle, then we will have to make them at the back end. At that point we
get the sort of thing that is being discussed here: decisions based on
subjective calls to power.

Which is a very firm definition with many correlates and consequences which
we can discuss rationally. Excellent! Now this puts all the cards on the
table and real openness will prevail. For instance you have included the
principle of absolute freedom from all coercion that I suggested should be
an intrinsic part of extropy, but which met with wide-spread disagreement
from several "luminaries".

Reading the recent archive, we see that this is explicitly not the case. Max
More, for instance, says highly coercive communitarian governments can be
extropian (even though he explicitly is not).

Of course, diversity is not a problem: it is a virtue (source of new ideas).

Unwillingness to subject our diverse views to explicit competitive tests IS
a problem.

Let's just treat it like science - I define intelligence as x and you define
it as y and then we can test and see is wrong first ;-)

JVirey said it best when he said

Let's argue about what it should mean, not just give it up to mean anything.

Sounds like my reaction too - not bad, but didn't excite me. In
"Beggars and Choosers" the supersleepless (the really smart
descendants of the sleepless) actually do something that might be
called quite libertarian, but it was a somewhat quick ending of the
book.

The best thing was the brief description of how tricky these
supersmart people were to deal with - they made obscure academic
four-way puns as part of their equally obscure research, leaving the
protagonist completely in the dust. At the same time their secret plan
could likely have been implemented in a much neater way.

To me, the answer is obvious.  You must tune the punishment to the crime and
distinguish levels of sociopathology. 

A crime of violence is very different from a crime of property.  Violent
individuals must be removed from society proportionately to the level of
violence and recidivism up to permanent removal for murder one.

On the other hand, it's totally counterproductive and wasteful to imprison
perpetrators of property crimes.  Here is where restitution works.  If the
perp is poor, make him do useful work in (maybe get training) in a restitution
facility.

Victimless crimes, of course, need to be taken off the books.

I am a libertarian for law abiding citizens,  but if you commit a crime, there
must be consequences.

Lately I've been noticing the efficiency of the good cop - bad cop model in
several different contexts to the extent that I'm beginning to think that it

Has anybody else noticed this?  What examples can you cite?  Are a good God

Actually I have them, but not on Atlantis as it is currently written
up. There was another colony, named Jerusalem. It was colonized by a
coalition of fundamentalist christians who believed that the lack of
Second Coming in 2035 was a sign to go somewhere else. They set up a
colony, behaved overall as you might expect, and were eventually
toppled in a coup by the second and third generation colonists who
renamed the planet Dionysos and went in the other direction, aiming
for hedonism instead. Anyway, after *that* got a bit stale, methods
for mental design began to appear. Originally they were based on
drugs, mysticism and psychological tricks, but the area became more
and more of a science. Eventually, the psychodesigners could just
about insert any personality, emotions, values or mental states in
their clients. As you can guess, Dionysos is a rather "liquid" place
in 2350, where the basis of identity is regarded as the experiences
one has had rather than personality or values.

While of course drugs and neurohacking are completely legal just about
anywhere on Atlantis they haven't advanced equally in that
direction. There are definitely people with fun stuff in their brains,
but research hasn't been that heavy for various reasons (mostly
because large projects are trickier to fund and insure than small
ones, putting an emphasis on small-scale applied science and
technology).  Other notable colonies in this respect are Arcadia,
where Culture-like drug glands are fairly common and Unity, a
religion/megacorporation/colony that broke away from the TerraNova
colony to become a borganism.

Definitely! This is in fact one of the factors that has influenced
many colonies in my scenario, with the second generation tending to
disagree or change the values of the original colonists (see my other
post for what happened on Jerusalem/Dionysos). Of course, the trouble
with Atlantis is that nobody forbids you from having these views, it
is just that it is a society with a lot of individualists that will
not take them seriously.

As I have written up things right now, there have even been a few
states. And there are definitely people who disagree with the
Atlantean society (like the Rand monks, who think evil Kantian ideas
have polluted it :-).

Guerrilas and terrorism might be of rather little use, since there is
no central government to strike against - you might blow up someone's
ranch, but that doesn't hurt anyone else. Besides, as you might expect
there are a lot of people willing to defend their land and rights
(most likely more people are accidentally hurt or killed on Gun Pride
Day than any guerrila would manage to achieve :-). So the dissidents
would have to find other means. Economic warfare, trying to set up
some kind of monopoly? 

> It would be interesting to play with various tactics and see how

Definitely. This is something I think is great with roleplaying games,
you can test out various scenarios in a controlled way.

A small note: this is a worthwhile discussion, but not directly
relevant to the early Atlantis colonization scenario where there is no
similar tech level enemy. It would be interesting to hear suggestions
for how to deal with it, though, since there is a very real chance
that in the FTL era of my scenario there will be a (slightly unusual)
enemy.

In reinforcement learning, you can either reward good behavior or
punish bad behavior. In some tasks in machine learning this results in
identical results: punishing an agent for remaining in a maze or
rewarding it for escaping has the same effect when used in machine
reinforcement learning. In this case it doesn't matter if you use a
Good or Bad Cop.  But if the situation is not symmetrical (as in
vertebrate nervous systems) then this might actually help. However, I
don't think there is a natural law saying this is better, rather it
suggests that the information received from the environment is not
just scalar but has slightly more information.

Adrian,

   Could you elaborate on what you consider the roles of the Good Cop & Bad
Cop, and what you believe are the benefits of this model.  Is this a on the
possible necessity of Evil or a Satanic type figure?

Agreed, restitutions/fines should only be used as a supplement in
more serious cases (violent offence, murder, rape, large fraud/theft,
great damage to property etc.)

Some proposals:
Murder --->capital punishment, with cryonic suspension (so that
there's at least a chance to reverse the verdict when the person
is proven innocent in retropsect).

(Btw, check out this great pro-CP page:
http://www.rit.edu/~wwl2461/cp.html
See also: http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/8169/)

When reversible suspension becomes available, it could be used
for lesser crimes instead of imprisonment.

Violent offenders should receive corporal punishment and,
depending on the severity of the offense, be either
put in prison for an x number of years (or life, in very
severe cases), or released into society with a tracking
device (ankle bracelet, for example, or an implant). This
could either be temporary or permanent, depending on
the specifics of the crime. Violent offenders released
from prison would receive the same treatment.

Fines would suffice for lesser non-violent crimes, with
prison (labor camp?) terms for more serious offences
and repeat offenders.

The victims of a crime should _always_  receive restitution
by the offender, with indefinite jail terms for those [offenders]
that refuse to pay.

False accusations should be punished very severely (same
sentence that the falsely accused would have received).

When uploading becomes available, one could place criminals
into a bible-based "techno-hell" where they are tortured for all 
eternity, or for some predetermined period, according to the 
severity of the crime.

Although such a system is used in transcendant monotheism generally (Judaism, Christsanity, Islam, Zoroastrianism), there are also examples of dual systems where "good" and "bad" do not apply, i.e. Taoism (yin/yang), Vajrayana Buddhism (yab/yum), Wicca (God/Goddess) and the psychology of Carl Jung (anima/animus).  It is interesting to note that when the division is not a "good cop/bad cop" one, it typically falls along (some version of) gender attribute lines.

Damien, why do we need room temp superconductors?  In space you
have a vast expanse of 3 degrees Kelvin space in which to radiate away
waste heat.  Our current liquid nitrogen temp superconductors might be
sufficient if we work out the other details.  spike

Well Glen, starting in my family (vis a vis my daughter) I'm the hard
disciplinarian and my wife is the softy, in our business I'm the creative
positive motivator and my wife is the penny pinching "we need more sales"
type.  

Talking to friends with children, it seems that they have the same model
although there is fluidity in who is the good cop and who is the bad cop, and
other married business owners seem to be the same.

When I was in the Weapons Dept. on the USS Hunley, we had a hard ass Chief and
a "good guy" First Class.

Maybe it's just the old "carrot and stick approach,"  but it does seem fairly
ubiquitous and thus worth expanding and generalizing.

Remember that space is also an excellent insulator, and that the
launch system (where you really need the big coils) is on the ground.

I have seen a lot of skepticism about the Y2K bug on this list,
particularly toward the possibility of the US power grid failures. 
Apparently my local power company believes that Y2K power failures will
definitely happen if they don't replace 15% of their electrical devices,
and may still occur anyway.

_Florida_Today_, March 4 1999
"Utilities fear power outages possible Jan. 1"
(Reproduced without permission)

Associated Press
Ft. Lauderdale--No matter what supermarkets, nursing homes, bank machines
and other businesses do to prepare for the Year 2000 computer bug, that
could all be for naught without electricity.

"Electricity is fundamental to just about everything we do," said Gene
Gorzelnik, spokesman for the North American Electric Reliability Council,
an industry association that has taken responsibility for getting the
nation's electric utilities ready for the Year 2000.  "We want to make sure
that the electricity is available."

Florida utilities have been scrambling to be ready for the new millennium,
making preparations so their power plants don't go haywire as the date
changes from 1999 to 2000.

Florida Power & Light Co., the state's largest electric utility has
budgeted $50 million for its Y2K program.  That program included inspecting
5,000 types of electric devices, about 15 percent of which needed to be
replaced or upgraded.

"We're confident that we will have done absolutely everything we could have
done to be ready for the turn of the century," said Nancy Brock, project
director for Year 2000 readiness at FPL.  "We do believe it's manageable."

However, there's no guarantee there won't be an outage come Jan. 1

"It's possible.  On any given day it's possible," Brock said.  "There's
always the chance that something could have been missed."

The Florida Reliability Coordinating Council, and industry association that
coordinates the transmission and distribution of power in the state, has
drafted contingency plans for the turnover.

Power companies have been testing individual pieces of equipment or systems
in isolation, but haven't had the chance to test the entire network at
once.  They will get that chance April 9 and Sept. 9.

Despite all the repairs and upgrades, other factors could influence
utilities' ability to deliver power Jan. 1.

Perhaps the biggest concern is a potential for a cold snap, when power
usage spikes as people turn on their heaters.  Even under normal conditions
that can trigger scattered outages.

Other scenarios the reliability council is looking at include disruption of
telecommunications, control systems or the fuel supply, any of which could
make running a power plant very difficult.

But there is an upside.

Jan. 1 falls on a Saturday, when many businesses are closed and power
demand is less than on a weekday.

Also, some utilities have based their Y2K plans on hurricane preparedness,
which is familiar to many Florida businesses.

Hyde Space Fountain? Sounds like a neat gadget, can I get one by mail order?
Large-scale ideas for improving on rockets abound, just recently JoSH,
sci.nanotech's moderator, suggested that the easiest way to proceed is to
build a long accelerator on diamondoid towers sticking up out of the
atmosphere: maybe you could call this the "Reading" Spaceroad, but it
certainly wouldn't be the "Short Line" :^)

You need to distinguish a court of law (in which you do have this right)
from the rest of life, in which you don't.

We none of us have any idea what anyone is saying about us "behind our

It is just a datastream. Certificates of both positive and negative

It is free. Band width will be free and people will want to push this
information onto the stream so will do it for free. For-fee layer may evolve
on top of this structure, but the core structure is free, just as speech is
now (literally and metaphorically). That is why I am so hot on
non-interventionist government - to allow these new systems to work.

Shifting this debate to the level of memes is an important advance, Anders,
thank you. It makes explicit the real competition (between memes) and also
allows us to understand that some memes may construct vehicles which destroy
(physically) the vehicles of other memes.

Now, as long as we have non-initiation of force as a core principle around
which everyone of will rally every single time, we can disagree all we like.

Therefore, regarding the memes of which you two are speaking, I agree with
both of you 100%. Live and let live, think, talk, cooperate at times etc.

My problem is with the memes which advocate first use force against our
memes. Memes which program their vehicles to cripple or destroy our
vehicles.

The memes of which I am speaking are not playing prisoner's dilemma. They
don't give you a choice about cooperating, that is the whole point.

Cooperating with these memes is death: that is the program they are running.

How do cooperate with a meme that says drugs are illegal and using them to
improve your information-processing speed or longevity is illegitimate?
(these two are both written principles of the Food and Drug Administration,
for instance).

This meme outlaws your brain from achieving extropy. It legislates that you
must die within 4 score and 10 years +- 20, and that you must not have an IQ
or intellect more than three standard deviations above the 1970 mean.

To tie this to the first par quoted above, I can see no possible future in
which these memes are future allies.


Now, the only way in which one can influence the success of a meme is via
the success of its vehicle. If its vehicle is allowed to roam the
country-side forcibly reprogramming other vehicles, incarcerating vehicles
like Larry Flynt who refuse to be reprogrammed, disarming vehicles which
might be future threats etc. I think that we have to do something. Running
away is not yet an option.

This is clearly a wide-spread (though not pervasive) meme on the list.

IMHO, defining does indeed make the _concept_ "rigid" and "excluding", but
in exactly the degree to which this is achieved, it makes _us_ flexible and
discriminating.

Extropianism can be either a philosophical construct or a scientific
construct.

Philosophically, some definitions will lead to progressive science and
others will stultify. An analogy might be Richard Dawkin's selfish-gene
concept. Richard thinks of this as rather more of a philosophical
orientation rather than a scientific theory in itself.

It has of course proven itself to be immensely powerful in generating an
entire novel, progressive, research program. Some philosophical Extropys
will be more progressive than others. I suggest that those which are
principled about the use of force and which follow this through to its
logical conclusions regarding the government as an agent of force, will be
most progressive. Exactly as Dawkins has had to publicly battle against both
religionists and the Marxist's such SJ Gould, so too this principled version
of extropy will have to battle, but, similarly, it will be most progressive.

Scientifically, extropy could be a theory of how people best will get to
their future: as such testable hypotheses can be derived and inadequate
definitions junked. Some scientific Extropys will be better predictors than
others, though  overall, this enterprise will be of limited value. Such
theories are usually better at history than futurography.

The whole point of this mail is that in neither case is being inclusive and
bland helpful.

Having an "open" concept which is inclusive of lots of opposing people and
not really antithetical to anything is like running for president - you
promise so much to so many that you end up do nothing for anyone.

This purported "openness" is also every bit as rigid and limiting as a more
precise comprehensive, and well specified definition. The more open form
rigidly disallows principled choice of action, because it has constantly to
say "oh well... let's not jump to conclusions: everyone has a right to their
own choices ... no matter what they might be."

I will respond here only selectively, and as briefly as possible. I am
writing a separate piece that will appear both in the Exponent newsletter
and in the ExI FAQ. This will lay out as well as I can, how I think the
term "extropy" should be understood and what it means to be an extropian.

If that's what you mean, then why not say that in the first place? There is
no *rejection* of libertarianism. Even now, you state things in a way
liable to confusion--it would be natural to read your above last sentence
as implying that extropianism is compatible with any statist view. I have
already shown why that's wrong, and I will go over it again even more
carefully in the separate piece I'm working on. Because of the principle of
Self-Direction in particular (not to mention Self-Transformation), only a
quite limited government is going to be compatible with extropian values.

>Max More's argument is that "if Anthony Garcia had his way, *you*, Mr. Virey,
>would not count as an extropian."

You have never said what you mean by being a "minarchist" so I don't know
who you would include and exclude. Minarchists draw their lines in
different places. Would you agree to taxation in order to finance your
minimal state? Or do you expect such finance to be possible through gifts?
Or would you require user fees for police and court services? My point was
that if "extropian" were defined by Garcia or by you, we would end up with
only one extropian. My concern is be less tight-assed (to use a term only
allowed to licensed philosophers) about this while retaining our shared
values. Laws and legal institutions are merely means to the ends that we
extropians favor. Because of our differing views about how the world works,
we will disagree about how much, if any, government is needed to foster our
goals and extropian values.


>3) Max More's answer to my post finally revealed to me what is wrong with the

No, it's afraid to become a dogmatic, narrow-minded set of required beliefs
about means. That's a difference that you have not grasped.

>I suspect that the rampant tolerationism and subjectivism of the movement

Clearly, also, you do not understand pancritical rationalism. It rejects
*foundations* for reason in the sense of absolutely certain and forever
privileged grounds of knowledge. (The argument given by Eliezer was not, in
fact, for foundations, but for support. Reason can indeed be supported, but
not given a foundation.) If you have found an ultimate foundation for
reason in the relevant sense--where every philosopher has failed--I would
be fascinated to hear it.

The most blatant admission of the
>tolerationist-inspired fear of clear, logical thinking is to be found in
Max's

Yes, I must be terrified of clear logical thinking. That must explain why I
persisted through my doctorate in philosophy and why I teach logic. Boy,
you really caught me there! Of course, I never challenge anyone's unclear,
confused thinking in my classes. I always tell them it doesn't matter what
or how they think. In fact, I'm not  really trying to clarify your thinking
about "extropy" -- that's just an illusion. [Excuse the slight sarcasm;
anyone who knows me must have choked on reading your sentence above.]

That's right, it's part of my deliberate plot to get people so stoned that
they can't think straight! I suppose the real explanation couldn't possibly
be that Wilson's book contains something of value in regard to
self-transformation?

Come now. It was a clear implication that you were talking about extropians
in general. If you were only talking about Joe Dees (whose views on logic I
do not know), why not say so? Again, you only say this when called on your
obviously false generalization.

Immunized against *everything* they have to say and *everything* they stand
for? Wow! I'm glad I don't have such a memetic immune system. I find much
in Wilson to be terribly silly, but also quite a bit that is valuable.
Perhaps I personally may have an overly fond view of Wilson, since he was
the first person to introduce me to libertarianism (for which you give him
no credit of course) and cryonics. An interesting example is The New
Inquisition--a puzzling but stimulating mixture of lots of ridiculous views
combined with some fine suggestions for critical and creative thinking. As
for FM, I actually thought your sharply critical review of his early works
was mostly excellent, though overly harsh in my opinion. I particularly
find FM off-base when it comes to economics, but how can you so totally
reject a thinker who has been such a pioneer in the ideas of transhumanism? 

These cases suggest to me not that you have a respect for reason, but an
attachment to either-or thinking -- a need to completely accept or reject
whole complexes or ideas and people.

 one in which no extropian would ever
>proudly claim that "reason is without foundation" or that intellectual

I never said that clear-cut ideas are dogmatic. It is closed intellectual
systems that I see as dangerous, and I can give you numerous historical
examples to support this. As for "reason is without foundation", again I
see no sign that you understand pancritical rationalism. You see to equate
it to the view that reason is arbitrary. (Before you respond, *please* take
the time to read either Bartley, or my essay which is on ExI's web site.)

I wish you would stop with these false and unfounded statements. The fact
that Rand *and* Wilson are both in the top ten reading list in itself shows
your statement to be silly. Extropians will differ greatly in their
opinions of Rand and of Wilson--it probably depends on what stage in life
you come across them, on whose personality appeals more, and on which of
their ideas you focus on more.

Yes, you would be asking for too much -- or rather, for something not
appropriate. I will say again--"extropy" is not intended as a technical,
theoretical term. If you want that, you already have "negentropy", whether
you use an information-theoretic or a thermodynamic definition. More on
this in my separate essay to come.

Glad to hear it.

While I'm finding many of your comments frustrating, I do thank you for
bringing focus again to the definitions and understanding of "extropy" and
"extropian". I've altered and improved them before and no doubt will again
as a result of this. That's an advantage of an open system, rather than a
closed, final system.

Onward!

I've put a draft of "What is Extropy" on a web page for comments. It will
become a FAQ answer, after a bit of testing. You can find it here:


http://www.maxmore.com/extropy.html

I will also add to the explanation of economic and political views and
extropians in the FAQ answer that I recently revised.

If one must live and work in the world, being both a libertarian and a
minarchist is perfectly rational and consistent.  In my own personal and
perhaps idiosyncratic use of the terms, "libertarian" refers to a political
philosophy derived from a set of political ideals, while "minarchism" refers
to a set of practical political values derived from those ideals.  Thus, the
libertarian ideal of non-initiation of force is expressed in the minarchist
value of curtailing state action wherever practically possible, in the
circumstances one actually faces.  An example of this in a specific historical
context is the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights, which was, by the
standards of its day, a substantially minarchist expression of libertarian
ideals.

Note that a similar mapping of terms can be used with other pairs of words
expressing political ideals and actual expressions.  Thus, "monarchism" can be
seen as a set of political values expressing the ideals of "absolutism".  The
philosophical supporters of the Crown in 16th and 17th century England were
absolutists; their institution of monarchy represented a set of compromises
with history with which I am sure they were dissatisfied.  While Tudor and
Stewart absolutists would have wished it otherwise, the Crown was required to
share power with a whole host of other political institutions, from Parliament
and the Church, to the web of common law centers of power in local practice.

A dichotomy between ideal and real must be recognized the moment one descends
from the ivory tower of pure principle into the historically-based reality of
political action in the real world.  The ideological purist may take comfort
from his unwillingness to compromise, but he will achieve little in the real
world.  Accepting minarchism as a guide to action, illuminated by the ideals
of libertarianism, on the other hand is, in my opinion, a workable practical
political platform.  

Even constrained by the limits of the achievable, there will always be a
spectrum of choices involving more or less government coercion.  Adopting a
principled program of consistent minarchism leads to practical programs such
as privatization of previously state-controlled industries, the use of
arbitration in place of monopoly state legal regimes, the tolerance of
individual choice in personal matters, the consistent minimization of
regulation and taxation and the encouragement of personal responsibility.

Beyond this, accepting a distinction between political ideals and practical
political values avoids the well-known dangers of ideological zealotry.  I
acknowledge that libertarianism is the one ideology which least lends itself
to revolutionary zeal: After all, there is something comic about the image of
a zealous libertarian, since non-initiation of force is the sine-qua-non of
the libertarian ideologue.  One has difficulty imagining the excesses of the
guillotine employed by thorny individualists.  Instead, libertarian zealotry
is much more likely to express itself in a debilitating, fractious
factionalism, which of course leads to the ultimate paradox of libertarianism
in the real world: Libertarians eschew most of the tools of political power
that history provides to those who would work some change in the world.  I
fear most those libertarians who do not see irony in the slogan,
"Individualists of the world unite!", but I also understand that dealing with
the reality that lends that irony is a necessary condition for effective
change.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

What are the principles of good or ideal solutions?

Can a set of criteria be developed against which
proposed solutions can be tested?

Can a methodology be developed that enables individuals
to select solutions with a high probability of success,
rather than spend their time on "solutions" that have
little chance of being implemented, and even if implemented
are likely to cause further problems because of their
unintended consequences?

Suppose I have a problem with the "social security system"
I'm currently participating in. I'm dissatisfied with the
expected future returns on the money I pay into the system.

As a solution I could start a campaign to privatize the
system with the expectation of higher future returns. I
could spend a lot of time and money persuading people to
join me in my campaign. What are the chances of persuading
the politicians and bureaucrats in power to relinquish
their system to the private sector? How long might it
take before the system is privatized? And, once it's
privatized, what if I'm still not satisfied with its
future expected returns?

On the other hand, suppose I could find a way to opt out
of the "social security system" and set up my own "personal
security system." Every month I invest a sum of my choosing
to build up a nest egg for my "old age."

The second solution suggests a principle: The implementation
of an ideal solution is under personal control.

Someone may object, "You're not allowed to opt out of the
social security system!"

This suggests another principle: An ideal solution may
involve doing what most think is "not allowed"; what people
say is "not allowed" needs to be questioned.

But if I do what's "not allowed" I may end up in jail!
This raises the issue of risk associated with solutions.
What risks am I willing to take in implementing my
solution? What can I do to minimize the risk? How can
I achieve the best reward/risk ratio?


Tentative Criteria for Ideal Solutions 
--------------------------------------

They are solutions to personal situations, aspirations,
or problems.

Their implementation is under personal control.

They may involve doing what most consider to be "not
allowed."

They provide the best reward/risk attainable.

They respect individuals and their property, i.e., they
don't involve coercion.

They should not cause worse "side-problems." (Analogous
to a drug such as AZT producing side-effects.)

They should be beneficial to others, particularly
friends. The losses, if any, to friends should be
minimal and invisible to them.

The losses to certain enemies should be maximal and
invisible to them.

They tend to increase personal power, competence, and
effectiveness; their implementation leads to more
powerful and effective future solutions that are
easier to implement.

They need to be communicable and profitable so they
can be "rolled out" to create a better world, i.e.,
other individuals can be inspired to also implement
them to their own and general benefit.


Feedback appreciated.

That link was stale, but ABC's Web site is covering leaks of data go China
about the W88 warhead internals.

Prediction: It will turn out that various actors have been collecting
intel on "exploits" of critical systems, public and black-ops, and will
time their assaults on same to best advantage with whatever "organic" or
"genuine" Y2K problems arise. Or they'll threaten to, and extort whatever
the market will bear out of the targets. The UK milsat is just the tip of

IMPORTANT NOTE:

There seems little question that the current institution of the prison system
in the U.S. is a failure and a disgrace. In part because far too many people
are imprisoned for victimless crimes, prisons here have become inhumane crime
factories.  Decriminalizing victimless, consensual activity would obviously go
a long way toward relieving one of the primary causes of problems in prisons,
which is overcrowding. Beyond this, two means could be employed to reform the
current state of our prisons: Improved and more widespread electronic
monitoring and revised prison architecture.

The technology currently employed with electronically monitored home
"incarceration" is pretty primitive.  The examples I've seen involve a
receiver installed in the home and a clunky anklet transmitter that is
monitored by the stationary unit.  The base station is connected to a
telephone land line and receives a call from an automated system once a day
(or more often).  The "prisoner" is required to answer the phone, respond to a
randomly generated series of questions and place a proximity sensor onto the
anklet.  The base unit periodically calls the central facility to report on
whether the anklet has passed beyond the range of its receiver (approximately
200 feet). A human probation officer must review the recorded responses to the
questions asked by the system (to, among other things, confirm the identity
and sobriety of the offender).

A more sophisticated system could easily be developed with cellular and/or GPS
technology and more advanced information processing.  First, the base station
could be dispensed with.  Second, a smaller and less intrusive mobile unit
could give constant reporting on a prisoner's whereabouts.  Third, the system
could be designed to include or exclude specific locations from a prisoner's
prescribed locations, so that probation or sentence could include non-entry
into a specific neighborhood or house.  Units could also be designed to
interact with each other, so that offenders or probationers could be
effectively prohibited from congregating or acting together.  All of these
factors could be analyzed and reporting could be prioritized and decentralized
so that, for instance, a report of unauthorized congregation of offenders
could be routed immediately to the closest law enforcement officers, as well
as to the specific officer in charge of the particular individuals involved.
Finally, the anklet could be designed to emit an on-going audible alarm
whenever the spatial or temporal conditions of probation or incarceration had
been breached.  In this way, people near the offender would be alerted to the
presence of a parole violator.

Use of more sophisticated electronic monitoring systems could keep most first-
and even second-time offenders out of the prison population, reserving prison
for only the most serious and chronic criminals.  The audible alarm function
would serve as a strong deterrent to young people, who are particularly
sensitive to social pressure, and might keep them from descending down a
ladder of escalating antisocial behavior.

For the most serious offenders, prison should not be a social club for
sociopaths.  I have never understood why prisons are designed to allow the
aggravation and spreading of antisocial behavior.  Simply put, why can't
prisons be designed to isolate bad actors from each other as well as from
society?  Given the high per-prisoner cost of our current prisons, I believe
we could do better by designing facilities that put each prisoner into humane
isolation.  I envision a modular construction of cells, each with its own
exterior enclosure.  Access to the exterior section, which would be equipped
with stationary exercise appliances, could be remotely and automatically
controlled.  The cell space could be provided with maximally tamper-proof
plumbing fixtures and surveillance technology and would be designed
essentially as a one-piece, stackable unit.  The side opposite from the
exterior exercise area would interlock to form an access way observable to
prison guards.  Meals would be taken in isolation, delivered with an automated
system.  Prisoner access from cells to facilities such as medical care and
ingress and egress at the beginning and end of incarceration would be via
protected walkways that could be opened and closed remotely.  The utility
connections of the cells would be built into them, would connect in a modular
fashion and would be serviceable from the exterior of the cell. All access
points would be designed to default mechanically to the closed position, so
that power interruption would not result in an open environment.  Cell units
could be prefabricated in a factory setting and assembled into larger or
smaller prisons as needs demanded with minimal on-site labor or specialized
tools or materials.

While making solitary confinement the universal default condition of
imprisonment would seem inhumane to some, I would ask whether this would be
any less humane than the brutality perpetrated by prison gangs and violent
individuals.  Furthermore, while the opportunities for rehabilitation might by
curtailed by solitary confinement, I wonder whether any real rehabilitation is
possible in the current prison environment.  One possibility for
rehabilitation would be to make placement of a terminal device in a cell
(connected to intranet cabling already in place in the original unit) a reward
for good behavior, with increasingly open (but monitored) access to the
internet a continuing reward for continued good behavior.

Before principles of good solutions can be determined,
it may be worthwhile to develop a typology of solutions.
I expect that different principles will apply to
different types of solutions.

Tentative Typology of Solutions
-------------------------------

Type 1. Do nothing.

Type 2. Stop doing what you're doing.

Type 3. Do it yourself.

Type 4. Ask friends, acquaintances, etc. for assistance.

Type 5. Hire an expert or professional.

Type 6. Form a cooperative relationship, group, company, etc.

Type 7. Launch a campaign, get publicity for your cause,
educate others, etc.

Type 8. Earn or acquire money.

Type 9. Acquire knowledge, equipment, skills, personal power,
etc.

Type 10. Exit a relationship, group, company, etc.

Type 11. Kick out or expel him/her.

Type 12. Identify your own strengths and utilize them.

Some comments from Robert Ingdahl (my loyal henchman) and me. Overall,
it is a good answer, a better definition of extropy is needed since it
can be so misunderstood. If we tried to maximize negentropy, then we
better had to freeze the universe :-)

The problem is the "isms" section. The question contains a hidden
premise, and the answer in some sense accepts it. "Extropianism might
be an ism, but much less nasty than most others". Shouldn't you
explain the usefulness of having some kind of system in one's thinking
(rather than a random eclectic mess), rather than accept the
implication that all such systems are bad in some undefined way. Your
description of why a closed ism is a bad thing is a good start, now
you need to explain why an open, rational ism is a good thing and why
the question's assumption isn't valid - some isms are bad, some are
good, but you cannot avoid choosing.

What kind of info? The NRA can usually be helpful (www.nra.org). 

There is an interesting situation in Richmond , VA (USA) where "Right to
Carry" is in effect along with a zero tolerance policy for gun crime->
http://www.nra.org/crimestrike/exile.htm. Look around for the
correlation between Right to Carry and reduced rates of robery, assult
and rape. These types of crime have dropped by around 60% in Richmond
with the combination of an armed civilian population and zero tolerance.

Recently, there has been massive popular agitation for a memetic core
statement of our philosophy.  Some of us disagree with parts of the
Extropian Principles, others think they are too vague, and still others
think they are too complex and philosophical to serve as a combination
rallying point and recruiting brochure.

I offer, for your consideration and eventual virulent rejection, "The
Extropian Banner", after the style of "The Book of the SubGenius". 
After reading this, you'll be GLAD to take the Principles.

==

WE are the EXTROPIANS.

WE are the advocates of ULTRATECHNOLOGY.

WE are READY and EAGER for the coming age of neurohacking,
nanotechnology, immortality, space colonization, Artificial
Intelligence, transhumanity, uploading, superintelligence, and the Singularity.

WE believe in intelligence, science, rational thought, freedom, and the FUTURE.

WE do NOT believe in ignorance, pain, stupidity, death, or income tax,
and we intend to DO something about it.

WE will MESS with our genes, WIRE our brains, PROGRAM self-modifying
Artificial Intelligences, UPLOAD ourselves into computers, become
TRANSHUMANS, and then use our enormous brains to enhance ourselves EVEN MORE.

WE will move ALL of Earth's heavy industry into space, end pollution,
and disassemble toxic waste with infinitesimal robots.

We will CRUSH the rainforests ANYWAY, just to GET BACK at the
environmentalists for trying to outlaw every form of technology more
advanced than AGRICULTURE.

WE believe that YOU should have the right to build yourself a spaceship
using nanotechnology, travel across the galaxy, stake out your own solar
system, DISASSEMBLE it, and use the mass to build a supercomputer TEN
BILLION TIMES SMARTER THAN THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE, all WITHOUT GOVERNMENT INTERFERENCE.

WE see NO REASON to slow down the Inexorable March of Technological
Progress simply because someone ELSE thinks we are getting uncomfortably
close to GODHOOD.

WE would rewrite the LAWS OF PHYSICS if we could find the source code.

WE will LAUGH at limits.

WE will LAUGH at the foolish protests of namby-pamby technophobes.

WE will drag this planet, KICKING and SCREAMING, into the AWESOME AND
UNKNOWABLE FUTURE, and do it BEFORE our parents die of old age.

YOU can help us.

==

Does everyone agree with that?

ASIDE from the part about the rainforests.
That was a JOKE, ha ha.

Never start by defining your idea as something it isn't.  I would suggest:

'EXTROPY: A metaphor that refers to basic attitudes and values shared by
those who want to overcome human limits through technology.  [Lots of
guys want to do it through Guru Spammachakra.  Distinguish immediately,
but using a positive term rather than a protest.]  [Shorter version: 
"EXTROPY:  The core values associated with overcoming human limits
through technology."]  These values and attitudes are explained in The
Extropian Principles and include a desire to direct oneself in pursuing
perpetual progress and self-transformation with an attitude of practical
optimism implemented using rational thinking and intelligent technology
in an open society.  Extropy, as a metaphor, is directly opposed to the
metaphorical connotations of entropy, but is not to be confused with the
technical term "negentropy".'

I would suggest these topics be rearranged in that order.

No, I'm saying that while "Extropy" is a useful concept describing a
number of common qualities, it's a bottom-up concept like "readers of
Wired magazine" and not a top-down concept like "divisible by three". 
You can, very profitably, define a concept in terms of instances, any
time that you can abstract more information from the instances than you
use in the membership criteria.

Not at all.  If Eric Watt Forste changes his list to include the
Moonies, I will cease to cite it.  And the reason is not that these
people are In Charge Of Extropians, or even that they are looked upon as
natural leaders, but because these are the people who make posts, write
Web pages, argue points - people who not only take the name of Extropian
(or not) but exert efforts focusing on that definition, and, through
those efforts, create most of the pattern in the Extropian ideosphere.

No superiority is implied.  If someone or something else exerts a
stronger influence on the "group" - not intragroup politics or authority
within the group, you understand, but metagroup information like
group-image and internally perceived membership criteria - then I'd junk
the list.

Perhaps the problem is that the presentations confused what is desirable
and what is possible.  I should object strongly to any theory that
requires me to live my life as if I were immortal.

According to the Extropian Principles, maybe.  Maybe even in practice;
if the coercive government is the only way to prevent the world from
being destroyed, and if it is highly liberal in practice, it could be
Extropian.  The Aristoi arguably have an Extropian and highly
authoritative government; in that ficton, with uncontrolled nanotech
having already destroyed Earth1, the necessary amount of authority is
much higher.

Are you sure he meant that absolute freedom isn't *desirable*?

The only way you can test definitions is by checking implicit
assumptions and by pragmatically comparing usability.  Pragmatically
speaking, freedom is a part of the Extropian culture and it ought to be
in the definition SOMEWHERE.

BOSTON -- Mice lacking a gene for making telomeres -- chromosomal elements
with a conjectured but controversial role in aging and cancer -- were found
to go gray, lose hair faster, and recover less easily from the stress of
surgery and chemotherapy than normal animals. They also developed tumors
more often and died earlier, a team of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI)
researchers report in the March 5 Cell.

This actually isn't directly all that interesting to humans.  Standard mice
have unusually long telomeres, so even without telomerase to top up their
germ cells they manage to pass down enough for a few generations.  The ones
in question are the sixth generation (I think) of a constructed knockout
mouse.  This breed started running into trouble at gen 3, and was in deep
shit by gen 6.  My surmise is that the consecutively truncated telomeres
finally hit an unviable brevity by then, and there was a cascade of
chromosomal damage.  

A useful account (but partisan) of the telomeric hypothesis of aging can be
found on Tom Mahoney's site

Imagine just trying to opt out of a social security program. This would
take substantial effort to do it legally. The effort put into going against
so much societal inertia would probably outweigh the returns you would get
from opting out and having a private security program. The risks of doing
it illegally are likely to outweigh the benefits as well.
I suppose the only profitable way to opt out of one thing is to opt out of
everything, and start from scratch. Of course, this would probably entail
owning and starting your own country.

Clarifying this last point:
A solution should be scalable. (Kant's categorical imperative)
If everyone were to personally implement an ideal solution,
the criteria should still hold true.

Perhaps we could start with the Mars project.  All we need is a little dough

us could be settling on Mars in a decade and founding a whole new Extropian

I concur. This is the sort of statement that I was looking for in joining the
list  2.5 years ago and recently joining ExI. I want to be an activist, not a
diversity sensitivity trainer.

On the rainforests bit, Eli, how about:

We will completely REBUILD the rainforests ANYWAY and bring back every species
made extinct by man, just to SPITE the environmentalists who said it couldn't be
done with TECHNOLOGY, and  for trying to outlaw every form of technology more
advanced than AGRICULTURE, which is the real ecology killer. The rainforests
will become HUNTING preserves for humans to practice the ceremony of the HUNT to
retain contact with their roots....

Hey, Eliezer, I think Natasha already has this base covered, although with
a bit more moderation in content, but far more ambitious in range of
distribution -- Natasha's phrase "We Are Transhumans" is well on its way
outward in the solar system aboard the Cassini spacecraft.

Also, this reminds me of The Extropian Declaration that Tom and I wrote way
back in the very early days of Extropy magazine (it was written no later
than 1990, maybe 1989). Remember that we wrote it in the spirit of fun.
(*Please* don't anyone complain about lack of philosophical rigor!) It's
written in the form of a memo to the universe at large.

Onward!

Max
----------------------------


To: The Universe                   From: T.O. Morrow and Max More
-----------------------------------------------------------------


                    THE EXTROPIAN DECLARATION
 

Extropians: Forward! Upward! Outward! Into the future!

We who want to live, we who want freedom, we who want to learn: We
challenge the forces of entropy!

We deny all limitations on our boundless wills: Ignorance, State, Religion
and Death.

We want more intelligence, more power, more liberty. We want more life!
We say: More!

More...about extropy:

Why are we "extropians"? Because we want to survive and prosper in our
often hostile universe. As scientists describe it, our universe naturally
tends toward entropy. It is entropy that breaks down our cars, shorts out
our computers, and withers our flesh. Entropy is the supreme enemy of human
hope.

Extropians hold a consistently anti-entropy point of view. What does
`extropy' mean? Look to its etymology: `Entropy' comes from the Greek `en',
or `in', plus `trepein', or `change'. `Extropy', on the other hand, comes
from `ex', or `out', and `trepein'. Thus while entropy decreases order,
usable energy, and information, extropy increases all three of these goods,
goods that our well-being demands. In a universe threatening to drown us in
a rising tide of disorder, extropy offers us safe passage to higher ground.

Prepare for the future;

It's not going to go away! After wandering along at a slow pace for
centuries, our world has started to enter a period of change that will far
outrace historical standards. The changes occurring in the twentieth
century dwarf those of any previous thousand years, but they only hint at
what the future holds. We face a turning point in history - a time when
artificial ultra-intelligence, nanotechnology, physical immortality, and
other factors promise to radically transform every aspect of our existence.
We are each responsible for preparing ourselves for that future, and for
helping others to understand the coming age.

Ready...set...

We must radically revise our present conceptual frameworks, values, and
expectations if we are to both survive and prosper in the coming age.
Extropians view the future optimistically. Our optimism is a rational
expectation based on the facts coupled with a dynamic attitude towards the
future. Aiming high will help us move upward. Optimism can be
self-fulfilling! We expect great things from the future because we foresee
incredible opportunity, diversity, and beauty. We will have material
abundance beyond our dreams, a pollution-free environment, fantastic
intelligence, the ability to create new worlds, and other wonders yet
untold. We look forward to using these opportunities, and enjoying
ourselves fully in doing so.

Let's Go!

John Lott's recent book has really shaken up a lot of policy wonks.  I doubt
much of it is available on the web, though, except via purchase through Amazon
or the like.

The Cato Institute has a ton of downloadable papers and a handy search engine
to help you find just what you want.  I recall reading a fine paper on gun
control published circa 1990.

Facts seldom hurt an argument, but do not neglect the moral angle:  We each of
us have a duty to protect ourselves and our loved ones.  To strip others of
their rights to exercise that duty commits a grievous wrong.  I think it
wholly fair, moreover, to charge gun-grabbers with a sort of cowardly
ignorance:  Fearful of taking up the burden of self-defense, they wishfully
imagine that they can avoid the problem by delegating that duty to third
parties.

You're asking for pro-gun sources here, and Lorrey is asking for them on
the virtropy list.  Has it ever occurred to you guys to gather your sources
*before* you argue your point?  :-)

I believe I missed this point in replying before. What's this about
including those who favor compulsory genetic engineering? I think you are
confusing something I said in the new FAQ entry about *technocratic
transhumanists* who may favor this. Clearly, forcing genetic engineering on
persons is not consistent with Self-Direction, among other Extropian
principles.

The relevant passage is in the FAQ as follows:

"Clearly some political views will be incompatible with extropian thinking.
That is one way in which extropianism may differ from other forms of
transhumanism. For instance, technocratic transhumanists may favor setting
up an elite group to determine which genetic modifications are allowed or
which are compulsory for the general population. Socialist transhumanists
would want to centralize control over all economic activity in order to
shape the future."

Did you get this from somewhere else that the FAQ entry, which perfectly
explicitly and clearly said this could be a view of non-extropian
transhumanists? Or were you just firing shots off randomly?

In defense of the "cowards," I might offer up a different rationale for why
a person does not want a gun.

A single person is not likely to be completely rational or objective when
judging others. It takes an awfully open-minded person to realize that their
own interpretation on the facts might not be the only one... this should not
necessarily be interpreted as cowardice, although I do agree that our
current justice system isn't exactly living up to its objective ideals.

World's Glaciers Show No Evidence of Global Warming

Major Polar Glaciers are Expanding, Not Causing a Rise 
in Sea Level


MEDIA ADVISORY
For Immediate Release 
Contact: John Carlisle  202-371-1400


The world's glaciers are not drastically receding due 
to alleged man-made global warming but in many cases 
are expanding, according to a recently released 
National Policy Analysis paper by the National Center 
For Public Policy Research.

Proponents of the theory that man-made greenhouse 
gases are dangerously warming the planet point to 
retreating glaciers as evidence of global warming 
affecting the climate.  Global warming theory 
proponents claim that these melting glaciers will 
cause a catastrophic rise in sea level which may 
submerge major seaboard cities like New York in coming 
centuries.  By scaring the public with such 
apocalyptic visions, the environmental movement hopes 
to build support for the Clinton Administration's 
agenda of imposing economically-damaging cuts in the 
nation's greenhouse gas emissions. 
	
However, according to National Policy Analysis paper 
#235, "Behavior of the World's Glaciers Fails to Prove 
Global Warming Theory," glacial activity disproves the 
global warming theory.  Authored by John Carlisle, 
director of the National Center's Environmental Policy 
Task Force, the paper argues that global warming 
theory proponents are wrong to point to the retreat of 
some glaciers in the mid-latitude regions of the 
planet as evidence of warming since glaciers respond 
to a variety of complex natural phenomena other than 
global temperature variations.  Furthermore, mid-
latitude glaciers represent only 6% of the world's 
glacial ice while Antarctica and Greenland, on the 
other hand, contain 94% of the glacial ice.  
Contradicting predictions of alleged global warming's 
climatic impact, the Antarctic and Greenland glaciers 
are advancing which has the effect of lowering sea 
level.

"The advance of the polar glaciers indicates that 
there is no evidence that global warming is melting 
glaciers and thus no reason to fear a catastrophic 
rise in sea level," says Carlisle.  "Instead of 
providing proof of global warming, glacial behavior 
represents yet another powerful indictment of this 
already controversial theory."

The Environmental Policy Task Force is a project of 
The National Center For Public Policy Research, a non-
partisan, non-profit education foundation.  The Task 
Force was established to find and promote innovative, 
workable solutions to environmental problems - 
solutions that minimize the suffering of working 
Americans while still protecting the environment.

For more information, contact John Carlisle at The 
National Center For Public Policy Research at 202-371-
1400 or Jcarlisle@nationalcenter.org or download the 
paper at the National Center's website at

Friends,

	I probably shouldn't get involved in this, but,... 


This thread began when Adrian Sidle, on Wed, 3 Mar 1999 07:49:57 EST, wrote:


>I have served in the military of my country during an unpopular war (Viet Nam).

	Let me direct the reader's attention to the careful phrasing.  Adrian doesn't want to tell you that he was never in Vietnam.  He doesn't want to tell you that he joined the navy; that he never sacrificed a nights sleep, or a meal; and that he never risked personal injury more serious than a hangnail.  And you thought he was a modest, crafty, battle-scarred Vietnam Vet.  But he didn't say that. 
	What the modern reader will also be unaware of is that joining the navy at that time was an act of pragmatism bordering almost on cowardice.  Almost, but not quite.  You see, back then, anyone of military age who wasn't a complete idiot was concerned about their personal safety.  You could get killed in that damn war.  But, if you joined the navy, you avoided the draft, and with it the army, and the possibility of combat.  You got to have your cake, and eat it too.  The recognition of honorable service to your country in its time of need, with an absolute guarantee that your butt would never be on the line (as in "battle" line).  Army, Air Force, and Marines were all stationed on Vietnamese soil.  Only those in the Navy were not, with only a few exceptions.  So no one back then thought that joining the navy was a cowardly thing to do, they thought it was a smart thing to do, damn smart.  Many's the draftee who wished he had figured that out _before_ he got drafted.

>Contrary to popular opinion, I and the overwhelming majority of my comrades believed >in the justice of that war. 

	Yes they did.  They were boys out of high school, raised on John Wayne movies and rabid anti-communism, who wanted a war like dad had in WW2, and their uncles in Korea.  A war like on tv where men died with heroic grace, where the enemy was an evil sub-human who deserved to die, and who did so with cinematic convenience.  These were boys who were charged up with testosterone and anxious to prove their manhood and their patriotism.  They would fight,...and kill...and die...for the country they loved and which, they believed, could do no wrong.  They knew nothing about justice, nothing about war, nothing about history, and less than nothing about Vietnam.  In short, they were clueless.  
	An examination of the facts clearly shows that the US involvement in Vietnam was a wholly criminal affair.  Those who believed or believe otherwise are, to be blunt, wrong.  As in two plus two equals anything but four.  Wrong. 
	

>Is it not the highest form of love to give your life to save your friend's life? Is it not then the same to give 58,000 of your dearest American lives to save millions of Asian lives? We did it in WW2.


	No one who went through that period, and who learned ANYTHING, could repeat the above infantile cliche horseshit.  This is "I wanna be a hero just like dad."   


>Not to open a hornet's nest, but my comrades and I were certain that cowardice was at the root of the protester's actions.
 
	And this, this is the worst.  No, no it's not.  Two MILLION Vietnamese murdered; 58,000 clueless American boys murdered.  Heroes all.  Killed for profit, for the vanity of power, for bigotry, and for stupidity; that's worse.  
	The people who, for various reasons, protested this crime, who understood about injustice and war, and who tried to stop it, were heroes as well; but more to the point, they were regular people who retained the ability to distinguish right from wrong, and who had the courage to act on this knowledge, at a time when cultural influences worked almost overwhelmingly against them. 


	In June of 68 I notified my draft board that I was ready to go.  Stupid.  They drafted me, and I served in the army from Sep 68 to Jun 70.  But I got lucky and did not go to Vietnam.  
	I was near clueless back then, as so many of us were.  We ALL learned something.  Some more than others.
	Getting at the truth, especially about the history of "difficult" times, can be tough.  You will not learn it in school, or find it in the mainstream press.  But it can be done.  If you want the truth about Vietnam, read Chomsky.

	I wrote this because I wanted readers like Randall Randall and Harvey Newstrom, who stated that they were too young to experience these events first hand, to have a chance at the truth.  

 
			Best, Jeff Davis

:-) Wonderful! It is a nice self-parody on our memes (*we* better
ridicule ourselves than let somebody else get there first!)

I suggest that somebody with creativity and an yearning for money try
to make t-shirts with it for Extro4 (Better give Eliezer his due).

Well, I'm not an expert on glaciers, but I wouldn't be surprised if it were
true.  IMHO, the real science behind the global warming debate can
accurately be summarized as follows:

1) The computer models used in pro-warming forecasts are utterly worthless.
We barely know enough about climate change to make rough, short-term
estimates.  Detailed predictions about changes decades in the future are
simply not possible - if you try to make a program to do that, all you get
is an automated copy of your own biases.

2) The experimental error in our global temperature measurements is at least
as large as the changes that are being "measured".  This means that we
really can't tell if anything is happening or not.

3) Climate changes have so many different effects that it is not at all
clear whether a moderate warming would work out to be good or bad.  There
are lots of scary-sounding theories, but we have no idea if any of them are
true or not.

4) Improvements in the data over the last decade have tended to result in
lower estimates for global warming.  At this point the changes that most
pro-warming scientists are predicting are smaller than the normal
year-to-year climate variation, which leads me to suspect that the whole
thing isn't worth worrying about.

If we really want to know what is going on here, we'll have to wait until
the climatologists actually know enough to start making predictions
(probably another decade or two given their current rate of progress).  Of
course, climate change is such a slow process that it shouldn't be a big
issue to us anyway (that is, if you actually believe that nanotech & AI will
happen in the next few decades).

I've got two different lines of commentary on the heavy-planet scenario as a
candidate for the Great Filter:

First, allow me to point out that it isn't enough.  Even if one accepts it
at face value, it would catch only a modest majority of civilizations.  Even
if life develops faster on heavy planets, we know it is possible for it to
develop on Earth.  That means that unless the preference is extremely
strong, this effect could only reduce the population of spacefaring races by
1-2 orders of magnitude.  Given that what we're looking for is more like
12 - 14 orders of magnitude, that doesn't help much.

Second, the argument takes a very short-term view of a problem that is
properly examined from a cosmological perspective.  It doesn't matter if
space travel takes a few hundred years longer, or is a few orders of
magnitude more expensive.  What we're looking for is something that makes
space travel utterly impossible.

Perhaps this would be a good time to point out that the problem of escaping
from a deep gravity well (escape velocity maybe 15 MPS) is trivial compared
to the problem of interstellar colonization (required velocity at least 0.01
C = 1,860 MPS).  We can't rely on the first problem to prevent people from
solving the second one.

This is a neat idea.  I don't thing it is quite feasible yet, but it isn't
very far off.  Fitting all the electronics into a small enough package
should be practical within a couple of years.  The battery is a bit of a
problem, however - we don't want to rely on something as failure-prone as
current cell phone systems.

The software to run this system would be far more complex than it seems at
first glance, but I think it is (just) within the limits of what we can
currently do.

One problem with implementing it right now:  I asume that any communication
failure is going to be interpreted by the system as a parole violation
(otherwise there are too many ways to spoof it).  Given the low reliability
of current wireless systems and battery technology, this means false alarms
would be fairly common.

As a temporary measure imposed by the limits of modern technology, I would
support this approach.  Ultimately, I think criminals at this level should
have the option of mental reprogramming instead (note, however, that this is
the *individual's* choice, not the State's).

I like your general approach, but I don't think it is technically beneficial
to try to create a modular pre-fab design.  Heavy concrete-and-steel
construction is not especially well suited to this approach, especially if
security is important.  But we can easily build the same kind of setup using
conventional techniques, and it would be considerably cheaper than current
prisons.

How about one exercise area for a group of 4-6 cells?  Everyone gets
allotted a 2-hour block of daily exercise time, and that's it.  It means you
need to station a guard where he can see the exercise area, but you probably
still end up saving money.

It would be far less expensive to use relatively normal fixtures, and accept
the need for an occasional maintenance visit.

Unfortunately, this isn't possible yet.  You need electrical connections,
plumbing, and climate control, all of which require complex connections
performed by skilled technicians.  That's the main reason why I suggest
implementing the same design using normal construction methods.

Besides, it also means we could shorten prison stays in many cases.  If
prison is going to have any deterrent effect at all on an individual, a few
months of solitary confinement will be more effective than several years of
conventional incarceration.

I don't like the idea of giving criminals direct contact with the outside
world.  Why not simply give them access to an internal library?  Give them a
book list and forms for requesting titles, and they can receive their
selections through the same system that delivers the food.  This approach
has been used in the past, and it seems to work about as well as most other
methods of rehabilitation (which is to say, there are occasional successes
but little overall effect).

You've got to learn the difference between a scientific organization and a
political action committee!  Any group whose history page
<http://www.nationalcenter.org/NCPPRHist.html> starts off with framed
quotes from from Michael Reagan, Dick Armey, Rush Limbaugh, and Tom DeLay,
is not a scientific organization.  The page says that they were founded
specifically to serve the Conservative Movement.  They research all sorts
of issues, but always come up with answers that match what the
conservatives want.  True science researches an issue to find the answer. 
This group was founded to provide the required answers, and then performed
their "research."


I notice that this "media alert" wasn't actually published by any reputable
media.  I also notice that the article seems short on facts.  It says that
"glaciers are not drastically receding", but doesn't say their not
receding.  It says "in many cases are expanding", but doesn't say if more
are expanding than are decreasing.  In fact, there is very little substance
in the article to examine.  It spends much more time on politics and
conspiracy theory than it does on glaciers.  It also fails to give any
specific findings, fails to mention who did the research and when.  There
is no news in this article, it is just a restatement of conservative
belief.  If any new study was actually performed, the article certainly
didn't make it clear.

A footnote: I think in my last paper draft I overemphasized the prospect of a 
few systems being left untouched in the mad rush to move along.  I'd rather
focus attention on the prospect that aliens did come to our system, but left
in a hurry after using up some resource we don't see around us.  They would
have had no particular reason to hide any signs of their presense, but also
would have wanted to recycle any trash they created.

: Shrinking Greenland Glacier Signals Global Warming
: 
: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Large tracts of the Greenland ice sheet -- a giant
: ``ice cube'' that helps cool the Earth's atmosphere -- are disappearing
: faster than scientists expected in a sign that global warming is having
: dramatic effects, researchers said Thursday.
: 
: ``It's probably slipping faster into the ocean than it has in the
: past. This isn't something we will have to worry about in our lifetime,
: but it will be a question for our children if this phenomena is
: accelerating,'' said William Krabill, project scientist on the NASA
: Goddard Space Flight Center study.

I hadn't heard the story about the glaciers growing.  This was the only
one I'd seen recently.  How reliable was the study about growing glaciers?
Was that from some group dedicated to debunking global warming?  Can you
give a URL for the group or the study?

: A study published Wednesday in Geophysical Research Letters said the
: 1990s were the warmest decade of the millennium, with 1998 the warmest
: year since 1860.

This corresponds to my experience.  It seems to have been getting
hotter and hotter.  Every year for the past few years has seemed to set
new records.  Those who claim that global warming is a real phenomenon
would presumably predict that we will continue to see increases.

For those skeptics, what are the odds that 1999 will turn out to be the
warmest year this century?  What are the odds that the first decade of
the 2000s will be hotter than the 1990s?  At what point would you start
to agree that global warming is a real and ongoing phenomenon?  (Note -
I am not asking you to agree with a particular cause of global warming,
or that everyone should be forced to return to a 17th century lifestyle
as a result, rather the question is whether we should expect warming to
continue to increase.)

I think you'll find that glaciers in the northern hemisphere are receding,
and glaciers in the southern hemisphere are growing. I don't have a cite,
but that's certainly true of the only glaciers I've visited (in New Zealand
and the Canadian Rockies); AFAIR the New Zealand glaciers were receding
until the middle of this century and have been growing again since then.

However, that depends on what your definition of "seems" is. My experience
has been the opposite; I haven't seen a summer worthy of the name since I
came back to England two years ago, and nothing that even begins to compare
to the super-hot summers of the seventies. 

I'd be interested to see an independent study of recent temperatures; all
that I've seen implies that the pro-greenhouse folks declare each year to
be warmer than ever before even when they're not. In fact they seem to
declare any kind of weather as proof of global warming, whether it's hot,
cold, perfectly clear or a major storm.

The unit could have a kinetic battery that uses a solenoid to generate power

If its on the cellular network, the wearer is banned from areas covered by cell
x,y and z, but is allowed in areas covered by cells a,b and c. Using cell zones
is easier than using zip codes.

Only if it doesn't have a tolerance built in. Say 5 minutes. The wearer is
notified when a signal is lost, and they MUST get to a hardwired station to
report their location within that time frame.

Yes, this winter in the northeast US was slightly colder and slightly wetter
than the norm. We didn't have a total thaw in late January like we usually
have, but we are getting more early and late snowfall as well. Its March and we
are still getting temps below zero F at night, barely hitting the 20-30 deg F
range during the day. Of course local conditions are not 'representative' of
the system.

The stats I find interesting is that those that claim global warming say that
it is triggering more very violent storms, hurricanes, etc., yet when you look
at the hurricane data, something like 75% of the most dangerous, high power,
and damagine hurricanse on record for the 20th century occured before the
middle of the century. This is a significant and incontrovetible indication
that the predictions of the global warming claimers are off by a wide margin.

To me, global warming is a non issue for extropians. By the time it is a
problem to us, we will be able to fix it with a quick nano-tech recipe. I also
see it as having good aspects:

a) it will prod island nations to invest money in developing floating and
submersed community construction techniques.
b) island nations will lobby for the UN to recognise sea-mount based
communities as sovereign nations
c) poorer island nations which can't afford to build their own floating or
submersed facilites will attract investment with incentives like the
Seychelle's bank account/consul law. We could wind up with an extropian country
just by being patient and biding our time.

Maybe.  Current radio systems (based on cell phone tech) would need more
power than you could generate this way, but the power requirements are
dropping as the technology continues to improve.

I'm picturing a system that sends a brief message at varying intervals
(otherwise the energy drain is too large to be practical).  Since you don't
want the wearer to know when the next transmission is due, there will be
times when it gets blocked for perfectly legitimate reasons (subway trips,
for instance).  Ideally we would like this situation to be handled by some
automated system, in order to minimize costs.

The hardwired-station idea would work, but we'd have to build an awful lot
of them (probably several hundred thousand just to cover major urban areas
in the U.S.), and even then you have to give the wearer enough time to get
to one (maybe 10-15 minutes?).  Otherwise there will be lots of "false
alarms" due to innocuous activity, which will require human attention and
thus cost money.

This line of commentary seems very scientifically germane to the suggestion of
most or all ET's residing on heavier planets than the Earth. Robin Hanson's
paper on the Great Filter made it clear that one plausible reason for a
shortage of ET's would be if the typical development of life takes much
*longer* than here on Earth. Now, I've read articles that suggest that our own
sun will be too hot to support large animal life on our own planet at some
point within the next half billion years or so. In that context, it seems
we're already "near" the end of the 5 billion year "window" for our sort of
life to evolve. If intelligence usually takes a great deal longer than that to
get going, you either have to say that it's extremely rare, or look to stars
that are less massive and therefore longer lived than our sun, stars that are
stellar class "K" or even "M", rather than our sun's "G" class. Among main
sequence stars, the smaller and dimmer the star, the longer its life span, by
quite a large factor, I believe -- and I understand that the smaller stars are
more prone to dangerous stellar flares, too.

 Given those general points, what I'm asking about the smaller stars is, does
the advantage of longer stellar life balance off against the flare radiation
danger in such a way as to strongly discourage life on any but the largest
terrestrial -type planets that may be orbiting those stars? This is a highly
technical question, no doubt! If someone is able to crunch the numbers, maybe
even complete with a good model of atmosphere thickness for different sized
planets, *that* would be interesting, certainly beyond anything that I'm
prepared to do. Admittedly, it's possible that this "ET's favour large
planets" idea might be killed on some technicality in fairly short order, in
the sense of disproving it as a statistical trend. For instance, possibly
there just isn't all that much difference in radiation dangers for stellar
life spans of interest? I have some sense that the uncertainties about such
things as "frequency of stellar flaring" might enough to leave an idea like
this on the back burner for a long time, before enough is found out to either
disprove it, or to solidly encourage it?

In terms of making a suggestion about why ET's might not have gotten
off-planet, this seems not so much of a concern to me, since no one really
knows what it would take to discourage your typical ET civilization from
developing space settlements! If, as I've outlined, even the highest tech
rocketry could arguably be too expensive or too dangerous for an ET
civilization, who knows if they'd ever get around to building the really
large-scale launchers that they'd need to surpass those limits? Note that
sending cheap little "seed" AI's into space might not be the answer, either;
if small, cheap AI's tend to get fried by radiation, maybe our ET's always
have to give up on that as well.

What I really notice here is that the above comment from Billy Brown seems to
suggest that an obstacle of something being "a few orders of magnitude more
expensive" would necessarily be overcome eventually, maybe taking only a "few
hundred years" at most before the cost barrier is reduced to something
manageable. The trouble with cost barriers is that, if the cost of breaking
through the barrier is too high, maybe no one will do it! As the old saying
says, "you have to walk before you can run"; what if most would-be space
travellers never learn to "walk"?

I'm SORRY I can't give you a source other than the discovery channel, but
from what I had seen on that show the major evedience for global warming
was a 1 degree F increase in the world's total average temperature.Anyone
seen anything like this?

Yes, revolutionary pride! This really kicks ass! Perhaps there

Personally I was thinking along the lines of a semi-public
mutual aid group. Our primary aim should be getting rich, the 
rest comes naturally. Money=power.

I assume you're kidding, but a Mars project would really make a lot
of sense. When the Singularity comes the earth probably won't be
a very safe place. Besides, colonizing Mars would be great fun!
Another (and arguably more urgent goal) would be creating an 
"upload machine". The best way to deal with the Singularity is to 
cause it yourself (by ascending). Even without a Singularity (very 
unlikely), the sooner we can upload the better.

Of course there are plenty of other useful and fun things we could 
do as a group, but the above should be the spearhead of the
transhuman effort. Anyone interested in a transhuman subgroup
with clearly defined goals [based on enlightened self-interest]
and philosophy(*)? As I've said many times before: we have a
kick-ass philosophy here, the BEST EVER in fact, and a very
talented group of people. Let's DO something with it! Something
BIG and useful. Transhumanism deserves it. WE deserve it.
Amen.

Tim,

   I think I see my misunderstanding...by Coventry, you are advocating a form
of behavior control based on reputation, without involvement of any
organization/governmental force.  This would certainly be in keeping with
Extropian values.  However, since this will be a sort of electronic village,
as you say, there is one thing which bothers me.  I have always found the
relative annonymity of modern society a strength in that it gives individuals
the chance to constantly reinvent themselves, something that is much more
difficult to do when everyone knows every bonehead move you've pulled in your
life.

tim,

     I agree that there is a strong memetic aspect to the question of how to
deal with alternate worldviews (specifically religions).  But I would suggest
that any religion is not a single meme, but a large and convoluted meme
complex, which has survived and evolved over many generations.  There are many
separate memes in a religion meme complex, many inter-related and some
contradictory; some of these memes are pretty good (by Extropian standards),
and others are terrible (by anyone's standards).  I recommend trying to
reinforce those positive memes and erode those negative memes, mostly through
reason and example.  Humanity has a thin veneer of reason which is hooked into
a rather advanced, emotion-driven, survival machine.  When dealing with those
who are not >H, we need to take the initiative to provide a calm, safe,
reflective environment which fosters reason, tolerance, and understanding.  We
need to connect with those of other views to work together on shared memes of
values, and try to understand the basis of our differences.  This sounds all
warm and cuddly, but there is a pragmatic underpinning.  In my opinion,
everybody is a potential resource (me included) which can contribute to
growth.  Now, these resources can also be turned against growth.  I want to
maximize our support, ensure our freedom, and minimize our opposition.  Being
warm and cuddly is a good way to do that, especially when you are a new
minority, which at this point in history is what >H are.  Current society is
barely aware of us, let alone sure how to deal with us.  This is a critical
point in the evolution of >H; what we do and say over the next decade or so
will determine whether we will grow into an accepted way of life, or are
persecuted as a danger to society.  Personally, I want to tap into all that
potential out there in humanity, not have to fight it.  Turning against whole
meme complexes will trigger a memetic immune reaction which could set back the
>H meme complex by many years.  Instead, let us single out those few memes
which corrupt and twist any other memes they come into contact with, such as
Absolutism, Infallibility, Intolerance, Genocide, etc.  Those I will be happy
to proclaim myself the enemy of, and to fight with all my might.

My Starseed/Launcher proposal is mentioned in the March 1999

column was cut to one page instead of 1-1/2).

One of my observations is used to end the article;
I am curious as to how this is received.

Aaron, I am not kidding.  Please read "The Case for Mars" by Robert Zubrin.
We could have our first people on Mars with existing technology within 10
years for a small fraction of Bill Gates money.  Perhaps we could rename the
planet to "Planet Gates" and give Microsoft certain rights in exchange.

It's a crime our species isn't already on Mars!  We can do it!

This would assume that the ETs in question would "never" invent
(practical) nanotech, which is rather unlikely. Needless to say,
with something like nanotech the "cost" of space travel would
drop enormously. Besides, even with today's tech one could
colonize the universe, it would only take somewhat longer.
I really can't imagine that choosing to remain stuck on one
dirtball would be the default choice for advanced races. The
aggression and pioneering spirit that made them the dominant
species on their homeworld would surely keep driving them
onwards in search of new territory, (virtually) no matter what 
the costs. From an evolutionary perspective, this makes perfect 
sense.

So, where are they? Beats me...

Well Jeff, I knew you were skulking around out there, seething in your simple,

If you are capable of a more specific assertion with some foundation on a

I was in Saigon in the Merchant Marine delivering war material in the sixties

The problem with this theory of the Great Filter, like the simple
Singularity theory, is that it doesn't take into account psychological
differences between races.  I suspect that most races are much like
humans in the sense of being individualistic rather than altruistic, and
not very cooperative; it's a stronger evolutionary attractor.

However, I also suspect that at least one in a thousand races will be
strongly cooperative, perhaps hivemind-like, or with authority-related
social emotions so strongly developed that the entire civilization can
be controlled by a single individual.  Unlike our race, such a
civilization has a real chance of deliberately avoiding a Singularity
(and surviving) if such is the group consensus; some such races will
also be relentlessly expansionist, and also interventionist.  All the
factors, total, sum to no more than a hundred thousand to one, I think -
more than enough for such races to have developed in our own galaxy or
one nearby more than a billion years ago.

Such a race would not be stopped by any cost of spaceflight, nor by a
Singularity, nor by nanowar.

Where are they?

"WE ARE TRANSHUMANS" in space.

 "We are transhumans" is ALREADY on its way to Saturn on board the Cassini
Huygens spacecraft.  This is the first time the memetic phrase about our
culture is leaving the earth and crossing the Solar System.

The phrase "We are transhumans" is part of my manifesto and essay I
authored in 1989.  http://www.extropic-art.com/cassini.htm

Another idea I had was to have coils in the soles of one's shoes that will draw
power from grids embedded in hallways and walkways, etc. Or using the same power
unit found in the soles of those damn LED lit sneakers.....must be a peizo

if it is a phone based system, just have a phone jack on the unit, so the user

millions of phone jacks already out there.

Greg & Billy,

   I also agree that the GPS monitoring system with built in alarm would be a
viable alternative for some of what is currently covered by imprisonment, as
well as the need to isolate prisoners from criminal society.  I wonder if it
wouldn't be better to decentralize prisons; build smaller facilities so to cut
down on the amount of interactions possible between offenders.  I have been
debating the idea of how much connection with the outside world a prisoner
should have.  Perhaps the best route would be to provide educational
programming, but not general entertainment.  One concept I have toyed with is
in the case of murderers.  Once the defendent is found guilty, this person
would have three options to choose from.  One would be to voluntarily enter
into intensive rehabilitation, where he would remain until he was reformed
(using radical methods if necessary, as long as they were through informed
consent).  Two, the prisoner could remain in near complete solitary, a form of
social death where his only contact would be with an advocate jointly agreed
to by the inmate and the court.  There could be some amount of flexibility
between these two, with the prisoner being able to opt to go from one to the
other for a limited number of times (after which point the default would be
solitary).  The third option would be assisted suicide.  The inmate would have
to be certified as competent to make the decision, and undergo councilling
aforehand, with perhaps a grace period between the time of requesting death
and the actual suicide (perhaps as much as a year).  Any time up until the
actual act the inmate could opt out, but then to take this option the offender
would have to undergo the whole process and waiting period again.  The
prisoner would also have a limited number of times to go between this option
and the other two, after which the default would be solitary.  The reason I
suggest that the number of times the prisoner could vacillate between options
is to prevent them from doing so in an attempt to work the system (get extra
attention, break up the monotony, play mind games, etc.).  Also, murderers
could have all their assets seized and given to the survivors of their
victims, especially dependents.  There are pros and cons to such a system, and
I don't know if I am satisfied with the concepts.  Again, the default seems to
be imprisonment.  

   Another option for future use might be to establish penal colonies for
repeat violent offenders in other areas of the solar system, such as on the
dark side of the Moon.  These would be isolated from the rest of human
society, perhaps run by AIs.  Just an idea.....

Mike,

    Great ideas for making the GPS system more practical....I like the idea of
kinetic recharging, though I am unsure if it would be sufficient for the
task....I especially like the five minute delay to get to a phone.

A few exceptions to Navy involvement in Viet Nam?

   Naval Aviators

   The Boats patrolling the Mekong Delta

   UBTs(not sure I've the right initials here): the predecessors of the SEAL
teams

Also, lets not forget that although they might not have been the primary
service in Viet Nam, there was still a Cold War going on which could have
heated up at any time.  And being on a Naval Vessel definitely made you a
target.  So, joining the Navy might have been a calculated risk to avoid being
a ground-pounder in Viet Nam, but I wouldn't characterize it as cowardice.
There was still the possibility of becoming a casualty of war, as with any
form of military service at any time in history.  Just wearing the uniform of
the US military can make you a target.  They were not running away from
military service so much as exercising some control over the nature it would
take.

Now, I have to admit to having a weakness for discussion about the Viet Nam
war and the various issues it entails, but I feel it would be less than honest
of me if I did not point out that this discussion has not exactly been
Extropian in tone.  That gives us three viable options.  
1)  Reframe the discussions in Extropian terms (how would the application of
Extropian Principles effect analysis of the Viet Nam war?)
2)  Move this discussion to another arena more appropriate.
3)  End the discussion.

Again, I have been as guilty as any of continuing this discussion in a place
and/or manner which were inappropriate (just look at the first part of this
post for proof of my complicity<G>).  For that, I apologize to my fellow >H on
the list.  What can I say?  It's tough to pass up a good discussion....

Short irrelevant story follows:
When I was a small boy a song came on the radio which went

"Heres to you, Joe DiMaggio,
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you..."

I was baffled, having never heard of him.  Not long afterwards,
a TV commercial had a guy selling vacuum cleaners:

Hi.  Im Joe DiMaggio.  Brand x vacuum cleaners yakkity yak
and bla bla.

Not understanding celebrity endorsements at the time,  I was
even more baffled.  Why would a lonely nation look to the
vacuum cleaner guy?  {8^D  end irrelevant story.  spike

Friends,

	I probably shouldn't get involved in this, but,... 


This thread began when Adrian Sidle, on Wed, 3 Mar 1999 07:49:57 EST, wrote:


>I have served in the military of my country during an unpopular war (Viet
Nam).

	Let me direct the reader's attention to the careful phrasing.  Adrian
doesn't want to tell you that he was never in Vietnam.  He doesn't want to
tell you that he joined the navy; that he never sacrificed a nights sleep,
or a meal; and that he never risked personal injury more serious than a
hangnail.  And you thought he was a modest, crafty, battle-scarred Vietnam
Vet.  But he didn't say that. 
	What the modern reader will also be unaware of is that joining the navy at
that time was an act of pragmatism bordering almost on cowardice.  Almost,
but not quite.  You see, back then, anyone of military age who wasn't a
complete idiot was concerned about their personal safety.  You could get
killed in that damn war.  But, if you joined the navy, you avoided the
draft, and with it the army, and the possibility of combat.  You got to
have your cake, and eat it too: the recognition of honorable service to
your country in its time of need, with an absolute guarantee that your butt
would never be on the line (as in "battle" line).  Army, Air Force, and
Marines were all stationed on Vietnamese soil.  Only those in the Navy were
not, with only a few exceptions.  So no one back then thought that joining
the navy was a cowardly thing to do, they thought it was a smart thing to
do, damn smart.  Many's the draftee who wished he had figured that out
_before_ he got drafted.

>Contrary to popular opinion, I and the overwhelming majority of my
comrades believed 
>in the justice of that war. 

	Yes they did.  They were boys out of high school, raised on John Wayne
movies and rabid anti-communism, who wanted a war like dad had in WW2, and
their uncles in Korea.  A war like on tv where men died with heroic grace,
where the enemy was an evil sub-human who deserved to die, and who did so
with cinematic convenience.  These were boys who were charged up with
testosterone and anxious to prove their manhood and their patriotism.  They
would fight,...and kill...and die...for the country they loved and which,
they believed, could do no wrong.  They knew nothing about justice, nothing
about war, nothing about history, and less than nothing about Vietnam.  In
short, they were clueless.  
	An examination of the facts clearly shows that the US involvement in
Vietnam was a wholly criminal affair.  Those who believed or believe
otherwise are, to be blunt, wrong.  As in two plus two equals anything but
four.  Wrong. 
	

>Is it not the highest form of love to give your life to save your friend's
life? Is it not then the same to give 58,000 of your dearest American lives
to save millions of Asian lives? We did it in WW2.


	No one who went through that period, and who learned ANYTHING, could
repeat the above infantile cliche horseshit.  This is "I wanna be a hero
just like dad."   


>Not to open a hornet's nest, but my comrades and I were certain that
cowardice was at the root of the protester's actions.
 
	And this, this is the worst.  No, no it's not.  Two MILLION Vietnamese
murdered; 58,000 clueless American boys murdered.  Heroes all.  Killed for
profit, for the vanity of power, for bigotry, and for stupidity; that's
worse.  
	The people who, for various reasons, protested this crime, who understood
about injustice and war, and who tried to stop it, were heroes as well; but
more to the point, they were regular people who retained the ability to
distinguish right from wrong, and who had the courage to act on this
knowledge, at a time when cultural influences worked almost overwhelmingly
against them. 


	In June of 68 I notified my draft board that I was ready to go.  Stupid.
They drafted me, and I served in the army from Sep 68 to Jun 70.  But I got
lucky and did not go to Vietnam.  
	I was near clueless back then, as so many of us were.  We ALL learned
something.  Some more than others.
	Getting at the truth, especially about the history of "difficult" times,
can be tough.  You will not learn it in school, or find it in the
mainstream press.  But it can be done.  If you want the truth about
Vietnam, read Chomsky.

	I wrote this because I wanted readers like Randall Randall and Harvey
Newstrom, who stated that they were too young to experience these events
first hand, to have a chance at the truth.  

 
			Best, Jeff Davis

Thanks to Eliezer for the humor.

If Eliezer's Banner is to turn into a shirt, we have to distill the
essence.

May I suggest:

As a start.

I would be interested in hearing how Extropians might respond to the
question,

Choose five people that you most wish would embrace the idea of cryonics
because they have a talent or a gift that the world can ill afford to lose.

The *what*?!

================

This whole discussion is very creepy to anyone with a passing familiarity
to the 19th C Panopticon theory of imprisonment lambasted so savagely by
Foucault.  For all his faults and extravagances, I suspect he was on the
money in finding this sort of dehumanisation utterly vile and
counter-productive (however awful current programs are).

Most serious offenders are deeply fucked up, shaped and deformed by abusive
experiences and operating with extraordinarily limited social repertoires.
Isolation just intensifies this cruel soul death.  Foolish and sentimental
as it sounds, what they need is love - maybe Tough Love, but not coldness.
How we manage to provide this I don't even start to know.  I suppose the
best way is somehow to intervene early - again, this then becomes a matter
of reviving community, especially among the socially deracinated.

My A2cents.

Adrian,

   Will take your request to break the posts up into more digestible pieces
into consideration.  I try to, but I have very little time to respond to posts
currently (doing a subinternship, vice-chairing at the American Medical
Student Association National Convention, and getting married all this month),
that I sometimes let the editting slide.  I will attempt to ramble in a more
organized fashion in future<G>.

Damien,

   This is an excellent point, and raises an important question.  Should the
guiding principle for sentencing be limited to punishment and protection of
society, or should it be the redemption and reclaimation of those who our
society have lost.  I personally believe the ideal would be rehabilitation,
but fear the pragmatic answer might lean more toward protection of society.  I
would be interested to hear how you believe these two goals relate to an
Extropian ethic.  How do we treat those who do not respect the right to live
unmolested in one's own person?

There are numerous problems with this 'evidence'. Firstly, even if you
accept the surface temperature data, then the temperature today is only
a fraction of a degree higher than it was at the beginning of the 19th
century! This is why most of the pro-warming arguments discuss temperature
changes from the mid-19th century to today, because there was a major drop
in temperature around 1820, and that significantly inflates their figures.

Secondly, various people have shown problems with the surface temperature
data. One temperature measuring station used in many studies showed a one
degree change... but when someone actually went there and looked at the
station they discovered that over the last couple of decades bushes had
grown around it blocking out a cold wind; compensating for the wind effect
removed the increase. The other stations are not evenly distributed, and
many are near airports or in cities where the temperature will be rather
higher than average. The global measurements by satellite show almost no
change in the last few decades.

So the basic global warming issues are:

1. What is the 'correct' temperature for the planet?

We don't know.

2. Is the temperature changing?

We don't know.

3. If so, are the changes the result of human action, or are they
natural variations?

We don't know, though the evidence seems to show much larger natural changes
than anything supposedly caused by human activity.

4. If so, will this have a worse effect on us than closing down industrial
civilization?

We don't know, but I find it strange that many of the pro-warming folks
love to trumpet the glory of Gaia, their wonderful self-regulating global
organism, yet then turn around and tell us that actually Gaia isn't
wonderful enough to handle a small increase in carbon dioxide.

Given another twenty years we may know the answers to many of these questions,
but today we just don't have enough data and rely on dubious computer models
instead.

The Extropian T-Shirt is here!

http://pobox.com/~sentience/t-shirt/extropian.jpg

181K, 8.5" x 11" at 72 dpi.

I still have the original, mostly text-based file, so I can change that
if that's not the right size.

But IT'S NOT FREE.  Or maybe it is.  I haven't decided.
What's the industry standard on residuals?

==

About the Banner:  I would like to ask anyone who uses alternate
versions of the "rainforest" line not to put my name on it; if this line
is merely omitted entirely, *along* with the line about ending
pollution, feel free to impress others with the majesty of my Name.

==

Is anyone interested in the JPEGs for my "Singularity 2005" T-Shirt?
That's what I currently wear at conventions - without the ugly little
copyright notice, BWAH HA HA.

http://pobox.com/~sentience/t-shirt/singularity.jpg (side 1)
http://pobox.com/~sentience/t-shirt/singularity.2.jpg (side 2)

Speaking of which, does anyone know someone who can transfer a 72 dpi
JPEG in "thousands of colors" to a T-Shirt so that it comes out AT THAT
RESOLUTION?  My actual T-Shirt looks a lot less impressive, not to say,
or perhaps scream at the top of my lungs, BLURRY.

For that matter, the brain-and-chip insignia looks a lot more impressive
in the original RGB 16-bit color instead of CMYK, but you can't have everything.

I consider said image to be my PERSONAL INSIGNIA, so use it NOT without
permission lest the DEMONS OF COPYRIGHT VIOLATION tear out thy nostrils.

On the other hand, I don't mind people walking around with my personal
insignia on their T-Shirts, practically shouting "I'm a minion of
Eliezer Yudkowsky!"

This one definitely isn't free, though - that image was NOT easy to put together.

How do you know? The relationship between social structure and the
emergence of intelligence is at best unclear. 

A solitary species will likely never develop a civilization, there
will not be enough memetic exchange to keep much accumulated
knowledge. Clearly, a certain amount of social connection is
necessary, but it is not clear where the "optimum" (i.e. maximal
probability of the emergence of a technological civilization) level of
individuality lies. So it is a bit premature to say that this is a
stronger evolutionary attractor.

Yeah?  You mean the Power would, not just vaporize any intruding
spaceships, but traverse N galaxies to get the WHOLE civilization? 
Okay, no problem.  Maybe it picks it up as soon as it sees radio
emissions.  Also, no problem.  But if the Powers are that altruistic, or
mortal-phobic, or whatever, why aren't THEY here?

The worst part is, the blasted answer is probably obvious.  I've got the
feeling that this whole problem was set up DELIBERATELY, as a means of
communication, so that there's only one *possible* answer, which is
immediately obvious to the first transhuman on the planet.  I'm smart
enough to hear Them screaming the answer in my ear, but not smart enough

0. Every non-interjection verbal term used by humans refer to something.

   That ``something'' exists as:
	(a)	a phenomenon in the real world,
	(b)	a set of signal data in brains of sentients,
	(c)	both of the above,
   or	(d)	none of the above

   An interjection term would e.g. "Ouch!" or other non- or quasi-verbal
   communication (e.g. the words which U.S. TV companies convert into <beep>
   would be quasi-verbal communication).
   
1. When I first read the passage above I thought the term "qualia" referred to
   the property of objects in (b) being characterized as e.g. ``being red''.

   But after reading the passage again, it appears to me that the ``qualia''
   term actually refers to the set of properties in (a), the basic input data
   of the human brain.

   The qualia ``red'' would then consist of the frequencies which would cause
   a human to call the perceived colour "red" when sensed by the human.

   Correctly understood?

2. The qualia of any rational interpretation would then refer to the output
   from the rational thinking part of the human brains, as perceived by the
   internal (non-verbal) monitor.

   Do you feel certain that this actually has the same immediate quality as
   the qualia of external input has?  Apart from introspection, do you have
   any data that suggest that the human brain implements the verbal symbol
   manipulation on qualia?  If not, would not the verbal symbol manipulation
   actually _be_ the qualia of the verbal part of brain?

   Consider the fact that by naming various parts of one's mental processes
   one achieve power over them in metaprogramming (cf. the magickal idea of
   getting power over something or somebody when you know the true name).

I evoke the symbol complex "red", "Yes." if do not and <shrug> if I disable

I'm wondering if the new books by Kurzweil, Moravec and Gershenfeld have 
sparked more interest in the ability of machines to think in the 
academic communities.  I know the books are primarily geared toward the 
layperson but I'm hoping this will make the academia think more this as 
a legitimate topic of research and inquiry.

Okay, that section is now on the Web at:

The HTML contains a link to:

I am thus using qualia in the "hard problem" sense.

This is not necessarily intrinsic to the explanation.  It works almost
the same way if you substitute "neural firings in the visual cortex" for
"the redness of red"; it's just that, at that point in the explanation,
you don't yet believe in the visual cortex.  Got it?

I see no intrinsic value in calling myself ``extropian''.
For me the name is irrelevant.  The map is not the territory.

In the past, as I perceived the state of the world, extropianism
required libertarian politics and transhumanism had no such constraint.

If the ExI people lifted that constraint, then would somebody please
define the difference, if any, between extropianism and transhumanism?

If no difference exists any longer then

   Transhumanism - the generic produce.
   Extropianism - a brand name.

I'm not sure about the solar flare probability, but I can tell you that such
events are probably no more dangerous to life than asteroid impacts.  A big
flare might kill a lot of land animals on the facing side of the planet, but
sea life and land animals on the other hemisphere will be fine.  A modest
improvement in radiation resistance would prevent solar flares from even
doing that much damage.

However, it would be very difficult to get liquid water on a planet orbiting
a small, dim star.  The star puts out so little energy that a planet must be
extremely close in order to stay warm.  We don't know all that much about
how planets form, of course, but it is hard to build a model where that kind
of thing will happen often enough to be significant.

But it isn't.  Let's look at some options:

1)  With chemical rockets, you might be stuck with having <1% of your
vehicle as payload.  Today that would be impractical, but with nanotech that
1% can still do something useful.  With low construction costs, the low
efficiency also isn't nearly the problem it would be now.

2) Nuclear rockets have been studied many times by various groups, and the
general conclusion has been that they are no more dangerous than chemical
versions.  Besides, if you're really worried about it you can launch the
thing from an island (or even a floating platform, like Sea Launch).  We
don't know exactly what the upper limit on performance would be for such
designs, but it is likely to be an order of magnitude or so better than
chemical rockets.

3) Spaceplane-type systems would negate most of the thick-air problems, as
would air-launched rockets.  We've really only begun to explore the
possibilities of this kind of approach.

4) Laser launch systems negate the whole problem.  With almost all of the
mass of the propulsion system on the ground, the vehicle can be mostly
payload even in high gravity.

Note that I haven't even considered what could be done with fusion power,
antimatter, laser ramjets, magnetic levitation, or other exotic
technologies.

We can solve that problem now, with off-the-shelf technology.  You just have
to give your replicator a few ounces of shielding.

By that standard, scholars of the 10th century could confidently conclude
that the idea of shipping an army across the Atlantic in giant steel boats
is specious nonsense.  Why, there isn't enough steel in the kingdom to build
such a vessel!  Where would you find the tens of thousands of blacksmiths?
How could we ever grow enough hemp for the rope?  Burn coal to power it, you
say - but man, do you know how expensive it is to mine coal?

It isn't that technology magically makes everything cheap (although
sometimes it does).  Its that economies grow over time.  We routinely do
things now that would have been insanely expensive a hundred years ago, and
there is no reason to expect this trend to change in the future.

Rocketry was developed for military purposes long before space travel became
a serious possibility.  There is a continuous progression of innovations
leading from primitive fireworks to ballistic missiles, and from there to
space flight.  Making space flight more expensive would make development
along this curve a bit slower, but that's all.  To create a situation where
virtually all civilizations remain planetbound for millions of years, you
need a much larger obstacle than a 3G gravity well.

Do we believe in personal responsibility or not?  If we hope to create a
society in which people are free to direct their own lives, we must
recognize those people as independent actors.  By reducing criminals to the
role of passive victims of their experiences we dehumanize both them and
ourselves.

A society that sees its criminals as mere victims of social influence will
soon see its law-abiding citizens in the same light.  If a murderer is not
responsible for his actions, then neither is a drunkard, or a philanderer,
or a luddite.  If we can not condemn our vandals, thieves and murderers, how
then can we praise our artists, philanthropists and statesmen?

This is a road we should not take.  It leads inexorably to a political
philosophy in which freedom is mere illusory nonsense, and the wise servants
of the State have free reign to ply their healing arts on anyone who
deviates from their vision of the ideal citizen.  The end of that road is at
best a sterile, universal conformity, and at worst a complete end to
personal identity.

I say, let us live as free individuals, and expect others to do likewise.
Let us praise the men who risked their lives to smuggle Jews out of Nazi
Germany, and let us condemn the man who murders his neighbor for pocket
change.  Above all, let us build a legal system that acknowledges an
individual's right to make his own choices, for good or ill.

Congratulations Eliezer.  And you thought we would would reject you?!  I,
too, greatly enjoyed your banner.  Just one section concerns me a bit,
though.  Call me skittish or nit-picky, but how do we reconcile the recent
discussions of how Extropians embrace the principle of "non-initiation of
force" and your phrase, "WE will drag this planet, kicking and screaming,
into the awesome and unknowable FUTURE."   I wonder how lay persons are
likely to react to this statement.  Might I offer, "WE will lead this planet
into the awesome and unknowable FUTURE."  I'd buy one with that edit.  Keep
the copyright.  What do you think?

1.  It just occurred to me that someone might want to print that out and
post it up somewhere, or, for that matter, order a single T-Shirt from a friend.

http://pobox.com/~sentience/t-shirt/extropian.jpg
is hereby declared FREE for private usage only; that is, as long as you
don't sell it.  Print it out, xerox it, mail it to a friend, etc.

This does NOT apply to the Singularity images.  Thinking about it, maybe
"private insignia" is the wrong term to use, but I don't have the
name-brand recognition to declare it the official insignia of the
Singularity.  To use Mitchell Porter's term, it is only for the usage of
Yudkowskian Singularitarians.

2.  You don't need to read both sides of the Singularity T-Shirt. 
They're the same, except that where side 1 reads "If computing power
doubles every eighteen months, what happens when computers are doing the
research?", side 2 reads "If technology is produced by intelligence,
what happens when intelligence is improved by technology?"

3.  Pronounced out loud, the T-Shirt should be read as follows:

"WE are the EXTROPIANS."

"WE are the champions of ULTRATECHNOLOGY."

"WE believe in science, intelligence, freedom, and rational thought."

"WE do not believe in ignorance, pain, stupidity, death, or income
taxes, and we intend to do something about it."

"WE will drag this planet, kicking and screaming, into the awesome and
unknowable FUTURE."

"WE will do it before our parents die of old age."

You may then explain any of the ultratechnologies listed as your friend
asks about them.

You do not have to pronounce the copyright.

Fun Thing To Do:  Get a large room full of people (probably at Extro 4)
to recite this in unison.  Tape it, MP3 it, and put it on the 'Net; I
want to hear it.  Might make a nice closing ceremony or something.

4.  Max More has the Principles, TOMorrow has the Declaration, Natasha
has the Manifesto.  But the forms of memetic engineering involved in
producing a set of rational principles, an introductory Web page, a
manifesto, a definition, and *slogans* are not remotely similar.

It does look to me, given the VAST STORM OF APPLAUSE, like there was an
unfilled market for a set of slogans and a 30-second explanation, an
"Extropian creed" you can recite to a friend or stick on your office
door or a coffee mug or a shirt or a tattoo or whatever.

5.  The best part about slogans:  If you go around wearing a T-Shirt
saying "We are the champions of ultratechnology" and "We will do it
before our parents die of old age", then you feel obliged to actually go
out and do it.  This is one of the reasons why "champions" has replaced
"advocates", despite the hubris; it's not just the ring, it's that
people will try to live up to it.

Why do you assume there is someone out there?

IMHO, the most economical explanation of our observations is simply that the
average time required for a life-bearing world to produce a technological
civilization is much longer than the average time that pre-technological
life can survive in a single location.  Given what we know about stellar
lifespans and the frequency of cataclysmic events (nearby subernovae, GRBs,
close encounters with other stars or black holes, etc), this isn't all that
big of a stretch.  We have to make some pessimistic assumptions about the
natural rate of evolution, but that's a subject with plenty of big unknowns.

We can also tip the statistics a bit in our favor by noting that the
concentration of heavy elements in the universe has been slowly increasing
ever since the big bang.  Earthlike planets could not have formed in the
early universe, and planets with an Earthlike chemical composition have
probably only existed recently.

Why don't you try telling that to Admiral James Stockdale, who was

You couldn't just walk in an join the Navy. They had a limited
number of slots and the rich and powerful made sure they were
reserved for their own kind.

Of course if you really had power you either joined the national
guard  (Dan Quayle) or limped along on college deferment. (Bill
Clinton)

Now you're an expert on everyone who went. We may have been raised
on John Wayne movies (people die in John Wayne movies), but most of
the people who I know served weren't anxious to go, they did feel
it was right, and a duty they owed to country.

Those who served honorably are heroes, on this we agree. You might
also be surprised to learn that I agree that Vietnam was a bad
idea. Even though I enlisted at the time.

Nonsense, Jane Fonda is a traitor, not a hero. Those who opposed
the war on sincere moral grounds and acted accordingly also have my
respect.

I am not interested in Chomsky's opinion of the Vietnam War.

You wrote this to express your own opinions, nothing more.

Someone asked about extropian relevance. I feel it has to do with
personnel responsibility. I enlisted because that is what I felt
was right. I have always opposed the draft and cannot figure out
how it can exist in a so-called democracy.

The hypocrisy that some were forced to serve while others (based
mostly on economics) were given a pass is something that should
never again be permitted.

I was in the AF for almost nine years...one of those years was in South East
Asia.  I enlisted mostly because I had no choice.  I don't think that boys of
my age back then had much idea of what was right or wrong in this sense.  I've
always felt that there was some basic inconsistency in having a draft in a
"free" society.  I thought slavery was taboo.

I've since decided that slavery in NOT taboo.  The civil war didn't free the
slaves...it merely changed ownership.  Still...a free society is a nice
idea....It'd be nice to see one someday.

Way to go, Brian!  Correct on all counts.  It's time for the silent vets to
speak up and clear the air of the horseshit we've had to put up with then and
ever since.  Those of our generation who did their duty have gotten the
biggest shaft ever (I think).  I am so proud of all you guys who risked
everything for an ideal and have gotten nothing but shit ever since.

Just last week I was at a party where a gray haired lady asked what the red in
the American flag stood for.  I answered that it stood for the blood of the
brave men who died fighting for our freedom.

She acted horrified and said "I'll forgive you for that."

If she was a guy I would have been tempted to belt him, but all I could do was
walk away, seething, in polite silence.

Go Navy!

Damien Broderick cites the Panopticon theory of imprisonment as somewhat a
precursor to the present discussion of high-tech imprisonment.  That allusion
merits some spelling out, since I think it illustrates the naivete of the
notion that enough of the right sort of technology will finally cure the
prison problem.

In the early 90s I visited Joliet Prison (which proudly, and without apparent
irony, calls itself, "Stateville").  The huge and sprawling facility contained
a variety of buildings that reflected the evolution of penal theory, among
them an honest-to-goodness panopticon.  The walls of the panopticon, rising
some 5 stories, formed a large circle around a large, empty courtyard.  A roof
covered the whole.  In the center of the courtyard rose a multi-story guard
tower, its windows staring out toward the walls.  Prisoners' cells lined the
inside of the walls, open on the inside to the view from the tower.

In theory, the panopticon's architecture allowed a handful of guards to easily
monitor a vast number of prisoners.  The guards looked out and across the
courtyard directly into the cells.  Narrow windows on the outside of the cells
ensured that no shadows would harbor wrongdoing.  But in practice the
panopticon failed and went to an early retirement.  I could cite a variety of
technical reasons for the panopticon's failure, but the short of the story is
that human ingenuity repeatedly worked around the supposed infallibilities of
the panopticon's technology.

Perhaps newer and better technology will completely crush the urge to escape
confinement and scrutiny.  But past examples counsel skepticism on that count.

Hmmm... <drums fingers on desk>...  That's actually a pretty good
objection.  Maybe an alternate version would be a good idea.  Still, as
a slogan, I think the first version is slightly better.

What I'm saying is not that we are going to COERCE the world into the
future, but that a lot of people, as always, are going to try to hide
under the blanket, kick up a big stink, and outlaw every form of
technology more complicated than a Whitney gin.  We are going to have to
deal with technophobia.

One of the things a cause needs is a problem to overcome, and it does
help if the problem is political.  I'm treading on really thin ice by
doing that, but as long as I imply reluctance rather than evil
opposition, I haven't crossed the divide into hate-mongering (UNLIKE
people who use the term "entropians", by the way).  The Extropian quest
is not purely technological; we have memes to overcome.

In point of actual fact, the planet WILL go into the future "kicking and
screaming" and it will have to be dragged.  It always has been.

Which makes a nice reply to the people who walk up to you and want to
talk to you about the "kicking and screaming" part.  "Oh, no, we don't
want to force anyone; it's just that part of the problem is the media
getting hysterical about things like cloning and genetic engineering." 
(If challenged, add "There are legitimate issues, but they aren't
raised; there's too much panic-mongering and sensationalism.")

Finally, and most importantly, "lead" isn't quite as vivid as "drag,
kicking and screaming".  I can't think of an equally good phrase offhand.

I'm getting images of people pushing paratroopers out of planes... or
someone convincing a friend to go through with a performance... something of
the like. Implying the opposition is more timidity and momentary fear than
moral opposition. I dunno. Take what you will.

FWIW, my Cognitive Science professor (Michael R.W. Dawson) mentioned the
Kurzweil book this morning in class. I had to correct him on the title
however as he didn't get it right first try. ;)

Not too surprising considering his field I suppose.

I suppose this is rather selfish but when I heard of
the death of Stanley Kubrick the first consequence that
came to my mind was that the film entitled "AI" would
never make it to the big screen.  The rumor mill had
dubbed "AI" has Kubrick's next effort after "Eyes Wide Shut".

While there was (and still is) always a robust rumormill 
circulating about Kubrick, the AI rumor had particular 
substance to it.  There are even indications that Kubrick 
was consorting with Lucas' ILM to bring Kubrick's vision 
to the big screen. Alas, mortality.

Yeah, "lead" is a bit wimpy.  Michael Butler offered "drive" instead of
"lead" but hat doesn't really have a ring to it either.  I guess I was
worrying about the people that see the phrase and *don't* walk over to ask
for clarification.

Actually, the more I read the original, the less it bothers me.  Slogans
_should_ be somewhat provocative and in your face.  As Roseanna Roseanna
Danna might have said, "Nevermind."

Todd, a very popular musician, may be a good prospect (see below).  My
apologies, if this is old news.

   March 9, 1999

                 I saw the Light

                By Todd Rundgren

                    Technology has not changed my life. The
                    chill that many feel when they hear that
                    word is unknown to me. I grew up in a
                    house filled with my father's tools. I
                 don't remember a time without a refrigerator,
                 toaster, electric range, radio, record
                 player...or the TV where Walt Disney showed
                 us Tomorrowland. The family magazine pile
                 was substantially stacked with issues of
                 Popular Science and Popular
                 Mechanics--technology was already
                 "popular."

                 In high school, while others gravitated
                 toward the gymnasium and athletic fields, I
                 found myself showing up at the local Bell
                 Telephone office to watch what is now a
                 primitive form of data processing. After I
                 graduated I joined a band and spent hours
                 honing my "technique"--a style of blues
                 guitar playing called "bottleneck" or "slide" to
                 which I applied a pulley from a computer
                 punched-card sorter.

                 I later discovered the wonders of altered
                 consciousness through substances that were
                 created in a "lab"--complex molecules only
                 recently isolated and synthesized, but around
                 in some form since before man crawled from
                 the ooze. I wondered about other ways of
                 life and cultures, and airliners allowed me to
                 follow the pathways I had only read about
                 and imagined, carried along substantially by
                 the electrified commerce of my American
                 Express card.


                        It is only in those
                        moments, when
                        consciousness is
                       disconnected from
                    mankind and its artifacts,
                     that technology is not a
                    contributing factor to the
                         quality of life.



                 Economics--the inexorable dynamic of the
                 marketplace--has changed my life. There
                 came a time when all the computing power of
                 that roomful of Bell Telephone mainframes
                 was available to me at the cost of a
                 good-quality guitar, which is still a lot less
                 than a grand piano. How could I refuse the
                 latest technologies? It was a perfectly
                 natural buying decision that millions of people
                 have since made.

                 The first automobile was a technology. The
                 millionth automobile is a commodity. Would
                 life be different without a particular
                 technology? Yes, but not for long. Someone
                 would soon recognize the need and discover
                 a way to satisfy it, economics allowing. And
                 we will all experience and benefit from those
                 discoveries. We are not a technologically
                 advanced culture as opposed to, say, a
                 village of Mongolian jute farmers. We are
                 within an economic milieu that makes certain
                 things affordable to us and not to them.

                 Technology allows me to leave quibbles about
                 technology and economics aside. Because of
                 the increasing ubiquity of a relatively
                 primitive technology called the Internet, I
                 can deliver my product to a global audience
                 in the morning, walk the trails of the Na Pali
                 coast in the afternoon and gaze upon the
                 Milky Way at night--from my vantage point,
                 out here in the middle of the ocean, the
                 celestial bodies are vivid and detailed
                 because of the lack of city lights. It is only in
                 those moments, when consciousness is
                 disconnected from mankind and its artifacts,
                 that technology is not a contributing factor
                 to the quality of life. Yet, before long, I start
                 to wonder what it would take to travel to
                 those stars....

                 Todd Rundgren is a producer and musician
                 who is currently creating and selling his
                 music through his web site TR-i.com. When

AFIAK, Ms. Fonda wasn't so much against the war, as for

Note: many (if not most) of those protesters were probably just as clueless
as those boys that went to Vietnam. Kids looking for kicks, brainwashed
with lots of leftist crap which has, especially in Europe, done a *lot* of
damage since then. Of course, the "fascist" regimes that they protested
against weren't any better, they just sucked in different ways. Ultimately
they just replaced one evil with another. The idea behind the Vietnam war 
was sound IMO (contain communism wherever you can), though its implementation was
obviously flawed.

The major flaw was in our trying to fish the colonialist Frenh's fat out of the fire, and getting our own fat fried in the process.  The Vietnamese had fought the French for 30 years; what made us think that another few years of fighting us instead would make them give up?  The only way to win such a war is not to fight it, and let the desire for television and blue jeans to take over and rot their communist souls from within (as is happening now).

The only reason I see for the war in Vietnam as a plausible reason is this:
Failing to oppose communism in ANY theater during the cold war tended to
encourage them to further expansionism. John Von Neumann only knows where we
would be if we did not maintain such a policy for most of the cold war.As for
policy conducting the war, the worst mistake, which caused more deaths than
anything, was the cowardly and traitorous micromanagement and burdensome rules
of engagement that the Johnson administration used in conducting the war (Nixon
was not innocent of this either).

You know, Tokyo Rose served time as a war criminal, as did her Nazi counterpart.
Here, Hanoi Jane not only gets the approbation of the liberals, but marries Ted
Turner, makes hundreds of millions with her workout videos in the capitalist
system she betrayed. I applaud those who stayed here and opposed the war. Those
who went and gave succor to the enemy deserve no respect. I also agree it was a
stupid war to get involved in for the purposes we did. We should have backed Ho
Chi Minh after WWII when he asked us.

Its due to the concept of the militia and the citizen soldier. My own
anti-statist views notwithstanding, the idea that you could stay completely out
of a war effort simply by declaring yourself a concientious objector is false.
It simply puts you into a non-combatant medical billet. If those who were
opposed to the war were so philosophically opposed, why did they not register
themselves as  Concientious Objectors, as they were legally allowed to avoid
combat duty? There were hundreds of times more people protesting than who
actually registered as CO's. That indicates to me a high level of moral
cowardice. They were too chicken to be publicly known as CO's.

Remember the old story of Roman matrons to their sons: "Come home with your
shield, or on it."

On the subject of selectivity, well, the military can accept or deny anyone it
wants to. Just because you are eligible to be drafted does not mean they must
take you. They could decide in what capacity you could best serve the country.
If you were a loner genius, they certainly don't want you in a combat platoon
where teamwork and dumb obedience to orders is most important.

You also should not denigrate those who chose to be officers. A higher
percentage of officers who served in the region died than enlisted men, and in
the Air Force and Navy, unless you were in the SEALs or UDTs, you usually only
did die if you were an officer pilot, unless you got ambushed during R&R in
Saigon.

There is a good article in this week's Aviation Week about
commercial launch vehicles.  Our perennial fave, the Roton
has half a page, and my own best bet the K-1 from Washington
state had half a page.  This is the 8 March 99 issue.

After *aaaaalll* these years, the commercial launch business
is looking very promising.  (Again).  spike

Exactly.  What we want is for people to get intrigued by the T-Shirt;
then they look up Extropian on Alta Vista (first match the Principles
3.0), or Yahoo (Carder-Russell's home page; you can find extropy from
here but it ain't easy), or extropian.com ("Coming soon", no link to
extropy.com or anywhere).

We should try to optimize 'Net searches so that they hit on extropy.com,
which, IMHO, has the best combination of prominence and resources;
there's an immediate link to EWF's FAQ, which IMHO is the best
introduction, and a link to the Principles, the official definition. 
However it's missing a link to Anders's Transhumanist Resources, which
is the third thing to read.

I advise these courses of action:

1.  Register extropy.com with Yahoo.
2.  Link extropian.com to extropy.com until something's there.
3.  On extropy.com, near the top, put in a line saying:  "New to
Extropy?  Read <a=FAQ>the FAQ</a>, <a=principles>the Principles</a>, and
<a=anders>Transhumanist Resources</a>."

Interesting project.  Complete article (brief as it is) located at:

http://www.msnbc.com/news/248255.asp

***********************************************************
Scientists weigh interstellar flight

Preliminary plan calls for sending a telescope far beyond Pluto.

By Alan Boyle
MSNBC

March 9   Scientists are drawing up plans for what might be called an
interstellar Super-Hubble telescope. The plans call for a
robot-controlled, nuclear-powered cruiser to tow an observatory 50 billion
miles or more away from Earth. The challenges involved in turning the
concept into reality are ... well, astronomical. But that doesnt faze the
ideas backers. Were on the first steps of investigating how we take our
first steps, says physicist Roger Lenard.

[snip]

THE BOTTOM LINE
       All this begs the big question: Why do it?
 The Hubble Space Telescope captured this infrared image of an "Einstein
ring," a classic example of a gravitational lens. The bright spot in the
middle is a massive galaxy that has bent the light from an even more distant
galaxy, B1938+666, to form a ringlike pattern.
          The researchers say 50 billion miles is a magic number because at
that point the sun can be used as a gravitational lens: The suns
gravitational influence would bend light rays to a focus, greatly amplifying
the power of a telescope. Lenard said an instrument at the right lensing
point could observe faint objects at the universes farthest reaches, and
even solar systems within distant galaxies.
       There are other reasons to get out of the solar system: A distant
probe would have a view unobscured by the dust that surrounds the sun and
planets. The farther you get from Earth, the easier it would be to create a
three-dimensional map of all the stars in our galaxy.

the anti-patent meme appears to be taking hold more widely. Hopefully it 
will soon overcome its detractors in the courts as well, although I doubt
this ;-)

Can Libertarians and other Freedom Activists

Effectively Use "Fairness" as a Political Weapon?

-------------------------------------------------

by Frederick Mann <<f-prime@activist.com>

<<http://www.buildfreedom.com>


The reason that coercive politicians love to use

"fairness" to justify their policies and programs

is because "fairness" is a strong "button" for most

people. "Everyone must pay their fair share." "We

want fair trade, not free trade." "The Government

needs to provide fair housing for the poor." Etc.


Most (if not all) of us have a sense of "fairness."

When someone treats us unfairly, it tends to raise

our hackles.


Microsoft gets attacked because of its allegedly

"unfair business practices."


The IRS is hated by many because some of its procedures

and practices -- not to speak of high tax rates --

are widely perceived as unfair.


The recent campaign against the proposal for the "Know

Your Customer" regulations resulted in over 240,000

letters and e-mail messages condemning the proposed

regulations sent to the FDIC, and seems to have at

least delayed implementation of the regulations. The

significance is that the right issue can be used to

reach large numbers of people and persuade them to

take action.


Also significant is that the Internet makes it easy,

convenient, and quick for people to take actions such

as submitting objections to the appropriate agency,

writing to their state or federal representatives and

senators, writing letters to the editor, etc.


The Libertarian Party set up the Defend Your Privacy!

website at <<http://www.defendyourprivacy.com/>. A

number of similar websites can be set up, each for

a specific issue.


Consider, for example, the "New River, AZ Siege"

<<http://www.web-writer.com/newriver/> and the article

'Feds to lift 'siege' of Arizona town - Residents win

standoff against BATF, EPA'

<<http://www.worldnetdaily.com/bluesky_exnews/19990309_xex_feds_to_lift.shtml>.

The "New River Siege" website could have had an "Action

Page" that is automated as far as possible for people

to take action by sending messages to BATF, EPA, the

appropriate politicians, etc. The Fed's behaviour

could have been denounced as *unfair*.


I suspect that "unfair" is much more powerful than

"unconstitutional."


Such an "Unfair-Issue" website can be set up by a

profreedom business, for example, a gun manufacturer.

In addition to serving as a "campaign vehicle" regarding

the "unfair issue," the website serves an advertising

purpose -- "This website is provided by ABC Guns -

Click here to see our superb guns and rifles." So,

setting up and maintaining the website can be a

profitable activity.


Some libertarian Web Designers could specialize in

setting up and maintaining "Unfair-Issue" websites

and offer their services to appropriate businesses

and organizations.


It may be worthwhile to quickly set up one or more

"UNFAIR IRS" websites to take advantage of April 15

and Tax Freedom Day (May 10th, last year)

In addition to physical protests, through "Unfair Issues"

websites, the means can be provided for largely automated

electronic protests on a wide scale.


The Unfair-Issue Strategy may be particularly appropriate for

any individuals, groups, companies, or organizations that suffer

unfair government attacks:


* Unfair FCC microradio raids

<<http://www.onr.com/user/gnn/main.html>;


* Unfair FDA raids against alternative health practitioners;


* Unfair targeting of gun manufacturers;


* Unfair persecution of people in "sex industries" and

their customers;


* Unfair property seizures;


* Etc, etc.


* Unfair treatment of libertarian author Peter McWilliams

        It truly is unfortunate.  Kubrick was by far my favorite director,
due to his ability to emphasize meaning beyond the confines of text and
acting ability.  I can only imagine the things he could have done with a
movie about AIs.

>From information that I've read about extrasolar planet searches it would
appear that stellar flaring *is* a major concern, at least in some
astronomers' minds, as something that could greatly reduce the survival
chances of life in general. I'll refer you here to
http://www.kepler.arc.nasa.gov/nature.html, and the comment at the end of that
page related to stellar flaring and the need for life-promoting stars to be
more massive than M-class on that account. Now it may be that this concern
over flares is relatively minor compared to the concern over tidal locking,
mentioned in the same sentence, you may be right that sea life wouldn't be as
affected by flares and radiation from space generally. We're mainly concerned
here about land dwelling creatures, who'd be out in the open air to a great
extent, or dependent on a surface ecology, and *not* safe in an ocean, since
it seems there's a consensus of sorts that technology builders need to have
access to open air to make fire, start refining metals, etc. As for saying
that modest differences in atmosphere thickness would tend to totally remove
this concern, that's the sort of detail where I don't have any special
expertise to weigh those numbers at the moment. One interesting possibility is
that a larger planet with a much thicker atmosphere would do better on the
tidal locking problem as well, since the thicker atmosphere could easily lend
itself to a nice greenhouse effect, thus keeping the planet warm at a greater
distance from the star, where there's much less tidal influence to lock the
planet into having a permanent "day" and "night" side. Such a "locked"
situation is quite undesirable, apparently, but it would seem that a thicker
atmosphere would tend to make the most hospitable planets less prone to this
problem, besides providing more radiation protection.

See my above comment, and also again, see the graph at
http://www.kepler.arc.nasa.gov/nature.html, where it would appear that for "K"
stars, at least, there ought to be planets forming in the "life bearing" zone.
One thing I'd note is that I've read elsewhere that some theories have tended
to widen the outer edge of the Habitable Zone out considerably, so maybe even
the smaller "M" stars could support life, especially if the planet has a
relatively very thick atmosphere? As judge of a closely related claim on the
Foresight Exchange "idea futures" market, I try to keep up (the claim being
called "Earth2", "Habitable Earth-class planet").

These are the very points that interest me about a planetary situation that
would be much tougher to launch out of than our own. Right at the outset, it
would appear that regular bulk scale chemical rocket technology simply could
not do the trick of launching satellites to twice the orbital speed that we
require. Because of this, the ET's in that situation would miss out on the
"dawn of the Space Age" as we've experienced it. At the same time, if they
take awhile developing nanotech and any related technologies that might be
helpful, it's difficult to say for certain what other problems might come
about as a result of missing that early opportunity. For instance, suppose
that some of the ET's make use of technology to boost their own reproductive
capacity, maybe they just naturally produce more offspring than we do, or
maybe it's an evolutionarily persistent pattern, to use nano/biotech in that
direction *before* the advanced space stuff is available. In that sort of
situation, who knows if a heavily populated planet will ever be rich enough to
build the advanced launching devices? Maybe it'll be populated with floating
islands all across any oceans, and no one willing to allow a nanotech space
launcher next door!

Admittedly, this "ET's trapped on large planets" idea is mostly speculation,
at this point. Although I don't claim any "burden of proof" on this, it just
seems possible, that's all, a possible answer to how there might be some
hundreds or thousands of technological civilizations in our galaxy, with maybe
a few tens or hundreds of them just possibly being detectable message senders
for someone with a *very* good receiver? Though I'm just guessing at numbers,
if smaller stars are both longer-lived *and* more numerous than stars like our
sun, and if it takes a special kind of planet to bear life in that
longer-lived situation, the heavy planet scenario may be the result -- with
ourselves being the lucky oddballs, evolving faster than anyone else, in a
situation where bulk tech can actually get into orbit early in our history.

The thing to remember here is that it's the fundamentally progressive ideas
behind the whole question of the Fermi Paradox that tend to inspire some sort
of effort to explain why advanced ET's haven't expanded into our vicinity by
now. From what I can see, people who advocate SETI programs mostly don't take
Fermi's Paradox too seriously -- it's just assumed that advanced species wish
to talk, but that they've never quite expanded steadily outward for some
reason. In contrast to this "practical" lack of theorizing, it may be someday
be important for ET searches to have one or two well developed theories on
this -- theories might guide where we'd want a really big detector array to
look, for instance. In the meantime, let's not just assume the negative answer
of "no communicative ET's" just because it's hard to imagine that they've
somehow missed the space development options that we're pretty sure they've
must've missed in any case, if they *do* exist! Either they aren't here
because they've failed to evolve in our past universe thus far, or because
they've evolved but failed to go space settling, for whatever reason, or
because they've gone settling, but somehow failed to occupy some really major
niches, as in the "Burning the Commons" idea. No matter how you slice it, it
seems that we here on Earth are in a very unusual, hopeful, situation in being
the first to have a chance at starting a fairly efficient settlement wave,
either that, or we face whatever doom or hidden limit which may have stopped
potential "others" from expanding directly out to us.

Wow.

That's amazing.

It's got militarism, elitism, us vs. them AND starry-eyed pro-singularitarianism.

The worst memes of the limbic system wrapped in an easy to swallow extropian coating.

I love it. I'd follow it, and I consider that fact to be a serious defect in the makeup of my cognitive architecture

If we ever do an extropian memetics textbook, this HAS to be the chapter 1 case study.

P.S. Memetic tar-pit or not, I REALLY liked the part about the rainforest. Again, kudos!

KPJ,

   I think we have both delineated some possible models of the personalities
of Powers.  I would guess that we weigh the various probabilities of these
various models differently.  I suppose my goal is to strive to discover,
create, and/or become post-Singularity Power(s) which have the values I have
come to cherish in humanity, preferably with a minimum of the faults.  You say
that there is only fairness among equals?  I would go even further and say
that the Universe is a profoundly unfair place, even for those engaged in
overall equal relationships, because I doubt that any two beings are ever
completely equally matched in their advantages and disadvantages over time.
Sometimes one is more powerful, sometimes the other.  Now, I happen to believe
that we should work to impose some degree of "fairness" upon the Universe, by
which I mean some sort of consistent (though not static) set of rules for
living in a society which will maximize the potential for personal growth and
freedom while minimizing harm and fear thereof.  Now these two are not always
complementary values, thus there are many possible ideas as to what the
optimum society is.  Extropianism puts a premium on freedom and self-
determinism, allowing a large amount of risk and uncertainty, but limits that
freedom when it comes to those who try to take it away from others (which is a
perfectly reasonable constraint in my opinion).  Other systems weigh these
competing values differently.  Getting a little off-topic here....let's just
say I agree it is easier to have a "fair" system among relative equals.  I do
not know that it is impossible to have a "fair" system among those of varying
abilities; I can imagine a community of those of unequal levels of ability who
share a similar worldview nontheless and would be willing to all live by the
same code of social interaction.  I would say that a system which treats
everyone as equals is not realistic....what about one that treats all persons
as precious, from the least puny brain to the greatest Power, of unique worth
in and of itself.

Gotta have me one of them T-shirts!  Let me know when I can get my grubby
hands on one.

Here's another promotional idea.

I was glancing at a calendar today . . . 365 sheets, each with a pretty
picture of children doing cute things and a semi-thoughtful quote, and I
started thinking how nice it would be to see a calendar spreading Extropian
memes via Extropian-related quotes linked with Extropian art.  If we don't
have enough art for 365 days, do we have enough for 52 weeks?  I bet we
could come up with 52 good quotes that best represent Extropian principles.
I would ask Natasha to consider overseeing how the art might be linked to
the quotes once they were gathered.  Perhaps the final product could be in
the form of a screensaver and offered through CNET and other screensaver
sites?  Or actually marketed through bookstores for a profit.

Your thoughts?

Scott B.

Did somebody say "link quotes with artwork"?  I HREF you to
http://just-so.com/ (Just-So Literary Postcards), where exactly that is
already being done, albeit with classic art and literature.

I can't think of a much better way to spread a meme to another person, than to
send them an Extropian e-card. Would make for a good way to get transhuman
artwork projected onto more eyeballs, at least. Along with an appropriate,
uplifting quote.

I can set something like that up rather easily.  Needs a database back-end to
work well, though.  I guess I could donate the server space and db for it.

The hardest part, really, is to pick out which image to associate with which
quote, so they "click" together well.

The assumption that the Big Bang theory is correct, and therefore imposes a time
limit, looms large in these discussions.  IMHO there are many problems with the
BB [I've started a page with links to them at
http://www.mmsweb.com/eykiw/bb/bb.htm].

As John Kierein summarizes:
"Stars in our galaxy and globular clusters are thought to be older than 14
billion years and there seem to be similar stars that are seen in galaxies that
are many billions of light years away from us and thus apparently formed closer
to the time of the big bang.

Even our earth is thought to be 5 billion years old, and is expected to exist
for another 5 billion years before the sun expands and swallows it up.  The
atoms and molecules of the earth are thought to have been generated in previous
stars that went through several cycles of supernovae. Even though
supernovae are thought to last only fraction of our sun's lifetime, it is highly
improbable that there is sufficient time for these cycles to have occurred since
a big bang.

Similarly, our galaxy is rotating at a speed that only permits from 45 to 60
rotations since the big bang, which (according to Mitchell) is not a long enough
time for it to achieve its spiral shape.  Many spiral galaxies are seen at a
large distance and therefore from a time closer to the big bang which would
indicate they would have had time for even fewer rotations. Recent Hubble Photo
shows spiral galaxies within 5% of big bang time leaving time for only 2 or 3
rotations at our galaxy's rotation rate. The galaxies in this photo don't seem
to be crowded closer together as one would expect if they were really so close
to the big bang.

There are some very large chains of galaxies spread throughout the universe.  It
is believed these large structures, like the "great wall", would require many
hundreds of billions of years to form.

The temperature of intergalactic space was predicted by Guillaume, Eddington,
Regener, Nernst, Herzberg, Finlay-Freundlich and Max Born based on a universe in
dynamical equilibrium without expansion. They predicted the 2.7 degree K
background temperature prior to and better than
models based on the Big Bang. See "History of the 2.7 K Temperature Prior to
Penzias and Wilson" by A. K. T. Assis and M. C. D. Neves in Aperion Vol.2, Nr.
3, page 79f, July 1995.

There are many other discrepancies in redshift observations that are much better
explained by non-doppler shifts. Hubble, of course, didn't agree that the
redshift was doppler (see his book
"The Observational Approach to Cosmology" or Alan Sandage's discussion of
Hubble's beliefs).  There were several difficulties with this interpretation
that he pointed out.  Not the least of which is that if it were doppler, then
not only should each photon be stretched out by the doppler effect, but also the
distance between each photon.   Because the photon flux is reduced, this causes
the object undergoing a doppler redshift to appear less bright than a
corresponding object undergoing a
non-doppler redshift.  Hubble knew his observations were not in agreement with
this brightness correction.  He also knew that a simpler, non-curved-space
cosmology resulted from a non-doppler interpretation, and he felt that simpler
was better.  He didn't know what causes the photons to lose energy as they
travel through space, but he felt that it is some "new principle of nature" that
I think is the Compton effect.

As big bang theorists attempt to solve the age problem by making the time to the
big bang longer, they exacerbate the quasar problem. Quasars become even farther
away and intrinsically brighter. Yet their temperature remains that of ordinary
stars as exhibited by emission spectra of metallic ions
that can only exist at a limited range of temperature. They are known to be
about stellar size since they vary in brightness on a scale of a few minutes to
seconds. How do they stay so bright at
such a low temperature in such a small volume? They can't. They must have an
intrinsic non-doppler redshift and be nearby to be explained.

If quasars are nearby, they may even exhibit proper motion in the sky as the
Earth travels around the
sun.  Such a proper motion has been seen.  See Quasar Absolute Proper Motion
[http://hometown.aol.com/spacetimer/page/index.htm] for a table that includes
such proper motion observations."

One alternative to the BB would be a universe infinite in time and space, the
plazma universe theory proposed by Alfgen

I was thinking about the RainForest/Extropian connection this morning
and the comment someone made that science will eventually replace all
of the extinct animals we've killed...

In this month's Discover magazine there's an article about Japanese
scientists that want to clone a Wooly Mammoth.

Humans with our technology have done great damage to our planet (or at
least parts of it).  The left-greenies (Al Gore comes to mind) suggest
that we should rethink our reliance on technology as a possible
solution.  Us Extropians know that that's hogwash.

Technology got us into this mess (pollution, extinctions, etc.), and
it's the only thing that can get us out.

Your average Joe on the street probably wouldn't even pause to
consider that immortality is inevitable, but he may get excited to
know that technology will eventually help us rebuild our planet.

If we, as Extropians, are to become activists, maybe this could be a
large part of our message.  I think people will "buy" into the idea of
technology as a curative force for the planet quicker than they will
"buy" one primarily promoting immortality, space colonization, and
artificial intelligence.  (Not to say that we should back off those
subjects...)

I can't speak to whether or not this is a Steady State Universe, but I
would like to note that this *would* solve the Great Filter Paradox. 
Even if the Powers expand at lightspeed, or faster, or MUCH faster,
there would still, always and eternally, be islands with no
Singularities for an arbitrary distance.

The question would be figuring the formula, using (say) lightspeed
geometric vs. exponential growth-rate assumptions, the probability of a
given island being absorbed during a given time-period.  If this number
is too high, then we have the result that, even though we've managed to
survive until today, the probability is still 1000:1 (for!) that we'll
be absorbed by tomorrow, or maybe even during the next second.

In this case, Yudkowsky's Modified Anthropic Occam's Razor kicks in and
basically says "This theory has failed so many times that we might as
well assume it's wrong."

YMAOR:  That simplest explanation is true, which most uniquely predicts
the present given the past, with the least reference to the Anthropic Principle.

MAOR:  That simplest explanation is true, which predicts the present
given the past, with the least reference to the Anthropic Principle.

AOR:  That simplest explanation is true which least invokes the
Anthropic Principle.

OR:  The simplest explanation is the most probable.

It is an excellent idea. The "Extropic Earth" movement in my opinion, should work as a synergizer to
encourage industry to invest in such projects, perhaps it could push for such regs, where if, say
someone want to build a dam that threatens a species like the snail darter, they must construct
habitat for the species elsewhere to compensate, just as many developers do now with wetlands. I know
advocating government regs is anathema to most on the list, but it is how the current system works.
Trying to make one change is hard enough without trying to force everyone to make the change the way
you want them to. Suggestions?

An idea I had for private species recovery would to possibly make a lottery system, where people can
buy as many tickets they want, voting for the species they want to see brought back. When some magic
number of dollars is reached, the ticket selected as the winner decides which species 'wins' the
dollars for its reintroduction.

Comments???

Hmm...? I don't have the time right now, but there is an argument
*against* the steady-state theory based on the paucity of aliens in
Tipler & Barrow's _The Anthropic Cosmological Principle_. They seem to
reach the exact opposite conclusion than you.

Note: nothing in the below should be construed as partisanship, and my
purpose is not to reopen old wounds; rather it is to forestall
misunderstandings after commitments have been made and money has been
spent. P.S. I'm not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice.

Prudence dictates: 

Get a waiver letter from an officer of Extropy Institute before you
silkscreen up a bunch of shirts.

It is a matter of historical fact that people have done t-shirts using an
organization name (or a symbol or mark, or a word which brings that
organization to mind) without jumping through the proper hoops, and have
been promised lawsuits unless they stopped distributing same.
Ugly. Bad all around. Yiccchh.

Actually, I reach the same conclusion.  Apply YMAOR; if we're early
enough, relative to the Big Bang, that we could plausibly be the first
intelligent species in the Universe, or at least the lightspeed horizon,
then this theory uniquely predicts the Great Silence experience with one
reference to the Anthropic Principle.

The steady-state theory predicts steadily shrinking volumes of free
space, contactee civilizations, and thus requires continuous references
to the Anthropic Principle to establish us as both in free space
yesterday and free space today - it predicts the present, but not as a
unique result of the past.  By YMAOR, this is the less preferable explanation.

The Tiplerian version probably argued that the elder races would be
expansionist and Universe-filling, regardless of improbability, if past
time extended into infinity; or even a substantially long time compared
to the age of the Earth.

"Explain" is not the same thing as "predict".  Wheeler's QM
interpretation predicts the existence of our world - in fact, it
predicts it as a certainty, not just a remote probability.  It
eliminates the ugly blemish of state-vector reduction, which is
incompatible with both relativity and Schrodinger unitary evolution.  By
Occam's Razor, it is correct.  You have to use YMAOR in order to observe
that modern QM more "uniquely" predicts our world, as opposed to all the
other Wheelerian branches.

Infinite space predicts everything as effectively as Wheeler, which
makes it a semi-palatable alternative to a Great Filter Paradox with
*no* apparent resolution.  It is still unpalatable compared to the idea
that Earth lies on the earliest possible edge of the stage where
intelligence is possible.  The problem is that we can see ancient
galaxies with much higher fractions of heavy elements.

I agree fully.  My permission, or lack thereof, to use my particular
phrasing or graphic arrangement on T-Shirts, does not imply the
permission of Extropy Institute or similar stakeholders to use any
terms, trademarked or simply memetically "staked", or claim any official
status, which would require the permission of Extropy Institute or imply
the recognition of Extropy Institute or similar entities.  Everyone got that?

Let's hear from ExI.

I agree that putting more stress on the curative effects of technology
would help widespread acceptance of our meme-complex. And we don't just
have to point to the future--it's clear that in the most technologically
advanced countries, pollution has been reduced. Here in Los Angeles, the
air is far cleaner that it was in the 1960 and 70s, despite many more
people and cars. Fish life has been returning to the Great Lakes, and so
on. The more wealth we have, and the more intelligent our technology, the
more easily we can reduce pollution and even restore species.

ExI has recognized the importance of this point and at least started to do
something about it. While I understand the sheer reactive, emotional appeal
of Eliezer's line about the rainforests, it's a terribly harmful thing to
say. At Extro 3 we had a session on market-based high environmentalism, and
Greg Burch has some excellent writing on his web site on this topic. I
would like to see a specific section for extropian thinking on the
environment on ExI's web site.

Techno-market-greenly yours,

Max

>It is an excellent idea. The "Extropic Earth" movement in my opinion,
should work as a synergizer to encourage industry to invest in such
projects, perhaps it could push for such regs, where if, say someone want
to build a dam that threatens a species like the snail darter, they must
construct habitat for the species elsewhere to compensate, just as many
developers do now with wetlands. I know advocating government regs is
anathema to most on the list, but it is how the current system works.

This is not the *only* way the system works and, despite some people's
attempt to paint me as statism-friendly, I would be strongly opposed to
encouraging any such regulations. In fact, I would support lobbying efforts
to abolish the EPA.

One other way that is already being used is best exemplified by the Nature
Conservancy. I was a member some years ago and should look into renewing
(after checking out what they've been up to). In contrast to groups that
look to government to force people to preserve areas of land unchanged, the
Nature Conservancy raises money then *buys* the land and sets it aside so
that it is not built upon. I presume this could sometimes actually bring in
a profit to the NC, if they charged a fee for hikers, limited camping
activities, etc.

The great thing about this approach is that is uses markets, coerces no
one, and reflects people preferences rather than the effectiveness of a
lobbying group in forcing their preferences on others.

It's interesting how preferences vary. Immediately south of where Natasha
and I live (between Marina del Rey and Playa del Rey) is a stretch of
unused land. While Natasha wants to see it remain unused (see likes the
open space), I wouldn't mind seeing it "developed", since I find that area
quite unattractive--no interesting flora or fauna or physical features. But
if money was raised to buy the land (I don't know who owns it now--probably
some part of the state), I could not object. Other areas of unused land
that I find attractive, I would pay money to preserve. For example, if
someone wanted to smooth out the top of Mt. San Jacinto and build a house
or hotel on top, I would quite upset (I *love* to hike up there) and would
pay to keep it as is.

I think this kind of idea is exactly the sort of constructive response we
should be making (*in addition to* showing that the environmental problems
are not as bad as many make them out to be, and that in many respects we're
making steady progress). Before you can bring back species, you need a DNA
sample (though eventually, with enough computing power, we should be able
to reconstruct the probably genetic configuration of lost species from
related ones). I haven't heard what they have been up to lately, but
several people have talked about projects to preserve tissue samples of
endangered species. Gregory Benford wrote about the LifeArk Project (or
similar name), and the Foresight Institute talked about the Bioarchive
Project. Anyone know what became of these? Once the ExI web site changes
(explained in the Exponent that I'll be putting up very soon) are underway,
there should be a section for information on projects like these.

Any more ideas for what to call this approach? "High Tech Free Market
Environmentalism" is a mouthful. "Extropic Earth" excludes off-planet
ecologies. Maybe simply "Extropian Environmentalism"?

No, not quite that: if there are two explanations that explain the
same things equally well, choose the simplest one. (most likely
Eliezer's short description is to be interpreted in the same way as
the declaration :-)

Hell yes, if someone decided to sue you, they could sue you for (ab)use
or infringement of trade or service mark even if you gave it away.

Example: 1970's "Cocaine" t-shirts were chased and put down by Coca-Cola
because of dilution of and infringement upon their (Coke's) trademark and
distinctive script styling used in the "old Coke" logo.

Income isn't the issue. Damage is the issue.

Alas, Max, the Nature Conservancy has made a practice of handing over to
statist officials the title to the lands they have purchased.  For that
reason, I let my membership lapse.  I would, however, heartily support a more
enlightened organization that keeps title to wild lands and develops money-
making recreational uses of them.  One big problem:  Any private park has to
compete with multitudes of subsidized statist ones.

Sheesh, you can't win.  Write pessimistic extrapolations and you get
dinged for being a humorless nanosurvivalist; write humor and you get
dinged for being politically incorrect.  Write full-scientific-mode
articles and you aren't memetically attractive; write slogans and you're
unfairly taking advantage of emotions.  And did I mention that I get
dinged for competing with my fellow Extropians?

I know perfectly well that Life As We Know It is by no means whatsoever
designed so that winning is possible.  In fact, my current goal is only
to LOSE in INTERESTING WAYS... even though a unprejudiced evaluation of
the probability branches reveals that, on the whole, maintaining belief
in the possibility of positive action results in better outcomes for
those Universes in which this is possible.  But then, WE are Extropians!
 WE make the Universe INTERESTING!  Isn't that better than the
Principles? (*)

Anyway, the point is that anyone who reads the banner, in the proper
context of "remove industry" followed by "crush rainforests" should get
the correct message, i.e. "WE can make the Earth a paradise, but frankly
the environmentalists are starting to ANNOY us."

In fact, given the political correctness of environmentalism, some form
of sarcasm is needed to avoid triggering the anti-bogosity filters that
have evolved in our target audience.

(*) = Close captioned for the humor impaired:  Each of the statements is
in the style corresponding to that mentioned in the paragraph above.  I
am NOT being serious.

How about state level environmental agencies? How about the Army Corps of
Engineers control over any damp spot of land under the justification that it is a
'waterway' (under that justification, any game trail should be under the control
of the highway department. "Hey mr. rabbit, where is your driver's license?")?

I don't like the fact that the NC has been involved in the efforts in NH and VT to
shut down all logging operations just because one specimen of a non-native bat
species which is endangered was found in bat caves on private property (one in VT
and one in NH, which sounds kinda fishy to me). Its forcing logging companies to
give away the townships they own to the conservation groups, and long time tenant
leaseholders, like my family, will lose their leases when these out of state
groups take over the land.

Its basically a strategy for city slickers to steal their own game preserves, and
get free cabins (ours) to boot, while excluding the locals who were on the land
previously. Some of them came by a couple years ago to try to talk the local camp
owners into joining their group. We all told them to take a hike.

I'm working on forming a Leaseholders Conservation Association in the township our
cabin is in, so that when the paper company gets pressured into giving up the
township, we'll have primacy to take control of the town.

I'm not too concerned with off planet ecologies at the moment, and using the
Extropic Earth name will help dilute the radical influence of such groups as
'Earth First' (as much as I respect their dedication and fervency, no matter how
badly directed). Once we discover an exo-ecology, we can address conserving it.
Extropic Earth also, to me, exudes a homey, "we are all in this together" quality
that should inspire the joiners to get evangelized about applying extropic
concepts to environmental practices.

Coming up with a detailed strategy of extropoesis using extropic concepts like my
re-animation lottery should be a priority, and have it published and distributed
to the more rational environmental groups as position papers.

This is old science. The conflict of the cosmological constants has been tenatively
reconciled with the help of Hubble Space Telescope measurements.

Moreover, as Anders and others have pointed out here, the anti-BBers always tend to
conveniently ignore the problem of the infinite light levels in their arguments....

Depends on the size of the stars. Yellow dwarf stars are extremely long lived as
stars go. The giant type stars are short lived, as evidenced by the extremely old
nebulae, and the proven existence of galactic core black holes. Raise the ambient
radiation levels around a star enough (thus creating the stellar equivalent of a
greenhouse effect) or raise its mass, and you will age it faster. This is why stars
near the galactic core are 'older', even stars that are near the mass of our own. As
stars move from the arms to the intersticine spaces, their rates of aging also
change.

Galactic rotation was faster then, as such rotation is based on the radius of the
core black hole. As the core black hole expands, its rate of rotation slows due to
relativistic drag effects. Thus, the number of rotations should not be based on the
current rotation rate of our own galaxy. Because gravity is light speed limited, you
can calculate the rotation speed near the core 50,000 years ago by the current
rotation speed of the outer edge. Extrapolate this back in 50,000 ly steps to the
time of the big bang, and I think you'll find that the number of rotations goes up
by quite a bit.

Beleived by who? Current inflationary models show that the 'bubble' and 'wall'
accretion structures we see are a natural product of the big bang.

As I recently discussed with another person, any theory that maintains a steady
state universe must reconcile without flim flam the fact that such a universe would
have infinitely high levels of background radiation. Even if you postulate that
light as it travels great distances will be degraded over time down the spectrum to
redder and redder frequencies, it still creates a hugh cosmic greenhouse effect.

Even if the photons lose energy themselves, the energy does not just dissapear. For
example, a hydrogen atom gets hit by a photon with enough energy to make its
electron jump to the third shell. Since the electron wants to go back to the first
shell, it can either dump all the energy into one photon of equal energy to the one
that hit it, or two photons, one having the 3rd shell to 2nd shell energy, and the
other having the 2nd shell to 1st shell energy. Unless there are other types of
decay which can dissipate energy into other forms of matter (in which case they can
be experimentally verified in any laboratory), then there is no net energy loss. In
which case a steady state universe will pile up infinite energy levels, leading to
background energy levels so high that the vacuum should collapse upon itself from
the energy density (i.e. infinite energy levels means the whole universe is a black
hole). This is an obvious contradiction to the whole idea of the 'steady state',
thus negating itself as a viable theory.

unless the quasars are in fact, as has been theorized, merely the polar emission
jets of glactic black holes which are pointed our way.

But doesn't a universe "infinite in space and time" make the Great Filter that much more baffling? Now we have to explain the abscence of an infinite amount of civilisations/Powers. Under the Big Bang theory, we have the hard-enough problem of explaining why a large but finite past light cone is empty.
Because our past light cone under BB is finite, we can at least BEGIN to speculate about probabilities.
How do you propose to explain the emptiness of an infinite light cone?

My wife looked at that jpg and she said that maybe we shouldn't say we

exist.

How about We Reject Income Taxes, Ignorance, etc. ?

CHICAGO - The Associated Press via
NewsEdge Corporation : Contradicting
current medical theories, a 14-year study of
nearly 89,000 women found no evidence
that a high-fat diet promotes breast cancer
or that a low-fat diet protects against it.

Experts were quick to note that a low-fat
diet is still good for the heart and other
aspects of health. They said the study
indicates a need to look more carefully at
how diet may affect the risk of breast
cancer.

``We should just accept that good
scientists can't tell you yet what to eat to
minimize your breast-cancer risk,'' said Dr.
John A. Glaspy of the University of California
at Los Angeles, who was not involved in the
research.

The Harvard study was published in
Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association.

Doctors have theorized that eating lots of
fat increases breast-cancer risk. They have
based their thinking on animal studies,
international comparisons and studies of
women who developed breast cancer and
women who didn't.

Others have suggested that the key is the
type of fat consumed, rather than the
amount; that fish oil offers some protection
from breast cancer; or that contaminants
stored in fat trigger breast cancer.

The new study tracked 88,795 women in the
continuing Nurses' Health Study. The
women, ages 30 to 55, completed detailed
questionnaires about their eating habits
every four years from 1980 to 1994.

Researchers compared the diets of the
women without breast cancer and the 2,956
women whose breast cancer was discovered
during the course of the study.

Breast cancer was found to be no more
common among women who ate lots of fat,
or among those who ate a large proportion
of animal fat, polyunsaturated fat (vegetable
fat) or trans-unsaturated fat (partially
hydrogenated oils, such as those used in
margarine and to cook doughnuts and french
fries).

Nor was breast cancer any less common in
women who got a high proportion of their
fats from fish oil or who got less than 20
percent of their total calories from fat.

``Our research indicates it's highly unlikely
that women who consume a low-fat diet are
protected against breast cancer,'' said the
study's lead author, Dr. Michelle D. Holmes,
an instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical
School and Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston. ``Equally, it appears a high-fat diet
also poses no increased risk for the disease.''

Most surprisingly, women who ate the least
fat appeared to have a 15 percent higher
rate of breast cancer, the researchers said.
But Holmes said she's not ready to conclude
that a low-fat diet increases breast cancer
risk, because the finding was based on fewer
than 1,000 women who ate less than 20
percent of calories as fat.

UCLA's Glaspy said the new research ``is
something that we're going to need to
explain.''

He said fat intake may need to be very low _
as little as 10 percent of total calories _ to
reduce breast-cancer risk. He also noted
that only some kinds of fish oil have
appeared beneficial in previous studies. The
new study did not distinguish between
types.

Nor did it run long enough to explore the
possibility that dietary effects may take
longer than 14 years to emerge, he said.
Glaspy believes that diet interacts with
environmental factors in subtler ways than
scientists have been able to identify.

The theory that dietary fat is linked to
breast cancer arose from the observation
that breast-cancer rates are far lower in
traditional Asian cultures, where diets are
generally low in fat.

Compared with women in Western cultures,
traditional Asian women start menstruating
later, give birth at a younger age and gain
far less weight in adulthood _ all factors that
decrease breast-cancer risk, Holmes noted

NASA will launch an emergency
                  repair mission this fall to the Hubble
                  Space Telescope, which is in danger
                  of shutting down. 

                  NASA decided Wednesday to move
                  up the next regularly scheduled
                  Hubble visit to October so that
                  spacewalking astronauts can fix the
                  telescope's deteriorating pointing
                  system. The mission had been set for
                  June 2000. 

                  Two of Hubble's six gyroscopes, needed for pointing and
stability, have
                  failed since astronauts' last service call, in 1997. And
a third gyroscope is
                  partly broken and is considered unreliable.

That wasn't to you, it was to the fellow who complained about my using
"the worst memes of the limbic system".

I don't feel that I did so, at least in the sense of deliberately
invoking them.  I make every effort to keep my mind clean.  However. 
There is no way I can write effective slogans without triggering those
emotions to some degree in the part of the audience in which they are
already present.  In that case, the most you can hope for is that
somebody taking elitist pride in being a scientist will eventually
stumble on evolutionary psychology and feel obliged to believe it.

>From http://slashdot.org/features/99/03/09/1544207.shtml

Engineers, programmers and futurists believe that programmable robots that
provide sexual companionship are likely to be commonplace in the 21st
century, at more or less the same time as computers become able to process
information as quickly as the human brain. The implications of tactile
sexbots, likely to contain vibrators, sound systems and other equipment,
are as significant as they are unexamined. If you thought the fight over
the CDA was bad, wait till Rev.  Falwell and his many pious friends in
Congress discover Sexbots. For better or worse, computing might be
breaking down another big wall.  Techno-futurists have a sorry record when
it comes to predicting technology and the future. Remember the
intergalactic travel that was the centerpiece of Disney's Tomorrowland?
The magnetic hover cars, cancer cures, and climate-control systems that
were supposed to have been long in place by the Millenium? And only a
handful of technologists imagined how big the Net would get.  But here's a
futuristic vision that's a far surer and troubling bet than e-sex:
sexbots.  For several years now, engineers and futurists have been writing
(quietly) in academic journals and other venues about the intuitive
computer-programmed robots - sexual companions that contain vibrators to
provide tactile stimulation and sounds systems to provide love talk - that
some researchers believe are likely to become commonplace in the next
century.  A few years ago, these predictions could have been brushed off
as more digital hype, but computers are obviously becoming more
intelligent and intuitive, and are fast processing information as rapidly
as the human brain. Inventors and futurists like Ray Kurzweil (author of
The Age of Spiritual Machines), are guaranteeing that computers will equal
or surpass human intelligence early in the 21st century.  So sexbots not
only don't seem far-fetched, they seem likely.  The contemporary news
media, odd in many ways, are never more so than when it comes to their
reticence to talk openly about sex (unless it's Presidential). They talk
about sex scandals and Viagra, but the ordinary experience of sexuality is
almost a taboo. The Net has liberated sex from XXX-rated movie theaters
and porn parlors - it's the third biggest money-maker online, after
e-trading and shopping.  For better or worse, it's hard to think of a
bigger killer app for computing and software than sexbots. According to a
computing engineer who asked not to be quoted, prototypes of sexbots
already exist in Japan.  "I guarantee you," he e-mailed me, "that within
25 years, programmable, digital sexbots will be in many, if not most,
American homes and apartments."  The idea of sexbots will be horrifying to
many, for whom the very idea of mechanized, roboticized human passion is
beyond any Orwellian nightmare. Mary Shelley, who warned in the novel
"Frankenstein" about scientists playing God, and the horrors of unthinking
technology, would have flipped-out over the very idea of sexbots. Yet for
some people - the lonely, the severely handicapped, the isolated - sexbots
could be a great relief and release. And for others - unhappy spouses,
troubled adolescents - digitalized, mechanized sexuality is an open
invitation to addiction or to avoiding problems of face-to-face human
contact.  Robotic sex would also eliminate the emotional component of sex.  
Like fertility drugs and cloning, this is the kind of technological issue
in urgent need of discussion and consideration, even though history
suggests it won't be thought about much at all in advance. Like the drugs
that give couples the option of having seven or eight children at once, or
the medical technology that prolongs life sometimes beyond reason,
sexbots, will simply be here one day, and we'll be on our own when they
appear.  But sexbots are a techno-prediction that has the ring of truth.
Writer Joel Snell predicted in l997 (he's quoted in Richard Rhodes new
book Visions of Technology) that robots providing sexual companionship
were likely to see widespread use in the future.  Snell could foresee the
problems. Marriages might be damaged or destroyed if spouses choose sex
with sexbots over making love with their mates. Jealous lovers might
destroy sexbot rivals, or sue manufacturers for emotional damage.  On the
other hand, Snell pointed out, people seeking clarity about their sexual
identities would have a safe, reliable way to experiment.  Heterosexuals
might use same-sex sexbots to experiment with homosexuality or
bi-sexuality. Gay people might use other-sex sexbots to try out
heterosexuality. Predators with sexual addictions might no longer prey on
human beings.  Given that people become addicted to all sorts of pleasures
from slot machines to e-mail, sexbot addiction might be inevitable. Users
could become obsessed by their ever-faithful, willing-to-please sexbot
lovers that never say no or get headaches, and rearrange their lives to
accommodate their addictions. Support groups are inevitable.  Or perhaps,
Snell speculates, a new category of sexuality might emerge among humans -
the technovirgin, people who find it simpler, perhaps even preferable, to
have sex exclusively with sexbots. This would avoid all the emotional and
physical complications of having sex with people.  Like wondering if it
was as good for them as it was for you. Or as bad.  Intuitive and
recognotion technologies are already changing computing, from search
engines to recognition software to voice recognition. Sexbots would almost
surely be programmed to be highly intuitive, keeping track of what worked
and what didn't. They would become better sexual partners as they learned
more about their human counterparts, storing everything from gasps of
pleasure to frequency of orgasm in their memory banks. Every time they had
sex with a human, it might get better. Meanwhile, sexually- transmitted
diseases might fall, along with teen pregnancy, abortions, pedophilia,
prostitution and Viagra prescriptions.  The divorce rate might plummet as
well, since Sexbots could keep marital partners happy. The affair itself
might become outmoded. Why take the risk when your sexbot is waiting to
meet your needs?  Technology never works in predictable ways. The idea
that computing machines could take over the function of human passion is
as chilling as it is fascinating. But it's also almost totally unexplored.
Neo-Luddites will have a field day with the advent of digital or robotic
sex, as will parents, politicians, teachers, moral guardians. If local
communities flip out whenever Johnny logs onto the Playboy website, and
Congress twice passed blatantly unconstitutional Communications Decency
Acts to regulate "decent" speech online, how might they respond to the
idea of sexbots sold next to Imacs at Compusa?  Sex is a hair-trigger
issue in American politics, and the idea of machines performing it
round-the-clock will rock some of the most powerful elements in society.
>From information to MP3's and Open Source software, computing and the
Internet is about freeing up ideas and information and giving individual
people more control over their own lives. It's logical that this
relentless empowerment would extend to experiences like sexuality.  
Sexbots seem inevitable. But in a culture that refuses to think much about
either technology or sex, the one thing we do know is that we won't be
ready when they get here.

Interesting play on Sexpot.  This term will at least take the focus off
female servicing -- for it to be 21st Century, the services need to cover
both genders.

Well, since they don't cite any details its hard to know what their concern
is.  I will say that NASA tends to be very conservative about that kind of
estimate - i.e. their criteria is closer to "would we want to live there"
than "could life exist".  We really don't know much about how much radiation
resistance is possible in large organisms.

A solar flare would blanket the facing hemisphere of the planet with intense
radiation, which would kill most types of land life.  You are correct in
assuming that a denser atmosphere provides better shielding, and would thus
allow land life to evolve under a more variable star than would otherwise be
the case.  However, a few yards of water will provide better shielding than
even the densest atmosphere, so it is very hard for such events to kill off
sea life.

Ah, no.  They would be limited to much smaller payloads (in proportion to
rocket size), which would mean you'd need 1980s technology to put up
Sputnik.  Communication satellites would become practical with technology
only slightly more advanced than what we have now.  From there the
progression would continue on in the same way - their launch costs remain
about an order of magnitude greater than ours, so their use of space at any
given time is much more limited than ours.  When our launch costs fall to
$1,000/lb, theirs are $10,000/lb.  When advanced technologies like laser
launch or nanotech construction give us $100/lb launch costs, they get
$1,000/lb.  They aren't barred from space, they just need better technology
for any particular use.

So, if "A" goes wrong, then "B" might go wrong, which could lead to a purely
speculative problem "C", which under some conditions could combine with
problems "D" and "E", perhaps leading to problem "F"....

This is a long chain of speculative problems, most of which are suspect in
the first place.  That's a fatal flaw for any attempt to explain the Great
Filter.  If we say each of your steps happens in 99.99% of all cases (which
is far to generous), we still end up with a fairly modest number of races
actually being trapped this way.

It seems to me that you don't really appreciate the magnitude of the numbers
involved in this problem.  That, or you implicitly assume that the most
advanced technology that anyone can ever invent is only slightly better than
what we currently have.  Putting some numbers in, what you're suggesting is
that:

1) Virtually all advanced life (99.99999% or so) evolves on heavy worlds
orbiting dim stars.  Earth is a freak of nature that can never occur under
any reasonable conditions.

2) No possible technology can ever make space launches from such a world
even reasonably cost effective.

3) If space launches are expensive, a technological civilization will never,
ever expand beyond its home planet.  Not even over the course of hundreds of
millions of years.  No matter what kind of social structure they have.  No
matter what psychological drives they may have.

All three of these propositions seem extremely implausible to me.

I've been reading an interesting little book, It a a new
interpretation of the stoic philosopher Epictetus's works
"Discourses" and "Enchiridion" by Sharon LeBell called "The Art Of
Living." ISBN 0-06-251332-2.

I've been walking around with it in my pocket since I bought it.

The best self-improvement book I've read.

The works of Epictetus are available on line for free, and I would
also recomend the "Meditations" of Marcus Aurelius (a student of
Epictetus) also available online.

The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius:

Epictetus, the Discourses:

The problem with this scenario seems to be that it assumes sexbots to
be relatively cheap. But when you start to think about the actual
implementation (warm, moist synthetic skin, dextrous limbs, fairly
complex behaviors, ability to act autonomously for extended periods of
time) it becomes clear that they will be highly complex machines that
will be extremely expensive at first. Exactly how they will be used
will depend on how quickly the price falls and their initial uses; if
the image becomes that they belong to cybernetic houses of ill repute
the home models might become less likely, keeping the price up. It is
also unclear how much people would want to pay for a sexbot.

It would be a reasonable to combine the sexbot with other uses, such
as domestic help (the french maid or latino gardener? :-) which would
make it more cost effective. But if people have hang-ups on displaying
their sexbots (as seem likely given current morals) then there would
be a incentive to make ones domestic bot look as non-sexy as possible
(would keep down the price, but the same problems with high initial
costs would affect the domestic bots as the sexbots; multipurpose bots
are likely more cost efficient).

My guess is that it will take a while after we get domestic robots
before we get sexbots, and exactly how they will look and be used will
likely be quite path dependent. One could imagine hiding sexbots in
closets, or even having transformer domestic bots (lots of
possibilities for a transhuman sitcom :-)

I like Epictetus, but he seems a bit too content to let things be. His
insights in how to keep a calm and neutral mental state are valuable.

Another Roman philosopher worth reading is Lucretius; his De Rerum
Natura is great writing and a fun (if longish) read. His ideas about
natural science are often impressive (like his discussion how
lightening can be led through metal while it blasts wood), and
sometimes amusingly wrong. 

Are there any philosophers that manage to both appreciate change and
balance? Far too many seem to ignore change in favor of balance, and
the philosophers who laud change are often rather irrational.

This seems to imply actual mechanical robots.  Considering the complexity of
producing even an approximate simulation of the human body, producing such a
device is a pretty tall order.  It might well be possible in the 2020-2030
time frame, but it is likely to be very expensive and failure prone.

OTOH, recent progress in tissue and organ culturing suggests that actual
organic bodies may be much easier to create than is generally supposed.  The
simplest possible approach to creating a sexbot (or any really human-like
robot) might be a hybrid approach using a cloned human body controlled by an
electronic computer.  Of course, the cultural and moral issues involved in
such a project would be rather serious.

Of course, devices like this would be used for a lot more than just sex.
Anders suggested they might have a role as domestic servants.  I'd also
expect to see them as secretaries, receptionists, airline hostesses, and
many similar positions.  The skills required to do these sorts of jobs are
probably no harder to automate than lovemaking, after all.

There are a few items from the post that I would like to comment on:

> Marriages might be damaged or destroyed if spouses choose sex
> with sexbots over making love with their mates.

Perhaps.  But the people that would buy such a thing in the first place are
more likely to use it the same way they would a more conventional sex toy -
as a means of enhancing their relationship when together, and as a
substitute when they are apart.

> On the other hand, Snell pointed out, people seeking clarity about

An unmentioned corollary is the potential for sex education that actually
teaches how to please one's partner.  The opportunity to practice technique
without fear of embarrassment would be a godsend to many people.

This seems very plausible, especially since body modification technologies
are likely to be introduced for sexbots well before they are offered for
humans (no need for FDA testing, after all).  People who have trouble
finding compatible partners (fetishists, for instance, or the terminally
shy) seem especially likely to fall into this pattern.  I would also expect
to see a fair amount of power-trip behavior (harem collecting, custom robots
that look like celebrities), and an increase in what is currently considered
deviant sex (fetishists again, but also S&M and nonhuman sexbots).

> This would avoid all the emotional and physical complications of having

> with people.

Well, almost all.  Considering how attached people can become to their pets,
I don't think its much of a stretch to expect that most people will be quite
fond of their sexbots.  After all, they look human, they talk, and you have
all sorts of fun together.  A whole industry is likely to spring up to
provide personality customization, smarter AI software, and so forth.

Of course, this raises an important moral issue.  Any reasonably functional
sexbot is already going to be at least as smart as your cat.  Once you start
adding speech comprehension, personality software, domestic skills, and
other cognitive functions you're getting uncomfortably close to having a
real person - and different people will draw that line in different places.

The movie "Cherry 2000" might be relevant. It revolves around the
protagonist's quest in a post-apocalyptic landscape to find a new body
for his beloved "wife" - she got a short circuit and broke down, and
now he is trying to find her obsolete body model so he can put in the
memory chip he has stored. Not much of a film or story (it is quite
predictable), but psychologically not entirely unreasonable.

And we end up in the special purpose entity discussion again. Of
course, one might argue that sexbots with the right hedonic circuitry
might even have better lives than humans ;-)

Wouldn't virtual-reality sex partners be better?  Most of today's huge
porn industry (it's in the billions of dollars I believe) is
completely non-tactile.  You've already got millions of horny guys
(and girls) shelling out big bucks for magazines, videos, computer
games and websites - think of how much more money you could make with
a simulated virtual sex-partner?  

The first phase could kick in as soon as we have simple audio-video
surround VR (like with glasses and headphones).  Instead of watch 2
people go at on a flat tv screen, why not watch 'em go at it on your
own floor!  Or in your bed right next to you!  Or in the tub, the
neighbor's yard, wherever! The simple availability of such software
could possibly be the largest driving force for moving this type of VR
into the mainstream.

Phase two could include tactile simulation.  Wear this suit (fitted
with a "special" cod-piece) and "get some" yourself while you watch. 
Hell, participate in multiple-partner sex orgies!  Have sex with real
(simulated) partners from around the world.

Phase three is the full body immersion VR tanks - as far as you can
tell you're REALLY having sex.  

Phase four - neural implants.  Can you say "6 hour long orgasm?"  I
thought you could.  So much for productive work, huh?

Virtual sex is great for lots of reasons.  You can't get hurt ("Ouch! 
I think I pulled a muscle really bad!").  No AIDs.  No pregnancy. 
Nothing but fun fun fun!

Sexbots?  Bah.  By the time we can build them VR will be far enough
along to make "real world" sex seem quaint and silly.

Well, that's certainly the intelligent way to build them :-)

What do you think about the organic body approach to humanoid robotics?  I'm
thinking it solves a lot of problems with appearance, power supply and
mechanical reliability, but I'm not sure how bad the interface problem would
be.  I'd certainly expect neural interface technology to be advanced enough
by 2020 to allow computerized muscle control, but what about the more subtle
issues?

Tricky. Growing entire clones is likely rather expensive and slow,
since you want to get them to an adult size and it is not clear this
can be easily achieved even with hormone therapy. And development
without brains (yucky but IMHO ethical) is likely stunted, so they
have to grow with neurointerfaces in place to provide stimulation. In
the end I think this will be done if we get an overall transhuman
trend where people tend to regard individuality as more based on
mental pattern than physical composition (which makes the clones more
acceptable) and more and more advanced interfacing technologies
culminating in uploading (which would create a big market for these
bodies when visiting physical reality). But this trend might take a
long time to occur, making humanoid biological robots rather
remote. Still, animal robots might be much closer - remember the
experiments on controlling roach movements or using moth antennas as
sensors. Maybe the zoophiles will get sexbots first :-)

The more modular solution, where muscles and other tissues are put
together in a more artificial way than growing them all together, is
likely simpler to get a bit along the way with (muscles in nutrient
baths, stimulated by electrical impulses etc). Unfortunately I think
making a believable whole humanoid out of them is extremely hard, and
it might be simpler to go for the clone or a well-crafted synthetic
body.

This is certainly going to be a big money-maker for some people, but it
doesn't really give the customer what he wants.  Its just the best
substitute our current technology can manage for a reasonable cost.

If you want to watch a conventional movie on a heads-up display, that's no
big deal (maybe 2-5 years out).  If you want real 3D VR, where you can walk
around and watch from different angles, that means you need a computer
capable of rendering complex models in real time (which means around 10^6
MIPS, which you might have in a home computer around 2012).  If you want the
sim to be controllable (instead of just following a set script), or to
interact with the real environment at all, it also needs a decent physics
simulation to generate dynamic models for things like hair movement, flexing
muscles, and folds in clothing (multiple that MIPS figure by at least 100,
which puts us close to 2020).

Cool.  The tactile interface doubles the processing load (at least), plus we
now need a good, detailed physics simulation (its also not at all clear that
such a thing is possible without smart matter or real neural interfaces).
We also need a complete sexbot OS & control program for your simulated
partner, so it can do a decent job of pretending to be a person, and we need
to simulate an entire virtual environment instead of just a couple of human
bodies.  Now we're talking 2030 before we can run the software, even on an
optimistic projection.

High-fidelity VR is much, much more difficult than is commonly believed.  It
demands programs with hundreds of billions of lines of code, simulations
that will eat up TeraFLOPS of processing power, animal-level AI programs,
and extremely complex interface hardware.

If you are satisfied with a cartoon-quality world and a very rudimentary
tactile interface, you'll probably have your wish within a decade.  If you

But won't a realistic humanoid sexbot need to have nearly human AI in
order to be convincing?  At least animal AI, right?  Otherwise it's
just a pile of warm flesh that you thrust into (or get thrust by).  I
see the software of a sexbot being at least as tricky as that of my
virtual sex kittens and, coupled with the hardware a hell of a lot
more expensive.  Without extensive AI, it'll just lay there and maybe
moan.  If I'm gonna dish out big bucks for a sexbot, I want a WILD
woman!!

If your sexbot is a recreation of a 110 pound human female, what
happens if her software goes nuts and she starts biting (at the wrong
time), kicking, and generally flailing about during the heat of the
moment?  Possibly major injuries, costly repairs, and maybe
embarassing stains on the furniture...  And that's not to mention the
problems the 225 lb muscle-ripping he-stud that some customers will
want might cause...

If a virtual sex partner goes nuts you should just be able to
disconnect with no harm done (blue screen of coitus interuptus - hee
hee).

Sexbots would entail considerable maintenance (especially mostly
organic ones - imagine changing it's "diapers" - ewwwww).  Virtual sex
partners come with no muss, no fuss.

Besides, with virtual partners one can have sex with pretty much
ANYONE or hell, everyone!  Virtual sex can include as many partners as
can be imagined.  Sexbots provide each customer with one or two
partners - depending on price, maintenance, etc...

For fantasy purposes, I would think that most men would want an
endless variety of partners.  With a sexbot you might could have
different personalities, and there's always wigs, but without major
technology body shape would stay the same.

Also, virtual sex partners could use the AI of living, breathing
humans remotely located.  I'm sure some of the first applications will
be voyeuristic views of 3D strippers and naughty lovers.

I don't think the idea of sexbots is completely without merit, but I
can't see the technology maturing before we could have really
inexpensive virtual sex partners.

Maybe I'm just putting too much thought into this.

Aren't we all? :-)

Seriously (?!), I saw some presentation on tv a few years back of one
early virtual sex system (it was during the VR hype). What made me
think was the fact that it was a highly multimodal, very involving
interface. Maybe one could use it not for sex, but for "visualization"
of data or simulation control. Talk about an addictive interface :-) 

"Wow! Those genetic datasets of yours are *wild*!"

Just the thing to get young people involved in science :-)

Well, yes, it will.  However, so will the VR version.  I think this aspect
is about the same difficulty level either way.

What if your force-feedback system goes haywire?  To get the illusion of
walls and other solid objects, it needs to be considerably stronger than you
are (strong enough to easily break bones, in fact).  The robot seems a bit
safer to me - it doesn't need to be any stronger than a normal human.

See the above comment about force-feedback systems.  This is actually a
significant factor in current research - corporations are leery of funding
these things, because they're afraid people will get hurt when the
inevitable bugs surface.

If you can make it walk around the house on its own, you're 99% of the way
to being able to do any kind of physical activity.  Programming it to handle
its own routine maintenance should be trivial.

Now, its true that a VR personality doesn't take much maintenance.  However,
your full-immersion VR rig is going to be at least as complex as a robot,
with lots and lots of moving parts.  It probably still won't be as
trouble-prone as a mechanical robot (which is one reason to favor the
organic approach), but it isn't exactly going to be maintenance-free either.

Besides, a physical robot can do lots of other things, too.  Your VR partner
can't clean house, make dinner, walk the dog, or run errands for you.

Here, the VR approach wins hands-down.

So could a physical robot.

The hard part in a VR isn't the AI for the simulated partner - animal-level
AI should exist well before we have the horsepower to run a full-immersion
VR.  What makes the VR difficult is the need to simulate, in detail and on
demand, virtually any kind of physical process that can be perceived by
human senses. Making a realistic VR requires software far more complex than
anything we could possibly build with current tools, and computers much
faster than even a human-equivalent robot would need.

I think the outcome of this race will depend on what the relative difficulty
of the hardware vs. the software turns out to be.  My own projection would
be as follows:

animal-level AI		10 - 20 years
humanoid robots		20 - 30 years
realistic VR		25 - 40 years

Also, a variety of Japanese Anime has played with these notions.

In particular the rather difficult to follow "Five Star Stories" and the
"Armitage"
 series contain such elements.

	i was reading an article called something like "the demise of VR" in
seattle's _stranger_ the other day, and it had some very interisting stuff to
say... basicly, it said that what with retinal projection system tech being so
close on the horizen, the conventional wraparound goggle systems will most
likely never be.  the most likely setup for portables (to fit in the palmtop
niche) will be a combo of headphone, microphone, and retinal projector, all
built into one little unit... if u just had a cable running from that to the
proccessing unit, u wouldnt really need any other input-output devices (except
maybe a trackball)...
	just my two cents...

Guess I'll see your two cents and raise three. :)

Consider extending your description: retinal painting *and* three multimode
cameras (binocular from you, plus a face shot); and five sound
channels--binaural to you ("headphones" based on Wolf Ear tech, but made
failsafe), binaural(those "wolf ears" again) + close-mike from you. The
retinal sprayers might look like Ant Man mandibles and sit over your eyes
only as much as a classic Plantronics Starset sits over your mouth. OK so far?

I also want 24/7 record capability with "911"-style parallel
playback-while-record for all channels. That's SMOPD. Ana-Digi cellphone
with silent cuing? Naturalamente.

The rest of your stuff about [not] "needing" I/O devices seems muddled to me.
Trackballs drift; I'd suggest a Cat trackpad.

I consider the following to be a partial list of things that would be handy
when I'm trying to move about in the world:

Proximity detection fields (spare eyes & ears) so I can subcontract my
attention if I am willing to risk it. Realtime orientation and location
data, both center-of-mass and head tracking (twelve degrees of freedom);
somthing that can pass for force feeback (which probably won't actually
*be* force feedback, but can be learned by those motivated) --either
vibratory or galvanic or both; and gestural, voice tone, vital sign and
postural tracking and input. Many of these could possibly be based on
video&laser technology or ubiquitous computing. Some could be built into a
vest or shirt yoke today. Some are being prototyped for the military right
now.

And there's always Morse code in extremis, and no, I'm not joking.

Augmented reality *ought* to be more effective than closed-world ("hard") VR.
That especially includes reducing simulator sickess. Ubiquitous computing
or cellular computing *ought* to make AR easier. But that probably puts us
in David Brin privacy territory.

Having worked in VR and pen computing, I gotta say the RAH quote is right
on the money.

	yea, i grok the part about the lightweight and unintrusive retinal
projecters, but what about the wolf ear jazz? thats a new term for me... ill
search for stuff on it.

	i agree; setting this stuff up wouldnt be a big problem.  might make the
whole video-phone field of ideas finally take off... 

>  The rest of your stuff about [not] "needing" I/O devices seems muddled to
me.

	i was saying that youd have all the i/o devices we have (and lots
more/better) with our current pc setup.  basicly, running and using a
currently avalible os (yea, this is shooting low) would be quite doable with
the retinal/headphone/mic combo, plus maybe a pointing device.  

>  Trackballs drift; I'd suggest a Cat trackpad.

	never heard of the cat trackpad. ill look around tho.

	yea, ive heard rumors to that effect. got any references for me to mull?

	yup, theres always that. then there was that onehanded sign language

I disagree.  A cat is a cat, even a cat with speech recognition,
personality software, and domestic skills.  (WHAT an idea!  Probably
more profitable than the ACs, if someone pulled it off.)  In fact, the
level of intelligence is more analogous to that of a spider.

The really ironic thing in most discussions of Artificial Intelligence
is that the pundits treat emotions as a great mystery, and talk about
AIs with human intelligence who still don't understand emotions.  What
rot!  Dogs have emotions.  Rats have emotions.  Lizards have emotions. 
Emotions are easy.  We'll have emotional AIs long before we can
duplicate the simplest rational thought.  We could make them right now,
if anyone wanted them.

Personality interface?  ELIZA, integrated with HEARSAY II, a Cyc DB, and
a gigabyte archive of all the conversation from the most well-written
erotic stories on the Internet.  The AC won't be able to discuss
Epictetus, but it will be able to respond to the vast majority of
stunningly unoriginal comments with considerably more touching returns. 
All it really needs is a NL parser and Cyc DB that can figure out the
analogy between something it hears and something it's stored.  The ELIZA
rules operate on keywords in the rough model instead of the speech, and
the return volley derives from a vast database instead of being made up
on the spot.  When you consider how well the original ELIZA worked, how
it was perceived as being human when it was just a terminal instead of
pseudoflesh, there's plenty of tolerance for simply ignoring any
ambiguous remarks.

How much actual intelligence does this require?  Answer:  None.  There
is no component here which is capable of original thought.  At most, the
sophistication would equal that of the Structure Mapping Engine or Cyc;
it would fall short of Copycat or EURISKO.

The reflexes are undoubtedly quite complex, but while the present
ambient "mode" of reflexes might be linked to both senses and speech
command acceptance, the complexity of the reflexes themselves would not
be integrated with the personality front.  The reflexes might involve a
complex, active model of the user, but would it really be necessary to
integrate this with the conversational model?  Maybe a set of simple
heuristics would cross-link the two; it still wouldn't be intelligence.

In short, the AC really would be operated by emotions, meaning that it
would have a set of "modes" that could trigger complex behaviors and be
triggered by complex rules, but all the communication between modules
would be through the modes.  A really sophisticated AC might even have a
modular emotional system with several tones (*) that can operate
independently and simultaneously impose different behaviors that would
be automatically integrated.  But this is really over-complicating
things up to the "lizard" level; the "spider" level of discrete,
non-reduceable modes should be quite sufficient.

(WAS:  SPACE/NET: Getting The Internet Off The Ground And Into Orbit)

Between that and the Space Hilton, this is one of the most heartwarming
things I've heard in years.  They want to start limited commercial
flights in 2000!

As a Singularitarian, I'm not excited because of the economic benefits
of asteroid mining or even lunar mining; I don't see that in a near-term
time frame.  The payload and cost-to-orbit looks like it might be
economical for Solar Power Satellites, which could prove economically
important.  The main reason, of course, is the possibility of
self-sustaining O'Neill or lunar colonies.  Just in case I'm right and
work too slow but Drexler's wrong and works too fast, you understand.

So my question is this:  O'Neill colonies, capable of sustaining
themselves with no help from Earth for at least a year, no sooner than
2002 and no later than 2013.  Can It Be Done?  How Much Will It Cost?

I'm assuming that we send up an independent nanotechnology lab.  This
way, even if someone cooks the Earth, they can duplicate the nanotech
independently and go on to _Aristoi_ from there.  This assumes that the
first assembler either isn't a Deep Dark Secret or that the military
labs have a continuous channel to space that they can use, in case of
defeat, to altruistically transmit the Secret before being eaten.  How
Much Will It Cost?

This would really cover all the bases on (survival of
humanity)/(Singularity); nuclear war leaves Australia (although the
colonies are dead), nanowar leaves nanotech-enabled colonies.

You're missing the obvious deficiency, though: there is

will make your VR partner smell and taste right.  This
is easy with a robot.

Since WHEN have quasars been considered to exist within our own galaxy?

Everything I've ever heard said they are distant extragalactic objects that put out
the energy of hundreds of thousands of stars.

For a minimally functional device this may be true.  I suspect, however,
that more intelligence will be required to make something people will really
be happy with.

For a really primitive AC, this approach might work.  However, I don't think
anyone is going to be satisfied with the results.  The problem is that if
the AI doesn't understand what it is doing, at least on a mechanical level,
you're going to have serious problems getting any real flexibility out of
it.

What you really want is an AC that can comprehend spoken English well enough
to carry out instructions in several unrelated problem domains.  This NLP
system needs to be integrated with a sophisticated motor system, equally
sophisticated sensory processing, a personality simulator, and an AI with
enough intelligence to translate "clean the place up a bit" into a series of
physical actions.  It needs a world-state model, so it can figure out what
it is doing, and it needs at least a primitive method of modeling the
internal mental states of humans (so it can tell when you're not in the
mood).  Now, this still isn't a sentient being, but its a starting point
that could easily lead to one with the right enhancements.

Fundamentally, I think that for projects of this scale the simplest way to
get intelligent behavior is to actually give it some intelligence.  Trying
to get the same result with a mountain of domain knowledge and some simple
rule-based processing will take far more effort and give far more limited
results.  Given the competitive demands of the market, that means that the
high-IQ approach is likely to win out.

As a side note, I would expect most of this software to be commercially
available by 2020.  Certainly the motor & sensory systems will be
commonplace, and there is a strong demand for NLP.  Simple domestic robots
would seem to be much simpler than an AC, so the integration of these basic
technologies should be well underway by the time anyone can seriously
contemplate building ACs.

"...the astronomical community still persists in assuming that the redshift is a valid
distance indicator from which they incorrectly deduce that quasars are
extra-galactic...The problem is that if the quasars are at cosmological distances the
rapid intensity variations appear to require unacceptably large energies [e.g.
Pauliny-Toth,I.I.K., Kellermann,K.I.: 1966, Astrophys.J. 146, 634] ... The reason for
this is that, if, as has been commonly assumed, significant fluctuations in intensity
cannot occur in times less than the light travel time across the source without
'blurring' the observed variation, then the observations put a limit on the linear
dimensions typically of the order of one light year. If the quasars are at cosmological
distances, then this corresponds to angular sizes well under 10^-3 arcsec and magnetic
fields less than 10^-5 G. In such weak fields, the energy in the form of relativistic
particles required to explain the observed radio emission is then typically greater than
10^58 erg generated in one year or less. Even in these days when violent events in
quasars and the nuclei of galaxies are commonly accepted, the thought of energy
generation at the rate of 10^51 erg/sec lasting one year or more seems too fantastic for
most to accept. For this reason, it was suggested that quasars were not at cosmological
distances ..."

QUASAR TON 202 IS WITHIN OUR GALAXY.

Varshni,Y.P., Talbot,J.P.: 1995, unpublished notes.

A careful search through Luyten's (1969) proper  motion survey for quasars from the
Hewitt and Burbidge (1993) catalog reveals that the bright quasar TON 202 (QSO 1425+267)
has a proper motion of 0.0530.016 arcsec/year, about the same motion as NGC 7293 or
Helix. A previous search of this catalog  by Varshni (1982) found 30 quasars, 3 of which
had very large proper motions. A more recent search uncovered 10 more quasars, including
TON 202. The proper motion of TON 202 is perpendicular to the orientation of it's radio
lobes (Rogora et al., 1986). If it is truly as far as it's redshift implies (z=0.362)
it's tranverse velocity would be of the order of one thousand times the speed of light,
a clear indication that the cosmological redshift hypothesis is completely untenable.
Which leads us to conclude that this quasar is a star within our galaxy (Varshni, 1973,
1974a, 1974b, 1975, 1979, 1982, 1988) the strong optical emission lines are due to
recombination laser action in a rapidly expanding stellar atmosphere. This is by no
means an isolated case : Kron and Chiu (1981) have discovered QSOs with large proper
motions one of them significant to 7 sigma. These facts explain the failure of HST to
detect 'host galaxies' around many QSO. Considering the brightness of TON 202 (V=15.63),
confirming the large proper motion should not present any particular observational
difficulties with present day CCD equipment.

The mean error in the existing measurements of the proper motions of quasars are rather
large. Any
conclusion on this question is subject to this important qualification. In most of the
reported cases, all
that we can say is that the proper motion is about or less than 0.015 arcsec/yr.

Sorry to everyone on the list for what appeared to be spam.  That url

unable to confirm my recollection of the url from work at NASA because
visiting a site like that raises major red flags in their automated

These dolls were featured on HBO's Real Sex 22 and their visual
appearance makes suspension of disbelief very easy.  I am forwarding

Transhuman Mailing List

Since that Real Dolls link was nothing but a sinister porn ad, I'll
try and fill y'all in on these $5000 doodads.

Note: Some of this is my research, most is the HBO Real Sex 22 episode
that featured the Real Dolls.



They sure do cost $5000, and what you're paying for is an amazing
sculpture job, as well as a huge amount of silicon. They seem to be
female-only at the moment (though a few "chicks with you-know-whats"
have been created on a special order basis), so their breasts,
behinds, and various other spots are comprised of this high-grade
silicon. They seem to be coated in the stuff, actually. This makes
them soft to the touch, and yielding, but still pretty rubbery.

There are all sorts of dorky little details regarding their sexy
features, including a weird little suction action that takes place due
primarily to the properties of plastic, rubber, etc. And the hair (all
the hair) is human.

The Doll itself is created like a big squishy action figure, with
plastic bones and joints (gaps where the rubber takes over) in all the
right places. You can position it as you want, and it will basically
stay put.

Anyway, all of that is pretty uninteresting, at least as far as
sexbots go. It's a high-class blow-up doll, and for what it's worth,
they really are exquisitely sculpted (I'm talking facial features,
dammit!)

The sexbot issue is being addressed, though, as various animatronic
features have been planned (and partially built) by the couple
responsible for these silicon lovelies. Here are the prospective
specs, in order of complexity.

-Moving tongue and eyes
        Once activated, they keep moving. A feature will be added to
start
just one (eyes or tongue) at a time

-Audio
        Again, cued in with the moving parts, the dreadful thing starts
moaning.

-Moisture
        Figure it out

-Tactile Audio
        Now this one is scary. "Nerves" implanted in various erogenous
zones
will send signals to the primitive "arousal computer", and if the
right things are done (like a dirty version of Electronic
Simon)...Machine Orgasm! At which point it acts bored until you
finally cuddle with it. Well, maybe not. But honestly, it reaches an
orgasm, or so they plan, but only minor development has been completed
(these people are about as tech-illiterate as you can get). They also
plan to give the Dolls a rudimentary learning capability, so as to
learn what you like to do to it, and thus pretend to enjoy those
actions more. You wanted decadence? You got it!

Now they didn't mention how well these dolls are doing, but suffice it
to say that the couple is in the shop every day, and their stock isn't
exactly sky-rocketing. However, it's fascinating to note that people
will pay $5000 and up for the most primitive sexbot around (right now
it has none of those special features), which leads me to believe that
a more cost-effective sex doll, one with some basic moving parts,
could become as popular as....blow-up dolls. Unless you made this
things fashionable, they would remain the realm of pervos and
fetishists.

The most interesting possibility on this list, in my opinion, is that
of duel-feature domestic bot/love droid, but we all know robots aren't
gonna be around until Spacely Sprockets finally gets off the ground.
So, my final estimate is that mass-appeal sexbots are a foolish topic.
Fetishists will always pay ridiculous sums for ridiculous stuff, but
no fetishite trend has ever been mainstream enough to deserve serious
attention.

But then again I have a bias against bot-talk, because anything that
needs that much maintenance isn't feasible enough to really discuss.
Anyway, hope that was informative.

Has anyone considered a bumper sticker?  Currently I have one that says

 "DON'T STEAL.....the government hates the competition". 

 I get lots of comments regarding it. (The cops are NOT amused)

A bumper sticker with an Extropian theme would get a lot of exposure.

	Aaahh, the incredible likeness of being.

	It seems my bits and bytes have gone astray and landed me on the
Sextropians list.  Mayhaps a fun group.

	Have we stumbled on the answer to Fermi's paradox here?  All the work of
technologically progessive cultures is really just diverted sexual energy?
With the invention of sexbots comes The Great Release, unrestricted sexual
expression for technoweenies?  Everyone lying around with hot moist
towelettes going, "Aaaaaaahhhhhh.  Is there anything in the fridge?"  To
which their sexbot replies, "What's your pleasure, oh pendulous one?" 
	All play and no work makes for a serious paucity in the inventory of Von
Neuman probes, as well as putting the race for the singularity on
indefinite hold.  Don't want no poopy old SI confiscating the molecules of
YOUR sexbot now do yuh?
	While the meek Luddites, eschewing technology, inherit the earth.

Thats right, Mike.  This is why I posted that any measured proper motion
is experimental error.  There were plenty of indications, even before
the Hipparcos data, that quasars were distant and energetic, waaay
extragalactic phenomena, specifically their enormous redshift.  There
was, and perhaps still is, debate that quasars are associated with
relatively near galaxies to an extent that is statistically significant, but
I sure dont see how they could be, with all that red shift.  Halton Aarp
I think is the name of the guy who was proposing that notion.  spike

Douglas Hofstadter is organizing a roundtable discussion at Indiana
University related to the limits (or lack thereof) of machine intelligence.
The objective of the roundtable is to elicit a discourse among various
academic disciplines on the potential of artificial intelligence and its
impact on human society.  I am not certain if Hofstadter's effort is in
response to any of the recent popular books on the subject.  I've been
promised a copy of the proceedings but  I doubt there will be much in the
way of new thinking or breakthrough viewpoints on the topic of artificial
intelligence.  However, I am interested in looking for what I call "efficacy
creep", the often slow process of academia deeming a subject respectable
enough to discuss in the coffeehouses.

US scientists have genetically-engineered chickens to grow basic "legs"
instead of wings.


Researchers at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, took a gene
normally found only in chicken legs and transferred it to the forming wings
of chick embryos.

	for one thing, im fairly sure that this isnt particularly comfy, from the
chickens POV. is that relevent?  do chickens have rights, from an extropian
POV?  if they dont, and our desire for chicken legs causes us to grow chickens
that are really just masses of legs, where do we stop?  should we? cows that
are really just massive mammeries would be... interisting.  what about pigs
that have asses the size of a buick?  wouldnt run outa ham for a while...

	true, practically any; however, thats because all but a very few have very
interisting side effects.  but im sure your aware of the success of creatine
(boosted by mcgwire hittin 71 homers), and that has no real negitive side
effects.  at least, none that i know of...

more important)...

Check out a prize winning Jersey Cow...or a champion Hampshire Pig.  The
traditionaly methods of breeding are takeing animals in that direction now.  

Direct Genetic manipulation just speeds up the process...and allows for a
whole range of options in a much shorter time..

I see no problem.

A good question, and here's my answer:  when the chicken or pig or
whatever, says. or communicates in any way, that it would prefer
another. more "natural" bodily configuration, then this sort of
activity is "immoral." Until then, as long as the animal in question
keeps its snout/mouth/beak to the trough, this sort of activity is OK.

McGwire also took a legal steroid that Sammy Sosa refused to take because he
felt it was cheating. In a sense I think it is, but then, anyone with a
great deal of inherent talent is also a "cheater"...

	whats cheating? is life fair? didnt think so...  i would say that its sammy
sosa's loss there.  and yea, genetic difference can be used as an advantage is
most situations, so, unless we are all identical, we all "cheat" in some way.

While I've been impressed by the host of authors that have attempted to
extrapolate current trends in science in technology to write books couched
in science fiction, I've noticed a paucity of books that attempt to
extrapolate on social systems.  Many great "hard" science fiction novels
appear to be set in a far future with social systems that are essentially
the same as the ones we see today or have seen in the past. I suspect this
is a product of most good "hard" science fiction writers not being extremely
versed in sociology, economics, and political science.  Anyone know of
examples of writing that attempt to extrapolate both the science and the
technology along with their effects on society to produce novel and
innovative social systems?

Why?  Because social systems are the product of human emotions, and you
have to understand something to alter it properly.  The only SF author I
know of who's displayed even the beginning of that understanding is Greg
Egan... and his only flirtation with true altered emotions (that I've
read) was in _Quarantine_.  I suppose you could call the "true Ensemble"
a novel social system, which it is, but it's displayed only in passing.

Wouldn't help if they were.  All three disciplines, like psychology, are
"soft" sciences, and you can't build a book around them.  You'd need a
grounding in game theory, evolutionary psychology, neurology (especially
brain-damage cases) and cognitive science.

> Anyone know of

Problem is, there hasn't been a really innovative social system that I
know of in the entire twentieth century; people still fall into the same
old patterns, creating hierarchies and pecking orders.  The only thing
that will really alter that is neurohacking or intelligence enhancement
of one kind or another; *maybe* collaborative filtering (or similar
computational coordination) would do it.

Most of the pieces listed above show the culture only in passing.  Only
_Deepness_ and _Aristoi_ show deliberately created, fully visualized,
and wholly new and different cultures intrinsically based on advanced technology.

I can think of half a dozen people with a talent or a gift that the world
can ill afford to lose, but they don't embrace the idea of cryonics because
they don't want to require people (who may have other talents or gifts) to
look after frozen cadavers. IOW, the very people who have talents or gifts
that the world can ill afford to lose, do not endorse the idea of cryonics.
If those people don't endorse cryonics, why should extropians?

These people that you are speaking of must be unfamiliar with the idea
of automation, no?  I mean, the only reason that people now look after
frozen cadavers themselves is that there aren't enough people signing
up to make it worth automating.  BTW, calling them "cadavers" sorta
begs the question, and betrays the assumption that these people are
really dead, rather than revivable.

Because, being talented does not protect you from being ignorant.  And when
I say ignorant, I mean _without knowledge_.  I seriously doubt that you are
ignorant.  And yet you seem to be taking the position that cryonics does not
deserve our endorsement.  I'd be very interested in hearing why you take
this position.  Why, exactly, shouldn't Extropians endorse cryonics?

What do you mean by social systems? I find that many of the great science
fiction writers do so as a matter of course. Heinlein developed several, and
Bujold's novels in her Vorkosigan universe shows several  as well. Damien's The
White Abacus also is an excellent example. The limitation I think that you may
be thinking of isn't a matter of what writers are capable of, but what humanity
is capable of dealing with realistically and still remain human. The more odd a
social system is, the more fitting it is with an alien species...

Has anyone else seen the movie? It just came out on video. Very cool
psychological math thriller with a really cool futuristic electronic
soundtrack. I highly recommend it. It has interesting Tipler-esque themes
that explore the marriage of mathematics/theology, albeit with sinister
implications.....

Good question. Humans have been making species extinct since the Ice Age.
Mammoths, sabre toothed tigers, cave bears, brown bears, red elk,
gigantopithecus, neanderthals, you name it, we've been wiping them out since
we were in loinskins...

Most of the Northern Sahara is a desert because the poor agricultural methods
of the Carthaginians and the Romans wiped out the northern savannah. The
highest level of lead pollution in history occured during the Roman Empire,
not today (some say that is why the empire fell, they wound up with a
generation of lead poisoned imbeciles).

If you study a comparison of the levels of per capita pollution with the per
capita income, you find that pollution per capita is at its highest with a
per capita income of about $10,000.00. After that point the pollution per
capita will drop off significantly down to what looks like some sort of a
limit at abou 35-40 percent of the maximum, at around the $20k per capita
level. Since there aren't any societies that exist with higher per capita
income, it is impossible to extrapolate, since per capita income in a society
seems to behighly dependent on the technology level of the society. We don't
know what sort of pollution reduction technologies may be developed in the
future, although controllable limited nanotech may be considered to be
capable of being a 100% reducer of pollution.

That point of view is idiotic.  It's wrong to require people to live up
to an obligation they took freely and were handsomely paid for?  Being
frozen is likely to be just as beneficial to the caretakers as to the
patients, especially those whose talents and desires make them choose
that career.

I've noticed and complained about this failing too.  And science fiction 
author' areas of expertize are an important proximate cause.  But that 
expertize choice is itself no coincidence.  I think the deeper cause is
the fact that the public will defer to a remarkable extent to claims of 
physicists, and the public is extremely unwilling to defer to economists.
Other academic areas fall in between these extremes.

Physicists can declare the universe has eleven dimensions, based on the 
slimmest of evidence, and media coverage basically says "isn't that cool."
Economists can say price limits probably reduce the supply of an item like
labor, standard economic wisdom for centuries, and if the media mentions
it at all it is described as controversial, being sure to quote disagreeing 
experts.  And this is no more the fault of the media than the SF pattern 
you describe is the fault of SF authors. 

SF readers mostly swallow an SF description of an encounter with a black 
hole, complaining perhaps if this slows down the plot or if it disagrees 
with expert descriptions of such an encounter.  Story descriptions of an
encounter with a price limit are less vivid, and so more likely to slow
a plot down.  More important, an SF description of an economic effect of 
a similar level of speculation would be met with far more reader 
skepticism.  The author would have to put a lot more work in to justify 
its plausibility to readers.

There are surprisingly few, but that doesn't mean they are rare. Most
extrapolations are simply badly done ("Hey! Let's make a feudal
setting... oh, it is the future, so I'll add AI and robots, they won't
change anything anyway..." or "Since everybody is so enlightened, they
just go around being pleasant. No need for an economy.").

Why can't you build a book about a soft science? I would think it is
actually easier for many authors to write about society, emotions and
people than technology and science - but the authors who do so tend to
write mainstream fiction, where alternative social systems are
extremely rare.

Well, yeah, but I've already got a solution for that too. Thermal superconductors
built into the sturcutre of sky-hooks will conduct excess heat out of the
atmosphere and allow it to be radiated away in space.

Another idea is to promote technologies which produce a form of pollution which
negates greenhouse gasses....a first generation form would be simply to
genetically engineer plants to be far more efficient converters of solar energy
in their photosynthetic processes, thus leading to increased crop rotation,
increased oxygen output, etc.

There are examples of environmental damage caused by pre-industrial
civilizations, such as over-grazing in Spain.  Population and economic
activity per capita are now much higher than in the pre-industrial age,
so the potential for environmental damage today is larger.  But modern
technology and scientific understanding can be used to intelligently
manage impact on the environment.  So we are better off with technology
than without it, but only if we use it wisely.  A return to
pre-industrial technology would require a drastic drop in population from
its present level of about 6 billion.

(Sound effect:  <WHAP>)

I don't believe I missed Zindell.  I went out and deliberately looked at
my Singularity bookshelf, and I missed not one, not two, but THREE
Zindell books.  Well, if I had a copy of Neverness I'm sure I would have
noticed.  I'll toss in a sympathy vote for William Gibson, who was
original when he was new, and add some more books I missed:

Iain M. Banks:           Player of Games   (Duh!  Duh!  Duh!)
John Barnes:             Mother of Storms

> Why can't you build a book about a soft science?

Well, first, let me ask:  Have you ever tried building a story?  (If you
have, ignore the question.)  I myself have been trying to write SF for
years and have yet to come up with anything worthwhile.  (Of course, I
maintain high standards; if I'm not going to be an above-average author,
I'm not going to bother.)

And I would say:  No, it's not easy to build a story around a soft
science.  "They require, not thinking, but scholarship."  Soft sciences
don't have sufficiently generalized rules.  You can't vary conditions
creatively in a soft science because they're tuned to the
here-and-now-and-human, and are too fragile and inelegant to be taken
out of it.  (There are exceptions; these exceptions have ceased to be
soft science.)  And above all, the theories are politically correct, and
political correctness doesn't make for either good fiction or good
science.  Soft sciences are the result of human nature, not descriptions
of its governing cause.  Writing stories based on them produces tales
that are not only human, but stupid, unimaginative, naive, and bureaucratic.

Yeah?  It's easier to write about minds than about technology?  Well,
it's a lot easier to write about *alien* technology than about alien minds.

We have more experience with the social effects of material technology
than with cognitive technology.  Authors who vary cognition do so by
creating alien societies that are interacted with, but not often
internally detailed.  (Jack Vance is a brilliant exception.  So is
Vernor Vinge, who isn't half as good technically, but is more original.)

"Sorry, you can't write this story.  Neither can anyone else."  Maybe I
could, or a brain-damage patient could; an autistic, Asperger's
syndrome, Specialists... there are all kinds of neuromods, with
experience that might create a truly alien mind; the problem is that few
neuromods make good authors.  Maybe I will; I have the verbal
proficiency, and I'm working out the real rules for drama - but it's
equally likely that I never will be able to plot a story longer than a short-short.

Is there such a thing as a thermal superconductor?  I've seen references
in SF but I don't know if such things really exist.  I suppose you could
use a heat pump, in any case.  How much heat could you really pump out
in this way though?  A sky hook is pretty small compared to an atmosphere.

A week or so ago, Robin Hanson objected to the label "network effects" on
grounds that "externalities" fits better, that economists should stick
standard terminology, and that "effects" is so loose as to mean nothing.
Although I found that a pretty cogent argument, I remained silently
unconvinced.  I now offer some data supporting a contrary view.

Robin's argument left me unconvinced because I think that it courts confusion
to call call mere *pecuniary* externalities caused by network effects by a
term normally reserved for *non-pecuniary* externalities.  Pecuniary
externalities represent mere "budget" effects on third parties, as when
competition leads to lower prices throughout a market.   They do not at all
indicate market failure.  I appreciate Robin's theoretical concern for the
purity of econo-speak, but using "network externalities" would in practice
invite policy-makers and journalists to draw the wrong conclusions about how
to react to the phenomena in question.  Such non-economists would assume that
"externalities" indicates market failure.  Futher study leads me to believe,
moreover, that most economists would draw the same conclusion.

I attended a conference last weekend attended by scholars of law and economics
where spoke Joseph Farrell, a professor of economics at UC Berkeley.  Farrell
has, by all accounts I've heard, done pioneering work on network effects.
Noting that Farrell's talk consistently used "network effects" rather than
"network externalities," I asked him about his choice of terms.  He explained
to me that economists decided in the 1920s that "externalities" ought not
apply to mere pecuniary effects.  He added that, while he thinks that network
effects sometimes lead to conventional externalities, they often do not.
Hence his preference for "network effects."

I think they are a myth, caused by Larry Niven in _Ringworld
Engineers_. He seemed to assume that electrical superconduction imples
thermal superconduction (and did some fun stuff with that idea), but
I'm fairly sure he is wrong.

I wonder if there are thermodynamic problems with thermal
superconductors? Somehow I get the feeling that disordered phonons
cannot be transferred without causing secondary phonons in the
material. But it is not obvious to me.

Actually, waste heat might be a small problem since the increased
temperature will cause more radiation to escape into space. The reason
the greenhouse effect is so important is that it alters the amount of
IR-energy retained within the atmosphere; more heating will likely
just be a local problem.

Well, partially. But most of society looked surprisingly normal
despite the huge changes that had occured between now and the
book. Still, the posthuman pieces are great (if a deus ex machina).

What about Ursula Le Guin? I seem to recall some different societies
in her books, but it was a long time ago I read them.

Hmm, I think I see the problem: you want to write "hard soft science",
the kind of books Greg Egan or Robert Forward would have written if
they were economists or anthropologists (imagine a Forward-style
technical appendix afterwards, explaining the economic basis for the
story :-).

Actually, even if the rules are hard to generalize, that doesn't make
it uninteresting or impossible to come up with a good book that even
says something significant. A true artist would not just "turn the
knobs" to generalize our society, but invent a plausible or
interesting one. Soft science seems much more amenable to roleplaying
and scenario building than hard science.

Iraq, once the ultra-fertile cradle of civilization.

Imagine if Sadahm used the cash to re-green that former paradise.

Not that deserts are all bad, the Amazon rain forest is fertilized
by the millions of tons of dust that originally comes from the
Sahara. The dust plume is actually tracked by satelite.

A thermal superconductor (a material where thermal energy moves/equalizes
at the speed of light?) does not seem possible.  I suppose the most obvious
reason is that the material would have to have an infinitely rigid
crystalline structure.  Also, the enormous acceleration imposed on
individual particles in the material will generate *a lot* of strain on the
material (but hey, an infinitely rigid crystal should be able to handle it).

While a literal thermal superconductor is not known to exist (with the exception of
laser beams and plasmas), using current thermocouple technology and room temperature
electrical superconductors (yet to be developed, but expected to be not far off) one
could easily join the two technologies. Use the thermocouple technology at each end of
a sky hook (or each end linked to heat absorption and radiation thermocouple farms),
and use electrical superconductors to conduct the current generated by the thermocouple
farms.

Laser beams could also be used in the blue-green wavelengths to transmit heat into
space. On a related note, you may recall the 'sunflowers' that Niven described in his
Ringworld trilogy. Niven mistakenly described the weather effects of the blight of
these plants as heating the atmosphere up and creating a desert. Deserts get hot
because the sand is a thermal insulator that reradiates much light as heat. The
'sunflowers', having reflective surfaces, would not  degrade the light thus and so the
region with such plants should become cooler. I know this sounds counterintuitive, but
its kinda like a Bose-Einstein condensate in this way.

Wolf Ears might be a brand name. The basic idea is to augment standard
hearing protectors with internal speakers and external microphones, and
connect the two with circuitry that can amplify weak sounds, if desired,
while limiting the loudest level to (say) 85 dB.
I've got a pair (somewhere) and they do help, but they're bulky and a
little "dead".
Getting good stereo imaging and front-rear disambiguation would probably
require some more engineering & signal processing.

Farrell is an advisor of mine here, and I respect his opinion, so on that 
ground I should defer.  On the grounds of the argument you've described,
however, I retain my previous objection.  I think those 20s economists
were playing word games that ultimately lead to more confusion than it 
avoided.  It seems to me natural to say that a "pecuniary externality" is 
in fact an externality.  Those who assume that any externality must be 
non-pecuniary, or that any pecuniary externality is harmless, are assuming
too much.

There are earplug/hearing aid sized ones that do just this. I know of several
hunting buddies that like to use these, since they can crank the sensitivity way up
to hear the deer coming, but the circuit damps down when they shoot, so they don't
deafen themselves. The next thing will be to get a Mickey Mouse hat that allows long
distance directional stereoscopic reception.

I think we can peer deeper and find more fundamental drivers to the
structure of social systems than human emotions.  Genes and memes appear to
be the primary drivers.  The survival value of cooperation gives rise to
altruism.  Altruism gives rise to social relationships.  Technological
innovation maximizes the efficiency and effectiveness of cooperation on
several levels while at the same time making individuals more autonomous.
Ultimately, technology should eliminate genes as a primary driver of social
structure.  Information sharing, searches for knowledge not encapusable in
algorithms, hoarded knowledge, and to some extent memes may constitute the
only drivers of social interaction in the future.  This concert of factors
should lead to some interesting social systems.

I don't think the three I cited were necessarily "soft" science in the since
they are less grounded in science.  However, I believe they attempt to
wrestle with phenomena that are more complex than many scientific areas.  I
agree that the areas you've mentioned would prove helpful in developing an
intuition on how certain technologies would affect the structure of future
social systems.

I suspect issues in economics are more controversial (even needlessly so)
because of the political baggage that many attach to them.  The efficacy of
capitalism or socialism isn't undermined by the existence of eleven
dimensions.

Additionally, I've noticed a general attitude towards economists (even the
transfer pricing ones I deal with) by non-economists that they don't really
know anything.  I've not checked the latest accuracy figures for economists
predictions but the general feeling I get is that it is not spectacular.
People generally have a skepticism of economists.  But is this justified?
I'm not sure.  I don't think so.  I suspect the complexity of the phenomena
economics attempts to describe and model is higher than that of, say,
physics.  I'm not saying physics is not a complex subject.  But using
Chaitin's definition of complexity, I suspect the "theory of everything" for
economics will be more complex (i.e., longer) than the "theory of
everything" for physics.  I believe it will have more variables, more
echelons, more overall complexity.  Perhaps the success rate of economic
predictions is similar to that of meteorologists for a reason, both subjects
attempt to model an extremely complex interplay between a host of agents.

When economists can do something cool - instead of scurrying around
producing contradictory explanations, incorrect predictions, and
hideously failed recommendations - they'll get the public's respect. 
Until then, no matter how much economists try to imitate the jargon,
titles, and procedures of scientists, and no matter how many volumes of
ANOVAed statistics they produce to hide the lack of any high-level
rules, the public will rightly regard them as being on a level with astrologers.

I believe in science because science has produced technology.  No
technology, it isn't science.  And that also goes for superstring
theory, but physicists get the benefit of the doubt, from the media if
not from me, because vaporizing cities is so impressive.

I think you may be looking at the phenomenon backward here, Eli. I doubt that anyone
can claim that Greenspan, Rubin, and the rest of his team have done an outstanding
job managing the economy and rescuing many other countries from the brink of falling
into the Asian morass.

Where I think astrologers come in is that there are far too many people on Wall
Street who know that there are far too many imbeciles with money in the US who put
more credence in the vague soothsaying of their astrologers and phone psychics than
in economists. The one thing that prevents economists from being more precise is
because of the FUD factor that is produced by such superstitious investing
strategies (FUD stands for Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt).

I think that I figured out why more scientists than ever claim they beleive in god
or some supreme being: scientists are smart enough to realize that by doing so, the
average dope on the street is going to say to himself,"Gee, he is a god fearing man,
he must be ok and trustworthy." So being a beleiver may paradoxically give
scientists more credence in the public's eyes.

Whenever I discuss extropianism or cryonics with people I usually
hit them with this soundbyte:

I would definitely agree with you that the economy is far more complex (and
thus more difficult to predict) than anything physicists have been able to
model.  After all, physics models don't have to deal with sentient beings as
a fundamental particle!

However, IMO the public skepticism of economists is entirely justified for
this very reason.  We listen to physicists because they have a long history
of making precise, accurate predictions.  We listen to meteorologists
because they admit they can't be especially accurate, but they can tell us
what the odds are.  We largely ignore economists because we remember the
last 20 guys who claimed to be able to make physicist-like predictions, but
in fact weren't even as good as the weather man.

The public gave economists their chance.  We've seen their advice have a
profound effect on public policy for most of the 20th century.  But if
you're wrong often enough, people eventually start to notice.  If economists
want to be taken more seriously again, they need to:

1) Reign in these people who claim to be able to make detailed predictions.
Any educated person knows they can't, and listening to them simply
undermines the credibility of the entire field.

2) When a broad claim can be made, use the necessary probabilistic language
to make it clear you aren't over predicting (i.e. "cutting taxes generally
encourages economic growth" rather than "lowering the top marginal income
tax rate to 24% would increase GNP growth by 0.4% per year").

3) Start building a track record of success in areas that are simple enough
to yield to analysis.  There is already good work being done here, but it is
overshadowed in the public mind by the government-policy hucksters.

This is the prime reason it is so difficult. The weather does not change as a
result of someone predicting what is going to happen, but producers and
consumers always change their behavior based on what the economists say, which
winds up skewing the actual performance away from the predicted result. Things
have been fine in the past ten years because people are happy with the way
things are going, so they don't want to disturb the equilibrium. The moment some
politician comes along promising to make things even better with their pet law,
the equilibirum will get disturbed, creating resonance effects that, if they
feed back upon each other, may spin things out of synch with people's wants.

Economics should be considered to be a form of what has been called 'warning
fiction'. They accurately extrapolate what will happen if things go on as they
are. When the results of that extrapolation are out of synch with what people
want, they will change their behavior to prevent that unwanted future from
happening.

Note how Greenspan has established a practice of not sharing the long range
foecasts of the Federal Reserve, which is why the stock market surges or dives
on the slightest comment of his. Everybody knows they have the most
sophisticated modeling systems, but if they give out the results of the models,
the real world will change. Its the uncertainty principle in action. The Fed
therefore tries to act kind of like Asimov's Second Foundation.

I'm endorsing Steven Forbes in his bid to be the next President.

While he certainly isn't an extropian (big or little e), and there are
issues that I completely disagree with him on, I feel he represents
the best hope to get a Libertarian minded President (in this century
or the next).

Please take the time to join my e-Precinct and get some news about the
Forbes Camp. and consider voting for him.

http://www.forbes2000.com/cgi-bin/recruit/rec_redeem.cgi?memberid=486201463


I've committed to helping Steve Forbes become the next President of The 
United States, and I'm asking you to help.  I'm going to to lead an 
e-Precinct on the Internet where we'll work together in championing 
Steve Forbes' message of hope, growth and opportunity for America, and 
in recruiting others to volunteer and contribute financially. 

 
Please join with me.  I get credit for every new member I bring to the

Forbes does have many attractive views, especially in the economic realm.

Where most of us will have problems are the social issues.  See
http://www.Forbes2000.com/compass/complete_text.html.  Forbes appears to
be wedded to conventional religious morality.  He opposes abortion and
wants to work to make it illegal.  He sees Clinton as having abandoned
the war on drugs and wants to increase crackdowns.  He opposes assisted
suicide and views it as a step towards euthanasia

In some ways I am not too terribly concerned about these issues, because
these are largely old disputes which have battled to a standstill.
No new President is going to be able to push things much one way or the
other, whether his views are those I would support or oppose.

My larger concern is the new issues we will face over the next decade,
particularly in the biotech field.  Forbes is going to be looking at
these new technologies through the prism of the Bible.  As President
he would be providing leadership on new and unfamiliar problems, and
could be greatly influential.  How is he going to react to cloning,
or other new fertility technologies?  How about genetic modification of
unborn children?  How about pre-death cryonic suspension, or meddling in
the natural lifespan?  I am concerned that he would take a reactionary
position to all such issues, and oppose anything which is a significant
change from the natural lifestyle ordained by God.

Forbes is not exactly a front runner.  Most of the smart money for the
Republican nomination is backing Bush, with Elizabeth Dole making a push
probably to be a vice presidential candidate.  Obviously there is still
considerable uncertainty, and particularly if Y2K is nasty then Forbes
may be able to position himself as a technocrat who can clean up the mess.
But otherwise, his chances are slim.

If you're going to support a candidate who is so unlikely to win, you
might do better to find one whose views you can support wholeheartedly,
someone who doesn't hold positions that you hate.  Presumably there are
or will be a number of minor party candidates who will be more attractive
than Forbes.

It is true that many of Forbes' ideas are relatively good for someone
who is so visible.  If he emphasizes the economic side, he could help
pull the other candidates towards positions I support.  It may be worth
backing him for this reason, even if his own chances don't look strong.
I would want to wait and see how he balances his emphasis between his
economic and moral/religious views.

Unfortunately, I can't share your view that Forbes is a Libertarian or a
minarchist.  He may have been one four years ago, but (if so) that was in
the past, and is not a reflection of his present beliefs.

Whether (a) his views have changed, (b) he is simply more expressive of his
long-held views on issues that he was silent about in the 1996 campaign, or
(c) he is simply whoring his beliefs in an effort to gain the Republican
nomination, Steve Forbes has dramatically pandered to the religious right
in the U.S. over the past 2-3 years.  If he was libertarian-minded at one
point in time, he has cast those beliefs aside and joined forces with
statists who would regulate morality.  While economic freedom is a bedrock
libertarian concept, it is not the only freedom important to libertarians,
and reasonable people may differ over whether it is even the most important
freedom in the canon.

Support him if you will.  It's a free country, at least in such matters.
He may even be the lesser of the many evils we have to choose between.  But
in my view, he's shown himself to be at best a political whore and at worst
a statist moralist.  I don't give my vote to either.

Sure, someday someone may automate cryonics. That doesn't automate reviving
the dead though.

Anyway, IMHO, the world can "ill afford" to lose people who help to prevent
the world making cryonic mistakes, people who can point out the flaws in
cryonic ideology or idolotry, so that extropians don't waste even more
resources on it. Instead of trying to revive the dead, I think it better to
find ways to raise the living to the level of Stephen Hawking, Spider
Robinson, Doug Engelbart, Robert M. Pirsig, Neal Stephenson, Douglass
Hofstadter, Martin Gardner, Arthur C. Clarke, Steven Jay Gould, and James
Randi, for example. In addition, I think that cryonics drains resources that
could better go into finding cures for fatal disease and terminal
conditions. Frankly, I think the world can "ill afford" to lose extropic
cognitive dissidents, and I don't think living extropians should squander
the resources of their world on the dead, even if the dead have convinced
some people that they believe in extropy.

I think a more extropian program would clone terminally ill ultra-talented
and gifted people (that the world can "ill afford" to lose), because a
younger version of a deceased genius could pick up where the old one left
off, and do so much more quickly, given the advantages provided by more
recent technology and intelligence augmentation.
Furthermore, cryonics seems entropic in that it denies
that life may create even more talented and gifted people. Scientists
capable of reviving dead genius could create even greater genius, and
consequently would have no reason to perform resurrections. After all, it
makes no sense to rebuild a 1950 machine, when you can create a better and
more powerful new one to replace and surpass the old one in 2050. Cryonics
can only hope to revive talented and gifted people, but transhuman extropy
seeks to surpass, exceed, augment, and transcend what has gone before, no
matter how talented and gifted.

The extropian world can ill afford to believe that it cannot produce greater
talents and gifts than it already has. Cryonics contains the seed of its own
demise, namely, entropic conceit.

Cheers,

--J. R.

I do not believe that a particular position on abortion, for or against,
should be part of the Extropian political principles.  When does a cell
mass stop being an embryo and start being a sentient being?  This is a
question of neurology and nothing else.

A shot in the dark:  

Is it possible to induce a state of hibernation in humans that would
substantially reduce metabolism by mimicking the chemistry of animal
hibernation?  What age related factors in humans would be improved by
hibernation if it were possible?  

It would be even better if we could hibernate with our bodies while
remaining fully cognitive with a direct brain interface to the net. 
Have there been any studies to see if hibernating animals would have
shorter life spans if they were chemically denied hibernation?

Consider the "ultimate generation gap" - that gap between mortality
and immortality.  My best conservative guess for defining this gap is
as follows:

Birth Date  
<1957          "mortal generation"
1957 - 1967    "The real generation X" (grey/fuzzy area)
>1967          "Immortal generation"

note: this is for the overall population, early adaptors of technology
and cryonics subscribers are exempt.

Anybody else want to put forth their own forecast of the ultimate
generation gap table?

I agree with the basic point that the Principles shouldn't contain a
position on abortion.

However, I think Eliezer is wrong in assuming (or purposefully framing) the
abortion question around "sentience."  Many people frame the question as
one of "having a soul."  Many others think the reasonable question is
"potential for sentience/intelligence/humanity" (after all, a newborn human
is much less sentient than my cat).

Simplifying the abortion debate to one of sentience and neurology is not
very useful, IMO, particularly because it misses much of what the debate is
about in the minds of those who deeply care about it.  To most people, the
morality of abortion is not about science.  Just as most people do not view
most questions about morality (and politics) to be about science.  Some
small subset view logic  as an appropriate means of resolving questions
about morality, and these logical moralist may or may not have a use for
scientific data (some do, some don't).

Thinking that a moral and poltical debate can be resolved by an item of
technical knowledge misses a great deal of the richness of human psychology.

Feel free to distinguish your viewpoint from "devil take the hindmost" to a

Say what? You lost me here, chief. Let's assume that someone has and is
paying for a suspension contract and the associated life insurance policy
or other hunk of money.
Calling that "squandering" is pretty high-handed; are you a Fabian? Or, if
that's not what you meant, what did you mean?

Let's see now, could this be an idea that no one has ever thought of
hereabouts?
Or could it be sufficiently charged that those who have thought of it don't
talk about it?
Hmmm, let me think, let me think.

>Furthermore, cryonics seems entropic in that it denies

How? I fail to see how a personal desire to take a long shot on not
becoming worm food has anything do to with any such "denial". 

Or perhaps you're talking about the people working in the field. Is going
to MIT and dropping out, or going to Julliard and then becoming a taxi
driver, any less such a denial? What do you propose doing about those sorts
of people--they "squander" the attention of the school staffs, don't they?
Hmm, stricter entrance exams?

BTW, for some reason your comments seem reminiscent of Lyndon Larouche's
argument that [paraphrased] "the proper population of Earth is 20(+)
billion, since it will maximize the number of geniuses alive at one time".
Not saying it *is* the same, but it smacks of it to yours truly.

>Scientists

>consequently would have no reason to perform resurrections. 

As a foregone conclusion, this is of course self-fulfilling. _You_ wouldn't
revive _me_; I'm not even genius grade. (Thanks for the heads up. :)) 

BUT--not even if all it cost were equivalent to the cost of today's Life
Flight helicopter ride and a couple of days in the ICU? say, twelve grand?
That *is* parsimonious of you; have you considered a career in managed care
cost containment? :)

And the two are naturally mutually exclusive? Somehow I missed a turn.
Let's not restore the old warbirds (or augment them)--everyone in the
future should be fly-by-wire from the keel up? This is a viewpoint, I
grant. See my next comment.

Well, there seems no shortage of conceit hereabouts. :) 

Permit me to say that I find the twin challenges created  by cryonics, or
_whatever "ambulance to the future" it mutates into as technology
improves_, to be 
  a) creating a world that wouldn't mind bringing corpsicles back, 
      and probably augmenting them if they're willing, and
b) creating a world that I (were I a corpsicle) wouldn't mind coming back to.

(I.e., "Worth the bother", from both social and individual POV.)

I am completely willing to grant that one or both of these may not come to
be. Nevertheless, 
nothing you've said so far convinces me that my using those two issues
daily as ethical-political guide stars is in any way entropic or conceited.

Sorry (sin),

MMB

I am guessing that this is based on average life expectancy. Note that the
current average includes people of all ages. The average life expectancy
for my generation is higher than that of my parents, if just based on
improved health care.

It all depends on when you expect life extension technology to become
available. I'm thinking the next ten to fifteen years. We won't need
nanotech to become immortal, IMHO, just good genetic engineering based
health care. Come down with a flu one week, you are immortal the next. We
will need nanotech to revive those cryo'ed, but those still living under
retirement age today should make it, for the most part.

Well, those are the non-sentient ones, that's the point... :-)

Exactly.  Potentially sentient entities should have potential rights,
real entities-real rights.  I could claim that every fertile woman who
passes by is a potential for carrying my sentient offspring, and she
would commit a crime if she refuses to do everything possible to bring
this potentiality into existence.

Of course, a fetus is less intelligent, sensitive, purposeful, coordinated,
etc. than a cat or even a frog.   It takes a real idiot to go against all
reason and claim that this blob of flesh that can later turn into a sentient
human if given proper food and education (*everything* can be turned into
a sentient human with proper addition of matter and knowledge) is somehow
"sacred" just because of this fact or because it looks somewhat like a human.

But then, of course, a newborn baby is also inferior to a cat, so rationally,
getting rid of them is ethically no worse than killing a cow - right?
And then, there are mentally retarded folk who will never turn into anything
sentient...   But that's really different... right?

You seem to have some serious misconceptions about cryonics, and the
expectations of cryonicists.  For the record, I expect that the development
of appropriate revival technology will be funded by the same trust fund that
keeps me suspended - i.e. its my money, and that of other cryonicists.  We
aren't asking you or anyone else to spend a single penny, or a second of
your time.  All you have to do is leave us alone.

As for whether people should sign up in the first place - well, this is a
perfect example of the sort of things people should be free to decide for
themselves.

Then you need to take another look at what people are actually doing.  Right
now cryonics consumes an utterly trivial amount of money ( < $1 million
annually ), none of which comes from public sources.  What research money it
does consume is mostly devoted to improved methods of organ
cryopreservation, which is quite useful for conventional medical purposes.
The only other near-term research prospect is reversible biostasis, which
again would have many important applications in general society.

Reviving current suspendees would require both advanced nanotechnology and
very advanced AI.  Meaningful research on the topic is unlikely to be
possible until after we have already eliminated diseases, ageing, and just
about any other imaginable medical problem.  Even intelligence enhancement
is a simpler problem.  So, your entire list will be old hat by the time
'non-productive' cryonics research could even be attempted.

In other words, you don't think it will work, so no one should bother doing
it.  We'll, that's your choice - and again, no one is asking you to lift a
finger.

My, what a wonderfully deathist set of memes.  By that logic, we should all
just shoot ourselves at age 75 to make room for the next generation.

Cryonics is an insurance policy aimed at improving one's odds of surviving
long enough to take advantage of advanced medical technology (especially
life extension).  Morally, it is no different than a heart transplant.
Cryonicists have no desire to 'hold back' the rest of the world - we just
want to live.

> Cryonics contains the seed of its own demise, namely, entropic conceit.

Try as I may, I can see nothing "entropic" about a desire to save lives.

Yes, but it's *incorrect* human psychology.  I mean, the old debate
about whether the Earth went around the Sun incorporated the same overly
"rich" psychology.  I know perfectly well that the abortion debate
represents ancient religious principles, overcompensation for centuries
of hideous injustice, decades of partisanship, rationalization, fuzzy
thinking, refusal to admit error, general hatred, and miscellaneous
bickering.  To perdition with it!  If it can't be resolved by techical

A few weeks ago on an episode of Ally McBeal, a woman sued to be allowed
to be kept asleep all the time.  (She had good dreams.)  In the end she
won, and they gave her a shot to knock her out.  I think they were going
to wake her up every week or two to see how she was doing.

I don't know if this is really possible, but it seems likely that you could
do this using various drugs.  Your metabolism would slow considerably, but
you'd still have to get up to eat and drink something every day or so, I'd
think.

There was a hibernation drug in John Crowley's _Engine_Summer_.
They'd get up every day to throw some more on the fire and eat a bit,
and then the smoke would put them back to sleep.  This is how they spent
the winter.

I understand that the brain represents a considerable fraction of our
energy consumption (at least while we are at rest) so I don't think you
could reduce the metabolism too much and still be conscious and alert.

You don't have to be interested.  I agree with you -- I'm not interested in
getting either myself or Extropianism into the morality-of-abortion debate.

But, unlike your example of orbital motion, knowledge of moral "right and
wrong" is not currently empirical, and probably never will be.  Empirical
knowledge explains (subject to revision, if you follow the scientific
method), but it doesn't guide.  It is likely that the best empiricism will
ever come up with is outcome-optimizing strategies for action when faced
with a moral question.  But empirical knowledge can't tell you which
optimized outcome to prefer.  For example, do I permit ten "innocents" to
die to save my neck?  That is a "moral" question that empirical knowledge
will probably never be able to help you with.

Empiricism doesn't make other forms of knowledge and experience
"incorrect."  Your personal bias in favor of empirical knowledge is just
that, a personal bias.  It is not the totality of human experience.  The
"richness" of human psychology and experience is broader than empirical
knowledge.  It is probably a rationally maximizing decision, based on your
personal utility function, to choose to limit and specialize yourself
within the general and diverse "richness" of human experience, but it is an
unjustified conceit (i.e., one lacking an empirical basis) to assume that
those who choose other specializations, who have other interests, or who
have other utility functions are "incorrect."

Sasha seems to be agreeing with my point, while having ignored it :-)

My point was that the morality of abortion is not easily reduced to a
question of neurology and/or "sentience" in the mind of those who care
about the question.  To most, morality is more complicated than that.

I take no (public) stance on the actual morality of abortion.  I have an
opinion, but I don't care about it enough to risk being drawn into dealing
with and/or debating those people who do _deeply_ care about the issue.
Because of their passion for the issue, they (on both sides) demand far too
much time, energy, money and other scarce resources, considering that my
interests lie elsewhere.

I agree with Eliezer's post that the Extropian principles should not
contain such a statement either, but I think his reason is flawed.  My
opinion for why the Extropian principles should be silent is closely
related to my own reasons for silence.  It's a pragmatic reaction to the
risk on being drawn into a costly political debate over an issue (the
morality of abortion) that is at best tangential to Extropianism.

A question more closely related to Extropianism (at least the political
threads thereof) is the view of the Principles on whether the state should
be imposing a certain view of morality on individuals.  But that question
is broader than and different from the issue of the _morality_ of abortion.
I don't think that Extropianism, as I understand it, has much to say on the
morality of abortion.

Being explicitly pro-choice (and for the legalization of drugs, prostitution,
euthanasia, abortion and other victimless crimes) sends the right
kind of (progressive, rational & open-minded) message, and it's certainly
in the spirit of the Extropian principles. Examples like these make it easier
for people to understand the Extropian vibe, and show that the philosphy
is "socially aware". It might even make the more futuristic issues easier
to swallow.

Yep, here's where even the most fanatical pro-choice people 
become incapable of rigorous rational thought, and get sentimental. 
IMO there should be (with regard to legal matters) some kind of
official value scale on which an individual is (roughly) measured, with 
babies and complete retards at the bottom, and the hyperintelligent/
sentient at the top. So basically your rights would grow as you'd 
develop mentally (which is more or less already the case with things 
like driver's licences, alcohol & tobacco consumption, voting etc.) 
Because of the (slight) possibility of recovery, the "braindead" or 
otherwise comatose should retain their former status. 

Of course the system shouldn't be constructed so that the most 
"sentient" individuals would have a carte blanche for killing the lesser 
developed, but one should certainly eliminate such things as mothers 
going to jail for killing their newborn infant, let alone for having an abortion.

Not at all!  The point others have been trying to make is that outlawing
abortion is legislating morality, irrespective of the *actual* morality,
and thus against the Extropian Principles.  My point is that there
exists a plausible position stating that abortion is not "immoral", it
is "violating the right to life of another sentient", and thus
prohibited by the Extropian Principles.

Since no additional definition is provided to the fundamental questions
of abortion by the Extropian axioms, and since the Extropians themselves
are divided, it is erroneous to state that Extropians are for, or
against, abortion - which is a statement I've seen, both on this list,
and in articles about Extropians.

Is abortion controversial?  Yes, but it's a controversy it well
deserves!  The stakes are either millions of innocent lives or the
freedom of millions of innocent women.  And, if the Extropian Principles
had some bearing on it, we shouldn't hesitate to say so, just as we
don't hesitate to make controversial statements about the utility of
cryonics or intelligence enhancement.  But they don't, and we shouldn't
embroil Extropians qua Extropians in the conflict.

Dear J.R. Molloy:  I'm more talented and gifted than you are.  Please
shoot yourself.

A sufficiently altruistic Extropian might decide that investing $100K in
Cycorp and/or Zyvex takes precedence over cryonic preservation. 
Consoling ourselves by saying cryonics isn't important is silly.  It's
not all-important.  It might be unnecessary or undesirable.  There still
exists a significant probability that it is important, necessary and desirable.

Information must never be destroyed.  It's a simple precaution.

I've made packs with others, regarding our return after cryonic 
freezing. Although I am young enough at this stage in technology that I 
may not have to even bother concerning myself with death. (in my 
nano-opinion) However, if it comes to that, I will take a higher 
percentage of a chance with cryo, than having none at all.

I've just about completed reading Ray Durzweil's book "The Age of Spiritual
Machines".  

Assuming he is mostly correct then I beleive he's answered the question as to
where all the Extra Terrestrials are.  Theyre in cyberspace.

I beleive he described the singularity.

He mentions using bucky tubes as a possible building material for very future
powerful comuputers. This would appear to indicate that carbon would be a very
useful material for a post singularity culture.  

What type of Stellar engineering would be required to alter  a star generate
excessive carbon?  What might it look like from earth?

Steve Forbes is a one issue candidate.  His primary concern is to push a
flat tax through Congress.  Unfortunately, the fact that a flat tax would be
a fiscal catastrophe doesn't appear to be a concern of Forbes.  However, I
doubt Forbes' zeal for the flat tax has nothing to do with the estimated $1
billion USD he'd save in income taxes alone if a flat tax were passed.

Here are some current musings of mine.

Transhumanism - The philosophy which advocates achieving complete control over
myself and my environment in order to improve (as I define improvement)
myself.

Some Transhuman philosophical challenges:
1)  Who am I? (the defining of the self)
2)  How do I determine if another entity in my environment has a self?
3)  How do I interact with others with a self who are in the same environment?

Obviously, working toward the first definition wouldn't be ethically difficult
if it weren't for the fact that there seems to be other beings with a sense of
self in my environment, and this leads to the question, "If I have the right
to control myself and my environment, don't they?  But if they are in my
environment, then they are a part of my environment, so don't I need to
control them?  And if they are in my environment, aren't I in their
environment, and thus something they need to control?  Maybe if I left out
that part about my environment and focused on myself....but wait, I am rather
strongly embedded in my environment, in fact on some levels it is difficult to
discern where I stop and the environment starts, and it is awefully hard to
totally control my life without at least some control of my environment....uh
oh.

Extropianism - a broad theory of how best to achieve >H goals based on the
concept that rationality, extreme decentralization, and maximization of free
and copious flows of information and resources provides the best environment
to foster Transhumanism.

These are just some working ideas....I would love some feedback.

If one does not restrict the view to solids, supercooled helium is supposed
to conduct heat at the speed of sound in the fluid, but I do not know
the details.  I am told if you have a volume of superfluid helium then
you cant have a warmer pocket within the superfluid mass.  It is either
all superfluid or all non-superfluid.  This came up as an issue with the
Gravity Probe B satellite, an instrument which is inside a dewar filled with
superfluid helium.  I dont know if it fits the SciFi definition
of a thermal superconductor tho.

Since a true thermal superconductor would be up against the limits
imposed by the second law of thermodynamics,  it is appropriate
that *extropians* should be discussing it.  {8^D spike

Ah, the Abortion issue strikes again....

My current opinion on the whole abortion issue:
1) The main issue of contention is one of what rights does a developing human
have at various stages in that development.
2) Also at issue is how these rights (if any) weigh against the rights of a
person who is acting as a life support system (aka mom) and thus SERIOUSLY
effected by the issue.

The answering of the first question requires two parts.  The first is a
moral/ethical/philosophical selection of which qualities confer protection on
a being (these rules need to exist anytime you have two or more entities you
wish to have cooperate).  Historically, those qualities suggested have tended
to be attached to the meme of Personhood.  This is the hard part.  The second
part merely requires the use of scientific method to determine what beings
most likely possess these qualities and in what measure.  In my formulation,
both philosophy and science are required to arrive at an answer.  The one
without the other is rather useless for this debate, I think.

Once we establish when (if ever) a prepartum being has some protected status,
then we must begin to balance the freedoms and rights of the mother against
those of this being.  I believe this to be a difficult but not insurmountable
question.

I would guess that for the immediate future, the best we could do is come up
with answers which are not absolute, but represent a spectrum of degrees of
uncertainty (at X level of development, there is Y% chance that this is a
"person") and the degree of discretion the mother would have would be based on
this degree of uncertainty and her own person risks/costs.

So, anyone care to take a stab at a few qualities which are worth conferring a
protected status to?

Oh, don't I just love sticking my head into hornet nests?

Who should live?  What is the Extropian value of bringing back old models of
humans?

First, it depends on your perspective....if you are some future society, then
there may be no value.  Then again, if you are the one hoping to come back,
there is a HECK of a lot of value.  

But I would argue that there is a value in bringing back the frozen dead
(besides altruism).  They may not be as smart, or as fast, or many other
things as the future population, but they have two PROVEN qualities.  One is
experience....a fairly rich cache of them, which when incorporated into that
future society, may prove useful.  For example, if the Amazonian Rainforest is
gone, and you're trying to recreate it as a tourist attraction, it might be
useful to hire as consultants some people who actually visited it while still
around to make sure you're getting the "feel" right.  Or let's say we've
finally found some ETs, turns out they are not friendly, but the last war was
outside living memory....unless you spent some time in the deep freeze.  That
hands-on experience of battle mixed in with state of the art might be useful.
Oh, but that sort of ties into the second quality, SURVIVAL.  These relics of
the past are are personalities that were pretty strongly wired to find ways to
escape entropy.  Now, granted, the future may know some ways to program this
in, but these would be truly tested models.  Upgrading the cryonicists and
using them to augment the future's understanding of what it means to be a
fighter, and to beat the odds, may be more valuable than anything else we
could bring to the future.

Then again, maybe not....but I like to think so, and what is life but the
constant struggle fulfil seemingly futile hope?  

TRANSCEND!

If that is the reason, then the extropian position should be "abortion of
non-sentient life is OK" Neurology can then define the impact, but extropy
has a stance.

In fact, the real reason for no policy is that, as stated clearly in this
forum, extropy is a pragmatic philosophy with no fixed moral platform.

I am seeking to develop an alternative, but, as yet, will confess to having
not succeeded.

I fail to see how it could be a fiscal catastrophe. Its generally recognised
that the 17% rate he proposes is revenue neutral, and considering that the
average millionaire actually pays taxes in the 14% range indicates that the rich
will actually pay more.

Well I decided to do some checking.  I went to the Forbes website and
did a search on the word "libertarian" and the result was a ZERO.  This 
supposedly "Libertarian minded" candidate does not have the word 
appearing even once on his site.  Well OK I said, what about some 
issues I care about.  So I used the search feature on the forbes2000.com
website to find the following:

Gun Control
   Forbes Position: ????, I did a search on gun control and the search engine
   took me to a page titled "The Steve Forbes Medical Savings Accounts"

War on (Some) Drugs
   Forbes Position - It is society's "right" to protect itself against
drugs by
   passing laws

Censorship (Internet or otherwise)
   Forbes Position - ??? - Search engine turned up nothing for
"censorship", "CDA",
   "pornography" or "decency"

Abortion
   Forbes Position - ??? - "Today, however, there is no doubt  medically,
   genetically  that individual human life begins at conception, and ends
   with natural death."

No, Forbes is NOT "LIbertarian minded", in my opinion he just another
conservative
Republican who plays kissy face with the religious right.  Just read some
of the
stuff on the forbes2000.com website.  

I can not stop anyone from posting a messages urging support for conservative,
republicans with anti-Extropian views however I will suggest that any such
post will be met with a response.

I had no intention of interfering or intruding in any way. I simply pointed
out to Randall that it would serve transhuman extropy better to fund
intelligence augmentation, bionic engineering, and synthetic evolution
rather than salvaging unavoidable obsolescence.

Obviously people have that liberty. Extropians also have the freedom to
endorse alternative means to arrive at a posthuman destiny. It comes down to
a matter of personal taste, I suppose. I envision a future in which people
_create_ better, smarter, stronger people rather than dredging them up from
the morgue.

Okay, so how does that help us decide "Who Should Live?" (the topic of the

By the time "we have already eliminated diseases, aging, and just about any
other imaginable medical problem" we might conceivably have the means to
create a better human (transhuman) than any genius who ever lived. So why go
backward, when we can go forward? How to justify salvaging what we've
already surpassed? Not only would the entire list become "old hat" it would
become garbage by the time you mention. Which restates my point.

In other words, I think extropic humans can (and will) do better, so no one
needs to lift a finger for cryonic humans. If some people choose to dwell on
cryonics instead of more powerful extropic technologies, then, based on the
figures you've supplied here, it won't amount to much waste. So it doesn't
much matter.

If, in contrast to this scenario, cryonics succeeds to the point where the
question, "Who Should Live" becomes more than a parlor game, to that extent
it subverts extropy, because it supports stagnation more than it supports
progress.

No one has asked me to lift a finger... no, they just asked, "Who Should
Live?" Lucky for me the answer to that question does not require lifting a
finger. Those who should live precisely correspond to those who surpass
those who have died. Neither you nor I, but rather posthumans shall decide
ultimately. Physically and finally, we will have to die as humans in order
to become posthumans. So, the only thing cryonics can contribute to extropy
relates to how it might help to develop transhumans, i.e., how it can
displace humans with posthumans.

Of course you might prefer to think of life as a smooth, uninterrupted,
transitional, evolutionary process with no annoying individual deaths -- a
gentle morphological flow from one form to another. In counterpoint to this,
I see the phase shift from human to posthuman as a quantum punctuation of

No, not "deathist" whatever that means, but rather extropic. By this logic,
we should all just focus on reaching our full potential as creative
entities, and supporting technology which will itself evolve into new forms
of life. You don't need to lift a finger (or put a finger on the trigger),
as that master of the bleeding obvious, Swinburne has written, "No man lives
forever, dead men rise up never."

"shoot ourselves at age 75"? I don't know why, but that reminds me of Jerry
Garcia and the Grateful Dead. Or perhaps it has to do with your word
"deathist." I have nothing to do with any of that, but anyone who hasn't
seriously considered suicide hasn't grown up yet.
The next generation will make room for itself, don't worry about that.

Okay, fine. As Soupy Sales used to say, "All you insurance salesmen... Watch
your policies!"
I understand the motives behind cryonics. I also understand that the
political realities of a severely overpopulated planet will need to change
as drastically as any technology in order for cryonicists to survive the
next punctuation in evolution. And I understand that I may have completely
missed the mark in this respect, and cryonics may really take off in the
coming years, so that tens of millions of people opt for cryonic suspension
rather than cremation or burial. Whatever happens, I don't think I'll shoot
myself to make room for the next generation. I may just shoot myself because
I understand that I've already lived as much as I can, and hanging around
annoys others as much as it bores me. That probably won't happen for another
ten or fifteen years. At any rate, I'd better get busy and scrape up the
money to freeze my shot-dead body.

>Try as I may, I can see nothing "entropic" about a desire to save lives.

The meme "saving lives" entails entropy because it seeks to stop dynamic
change and spontaneous natural order. I think that when we more clearly
understand biology at all its levels, from the molecular to the societal and
ecological levels, we will begin to appreciate the significance of our
existence more fully. Extropy gives us order for free, and when we intrude
on that order, even with the best of intentions (or with selfish intentions)
to save lives, we smash against the complex algorithms of life itself.

Perhaps my raving here amounts to "deathism" but death and birth eternally
form the two sides of life. Yet, by the logic of cryonicism, we should
freeze talented and gifted persons while still young and healthy (you should
freeze yourself while you're still young and healthy), so that cryonics can
preserve you in good shape, thereby providing a better chance for a
successful revival -- to save your life for a future time of advanced
medical technology, especially life extension.

You think of this as an argument against cryonics, but really it just argues
for an answer to the question "Who Should Live?" I say those should live who
grab life by the throat every day and squeeze the juice out of every moment.
I say William Blake got it extropically correct when he wrote:
"Who seeks to bind herself a joy
Does its winged life destroy
Who touches beauty as he flies
Lives in eternity's sunrise."

Cheers,

"Fabian"? Sounds like a 50s (incrementalist?) Rock 'n' Roll singer.

I meant that if I (as an extropian thinker) had to decide between spending
time and energy (money/resources)  on reviving a dead genius versus creating
a  new and improved super-genius, one with double the talent and giftedness,
I'd go for the 2nd Level model. To put it another way, it means that
spending $2,000 on a new computer system makes more sense than
_squandering_ $2,000 upgrading/reviving a deceased vintage 386.

Cryonics denies resources to other kinds of science (bionic/human
engineering, symbiotic intelligence augmentation, etc.) that could build
better humans, which means more talented and gifted humans than the ones you
want to rescue from worms. Cryonics "denies" resources to transhuman
engineering in that it uses the resources that the other sciences need.

Yes, but it would depend on what field they worked in. Strict entrance exams
probably do more to promote extropy than sloppy ones do.

I had not intended to convince anyone of anything. I simply took the

successfully pointing out the advantages of extropy over cryonics. <sigh>

Consoling yourself that cryonics makes sense doesn't make it so.
Unimportant, unnecessary, and undesirable don't add up to much, true enough.
If you'd gamble on such probabilities, your $100K would help to build a nice

You can't destroy information, you can only change it into other forms of

 "An Insulin Index of Foods: The Insulin Demand Generated by 1000-kJ
 Portions of Common Foods"
 American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 66: 1264-1276 1997
 Susanne HA Holt, Janette C Brand Miller, and Peter Petocz
 
Abstract:

   The aim of this study was to systematically compare postprandial
 insulin responses to isoenergetic 1000 kJ (240-kcal) portions of several
 common foods. Correlations with nutrient content were determined.
 Thirty-eight foods separated into six food categories (fruit, bakery
 products, snacks, carbohydrate-rich foods, protein-rich foods, and
 breakfast cereals) were fed to groups of 11-13 healthy subjects.
 Finger-prick blood samples were obtained every 15 min over 120 min. An
 insulin score was calculated from the area under the insulin response
 curve for each food with use of white bread as the reference food (score
 = 100%). Significant differences in insulin score were found both within
 and among the food categories and also among foods containing a similar
 amount of carbohydrate. Overall, glucose and insulin scores were highly
 correlated (r = 0.70, P < 0.001, n = 38). However, protein-rich foods and
 bakery products (rich in fat and refined carbohydrate elicited insulin
 responses that were disproportionately higher than their glycemic
 responses. Total carbohydrate (r = 0.39, P < 0.05, n = 36) and sugar (r =
 0.36, P < 0.05,n = 36) contents were positively related to the mean
 insulin scores, whereas fat (r = -0.27, NS, n = 36) and protein (r =
 -0.24, NS ,n = 38) contents were negatively related. Consideration of
 insulin scores may be relevant to the dietary management and pathogenesis
 of non-insulin-dependant diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia and may
 help increase the accuracy of estimating preprandial insulin
 requirements.

I'm not sure who is "generally" recognizing that Forbes' 17% tax rate is
revenue neutral, but the U.S. Department of Treasury is not one of them.
The Treasury estimates Forbes' plan will revenue shortfalls of $200
billion+.  The Archer, Gramm, and Kemp flat tax proposals are as bad or
worse.  Even Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka, who first proposed the concept
of a flat tax in 1983, have stated that a flat tax is not tenable.


>and considering that the

>will actually pay more.


First, you pay federal income taxes on your current income, not your net
worth.  Thus, net worth is not a good indicator of effective tax rate.
Secondly,  the top marginal tax rate in the U.S. is 39.6%.  Since this rate
applies to income over $200,000 its obviously wrong to think that the
"average" top-tier income earner's effective tax rate is 14%.  Also, Forbes
plan eliminates taxation of capital gains and interest.  70% of all capital
gains and interest income is realized by the top 5% of American society.
Here we have a tax rate change from 28%/20% to 0%. It is quite clear that
under Forbes flat tax proposal (and the others as well) that the upper and
upper middle class will receive all of the tax benefit.  Furthermore,
according to the Treasury, 69% of the tax benefit generated by Forbes plan
inures to the top 3%.

The flat tax promotes the myth that a simpler tax code must incorporate a
single tax rate regime.  This is absolutely wrong.  Forbes, Archer and other
GOP disciples are attempting to capitalize on the average American's
ignorance of the complexities of the tax system.  The complexity in the
current tax system is not the progressive tax rate (there are 4 or 5 tax
rates which are very easy to follow).  The complexity in the current tax
system is determining what is "taxable income".  We can keep the progressive
tax concept (i.e., higher income earners pay a larger portion of their
earnings than lower earners) while simplifying the tax code.  But why would
Forbes and others want to do that when they can captalize on the public's
distaste for the current tax system by deceiving them into supporting a huge
tax cut for Forbes and the rest of his wealthy buddies.

There are already carbon stars, and some red giants accumulate carbon
soot in their outer atmosphere where it can likely be scooped up. And
the R Coronae Borealis stars are even better: they seem to accumulate
so much carbon that their light output drops a 100 times over 10-20
days, and then blow away the carbon shell. Yum-yum for the posthumans!

looks interesting :-)

RCBs are fairly rare, so either there are few carbon-gobbling beings
out there, or they exploit the stars to such an extent we never notice
anything unusual. Maybe RCBs are simply stars where the local carbon
economy has strong booms and busts, while most other stars are simply
better (self)regulated :-)

I agree that Forbes' economic policies APPEAR to be more capitalism
friendly than any of the other government-subsidized candidates (Reps
and Dems), but he still advocates taxation!  Why vote for a socialist? 

Let's look at how the two major parties stack up to the Extropian
Principles:

1.  Perpetual Progress:  "Seeking more intelligence, wisdom, and
effectiveness, an indefinite lifespan, and the removal of political,
cultural, biological, and psychological limits to self-actualization
and self-realization."

Hee hee hee!  Can you imagine either of the subsidized parties going
along with ANY of this?  Can you imagine any politician actually
removing ANY barrier?

2.  Self-Transformation  "Affirming continual moral, intellectual,
and physical self-improvement, through critical and creative thinking,
personal responsibility, and experimentation."

Liberals may come closer to this than conservatives, but I don't think
you could accuse either camp of "critical" thinking.

3.  Practical Optimism  "Fueling action with positive expectations.
Adopting a rational, action-based optimism, in place of both blind
faith and stagnant pessimism."

Well, conservatives = blind faith.  And again, can we even use the
word rational in conjunction with a discussion about politics?

4. Intelligent Technology  "Applying science and technology
creatively to transcend 'natural' limits imposed by our biological
heritage, culture, and environment. Seeing technology not as an end in
itself but as an effective means towards the improvement of life."

Nope.  Can't see any conservative or liberal embracing this principle.
 Transcending 'natural' limits would make a conservative (think
Falwell) wet his pants.  And Liberals couldn't get past the cultural
and environmental limits.

5. Open Society  "Supporting social orders that foster freedom of
speech, freedom of action, and experimentation. Opposing authoritarian
social control and favoring the rule of law and decentralization of
power. Preferring bargaining over battling, and exchange over
compulsion. Openness to improvement rather than a static utopia."

The second sentence says it all.  Neither of the subsidized political
parties would ever go along with either opposing authoritarian social
controls or the decentralization of power.  Both Liberals and
Conservatives are interested in a very CLOSED society that adheres to
their notions of what is "normal."

6. Self-Direction  "Seeking independent thinking, individual freedom,
personal responsibility, self-direction, self-esteem, and respect for
others."

*ROTFLMAO*

7. Rational Thinking  "Favoring reason over blind faith and
questioning over dogma. Remaining open to challenges to our beliefs
and practices in pursuit of perpetual improvement. Welcoming criticism
of our existing beliefs while being open to new ideas."

Whoops!  Let's not even go there.  :)

Conclusion:

Politics and Extropianism do not mix.  The day we find a candidate who
will adhere to the Extropian Principles is the day that we should
crown him/her Absolute Monarch for life!  :)

Opinion:

Democracy is simply a mechanism allowing the few (ethnic, social,
corporate, cultural, philosophical minorities) to rule the many.  In
order to be elected any given candidate must pander to the wishes of
as many of these minority groups as possible.  

Any vote cast in any election is simply your way of submitting to the
absolute power of the State.  There was a website (I forget which one)
during the elections in November that I saw - it had a cartoon of a
hideous monster with a caption that read "Thank you for your vote
Slave!"

As for my pick?  Why vote for the lesser of two evils?  Check out:

J.R.,

   I agree that it makes more sense to buy a new computer than to upgrade an
old 386....so in the hardware department I'm with you.  However, when I buy a
new computer, I usually move as much of my old software as possible to the new
system, and even where it is not practical to move programs, I will take the
time to transfer my data from the old files into files which can use the new
programs.  A good example are my various writings; short stories, poems, etc.
The earliest ones started out handwritten, were later typed, then entered into
my first word processor, the whole program and files transferred over when I
bought a new computer, then the files switched over to a new word processor
when I decided it was better.  This information was valuable enough (to me at
least) to go through all those transformations.  They now exist in a form that
I don't think I would have imagined when I was younger.  But you know what?
They are still the same stories and poems, and they still have value for me.
In the same way, I believe that the personalities of cryonicists are valuable,
and that cryonics is like putting our personality files on disk, so they can
be transferred to a new system.  

   You also made the statement that, "....anyone who hasn't seriously
considered suicide hasn't grown up yet."  Well, then I guess I haven't, and
probably never will "grow up".  Actually, I made the decision a long time ago
to cultivate certain neotonic (sp?) traits, and hold on to them.  A sense of
play, a child-like joy in exploration, the belief that I can be whatever I
want to be, etc.  I believe these childish traits are in part what allows
children to learn so much easier than adults (along with some
neurodevelopmental factors).  And I have to admit to a few (very few)
irrational beliefs at this time, in fact they rise to the level of articles of
faith.  
-I believe it is better to be than not to be.
-I believe I will never run out of things to keep me interested (the universe
is big), and if I did, then I'd create something, and even if I couldn't
create something, I'd keep myself occupied doing the impossible (trying to
create something interesting).
-I believe it is better to do good than ill (by good I mean increase well
being, both in myself and the world around me).
These irrational beliefs (and they are irrational, for I can not absolutely
prove their value, mean that I will always look for a way to live, even in the
most hopeless of circumstances.  I will always look for a way to enjoy my
life, even in the most dismal of worlds.  And I will always look to make
myself and my world better, no matter how futile the task seems.  This belief
system pretty much precludes serious thoughts of suicide (even not so serious
ones).  Maybe it means I'm not grown up, but if that's so, then who wants to
grow up anyway?  And further, though my belief system may be irrational, I do
believe that they confer a survival advantage over other systems (though
survival itself could be considered irrational).

Thanks for sharing your perspective.

Glen

Those critics at the time failed to do two things:
a) they expected to keep all existing loopholes (most would be closed under
Forbes' plan)
b) they refused to utilize dynamic scoring (which we can see by today's
unexpected surplus is in fact the proper way to calculate tax revenues.)

When these two factors ARE taken into account, the 17% flat tax is in fact
revenue neutral.

The top marginal tax rate may be set at that level, but the only people who pay
it are those who do not follow the advice of their tax accountant. former Pres.
George Bush, for example, and his wife filed a tax return in either 90 or 91
which showed that their income was nearly a million dollars, yet their final tax
bill came to only 14% of their income.

Your claim about the tax benefits going to the top 3% are true only if you keep
existing tax loopholes, and expect (paradoxically) that everyone is now paying
the maximum percentage for their tax bracket, as if they were not using and tax
loopholes. Obviously this is cooking the books.

The problem with a 'progressive' system is that it is easy to hide loopholes for
the rich in there, but not so easy with a flat system. The rich get 90% of the
tax loopholes.

How about because, as the stock market indicates, when people are allowed to
keep their money, rather than it being confiscated, the economy grows faster,
thus increasing tax revinues. Its called dynamic scoring.

Nice coincidence, we're discussing democracy on the local Swedish

Actually, what you really should be saying is that "*Current
representative democracy* is simply...."; representative democracy is
just a subset of a larger set of democratic forms, some of which may
have very different properties. Then again, I agree with your critique
of the current system, and obviously it is worth looking for a better
alternative.

Hmm, what about the extropian principles applied to the Elder Party?

Perpetual Progress: Definitely. Unfortunately it doesn't involve
humanity.

Self-Transformation: Definitely. Although in slimy directions. 

Practical optimism: Doesn't the party represten practical pessimism?

Intelligent technology: Definitely (just think of all the life
extension, intelligence augmentation and brains-in-jars in Lovecraft's
stories). Although it will be quite alien, employ black magic and eat
people's souls. 

Open Society: "for then mankind would have become as the Great Old
Ones; free and wild, and beyond good and evil, with laws and morals
thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and revelling in
joy. Then the liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout
and kill and revel and enjoy themselves, and all earth would flame
with a holocaust of ecstacy and freedom." Hard to get a more open
society than that :-)

Self-Direction: See above. 

Rational Thinking: discouraged by Azathoth - if The Lord of the
Universe doesn't think, why should you?

Overall, it seems like the Elder Party is more extropian than the
others.  And remember, there are few cryonics slogans better than
"That is not dead which can eternal lie // And with strange eons, even
death may die."  :-)

As it currently exists, transhumanism is incapable of funding significant
research of any kind (unless we've got a few closet billionaires I don't
know about).  To my mind, that makes any serious debate about what we should
spend our money on rather pointless - when we actually have some, then it
may be productive to argue about it.

So do I.  So do most other cryonicists.  I also hope to be one of those
enhanced people - and I intend to take every possible measure to increase
the odds of that happening.

> rather than dredging them up from the morgue.

Note the assumption that suspension patients are dead.  This is
self-contradictory.

If cryonics can never work, these people are dead.  They will never be
brought back, so the issue will not arise.

If they can be brought back, then they aren't dead in any meaningful sense.
They are equivalent (in a moral sense) to comatose hospital patients, or
people in suspended animation, or anyone else who is unconscious and unable
to resume normal functioning without medical attention.  We could substitute
the word "hospital" for "morgue", with no change in the moral content of the
statement.

> Okay, so how does that help us decide "Who Should Live?" (the

It was a purely hypothetical question, and it is pretty unlikely that
anything like it would ever arise in the real world.  Cryonic suspension is
not especially expensive (unless you're already 80 when you start thinking
about it), so it is pretty hard to find people who want to sign up but can't
afford to.  If someone knows about cryonics, and doesn't sign up, they've
made their decision.

Besides, I believe the spirit of Scott's question could be captured as "If
you could pick 10 people to live forever, who would they be?"  Its essence
is "Who do we most admire?", not "How should we spend our money?"

Obviously, in a realistic scenario no one we pick is likely to have much
impact on the future.  That isn't the point.

Would you say the same thing about life extension technology in general?

Deathism is the believe that death is a good thing.  It is generally found
as part of a belief in some sort of universal harmony, cycle, or order which
is more important than the individual, and too sacred to be subjected to
human meddling.  In the vast majority of cases people with this sort of
belief see any attempt to achieve physical immortality as morally repugnant,
or even evil.

IMO, this kind of thinking is one of the biggest problems we face today.  It
may have been a necessary adaptation in the days when there was no prospect
of real life extension, but that is no longer the case.  Today it promotes
an irrational acceptance of mortality that greatly impedes life extension
research, and is thus likely to lead to hundreds of millions of unnecessary
deaths.

Either I've completely missed your point, or you haven't thought this one
through.

If a singularity is immanent, the whole modern concept of the overpopulated
Earth is meaningless.  Even primitive nanotech would enable the Earth to
support hundreds of billions of people in luxury.  It would also easily
allow us to move our entire civilization into space, restore the Earth to a
pristine state, recreate the vast majority of all extinct species, and
terraform Mars and Venus to boot.  Resource scarcity would not become an
issue for many centuries - and this is just pre-singularity technology.

That being the case, the idea that reviving cryonicists contributes to
overpopulation doesn't make much sense.

I doubt it.  IMO, the general population will not embrace cryonics until a
fully reversible procedure is available - at which point we aren't talking
about the same thing.

If you don't want to live, then there would hardly be any point to getting
yourself frozen.

But, come on, "ten or fifteen years"?  Surely you can do better than that.
If nothing else, don't you want to see how it all turns out?

I see.  So, does this also apply to life extension research?  What about
treatments for age-related illnesses like Alzheimer's and heart disease?  Or
how about cancer treatments, organ transplants, and blood transfusions?
These are all ways that we "intrude" on the "complex algorithms of life
itself".

Ah, no.  That is a common misconception, but it has nothing to do with what
cryonicists actually think.

As some of us are fond of saying, being frozen is the second worst thing
that could ever happen to me.  I have no interest at all in being frozen
young, and I hope to avoid ever being frozen at all.  I'd much rather face
an unknown future on my own two feet than in a dewar.

However, I may not be that lucky.  I may come down with some incurable
disease, or get mangled in an auto accident, or meet some other untimely
end.  Or, I may be completely mistaken about how long advanced technologies
will take to arrive, and I may simply run out of lifespan too soon.  Either
way, being frozen is a second change - instead of being dead and gone, I
have a possibility of being revived.  Its still a bad situation, but it
isn't quite as bad as being worm food.

So do I.  But I don't intend to go quietly when the grim reaper comes
calling.  I have more to do, to say, to learn and to see that could ever be
accomplished in a human lifespan, and I'm not leaving until I'm done.

I think what I find most upsetting about your views on cryonics is that seem
unusually callous.  Perhaps this is because you keep referring to those who
are cryonically preserved as being dead.  Cryonicists believe that these
people are still alive. . . very sick, but still alive.  Is using CPR or a
defibrillator a waste of resources because the person is obviously dead?
Suspension protocols are most appropriately thought of as emergency medical
procedures designed to save someone's life.  Emergency medical procedures,
in general, have varying probabilities of success.  We don't know yet what
that probability figure is for cryonics but we believe that it is certainly
greater than zero.

Actually, I started this thread by asking those on the list to select the 5
people that they most wished would enbrace the idea of cryonics because the
world could ill-afford to lose their particular gifts.  There weren't very
many responses to _that_ question.  The issue of whether cryonic suspendees
should be revived or not is one that you brought up, I believe.

Well, for one thing, reviving a few geniuses and recruiting their talents
just may speed up the process of building a better human.  Besides, as has
been mentioned, the biotechnology that will lead to reversible suspensions
is going to progress anyway because there are a large number of medical
applications besides reviving cryonauts.

What are you saying here?  I must die in order to become a posthuman?  The
human race must die to make room for post humans?  That's news to me.

I can understand how I might compare a "posthuman version of me vs. the
current version of me" to "the current version of me vs. a 1 year-old
version of me".  In a sense, the 1 year-old version had to "die" to make
room for the current version of me.  I realize that my developmental
transitions have been pretty smooth so far, and I agree that future
transitions may be much more quantum-like.  Any transition from one state to
another involves the "death" of the earlier state, but is that the kind of
death you're referring to?

Uh-oh.  The meme, "Death and birth eternally form the two sides of life."
is a particularly virulent one, and helps explain many of your views.  Am I
alone in considering this meme to be more Yin-Yang, dualistic,
polarized-thining nonsense?  I also don't believe that cryonicists would
advocate being frozen in a young and healthy state.  It's true that I
personally resent the fact that the state can prevent me from arranging a
cryonic suspension while I'm still alive, though.  I would want the option
of assisted suicide with immediate suspension if I discovered, for example,
that I had developed Alzheimer's or if I was terminally ill and in a great
amount of pain.  Why waste thousands and thousands of dollars and medical
resources on palliative care that is only briefly delaying my deanimation
when I plan on being suspended anyway?

Yes, grabbing the gusto is a good thing. I intend to grab it for a long,

Cryonics is between individuals and the companies involved, no
public resources are "drained". In fact the spinoffs from cryonics
research including such things as organ freezing will save
hundred's of thousand's of people per year.

You have the same fears, based on the same lack of knowledge, as
the general populace when it comes to cloning. Cloning only
produces a biologically very similar organism, (not an exact
duplicate) no memories are involved. The clone of a genius will not
necessarily be a genius, in fact not even likely.

We don't seek to deny the creation of others, just the preservation
of ourselves.

We are not doing this for the world, but for ourselves. I don't
think any of us hoping to be revived would mind having our
intelligence increased by future tech. In fact I expect it.

Cryonics is not life denying, in fact I think it's the most life
affirming, positive outlook of the future there is.

(I'm assuming that Eliezer meant "moral" and not "immoral" for that
statement to make logical sense)

Eliezer seems to be projecting thoughts and beliefs into what I said.  Why,
I don't know  -- that's a soft question of human psychology, and I don't
know Eliezer well enough to make an educated guess.

Eliezer , if you look back objectively at what I wrote, you'll see that we
actually are in agreement, and that this is a point I (alongside your
"others") have been making.

Extropianism is properly concerned with taking a stand on the legislation
of morality -- I say that right in the snippet Eliezer quotes.

However, Extropianism does not answer the question of whether abortion is
moral.  On that we also agree.  The no-first-coercion principle (assuming
it is an accepted axiom of Extropianism, which a recent list debate called
into question) doesn't get you there, because the real moral question is
whether a fetus (or any other entity one might name) is deserving of the
protection of that principle.

Where we disagree is on whether that question can be answered by empirical
knowledge.  Eliezer argued that it could be.  I posited that it probably
couldn't.

Finally, I stated that for pragmatic reasons, I didn't think it was worth
it to embroil Extropianism as a whole in this issue, given my perception of
the costs and benefits of taking a stand.

See, this is what we agree on.  I don't know why Eliezer is projecting
disagreement.  I could theorize, but then I'd be projecting as well.  All I
disagree with is Eliezer's assumption that the moral question of whether an
entity should be protected under principles of a "right to life" can be
answered by reference to technical and empirical knowledge.  If not sloppy
thinking, it was sloppy writing, IMO, for Eliezer to have left out (or
assumed an unsupported answer to) the important step of determining the
value criteria.

I also agree here.  It is an important controversy, but that doesn't mean
it is important to Extropianism.  As Extropianism is currently defined.

Extropianism might one day attempt to rigorously answer the philosophical
question of which beings deserve protection under the no-first-coercion
principle.  As Glen Finney points out, in a post on this thread, this
question hasn't really been subject to much analytical rigor yet.  For now,
Extropians (and people in general) tend to answer this question on feel, on
an analog rather than binary continuum (i.e., most of us would probably
agree that parents have some moral right to coerce their children so as to
better guide their development, but that that coercion does not extend to
ending their existence), and pretty much tie their answer to memes of adult
human personhood.  It is therefore not surprising that reasonable
Extropians currently come to different conclusions.

It probably would be valuable to Extropianism to rigorously develop
philosophical answers to this question of which entities morally deserve
protection from coercion.  But it hasn't been done yet, and would probably
be a costly undertaking, in terms of time and quality thought if nothing
else.  I do know (though not in an empirical sense :-) that it is not worth
_my_ time.  I've already re-learned why I have a rule (which I violated)
not to post on anything abortion-related, given even rational people's (a
category which I do place Eliezer in, given his past posts) tendency to
assume they know what another thinks, rather than read what they wrote,
when discussing the topic.

Absent such an effort and such answers (which despite Glen's invitation, I
shall not undertake at this time), I agree with Eliezer that reasonable
Extropians can differ on the question of whether abortion is moral.  I just
don't agree that the answer can reduced to a simple empirical question.

You are incorrect.  The statement is as I meant to say it.  I suggest
that you put your own semantics in order before accusing others of
either misinterpretation or "projection".

There is a distinction between "immoral" and "violating rights".  You
cannot successfully legislate morality.  You can successfully legislate
rights, as long as that legislation is phrased as negative penalties for
violating the rights of others, rather than as positive entitlements.

And no, they are not the same thing.  Most Extropians would say it's
immoral to convert someone to an irrational cult so that you can bilk
them, but it should never be illegal.

Your statement appeared to say that abortion was merely immoral, rather
than rights-violating.  If that's not what you meant, fine - point out
that you're using a different interpretation of a statement which wasn't
ambiguous under your particular set of postulates, but which had
entirely different connotations under mine.  This is not properly known
as "projection", nor is it irrational.

Kindly do not engage in accusations of irrationality unless you
encounter a statement which CANNOT be explained in any other way.  It is
EXTREMELY impolite and destructive of rational discussion.

No, you don't.

After publishing 350K about how to build minds in general, and 100K
about how to build mine in particular, I know far better than to trust
my mind.  But I do trust myself to accurately evaluate claims that my
mind functions in a particular way; or that someone else knows the
emotional contents of my mind, and resultant functioning, better than I do.

Your claim follows a known pattern of generic conversational tactics
which have yet to produce useful self-analytic content, so I am not
granting it serious consideration.  This does involve an assumption
about the cognitive etiology of the claim; which, under The Rules, I am
permitted to publicly mention *only* because defense against this class
of conversational tactics may require response on the same level.

> Extropianism is properly concerned with taking a stand on the legislation

If you are using "moral" as synonymous with "noncoercion", then you are
incorrect.  We state that legislating against victimless "immorality" is
illegal, but we do legislate against coercion-based "immorality".

These are two different stands.  That is why we use two different terms.

Too late for that.
You started theorizing the moment you used the term "projection".

Excellent point.  Calculating the tax from a tax table or tax rate
schedule is the easy part.  The large direct compliance costs are
associated with the other data collection and interpretation issues.  But
there is an arguably much larger cost associated with a complex income
tax system, and that is the adverse economic impact of tax avoidance
activities.

But I think the standard flat tax proposal actually is rather progressive
in the sense that higher income people pay a higher percentage of their
income in tax, despite the name 'flat tax'.  That is because the flat
tax, as proposed, is not really flat across all incomes.  There would be
large personal exemptions and dependent deductions which means that a
household would have to be solidly middle to upper middle class to pay
any significant income tax.  For example, a family of four would have to
earn something like $30,000 to even begin paying income tax.  And it's
important to keep in mind when looking at the whole tax system that most
US wage earners pay about as much, or more, in SS and Medicare tax than
they do in federal income tax, if one counts the 'hidden' employer paid
portion of the SS tax.

Those with high incomes now pay a very high share of the total income tax
take.  My impression of the current tax system is that the highest income
quintile pays considerably more in tax (all taxes) than the benefit that
quintile receives, and that the lowest quintile receives much more in
benefits than they pay.  But I don't have statistical data to back that
up.


In the latest Berkshire Hathaway report, it was claimed that BH and its
sub components paid 1/635th of the total federal revenue in 1998 (or
maybe it was income tax only).  So 635 BHs could fund the federal
government.  


A high income person tends to invest a large portion of that income.  To
tax the income away reduces total investment.  In the long run a high
tax, highly-regulated society would end up much poorer than a low tax
society.  Compare Cuba with Switzerland (or Liechtenstein, which is
thought to have a $50,000 per capita GDP).  That is only an estimate,
because Lichtenstein, which has no income or sales or VAT tax, does not
expend government funds collecting and processing such statistics.

He seems to be of the opinion that the market could have found better
uses for the money and materials used in suspension and maintenance for
growing the economy, by allowing the 'dead' persons heirs to collect
that insurance money, and spend or invest it as they please (also
allowing the government to take its cut as well).

He fails to realize that the market is acting here. The individual
places higher value on resuscitating his or her own life than in either
letting the government get half of his or her assets and to one's heirs.
Considering that something like 90% of all wealth does not remain in
families beyond the third generation, it should actually help the
economy by allowing those who are most capable of growing it to maintain
ownership while they are in suspension. The basis of free enterprise is
the idea that the individual knows best what to do with that
individual's assets.

Governments have a far worse track record (as seen in lower ROI on
government backed investment instruments versus the stock market) than
individuals in this regard. We would be contradicting the extropian
emphasis on the free market if we did not respect the individual's right
to use his or her own money for cryonic suspension as they see fit.

Not necessarily. Look at the heritability of wealth through generations.
It (wealth building capability) seems more to be a matter of nurture
rather than nature. The biggest wealth generators had some sort of
hardship which motivated them to become what they became. Bill Gates,
even though the son of one of the most successful lawyers in Seattle,
and who grew up in Laurelhurst, one of the nicest neighborhoods in town,
was a geeks geek. Tape on the glasses, prodigy programmer, etc., I know
for a fact how much he was picked on by his peers (I know a number of
people he grew up with).

I doubt that a clone of Bill Gates would be as motivated as he, partly
because of raised expectations.

It is far easier to build on what you know works than to start from
scratch. Evolution has gotten as far as it has because of this. A human
being posesses legacy DNA from every organism in its line of descent
since year 1.

Yes, I really don't care much about the future as much as I would if I
knew I would be a part of it. Existing as a historical footnote is not
my idea of immortality.

It also puts the proper emphasis on the individual's development and
evolution. Development of the species occurs as a result, not as a
predicate of this. Thus cryonics properly respects the extropic focus on
individuality.

Eliezer,

You seem to be taking great umbrage to the fact that I feel you are
misunderstanding what I said in my earlier posts.  Rest assured that that
happens to everyone at some time or another.

You should have noticed that I made no "claim" as to how your mind works,
only a hypothesis of projection (and not even a hypothesis as to what was
being projected) based on my perceptions of your mangling of my posts.
Note the "seems to be" and "I do not know Eliezer" formulations -- I chose
those words very carefully to express tentativeness, though you
acknowledged them only for rhetorical purposes.  I could easily have said
something Freudian like "Eliezer is projecting his deep-seated belief of
_x_ into my posts," but I did not (I still don't even have an idea of what
I would put in place of _x_, were I to make such a statement).  You may
have published so many bytes on how minds work that you can make
assumptions about the cognitive etiology of my posts, but this is something
I did not do, and disavowed the ability to do, despite your assertion to
the contrary.

All I was trying to get across is that you were setting up strawmen that
you attributed to me in order to make your points.  I agree with most of
your points, particularly the ones that are still being discussed in this
topic (and on which, from my perspective, you are still setting up
strawmen), but for some reason you can't see that.

Maybe that reason is my fault, maybe it's yours.  However, I see no value
in publicly continuing a discussion about whether you understood my posts,
as it is unrelated to the purposes of the list.  You may post whatever you
like in response, and you may rest assured you can have the last word, no
matter how distorted I may feel your comments to be (that should satisfy
your unreferenced "Rules," if I may hazard an assumption as to how they
might work).  I hardly see any value in continuing such a discussion
privately, but I could be wrong and you are welcome to email me if you feel
there might be some value.

Tim

It's a truism that email squeezes out nuance. It may be a false truism;
Americans today may just be so non-culturally-homogeneous, confused, poorly
schooled or unpracticed that our rudimentary skills are no match for the
medium. How many people can breathe genuine life into a cold reading of
Shakespeare? With that acknowleged...

As an external observer of the human condition, permit me to observe that

Why,

...closely resembles use of several rhetorical tricks. Among them: appeal
to the unseen crowd, assumption of the mantle of objectivity,
metacommenting, and metacomment inflation. I see this happen a lot, and am
guilty of same. It looks like playing to the crowd, and it may well be,
regardless of what's said, claimed or thought by the exponent.

I'm not defending or attacking anyone, I'm just remarking on "posturing"
tendencies that can lead to problems in public forums (s/b "fora", but
people tend to misread that as "flora" :) ). 

For an interesting discussion of the tendency for public discourse to stray
in these ways, see the "kindle Cole" entries in Robert K. Merton's _On The
Shoulders of Giants_. He goes into some scholarly detail re the
Hooke-Newton debates and their own private vs. published communications. It
seems this sort of thing predates email lists by several hundred years.

Is really total control the goal? While I certainly want to control my
aging or mental states, I don't really need or want control over the
details of my intestines most of the time. I think it is better to
think in terms of influence: how can you get the desired results?

Wouldn't extropianism in this context also be linked to the view that

Interesting musings.

Hi everyone. This is my first post, and I just have a quick question. What
does the ">H" mean in the above snippet? Is it Humanism? Transhumanism? I just
don't know.

Thanks everyone. Hope to post some more illuminating material in the future.

Bill

I think you guys are mostly right, but not quite for the reason you think.

When talking among themselves, economists have long had powerful empirical 
success, used appropriate probabilistic language, and punished those who 
claim more than then can make a case for.  When they speak to policy makers
and the public, however, their declarations seem to carry little information.
A combination of mercenary behavior and ideology lets advocates find
respected economists who will say whatever they want said.  

Why haven't other fields succumbed to this problem?  I suspect it is because
they have better tied advice to responsibility.  An astronomer who claims to
be able to build a better telescope is judged by his peers at this ability
and then given the task himself.  If he can't deliver, the worse for him.
A surgeon who says he has a better procedure starts doing it himself.
An economist telling a judge how to decide a case or a legislator how to 
design a health insurance system has much worse responsibility.  Economists
hired by firms to design their insurance systems do better, as do finance 
economists working at firms where they have a personal investment stake.  

Idea futures should, as an institution, give economists a better stake in 
being right about their policy claims.  So I predict that with idea futures
economists will come to be respected as knowing a lot.  The problem is,
we aren't likely to get idea futures until folks respect economists like me
who say its a good idea to try.

Indeed.  I especially delight in the local fruit vendors who universally
sign-post their wares as "FRESH" and even RIPE "ORANGES".  Naturally, I
refuse to purchase these ersatz items, although I applaud their honesty.

And today's question is:

Where do you want to live?

Permutation City?
The Culture?
The High Beyond?
(I'm guessing these will be the top three.)
Or some creation of your own?

I'm asking, not "Where do you think we'll end up?", nor even "Where are
you working to steer us?", nor yet "Which of these is morally
desirable?"  I'm asking "Where do you, personally, want to live?"  Nor
is this taking desire-transformation into account.  I'm asking where,
from the perspective of your *current* desires, you would want to live. 
It's an entirely emotional question; where would you feel comfortable? 
Being human, I have some desires apart from logic, even if I don't
believe in them, and I know where I - or rather, they (the desires) -
would want to live.

So, where?

Anders,

Thanks for your thoughts.  Now, let's see....

"Is really total control the goal?" - This probably would be better stated as,
"The ability to control totally.  This doesn't mean you have to constantly be
guiding every autonomic function of the body, but the ability to consciously
control them as needed would be very beneficial.  If you still have intestines
in future (or their posthuman equivelent) you may want to be able to focus
your attention on them if there is something unusual going on (hmmm, this new
food I ate seems to be triggering some sort of adverse reaction....think I
will keep it in until I reach a convenient restroom, then depending on it's
state of digestion and level of irritation, decide if it needs to be purged
from the system and if so, by which route).  This is a strange example, but I
can think of some better ones; for example, the ability to control your
circulation and basal metabolic rate so as to be able to enter a "hibernation"
state at will.  And of course, our ultimate goal is to be able to acheive the
complete ability to self-enhance at will, for example, you come across a
better design for a "digestive" system and you can reconfigure yours
accordingly.  Isn't this sort of total morphological control one of the
possible applications of advanced nanotechnology?  So, in summation, I would
say yes, I believe Transhumanism does seeks to be able to totally control
ourselves, though it is doubtful that we will consciously do so at all times.
Even in the example of our current intestines, while I don't have conscious
control, my body/brain does its best to maintain control on a subconscious
level.

"Or should we come up with another term for that idea to distinguish it, like
'translibertarianism' or something similar?" - Interesting point....I think
that in general the idea of not trying to control each other or each other's
proximal environment comes under my comment about extreme decentralization,
but perhaps it needs to be more explicitly stated?  I think of extreme
decentralization as being the rule of the self and one's immediate
environment.  If another forces their will on you, or vice-verse, then you
have begun the process of centralization.  Of course, if people were ruled in
very small groups, such as family units, you could still call that extremely
decentralized by today's standards, though not by Extropian standards.  So I
guess for me, extreme decentralization = self determinism in general, though
allows for cooperative, voluntary ventures.

I wrote at the end of my idea of Extropianism, "Maximization of free and
copious flows of information and resources."  I think I need a better wording
for this concept, maybe "Maximization of the production and free flow of
resources, such as information, energy, material, etc."  Any ideas?

Glen

Council for Responsible Genetics

Dear CRG

Tekno benefit for non-patenting of DNA in Melbourne, held 9 March 1999
AD.

Turnout was low but the event generated some publicity, absolutely
superb performance theatre on the subject, and represents the start of a
long-term process in Melbourne. Posters distributed, including CRG
petition letter, approx. 1,500, in addition to many hundred over the
last two years. Some funds generated for a newspaper advertisement but
there will be delay due to lack of larger numbers attending.

PETITIONS BEGUN:

To the Prime Minister of Australia
I the undersigned support the suspension of diplomatic relations with
the United States of America and all other countries who patent the DNA
of plants, animals and humans, and in particular patent longevity
therapies such as telomere therapy.
Signature  Name  Address    Date

To the Prime Minister of Australia
I the undersigned support legislation to prohibit the deliberate killing
of animals, including birds, fish, and domesticated animals.
Signature  Name  Address    Date

The next benefit will be for Guaranteed Minimum Income (redistribution
of nanotechnological wealth through token amounts of money to all
citizens, escalating in nanoyear (estimated 2020) - see Eric Drexler,
Engines of Creation - nanoyear is the year of self-reproducing
nanofactories).
*

WHY are we taking the two major thrusts of non-patenting of DNA and GMI,
and also including the vegetarian issue? Bearing in mind that the CRG
letter is being reprinted in full, with no extra commentary?

In fact, we believe even wider and weirder events are forthcoming,
however we are separating our understanding of these developements from
our assessments of the next 28 years.

POLITICAL ASSESSMENT

Unfortunately since the 1960s America has demonstrated an obsession with
money and corporate power and has not promoted democracy outside its own
borders nor cared for the bottom fifth of its own population.
Reinstituting legal ritual State killing of convicted criminals is seen
by the rest of the western world as the action of barbarians. It has
therefore demonstrated its moral and ethical decline. It has not come to
terms with its own colonial history and racism and has not assisted the
starving, despite storing massive amounts of grain for the event of a
nuclear war. America has resorted to threatening Europe with trade war
to push DNA patenting and it is no coincidence that Britain, which
agreed to human patenting in the 1970s, is the focus of many human
genome project scientists and "bioethicists". America is therefore
unreliable and groups such as the CRG are likely to collapse in the face
of apathy and the apparent monetary and legislative clout of the
business cartels, many of which are elitist families and individuals
masquerading as companies for the purposes of avoiding taxation, for
example in countries such as Australia.

INTERACTION WITH NANOTECHNOLOGY

The existence of intra-cellular genetic nanotechnology extrapolated by
Eric Drexler is a guarantee of long-term immortality for those who wish
to receive it. It heralds the end of evolution in terms of random
mutation and natural selection and its replacement by self-directed
evolution. It also heralds the end of the concept of species as
presently understood. THIS IS WHY THE CONCEPT OF PROHIBITING THE KILLING
OF ANIMALS NOW IS A VALUABLE ONE.

POLITICAL DANGERS DURING THE NEXT 28 YEARS

The perceived future emergence of an undemocratic American elite
controlling the productive capabilities of a leisure-rich world with
nanotechnology and life-extension, an elite which assesses other species
as having no rights and future artificial intelligences as having no
rights.

POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE TECHNOSPHERE

See: Damien Broderick, The Spike, The Last Mortal Generation
Eric Drexler, Engines of Creation
Frank Tipler, The Physics of Immortality
Transhumanist Internet sites, including quantum teleportation and
spacetime manipulation possibilities (sites include book listings)

PERSONAL ASSESSMENT OF POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENTS

We are about to escalate in levels of ability to a point already reached
by one third of the worlds containing life currently present within this
universe, approximately one and a half billion years after this level
was first achieved elsewhere in this universe (figures based on commonly
available assessments). Assistance in rectifying any teething problems
can therefore be expected from both burgeoning AI and human
superintelligences as they develop (see Gaian theory) and also from
other more advanced civilizations and groupings within this universe
(once quarantine is broken by developing superintelligences).

IN THE MEANTIME

The following political positions will be of assistance in calming the
general population (and some can be pushed by relatively cheap newspaper
advertisements and street pamphlets):

-Not being distracted by issues of genetic food improvement and related
labelling (which are worthy but are pushed by corporate-controlled mass
media to sideline the issue of DNA patenting). (For example, Friends of
the Earth have been distracted by this, combined with their tendency
towards total opposition to DNA and their lack of understanding of DNA
splicing possibilities with adults - even though it is mentioned on
South Park, for example.)

-Emphasising freedom of choice and the personal commitment of the CRG to
non-patenting of DNA and provision of longevity therapies (i.e. control
of body form) for free or the cheapest possible price while debates
occur (it is important to bear in mind that it may within decades be
possible to manipulate physical space - in the meantime there is enough
space on Earth and in the solar system to cater for all existing life on
the planet). Also, there are many extra possibilities relating to more
complicated bodily form, for example reversible meshing of two
consciousnesses and reverting to childhood. THE CRG WOULD BE WELL
ADVISED TO BEGIN HARDCORE DEBATE ON THE ETHICS OF GERON CORPORATION
PATENTING TELOMERE THERAPY AND BLATANTLY PLANNING ITS SALE (I.E. EXTRA
LIFESPAN) ON WALL STREET. ITS INVESTMENT IS REASONABLY SMALL. It should
be borne in mind that under conditions of full nanotechnology in twenty
years time and perhaps before such therapies could be designed and
manufactured by individuals, including ultimately within their own
bodies. SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ON THE PRICING ANTICIPATED BY GERON
CORPORATION SHOULD BE SOUGHT.

-Emphasising those who wish to age or to ignore DNA splicing and
therapies or intra-cellular genetic nanotechnology (i.e. 10-100
molecular supercomputers within each cell incorporating memory maps of
the genetic structure and capable or repairing or modifying or reverting
DNA) can continue to do so. IT IS LEGITIMATE TO BE CONSERVATIVE.

-Emphasising the sanctity of life as a general principle.

-Emphasising the necessity for increased democracy and unified area
votes for serious decisions (e.g. citizen voting for our UN
representatives, eventually by population - roughly one third
European-descent, one third Asian, one third Indian, plus Africa - and
citizen voting the UN Security Council, currently a nuclear weapons
club). (I.e. local area rules by flexible unified plebiscites, one vote
one being, with optout.)

-Emphasing freedom of expression, including new avenues for
communication.

-Investigating the numbers of the extremely wealthy ($250 million and
up), the percentages of total current wealth controlled by them and
their exact investment in genetic therapies and allied nanotechnologies.

-Emphasising corporate electoral structures (voting reform) legislation.
(Very pertinent under fullblown nanotech when capital becomes
irrelevant.)

-Emphasising priority funding to intensive human healthcare and
increased funding for animal hospitals.

-Emphasising public internet libraries and downloading facillitation
(including via computer paper and Internet books), freeware, giftware
and cheapware, mind privacy legislation, freedom of sexual expression
and rights to drugs legislation (including rights to genetic therapies).

Please excuse the apparently rambling nature of this letter but we are
entering the era of 'Future Shock' including new issues of interactive
technologies and bypass of systems development. As individuals we can
find new ways to address complex issues forthrightly. For example, when
faced with the common position that it is 'not possible' to prevent DNA
patenting in Australia, I immediately retort that slavery was banned in
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. If they can achieve that in an
inequitable and sometimes ferocious world, we can achieve equally
praiseworthy moral advances, no matter what temporary setbacks we
suffer. We can adjust our perceptions to the new emerging patterns of
consciousness and ability. Love and altruism can be the coinage of the
future that we can generate.

Elizier, could you briefly describe these different environments for the

I would like to thank all those who responded to the recent discussion
regarding the reasonableness of endorsing the idea of cryonics.  Clearly the
majority of the respondents are pro-cryonics and believe it to be entirely
congruent with Extropian principles.

It sounded to me as if several of those who responded are already signed up.
That's great.  Though I've been an advocate for a bit over a year now, I am
just now in the process of actually signing up.  For me, the procrastination
was more of a financial issue than anthing else.  But I've been wondering
how many among us are currently signed up.  If I recall correctly, one of
the webpages at ExI was dedicated to what one could do that would be
extropic (top ten things to do?) and one of those things was to arrange for
one's cryonic suspension.

Cryonics has proven to be a difficult service to market for a number of
reasons, many of which have been discussed on this list.  The industry needs
our support.  How many of us support the efforts of cryonicists?  How many
of us are signed up?  If we're not buying the product, who will?  I urge all
of you to do everything you can to insure that you participate in what will
be an undoubtably amazing future.  Take action to save your life and find
out which of the many predictions offered on this list come true.

Go to the cryonic websites.  Re-read their arguments.  Call their
representatives.  Get your questions answered.  If you really can't offer a
good counter-argument, then do yourself a favor; quit stalling and sign up!

Thank you again,

Scott B.

Without hesitation:  The culture of the Aristoi.  With the Banksian
Culture coming in second.  
	I suspect that especially extropian transhumanists would find the
institutions of the Logarchy implausibly statist, but seems to me that the
Aristoi actually had a civilization worth fighting for.  (Banks seems to
think that Cultural institutions are spontaneous and practically
inevitable products of diaspora -- so this probably seems more congenial 
to most transhumanists here and now.)  Both utopias are nicely hedonic
lefty domestications of the singularity, tho' -- and I'm all for that!

Perhaps so, we shall see.

As this relates to the question of Who Should Live?, or Who Would You Like
To See Embrace Cryonics?, it appears mostly people who have access to
cryonic technology, since cryonics doesn't receive any public resources or
funding to offer the service to Third World people. In future, conceivably,
cryonicists might recruit human volunteers, but with several species on the
endangered list, cryonicists might first try a giant Panda, an endangered
tiger species, or a mountain gorilla? If so, then I'd include a gorilla or
two in my "list of five" to embrace cryonics.

I don't think so, because I really, really like the idea of cloning, and
hope to see a human clone within the next few years. Until a few people
actually get cloned, we can only speculate and conjecture about what
attributes they may or may not have in common with their originals.

The ultimate entropy: Perfect preservation of perfect equilibrium, IOW,
death.
In diametric opposition to entropy, life means constant change and renewal,
not preservation.

Future technologists may well consider the motives of cryonicists when they
determine Who Should Live. Perhaps they will decide to revive a few humans
first to test the new technology before moving to more important species.
Great disappointments depend on great expectations. I suspect the next ten
or fifteen years will determine whether humans evolve to Type I civilization
(by Michio Kaku's system) or not. Probably not, because although science may
indeed provide the tools to reach Type I status, humans apparently lack
adequate motivation to use them, as any poll of the general public reveals.

To each his own. I'll put my money (okay, five bucks, hehe) on cloning
blended with genetically modified (intelligence, immune system, sensory
perception augmented) humans and combinatorial chemistry. But not for myself
understand, because first I want everyone else to have a chance to become as
talented and gifted as me. <supercilious smirk>

Sorry to upset you, Scott, I'll refer to them as "the cryonically preserved"
whenever I think of it. For instance: When the going gets tough, the tough
don't ask if the cryonically preserved should live.
This follows from the fact that no one knows if the cryonically preserved
_can_ live.

Right, and I had answered that, "I can think of half a dozen people with a
talent or a gift that the world
can ill afford to lose, but they don't embrace the idea of cryonics...
...IOW, the very people who have talents or gifts that the world can ill
afford to lose, do not endorse the idea of cryonics.
If those people don't endorse cryonics, why should extropians?"

So, now I ask you: Why don't people with a talent or a gift that the world
can ill afford to lose (candidates so far include Stephen Hawking, Spider
Robinson, Doug Engelbart, Robert M. Pirsig, Neal Stephenson, Douglass
Hofstadter, Martin Gardner, Arthur C. Clarke, Steven Jay Gould, and James
Randi) embrace the idea of cryonics? Has anyone asked _them_?

Do any of those working on speeding up the process of building a better

IOW, you must die as a child to become an adult, because the adult replaces
the child. This leads to the acknowledgment that the adult can understand
the child, even though the child may not understand the adult.

Well, I guess you could say that it means "to make room for post humans."
Likewise, the catepillar must die to make room for the butterfly. Nothing
new there. Sorry you hadn't heard of it before. Biologists call it
"metamorphosis" I think. At least they used to. Perhaps not anymore.

Good question. In addition, if birth and death do not form two sides of
life, what does? Would you make life one dimentional and linear? It seems
more sensible to me to take life as I find it, instead of trying to make it
fit some cryonic belief system. The cells in my body have all died at least
once during my lifetime, but the organism continues. Likewise, all living
humans may die during the course of the superorganism's lifetime.

Well, if nobody has any money to spend on it, and it can't happen without
money, then the whole issue remains science fiction. Nothing ignores
political reality quite like science fiction. I loved science fiction as a
child, but science fact carries weight.

>So do I.  So do most other cryonicists.  I also hope to be one of those

A great enhancement of consciousness comes from understanding the appeal of
hope, how it arrests development, and interferes with direct experience of
reality. A belief in the power of hope seems to me a superstitious
anti-scientific obstinacy. As Ben Franklin said, "He that lives upon hope
will die fasting." ...and, "Hope is a good breakfast, but a bad supper." To
which Ralph G. Ingersoll would add, "Hope is the universal liar." Even
Diogenes Laertius says, "Hope is a waking dream."

>Note the assumption that suspension patients are dead.  This is

I see no legal contradiction in calling "suspension patients" dead. Do
"suspension patients" vote? Do they pay taxes?

>If cryonics can never work, these people are dead.  They will never be
>brought back, so the issue will not arise.

The issue will not arise if no one can bring them back? Why not? It seems to
me that describes the issue you just referred to: "the assumption that
suspension patients are dead" no longer remains an assumption does it?

>If they can be brought back, then they aren't dead in any meaningful sense.

"meaningful sense" according to whom? They might feel it has some meaning.
"Suspended patients" have a few more problems than the comatose or merely
unconscious, but so what? The moral content of the statement remains: Better
to build something new than to drag something out of the hospital.

Since the whole thing remains hypothetical and "pretty unlikely," it sounds
expensive at any price. If someone knows about cryonics (as you've just
outlined it), and signs up, they've blown their money. The more one thinks
about it, the more it begins to look like a pyramid scheme.

>Besides, I believe the spirit of Scott's question could be captured as "If

I think he mentioned just five people. So, who did you vote for?

If the whole thing amounts to a hypothetical, excuse me for bothering you
about it. I think extropy (as opposed to cryonics) deals with more than
hypotheticals, so let's get back to real issues.

Hundreds of millions of suspension patients does begin to sound like it

No biggie, I just meant that overpopulation presently (not in the future or

That answers the question, "Who Should Live" ...the Singularity should live!

Right, because the Singularity will decide, not us.

There you go, when the procedure becomes available, so may better things
than cryonics become available. So, cryonics doesn't matter as much as
addressing the issues of who should live, which has the potential to ignite
a global conflagration as desperate humans compete for longer lives.

Except that getting yourself frozen does end depression... until advanced
medical techniques can more decisively remove it, or until such time as the
cause for depression disappears. If you don't want to live in this world,
cryonics offers the only materialistic alternative, at least for now.

>But, come on, "ten or fifteen years"?  Surely you can do better than that.

You don't think ten or fifteen years may suffice to see how it all turns
out? For all we know, it could all turn out tomorrow. I don't intend to just
sit around and wait. I intend to just sit around. Ten or fifteen years
should do quite nicely. The last ten or fifteen years haven't let me down
either.

Me too. Nevertheless...
"It is natural for man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to

The odds of getting (me) suspended seem astronomical to me, since I can't
even afford medical insurance. (Uh-oh, there goes another cat out of the

For a nominal fee, you can adopt me as your suspension patient. <g>

Thanks for the interaction, and remember: If you want to get done before you
leave, don't volunteer for anything.

No identifiable "logical consequence" has occured. Accordingly, genuine
sarcasm fails to emerge.

No, because it got changed into other forms of information, some of which
confirms that the Library may have existed. The species that created the
Library contains more powerful information than the Library contains, and
that species can create other libraries.

It may seem like "**SARCASM**" to you, but to me it looks like a pathetic
tantrum.

Right, and the cryonically preserved may constitute starting from scratch,
since experimental models will precede reviving those in suspension. IOW,
after several cycles of enhancing, augmenting, and amplifying mobile humans,
going back to the cryonically preserved would indeed seem like starting from
scratch.

You have to die sometime, whether in a hundred years or a hundred billion
years. But don't worry, historical footnotes will also disappear eventually.
Don't blame me, I didn't make the rules. It doesn't have anything to do with
"deathism" because everbody dies no matter what they believe. Trying to
change that parallels trying to change the laws of thermodynamics.

Only natural law never dies. By natural law I mean the fundamental
principles of existence, laws of physics and chemistry. So to the degree
humans incorporate natural law in their lives, they attain immortality.

I endores cryonics. Without some kind of crystal ball who is to say if 
the possibilities inferred to with this technique will come to pass or 
not. If I had the chance to chose life or death (with it's the most 
healthiest of attributes) I chose life. Unable to see the future, and 
yet humble enough not to trust in it, still gives way to the possibility 
that cryonics has to offer. If there is a percentage that I could 
return, without out betting on it, I take the chance. I lose nothing, I 
have only to gain.

	ha. ill outlive you if u die at all, man. and yes, i intend to prove it,
though i doubt youll be around to witness...
	and your "everybody dies" is far from a certainty; the only way it can be a
certainty is if everybody really dies, in which case u wont be around to say
"i was right." 
	in case nobody every told you, fallible humans made the "laws" of
thermodynamics (and many other "laws") in an attempt to give process to what
they percieve.  in that sense, u (by ascribing some ethreal kind of absolute
certainty to em) did make the laws... 
	u seem assume that there is no backdoor.  well, we found a way to cheat
gravity, and u would call that a law, right? people are always thinking about
new ways to lie, cheat, steal, and otherwise get around these things we call
(because we dont know how to get around em yet) laws.  if there is a way to
successfully pull this particular little coup off, i intend to take full
advantage of it.
	in the words of terry pratchet in _small gods_:  "i think what we presently
call laws are best rather called... guidelines."

In your frenzy to outlive the inconceivably distant Big Crunch or Heat Death of the present Universe, please remember to not mimic the Christians by mortgaging your present sure thing for the sake of a future maybe - in other words, don't forget to live bigtime now, and to optimise the possibilities and potentials inherent in present experience.  Make immortality an "in addition to", not an "instead of", and in your rush to seize all days, don't forget to throttle this one, and the next, and the next, until the last best juices of each one have permeated your palate of experience and are firmly esconced in delicious memory.

Hmm, tricky question. I assume "everywhere" isn't a good answer, but I
relly would like to distribute myself into a wide variety of cultures,
civilizations and states :-)

Permutation City (or the polises of _Diaspora_) might be a bit too
isolationist for my taste, even if I find virtual universe
construction very enjoyable. 

The Culture is *fun*, but might become a slight bit bland - maybe I
should join Contact or that trade/assimilator offshoot mentioned in
_Excession_.

The High Beyond seems to be an interesting place - dangerous, but
filled with potential. But I might be a bit too careful and risk
aversive to get close to the Transcend.

Just like Dale I might enjoy the Logarchy. Having daemons enabling me
to work on all sorts of projects at once, uniting art with technology
in a very free way sounds like heaven. The problem might be that the
political system has its drawbacks.

Stapledon's minded planets, galaxies and universes: no thanks, his
descriptions sound somewhat boring, they just sit there being
enlightened.

David Zindell's universe: Hmm, maybe Agathange would suit me, a life
as a nanotechnologist porpoise could be fun. The Order seems a bit too
conservative, but I'm an academic at heart and sometimes enjoy
intrigue; however, they are limited from a transhuman point of
view. And of course, a life as a Hakra jupiter-brain wannabee might be
exciting (and short :-).


To sum up, I think I would like to live in the Logarchy, working to
make it more dynamic. But I sure would want to visit the other
cultures the rest of the list may end up in.

Not only that, but IMHO being signed up is a "must" for any
serious transhumanist/extropian. It shows that one doesn't just
pay lip service to the philosophy, but "puts one's money where
one's mouth is". A sign of commitment. Not just to transhumanism,
but to reason and life itself. The only valid excuse I can think of
[for not signing up] is being too poor to afford it (note that some
of the cheapest suspensions come at approx. $15K).

Yes, so do I (and probably lots of others). How about a poll?

Perhaps you mean "Five Things You Can Do To Fight Entropy Now"
by Romana Machado (there's an "enhanced" copy at
http://members.wbs.net/homepages/c/r/y/cryonic4life/5things.htm)
An excellent essay indeed.

Definitely the Culture.

Behind this choice would come lifestyles based in part or
completely on the following.

I'll do it instead:

Permutation City (from Greg Egan's book of the same name): a
self-contained virtual universe completely independent of the physical
universe. It consists of an expanding cube of replicating turing
machines, each with its own expanding cube of memory (it is really a
6+1 dimensional cellular automaton). It is inhabited by uploads living
in their various virtual worlds, as well as another cellular-automaton
universe containing a simulated solar system inhabited by its own
creatures.

The Polises (Greg Egan's _Diaspora_): After the Introdus, most of
humanity lives as information in polises, nanotech supercomputers
hidden here and there. The Earth is inhabited by the remaining
"fleshers", many of which have re-engineered themselves to new forms,
and space by the Gleisner robots, uploads in robot bodies. The polises
tend to have different ideologies and aesthetics, ranging from
introverted art to interests in politics (Carter-Zimmerman for example
tries to make the other polises keep in touch with base
reality). Citizens have access to all the possibilities of an upload
existence, such as backups, copying, mental modification, enhanced
introspection and everything else.

The Culture (from Iain M Bank's books): A big interstellar
civilization of humans and AI. Since all material demands can be
supplied by non-intelligent machines and most intellectual problems
can be solved by the super-AIs (the Minds), people (and machines)
mostly have fun: everything from playing with their drug-glands to
building ringworlds to helping out less fortunate civilizations. It is
a kind of anarchist alliance.
http://www.st-and.ac.uk/~www_sa/socs/sff-soc/Culture.txt

The High Beyond (from Vernor Vinge's _A Fire Upon the Deep_): the
galaxy is divided into zones where different levels of complexity can
develop. The Earth is in the Slow Zone where AI, FTL and nanotech is
unfortunately impossible (see his latest book about that). Outside the
Slow Zone lies the Beyond, where these things are possible, and
outside that lies the Transcend, where *real* superintelligence is
feasible. The High Beyond lies near the border, and is inhabited by
millions of civilizations trading with each other, the Transcend and
the Low Beyond. Many are more or less augmented, and there is a
gradual drift as they move into the Transcend and new civilizations
bubble up from below.

Other transhuman cultures from sf:

The Logarchy (from Walter John William's _Aristoi_): After the Earth
was destroyed by grey goo, the survivors managed to create a new
civilization based on a kind of meritocracy, which eventually evolved
into the Logarchy. It is run by a few hundred Aristoi, people who are
simply best at everything: they are both geniuses, artists,
administrators and with impeccable morals (everybody can take exams to
become an Aristoi). Each Aristoi is responsible for a domain of
planets (many of which are terraformed new worlds), which he or she
runs with the help of a hierarchy of administrators (also selected by
examinations). The domains tend to become rather individual, and
people can move freely between them. Mental techniques,
AI-subpersonalities, an open interstellar internet (the Hyperlogos)
and very long life extension are widely used, however only the Aristoi
may freely experiment with nanotech due to the risks.

David Zindell describes several cultures in his books (Neverness, The
Broken God, The Wild, War in Heaven). Most of the stories center
around the Civilized Worlds which have decided against radical
transformations of humanity; they are influenced by the Order of
Metaphysical Mathematicians and Other Seekers of the Ineffable Flame,
an academic organization. However, there are some groups who have
developed in other directions: The Agathinians are humans who have
re-designed themselves to live as dolphin- and seal-humans in the warm
oceans of the planet Agathange, designing biological nanotechnology
and working on building a planetary consciousness. The inhabitants of
Alumit Bridge live in huge plastic cities where they try to form
super-enlightened group-minds. There are several people who have
uploaded themselves and become jupiter-brain gods, most notably
Nicolas Daru Ede (worshipped by the Architects of the Cybernetic
Church) and the Silicon Goddess. 

The Protektorate (from Charles Platt's _Protektor_): An interstellar
computer-run civilization, where semisentinent computers try to
maximize human happiness according to a well defined code (think
Asimov's laws, but more developed and flexible). Humans are
biologically immortal, have access to over a 100,000 planets, their
needs are supplied by automation and each has a monthly allotment of
resources (you can of course earn more by trade); most humans simply
play around. Unlike in the Culture, where the benevolent AI is
superintelligent, the Protektorate discourages scientific research
(especially computer science) - everybody has their needs fulfilled,
it would only be dangerous to introduce new stuff. Of course, you are
free to leave and set up your own planet somewhere else, but the
temptation of the help from the Protektorate tends to make escape
attempts fail.

Ah, no, this isn't true.  There are several quantities that seem to be
universally conserved in physics (mass/energy, for example, or momentum),
but information isn't one of them.  Some physical interactions conserve
information, but others do not.  Under Earthlike conditions, information is
created and destroyed all the time.

If you don't believe me, check your local resources on physics and
information theory.

The High Beyond, without a doubt.

Why?  Because there is actually something to DO in this universe.  I'm not
especially interested in spending eternity indulging in hedonic engineering
and navel contemplation.  I want to be able to do something productive with
my time, and Vinge's universe provides plenty of opportunity for that.

The Zones are permeable enough that a determined High Beyond civilization
could easily rescue entire civilizations from the Slow Zone.  The races in
the Low Beyond, who also don't have immortality, are even easier to reach.
The outer Zones are also desperately in need of an effective peacekeeping
force and reliable information sources, and anyone contemplating the move to
the Transcend could use an educated helping hand.

And once we've done what we can to make the galaxy a better place, the
Transcend is right next door...

The people at the top of my personal list are already signed up, or are
aware of the issue and thinking about it.  If we specifically exclude them,
that leaves me with several dozen people and no clear way to rank them.  So,
I don't really have an answer to the question.

I was referring to the longstanding resistance to any sort of longevity
research.  This barrier has begun to erode recently, but it has cost us a
lot of time.  The more time we lose, the more people will die before we have
an effective life extension treatment.

Why?  Contrary to the beliefs of the Club of Rome, we have yet to face any
significant shortage of resources.  Suspending people who can pay for it
simply creates another industry - and it isn't going to be any bigger than
cosmetics, or tobacco.

A "global conflagration"? How? As Anders would say, this is a Hollywood
meme.

Rationally, we would expect a treatment for old age to follow the same
course as any other medical advance.  It starts out being so expensive that
only the wealthy can afford it, and gradually becomes cheaper as its use
expands.  Anyone who can afford it can buy the treatment, and the cost falls
steadily with time.

That being the case, what is going to start a "conflagration"?  Poor people
in America don't storm hospitals today seeking cancer treatments, or
cosmetic surgery, or other expensive medical treatments.  They lobby their
politicians for entitlements, or work to improve their status so they can
buy better insurance.  Why should we expect things to be any different for
ageing treatments?

Now, I know some people are afraid that there will be some sort of uprising
in the Third World, but that idea ignores the military realities.  A nation
that is too poor to afford modern medical care is also too poor to afford a
modern military, which makes them completely impotent on the world stage.
Besides, most of the people in these countries are still wedded to beliefs
that oppose life extension - it will take a lot of exposure to the idea to
even get them interested.

Here's a way to do both: When a person reaches retirement age, they can be
offered double their benefits if they undergo suspension immediately. Thus you
remove an existing drain on the economy, deferring the liability and allowing
the invested assets to grow the economy to a point where all can live in
techno-paradise.

All should live. As the assets of those under suspension accrue interest and
grow the economy and technology, the money will become available to develop mass
launching systems, terraforming of Mars, reviving everyone, and cheap nanotech
based health care and food production. The more people who are retired in
suspension, the less money is wasted by unproductive individuals lifestyles.

Really, I thought we had some recent discussion on this list that
future medical technology was factored in and people with different
ages had different life expectancies.  So much for my memory :-)

So, what I call "the real generation X" is just above retirement age
as per your forecast.  That would mean most cryonics subscribers are
mitigating a much smaller perceived risk than I had assumed.

Following your forecast, I am 25 years ahead of "the real generation
X".  That means it is unlikely that I'll reach an age where it is
difficult to procure life insurance to fund a needed cryonics
suspension.

If I were to face near term anticipated death because of some freak
disease that just happened to be incurable between now and then, I
could use my 401K money to set up suspension arrangements and let my
family have the half a mil insurance that is subsidized by my company.

That pretty much covers most of the risks that can be mitigated if you
also consider accidents that cause brain damage or that occur in
situations where suspensions cannot begin in a reasonable time.  Add
to that murder or suspected foul play incidents that will require
autopsy and were pretty much at a 99% chance that my death will not
require prearranged cryonics.  Why would I want to spend $500 a year
starting now for that measly 1%.  A lot of people on this list put
cryonics at 50% or less probability of success.  I put it at 90%, but
don't subscribe for these other reasons.  I take calculated risks with
my life every day.  In this case, I sacrifice that 1% for my $500
techno gadget every year.

Chances are that I will sign up eventually, but it won't be for that
1%.  It won't be charity either.  It will be to support the research
needed to benefit the situation described above where I could have
reached into my 401K savings.

What follows is the longest text I've ever posted to this list.  I
promise to make it a rare occasion to post BASICS: text of this
length.  

My confused office mate, who recently "gave up country music" at the
advice of his pastor, forwarded this tid bit in an effort to finally
help me see the light.  My other office mate is a "sports
genius"....he he.  My untrained eye was able to pick up about 8
fallacies that I don't think I could properly annotate.  Is there
someone more competent on this list who could properly annotate the
fallacies or at least someone who knows of a net based atheist
resource that might be able to help.  Where is Jeff Dee when you need
him?

Bailey Anita wrote:

 "LET ME EXPLAIN THE problem science has with Jesus Christ."  The
atheist
 professor of philosophy pauses before his class and then asks one of
his new
 students to stand. "You're a Christian, aren't you, son?"
 "Yes, sir."
 "So you believe in God?"
 "Absolutely."
 "Is God good?"
 "Sure!  God's good."
 "Is God all-powerful?  Can God do anything?"
 "Yes." "Are you good or evil?"
 "The Bible says I'm evil."
 The professor grins knowingly. "Ahh! THE BIBLE!"  He considers for a
 moment.
 "Here's one for you.  Let's say there's a sick person over here and you
 can cure him.  You can do it.  Would you help them? Would you try?"
 "Yes sir, I would."
 "So you're good...!"
 "I wouldn't say that."
 "Why not say that?  You would help a sick and maimed person if you
 could...in fact most of us would if we could... God doesn't."

 No answer.
 "He doesn't, does he?  My brother was a Christian who died of cancer
even
 though he prayed to Jesus to heal him. How is this Jesus good?  Hmmm?
Can
 you answer that one?"
 No answer.
 The elderly man is sympathetic. "No, you can't, can you?"
 He takes a sip of water from a glass on his desk to give the student
time
 to relax.  In philosophy, you have to go easy with the new ones.

 "Let's start again, young fella. Is God good?"
 "Er... Yes."
 "Is Satan good?"
 "No."
 "Where does Satan come from?"
 The student falters.
 "From... God..."
 "That's right. God made Satan, didn't he?"

 The elderly man runs his bony fingers through his thinning hair and
turns
 to the smirking, student audience.

 "I think we're going to have a lot of fun this semester, ladies and
 gentlemen."

 He turns back to the Christian.
 "Tell me, son.  Is there evil in this world?"
 "Yes, sir."
 "Evil's everywhere, isn't it?  Did God make everything?"
 "Yes."
 "Who created evil?"
 No answer.
 "Is there sickness in this world? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness? All the
 terrible things - do they exist in this world?"
 The student squirms on his feet. "Yes."
 "Who created them?"
 No answer.
 The professor suddenly shouts at his student. "WHO CREATED THEM? TELL
ME,
 PLEASE!"
 The professor closes in for the kill and climbs into the Christian's
 face. In a still small voice: "God created all evil, didn't He, son?"

 No answer. The student tries to hold the steady, experienced gaze and
 fails.

 Suddenly the lecturer breaks away to pace the front of the classroom
like
 an aging panther. The class is mesmerized.

 "Tell me," he continues, "How is it that this God is good if He created
 all evil throughout all time?"  The professor swishes his arms around
to
 encompass the wickedness of the world.  "All the hatred, the brutality,
 all the pain, all the torture, all the death and ugliness and all the
 suffering created by this good God is all over the world, isn't it,
young
 man?"

 No answer.
 "Don't you see it all over the place? Huh?" Pause. "Don't you?"
 The professor leans into the student's face again and whispers, "Is God
 good?"

 No answer.
 "Do you believe in Jesus Christ, son?"
 The student's voice betrays him and cracks. "Yes, professor.  I do."
 The old man shakes his head sadly. "Science says you have five senses
you
 use to identify and observe the world around you.  Have you ever seen
 your Jesus?"

 "No, sir.  I've never seen Him."
 "Then tell us if you've ever heard your Jesus?"
 "No, sir. I have not."
 "Have you ever felt your Jesus, tasted your Jesus or smelt your
 Jesus...in fact, do you have any sensory perception of your God
 whatsoever?"

 No answer.
 "Answer me, please."
 "No, sir, I'm afraid I haven't."
 "You're AFRAID... you haven't?"
 "No, sir."
 "Yet you still believe in him?"
 "...yes..."
 "That takes FAITH!"  The professor smiles sagely at the underling.

 "According to the rules of empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol,
 science says your God doesn't exist.  What do you say to that, son?
Where
 is your God now?"

 The student doesn't answer.
 "Sit down, please."

 The Christian sits...Defeated. Another Christian raises his hand.
 "Professor, may I address the class?"
 The professor turns and smiles. "Ah, another Christian in the vanguard!
 Come, come, young man. Speak some proper wisdom to the gathering."

 The Christian looks around the room.  "Some interesting points you are
 making, sir.  Now I've got a question for you. Is there such thing as
 heat?"
 "Yes," the professor replies.  "There's heat."
 "Is there such a thing as cold?"
 "Yes, son, there's cold too."
 "No, sir, there isn't."

 The professor's grin freezes. The room suddenly goes very cold.
 The second Christian continues. "You can have lots of heat, even more
 heat, super-heat, mega-heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat but
we
 don't
 have anything called 'cold'.  We can hit 458 degrees below zero,
which is
 no heat, but we can't go any further after that.  "There is no such
thing
 as
 cold, otherwise we would be able to go colder than 458 - You see, sir,
 cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We cannot
 measure
 cold.  Heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy. 
Cold
 is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it."

 Silence. A pin drops somewhere in the classroom.
 "Is there such a thing as darkness, professor?"
 "That's a dumb question, son. What is night if it isn't darkness? What
 are you getting at...?"
 "So you say there is such a thing as darkness?"
 "Yes..."
 "You're wrong again, sir.  Darkness is not something, it is the absence
 of something.  You can have low light, normal light, bright light,
 flashing
 light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and it's
 called darkness, isn't it?  That's the meaning we use to define the
word.
 In
 reality, Darkness isn't. If it were, you would be able to make darkness
 darker and give me a jar of it. Can you...give me a jar of darker
 darkness,
 professor?"

 Despite himself, the professor smiles at the young effrontery before
him.
 This will indeed be a good semester.
 "Would you mind telling us what your point is, young man?"
 "Yes, professor. My point is, your philosophical premise is flawed to
 start with and so your conclusion must be in error...."

 The professor goes toxic.  "Flawed...?  How dare you...!"
 "Sir, may I explain what I mean?"
 The class is all ears.
 "Explain... oh, explain..." The professor makes an admirable effort to
 regain control.  Suddenly he is affability itself.  He waves his hand
to
 silence the class, for the student to continue.

 "You are working on the premise of duality," the Christian explains.
 "That, for example, there is life and then there's death; a good God
and
 a bad
 God. You are viewing the concept of God as something finite,
something we
 can
 measure. Sir, science cannot even explain a thought.  It uses
electricity
 and magnetism but has never seen, much less fully understood them. To
 view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that
 death
 cannot exist as a substantive thing.  Death is not the opposite of
life,
 merely the absence of it."

 The young man holds up a newspaper he takes from the desk of a neighbor
 who has been reading it. "Here is one of the most disgusting tabloids
 this
 country hosts, professor. Is there such a thing as immorality?"

 "Of course there is, now look..."
 "Wrong again, sir.  You see, immorality is merely the absence of
 morality. Is there such thing as injustice?  No. Injustice is the
absence
 of
 justice. Is there such a thing as evil?"  The Christian pauses. "Isn't
 evil the
 absence of good?"

 The professor's face has turned an alarming color. He is so angry he is
 temporarily speechless.

 The Christian continues. "If there is evil in the world, professor, and
 we all agree there is, then God, if he exists, must be accomplishing a
 work
 through the agency of evil. What is that work, God is accomplishing?
The
 Bible tells us it is to see if each one of us will, of our own free
will,
 choose good over evil."

 The professor bridles. "As a philosophical scientist, I don't vie this
 matter as having anything to do with any choice; as a realist, I
 absolutely do not recognize the concept of God or any other theological
 factor as
 being part of the world equation because God is not observable."

 "I would have thought that the absence of God's moral code in this
world
 is probably one of the most observable phenomena going," the Christian
 replies. "Newspapers make billions of dollars reporting it every week!
 Tell me,
 professor. Do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey?"

 "If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, young man,
 yes, of course I do."
 "Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir?"

 The professor makes a sucking sound with his teeth and gives his
student
 a silent, stony stare.

 "Professor. Since no-one has ever observed the process of evolution at
 work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor,
are
 you
 not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you now not a scientist, but a
 priest?"

 "I'll overlook your impudence in the light of our philosophical
 discussion. Now, have you quite finished?" the professor hisses.

 "So you don't accept God's moral code to do what is righteous?"
 "I believe in what is - that's science!"
 "Ahh! SCIENCE!" the student's face spits into a grin. "Sir, you rightly
 state that science is the study of observed phenomena. Science too is a
 premise which is flawed..."
 "SCIENCE IS FLAWED..?" the professor splutters.

 The class is in uproar. The Christian remains standing until the
 commotion has subsided.

 "To continue the point you were making earlier to the other student,
may
 I give you an example of what I mean?"

 The professor wisely keeps silent.
 The Christian looks around the room.  "Is there anyone in the class who
 has ever seen the professor's brain?"

 The class breaks out in laughter.
 The Christian points towards his elderly, crumbling tutor. "Is there
 anyone here who has ever heard the professor's brain...felt the
 professor's
 brain, touched or smelt the professor's brain?"

 No one appears to have done so.
 The Christian shakes his head sadly.  "It appears no one here has had
any
 sensory perception of the professor's brain whatsoever.  Well,
according
 to the rules of empirical, testable, demonstrable protocol, science
says
 the
 professor has no brain."

 The class is in chaos.
 The Christian sits... Because that is what a chair is for.

The High Beyond.  There is actual, real work to do in the high beyond.  A
resident there may have to deal with the fact that there are superior
beings, but said resident is not dependent upon them.  A High Beyonder
also has the chance to grow without bound, something that is not as true
in the other scenarios.

Those who succumb only to the unknown, live therein. I savor every 
nanosecond of life, as if the next may be the last. I also have personal 
reasons for feeling that way. (ie. a car wreck) However, the adoration I 
hold in my heart while consumming these precious moments, allows me 
(within my field of inetrest) to precieve an openess to the future 
possibilities. This insight does not detain me in any way, from the here

I think that cryonics differs from "life extension technology in general"
because cryonics represents a small part of the technology in general, and I
find other parts of life extension technology more promising, more
interesting, and more potentially much more powerful. Especially
interesting, clone technology combined with genetic modification and
combinatorial chemistry may have the possibility to amplify intelligence far
beyond present human levels. This may provide transhumans a significant (who
knows, maybe as much as a ten year) lead over silicon-based AI, to leap-frog
Moore's Law. To effectively manage future information technology, humans
will need all the augmented and genetically enhanced intelligence they can
get. I don't believe in personality, so I have no interest in freezing my
imaginary persona.

Beyond mentioning that moralism and philosophy have their roots in biology,
I haven't much to say about them, except that building a better organism can
result in better mores with less philosophizing.

It seems to me folks can get real touchy about this, so just let me say that
I endorse whatever medical research pays off in real benefit to real people.
Just because I don't happen to think much will come of cryonics doesn't mean
that I wish to intrude on others' enthusiasm for it.

Let me put it this way. In answer to Scott's query ("Choose five people that
you most wish would embrace the idea of cryonics because they have a talent
or a gift that the world can ill afford to lose"), I tried to indicate that
the people I think the world can least afford to lose may not themselves
embrace the idea of cryonics. Apparently some people on this list did not
grok what I meant by that, so let me add that the people I think the world
can least afford to lose have not yet emerged from ultra-technology.

The world, I suspect, will need super-intelligent and super-sane people who
can effectively manage human destiny on the chaotic eve of the Singularity.
Such super-people, it seems to me, will more likely come from clone
technology combined with genetic modification and combinatorial chemistry or
some new technology other than cryonics. I think the posthuman wants to get
born ASAP, and it doesn't have a messianic attitude toward humans. It
doesn't have a savior complex either. It wants to reach to the stars, just
like some of us do. And like us, it won't tolerate fools and assholes. To
it, we will appear as fools and assholes. It may even have an attitude: "Get
used to it, or get augmented."

That seems reasonable to me. But you'll have to convince the Club of Rome. I
didn't even know of them until you mentioned the name. Then again, don't try
to convince the Club of Rome. Don't even tell them about cryonics. They
sound like a group whose talents and gifts the world can easily afford to
lose.

Perhaps so, or it might more closely mimic a Club of Rome meme.

Of course, but the treatment for aged suspension patients involves reviving
them, and no one has yet demonstrated that treatment. So, as you suspend
more and more patients, the demand for the revival treatment increases, even
though it doesn't yet exist. That pushes the price up.

Oh, I dunno, perhaps the Chinese, lacking cryonic technology themselves, may
decide to take exception to other cultures' suspending hundreds of millions
of their aged patients. Or perhaps Asian families, eager to preserve their
own elders (some worship ancestors), may invest in US cryonic corporations,
which might put US militia maniacs in higher gear.

Wait until poor people in America car-jack enough vehicles so that they can
mobilize to storm hospitals. Just kidding... don't hack my ISP's server!

I've probably overstated my position on this issue. In itself, I don't
really think cryonics can ignite a social rebellion/conflagration, but it
could add fuel to the fire.

Precisely so. Which explains why I think this could lead to a conflict
between haves and have nots. When the have nots feel so excluded that they
can't even get a real rebellion going, then watch out. Powerful social
influence often comes from people with nothing (or very little) to lose.
They fight most earnestly and tenaciously. The kamikaze and the suicide
bomber have their own madness to motivate them.

Global corporations want posthumans to get born as much as the posthumans
do, because corporations need the brains. Expert computer systems already
replace aged company consultants, so corporations don't have much interest
in expert suspended patients. Upon revival, many suspended patients may
actually find themselves in the ranks of the poor, due to their inability to
catch up educationally, plus their huge medical bills for the revival
operation and the cure for what killed or incapacitated them.

I ordered a few things from amazon.com and they soon after started
sending me advertisements which I *think* must be tuned to my tastes
according to what I have purchased from them.  Or did they send
this ad out to everybody?  Has anyone else out in the writhing
amoeba heard of Neil Gershenfeld?  If their ads are tuned, they
sure have *my* number.  {8^D  spike

When Things Start to Think
                                   by Neil A. Gershenfeld

                                   A computer in your shoe? Maybe so. Neil
                                   Gershenfeld, director of MIT's Media Lab,
joins
                                   the ranks of techno-prognosticators with
When
                                   Things Start to Think, and his focus is on
how
                                   the future of computing will fit into our
physical
                                   realities. This sensorial focus allows
Gershenfeld
                     to explore such science fictional ideas as wearable
computers,
                     nanotech circuitry implants, as well as such concerns as
emotions,
                     money, and civil rights in the new age of artificial
intelligence.
                     Gershenfeld provides a historical overview of the
development of
                     computers and extrapolates a world in which we will be
forced to
                     deal with things that think all the time. This can't help

I vary between Permutation City and the culture.  The High Beyond would be

I'd tend toward the High Beyond.
Dangerous, certainly, but likely not much more dangerous than our
current world if you factor in the expanded abilities of individuals.
In a 'High Beyond' scenario individuals would command levels of
resources, energy and technology that we currently associate with nation
states or multinational corporations.
Personally, I find that very attractive, and as been mentioned in this
thread before, there would be _many_ options available.

If there is another, more constructive way of looking at democracy,
then maybe the above statement is not necessarily true.  I asserted
that democracy simply enforces minority rule over the majority because
politicians are forced to appeal to minorities (who vote in blocks -
unions, blacks, fundie christians, etc) in order to be elected. 
Politicians are also forced to respond favorably to the special
interests which fund their campaigns.

Can anyone describe a different version (or any version) of democracy
which could possibly be in line with the Extropian principles?  Open
society and perpetual progress come to mind as key principles to
consider?

My thoughts have been for the past several months that either a
benevolent dictatorship (monarchy, etc) would be a lot better than
democracy...

I'm not sure the project is worth the effort.  Do you think there is some
chance that he might actually listen to what you have to say?  I ask because
the sort of people who would find silliness like this persuasive are usually
not interested in listening to other viewpoints.

Sure - a constitutional republic.  We used to have one of those in the US,
but that hasn't been the case for about 70 - 100 years (depending on where
you draw the line).  The crucial feature is that the central government
should not have the power to do most of the things that special interests
would care about.

Hyperdemocracy, which instead of having one man, one vote, it has a one man, one veto system, which
requires 100% consensus to pass a new law (of course, you will need 100% consensus of a group to
impose this system and its original set of laws (constitution) on a group without using force.)

Other ideas for less stringent systems:

require a 3/4 majority to pass new laws, but only a simple majority to rescind old laws. Pass a
constitutional amendment requiring all laws to 'sunset', or expire in a given time frame, thus old
obsolete or unpopular laws are allowed to die (like the current Independent Counsel law).

Return the Senate to the old system of being appointed by the State Governors and approved by the
state legislatures. Thus they will be independent of the electoral system, and will return to their
old position of being a check on the mercurial whims of the masses.

At the same time, either eliminate the house of representatives, and replace it with, or add in
parallel, a system for national referendums. The senate and the president can still veto these
referenda, but their vetos could be overruled by a sufficient percentage, say 75% or 80% of the
popular vote, to override their vetos.

Joe and Billy,

   It may not work to try to answer....it is true that it is very hard to show
someone the inconsistencies in their beliefs.  However, repetition and
multiple sources can have an impact.  So, could answering such an attack on
science have some effect?  Possibly....just don't expect miracles<g>.

Can such a government keep itself from travelling down the same road
that we have?  Is there any way to prevent the slide into
bigstatism/socialism with democracy???

I used to think like that, but now I see it differently: would
you say that a slave who buys his freedom is "cooperating with
the system" of slavery?  No, you'd say that he was doing just
what his circumstances allowed.  Similarly, if voting can be used
as a form of dissent, I think it should be.

Failure to vote--to use the only tool the system allows--makes
one morally complicit in whatever atrocities are committed by
the government agents you failed to vote against.

   I agree that the ideal form of government is government by concensus,
however this type of government usually only works in a group which is fairly
homogeneous, small, and willing to compromise.  Also, any hardcore dissent can
bring such a system to its knees.

   Having things enacted by votes greater than a simple majority seems a
reasonable precaution, though it still means a small and despised minority can
be oppressed.  It is also reasonable to have a lower vote threshold for the
removal of laws, since this would help to offset the inertia in most
governments which works against the removal of things once instituted.  As for
laws expiring, I oftentimes find that such expirations lead to rubber stamp
renewals; again the inertia of "if it's already there, we'll just leave it."
Perhaps if we linked the term of expiration to the number of votes an item
received, with longer effective terms for those measures which were very
popular and shorter for those which only barely were enacted.  While not
perfect, this would mean controversial measures would come up earlier than
those which were not, and the controversial ones are the ones less likely to
end up being rubber stamped.

   I have also wondered if it wouldn't be better to return to the old method
of selection of the Senate.  And I do believe that there should be a wider
role of referendum in politics now that the technology is such that it would
make mass ballot initiatives practical.  One thing I would suggest, however,
is that maybe we should make measures have to pass by a certain percentage of
the total "possible" vote, sort of a quorum of the electorate.  If not enough
people vote to reach a quorum, then nothing can pass.  This would weaken the
power of special interest groups.  I also wonder if any time a ballot is cast,
we shouldn't have some sort of fact quiz, just to make sure that the person
voting actually knows what they are voting on, as opposed to just filling out
what they were told to....this may be a little difficult to do in a
nonpartisan way.

   One of the biggest problems I see for future democracies which are not
based on concensus is the issue of identity.  If I can upload my personality
many times, how many votes should we get?  I could do it just in time to
register, vote, then remerge after the count.  Or how about borganisms
composed of many originally separate personalities?  Do they count as one, or
many?  If there is a concensus, all these problems go away, but otherwise they
quickly become relevant. 

   Of course, we could count resources instead of individuals....the more
resources you have control over, the larger the percentage of the vote.  Some
subscribe to the theory that the voting process is a surrogate for combat,
with everyone conceding that the one who won the vote would likely win an
armed conflict, and thus it is better for both sides to let the vote decide,
which is less costly for both.  If this is indeed the case, then it would be
reasonable to assume whatever side in an issue had control of the most
resources would likely win (regardless of number of "personalities", unless
those ARE counted as resources).  This way, we would avoid the problem of
trying to sort out "who" gets "a" vote.  Of course, some issues people place
such value on that they are unwilling to concede defeat ever.  These are not
usually settled at the polling place even today.

   Just some thoughts spun off the cuff....what do y'all think?

Ah, Benevolent Despotism....

   It is an old meme which holds a siren call for many.  "There is no way to
get these terrible people to agree with anything sensible....I think maybe we
could find at least ONE good and righteous person, so why not give that person
all the power?"  It does have its appeals....of course, the problem is that
you have to continue to agree with every decision of your Benevolent Despot,
or else the meme in your mind quickly transmutes to Oppressive Tyrant.  Note
that this doesn't even mean that the person in power has to be wrong, just
that you think that person is wrong.  Or sometimes, you might even agree in
theory that your leader is right....but it is getting in the way of what you
WANT, right or wrong.  And of course, you begin to run into REAL problems if
in fact the person you've installed as dictator is actually making mistakes,
because who is there to correct them?

I think the fact that this didn't burst my bubble may have some small
effect.  The actual deconstruction of the writing will only cause him
to build more irrational defenses.  I like to think that the more
irrational defenses needed for the sole purpose of supporting a meta
meme, the more vulnerable it is to collapse.  There are a lot of fully
indoctrinated ex-christians on this list that took the time and effort
to build a self consistent rational world view.  Remember the "Aha
Experiences" thread?  Each one of them experienced this painful
buildup and collapse.  So all I can offer is to force the infected
subject to build up more irrational defenses with hopes that the virus
will be inoculated  by seeming to underestimate the host's
intelligence - so to speak.  

I was also planning on tracking down the author and where ever the
author posted this, and forwarding the deconstuction with full credits
to the one who does the work.  The author needs to know that just
because you can get away with these kinds of fallacies verbally to a
friendly audience doesn't mean that if you put them in writing for
wide distribution on the net the fallacies are so easily overlooked.

I would live in:  The Archive.

( Zone Barrier #4 on the canonical list in _Singularity Analysis_:
  http://tezcat.com/~eliezer/sing_analysis.html#zones )

Let's say that there's a full-scale Singularity and that we all have the
opportunity to go for all-out godhood.  If there's an infinite supply of
computing power and memory, the old personality might be archived. 
Various levels of our own selves might be "archived" as continuing,
active programs - ranging from our current selves, to the highest level
of intelligence attainable without complete inscrutability.  Hundreds,
even millions, of versions might wander off into strange realms of
cognitive self-alteration, but the "you" who first greeted the Final
Dawn would always be around as a backup.  What would there be to do? 
Perhaps any number of meaningful things; not as meaningful as the
Powers' playrooms, but meaning is meaning.

Life is good and there are gods to talk to.

On the contrary.  The only thing that can make me morally complicit in
*anything* is giving my consent to it.  If the government offers me two
candidates, Adolf Hitler and Michael Dukakis, my voting for Dukakis
doesn't make me liable for whatever portion of the national debt he runs
up.  Nor does my refusal to vote entirely make me liable for Hitler's actions.

A vote is just the degree of control the government has decided to allow
you over it.  It doesn't signify your acquiescence to the actions of the
government.  If I'd signed the Constitution, it would, but I didn't, so
it doesn't.  If I do my best, through voting, to minimize the national
debt, there is no action on the part of others that can make me morally
liable for what's left.  Others have no power over my moral
responsibility; nor can they force me to accept liability by making it
the lesser of two evils.  The ONLY thing that can make me liable is my
SPECIFIC CONSENT.  The theory of implied consent through ANY action (or
inaction) is hokum.

It is really a bit surprising that this idea comes up on this list,
since it is really the exact opposite of self organization and self
determination and so on.

I think information theory is important for designing systems of
government. Why doesn't central planning work very well? Because it
will not be able to get enough (and the *right*) information (besides
things like corruption and bureaucracy as well as that it doesn't take
individual preferences into account). The benevolent despot draws this
to an extreme, that despot would have to process *all* relevant
information for his society, something which seems to require at least
SI. But if you have an SI ruler, it is likely that there will be
close-to-SI systems out in society making things even more complex
anyway; the only way to solve it is to have a ruler SI that has an
information processing ability on the same order of the rest of
society - but then you get an *internal* regulation problem for the
ruler, since its own mind is just as complex as the society it tries
to regulate well. Oops :-) Putting the despot into charge of a big and
helpful bureaucracy doesn't solve the problem either, since now the
bureaucracy + despot is equivalent to a SI, with the added problems of
human nature embedded in the system.

_Aristoi_ comes to mind. That is what really irritated me about the
book, the political system was inherently unstable (or at least
metastable). Having a distributed system of many enlightened despots
makes the risks smaller, but they will never vanish. Still, the book
also demonstrated some of the basic flaws in the Logarchy fairly well.


I have played enough Civilization II to realize how frightening an
enlighted despot can be. "I must make the citizens of Pseudopolis
happy. So I'll send their musketeers to a certain death over in Sto
Lat, and they will become happier since they don't have any boys in
the field any more." ;-)

That's true only so long as voting is a level playing field.  When the
government subsidizes certain parties through the stolen earnings of
it's citizens and then restricts the ability to campaign by other
parties, I don't think there's such a level playing field.

The one weakness I feel the US Constitution has is that it lacks an explicit glossary. There should be
a glossary of simple definitions that are hard to misunderstand. Additionally, there should be a
clause saying that the constitution is to be interpreted literally, not figuratively, not
incrementally, not subjectively, and no more or no less than exactly what is said.

Much of the devolution of our system occured because the courts have found new meanings in the words,
ignoring the original intent, and they even have invented new interpretations that are literally
baseless.

Good comments. Here's some add-ons...

It will only bring such a system to its knees in the eyes of those who think there
needs to be a change in the system. Under such a system, though, since there is
completely voluntary opting in, where joiners must agree to the system and
understand its implications, the joiners will be free to leave the system if they
so choose. If the system is a monopoly PPL in a geographic area (like a current
day government), then if the majority doesn't want those who voted against to
block their proposed change, then they have to buy the sticklers out. Thus the
system will not be brough to its knees, but those who want change will have to pay
the market value of forcing their point of view...

Thats a good idea, having pro-rated sunset dates. I think though that unpopular
laws will be let die (as we are doing now with the independent prosecutor law here
in the US), while those that are tolerable will be let live.

One thing that would prevent such opression of minorities is by allowing
dissidents to opt out of the system and form their own political unit in their own
territory.

Thats a good idea, though with universal net access, the system can easily be set
up to allow voting over several days, in an encrypted system, so that those who do
not participate but are qualified to may simply be voting "I don't care either
way."

Well I remember living in Washington State, the referendums there were well
covered by the press, and every residence received a voting packet with
information on and position papers on the issues in the referenda.

Its a matter of residency. Currently, a human level intelligence must be 18 years
old to vote here in the US, and it must be resident in the local voting area for 3
months to a year to qualify for local voting rights. I think extending these to AI
and uploaded intelligences would help alleviate these forms of fraud.

Considering that in battle, the defending side in an entrenched position usually
only needs 1/5th to 1/20th the number of men to defend a position. Extending this
corrolary to voting, this translates to my supermajority proposal earlier.

The problem is almost never the benevolent despots. The problem is
usually the spoiled brat children/ambitious courtiers who end up
succeeding them.

Solutions to this problem usually involve randomizing/putting to a
referendum the choice of who succeeds who, and then you're right back to
the Canadian system of "elected absolute despot who gets turfed from
office every couple of years".

Representative parlimentary democracy, combined with a majority
government (where the sitting party holds more seats then the other
parties combined - fairly common here), combined with ridiculous rules
about members of the sitting party HAVING to vote the way the prime
minister wants, are as close as I've ever seen to benevolent despotism.
Sometimes it seems that the checks/balances provided by bureaucratic
friction in the civil service are the only reason this country doesn't
go to hell in a hand basket.

Hint for Canadian political groupies, try to avoid watching "Yes
Minister" during an election campaign :)

That is why there is space to write in your candidate. You don't "have' to choose
the explicit choices on the ballot.

If you think its important enough, run for office yourself.  Look, for example, at
what Vermont farmer Fred Tuttle did. Fred had been the star of a local indie film
called 'Man With A Plan', which recently aired nationwide on PBS, which is about a
retired Vermont farmer who needs money to care for his own father, so he figures
running for congress will get him in the money pit without needing prior
experience. The film was made several years ago, but last year a 'carpet bagger'
from out of state moved to Vermont and in one year filed to run as a Republican
against democrat Senator Patrick Leahy. This incensed Fred and his director, so he
decided to run for the Republican nomination himself. Fred won the nomination (on
a campaign budget of $16.00, versus his opponent spending several hundred thousand
dollars) and Fred immediately announced that he was going to vote for Pat Leahy
himself in the election and hoped his supporters would too. His election campaign
budget was, as I recall, $256.00. Senator Leahy's campaign commercials showed him
napping in a canoe on Lake Champlain, waking up and saying,"I love Vermont." Leahy
won, but Fred Tuttle still got 36,000 votes....

Voting for the lesser of two evils only makes you slightly evil. It does not make
you good.

Exactly right.  Abortion and morality(politics)  is about killing and /or the
use of coersive force.

A fetus is alive. When you abort it you kill it.

Restoration of neural output from a paralyzed patient by a direct
brain connection
P. R. Kennedy and R. A. Bakay
Neuroreport 9:8 1707-11 Jun 1 1998

The authors describe a communications link for a "locked-in" patient
with ALS. It consisted of a hollow glass cone, with gold recording
wires. Before implantation the cone was filled with neurotrophic
factors, encouraging neurons to grow into it and make connections;
this takes around 3 months and produce stable recordings at least for
15 months (in monkeys). The electrode was implanted in the motor
cortex, and the patient could learn to control the signal so that it
acted as a binary switch. This system with neurotrophic factors (or
even implanted peripheral nerves) looks a bit like the future,
expecially since it seems to survive well.


Perinatal choline supplementation increases the threshold for chunking
in spatial memory
W. H. Meck and C. L. Williams
Neuroreport 8:14 3053-9 Sep 29 1997

Characterization of the facilitative effects of perinatal choline
supplementation on timing and temporal memory
W. H. Meck and C. L. Williams
Neuroreport 8:13 2831-5, Sep 8 1997

One of the most fascinating forms of memory enhancement occurs when
choline is given to pregnant rats during day 12-17 of pregnancy and/or
to the pups at postnatal day 15-30. This results in what appears to be
a permanently better memory. In these two papers Meck and Williams
study how much treated and untreated rats chunk their memories, and
how well they can time their responses. In the chunking study, they
studied how the rats organized their food gathering in a maze. It
turned out that treated rats were better at gathering food (as
expected) and also that they started to chunk memories (i.e. first
take all the cocoa puffs, then the seeds, then the pellets instead of
just taking them in a radom order) later than the ordinary rats when
the maze was made more complex and demanding. That suggests that they
had better working memories. In the timing study the rats were to
respond after 20 seconds, and the choline treated rats managed that
task with less variance than the untreated. When given nicotine, which
increases the subjective clock so they respond prematurely, the
choline treated rats reacted more strongly than the untreated ones. To
sum up, choline supplementation seems to enhance spatial and working
memory as well as time memory for rats. It is interesting to wonder
what the effects might be in humans.



Effects of music and white noise on working memory performance in monkeys
S. Carlson, P. Rama, D. Artchakov and I. Linnankoski
Neuroreport 8:13, 2853--6, Sep 8 1997

It has been claimed that listening to Mozart improves cognitive
performance. One suggested explanation has been that the music sets up
some kind of rhytm or entrainment in the brain that is
beneficial. This study tested this by using monkeys as experimental
subjects instead of students as usual. The monkeys had learned to do a
working memory task, and silence, music (Mozart's Piano Concerto
No. 21 in C), a simple rhythm and white noise was played for the
monkeys before or during testing. If the sounds were played before
there was no significant effect. If played during the task Mozart
*decreased* their performance, while white noise increased it
(compared to the silence control group). This suggests that whatever
the beneficial effects of music are in humans, they are not due to
some simple neurologic effect but rather our higher level
cognition. For the monkeys the complex music was just
distracting. White noise might be a good way of tuning out other
distractions; this may be why some people work better when it rains.


Bacterial growth in space flight: logistic growth curve parameters for
Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis
M.A. Kacena, G.A. Merrell, B. Manfredi, E.E. Smith, D.M. Klaus and P. Todd
Appl Microbiol Biotechnol, 51:229-234 1999

Perhaps a potential problem one day: bacteria cultures appear to grow
more quickly in space than on Earth. In this paper the authors studied
the logistic growth of bacteria and compated them to similar
experiments on the ground, and it looks like bacteria can grow to
higher stationary state concentrations and have shorter lag-times,
most likely because they can fully exploit three dimensions and do not
sediment. Better clean more often in space. 


Tryptophan depletion in normal volunteers produces selective
impairment in memory consolidation
Wim J. Riedel, Tineke Klaasen, Nicolaas E.P. Deutz, Astrid van Someren
and Herman M. van Praag
Psychopharmacology 141: 362--369 1999

The effects of tryptophan depletion and loading on laboratory
aggression in men: time course and a food restricted-control
James M. Bjork, Donald M. Dougherty, F. Gerald Moeller, Don R. Cherek
and Alan C. Swann
Psychopharmacology 142: 24--30 1999

Serotonin is involved in cognitive performance such as learning and
memory, and also in the regulation of mood. The amino acid tryptophan
is used to produce serotonin, and by manipulating the levels in the
blood the serotonin levels can apparently be influenced. These two
articles study what happens when test subjects are given food or drink
that depletes or increase the levels of tryptophan. The first article
found that the subjects given an amino acid mixture without tryptophan
(which causes the levels to decrease by competition) suffered a
decrease in memory consolidation, but not on working memory,
perception, attention and executive functions. In the second study
participants were given drinks that either decreased or increased
tryptophan levels, and their aggressiveness was studied (by measuring
how often they tried to retaliate against a (simulated) participant
who caused them loss of money in a game). Men with low tryptophan
levels became more aggressive, while raised tryptophan levels didn't
make them more peaceful than when tested on an empty stomach. So
tryptophan depletion looks like something best avoided, although
tryptophan supplementation might not make us much more peaceful (the
cognitive effects are another question). 



Can you control your mood with carbohydrates?
David Benton
Value of pleasures and Questions of Guilt Workshop 1997
http://www.arise.org/bentab2.html
(There are more fun papers on that website about pleasure, I will
likely review more of them in the future).

A nice review of the literature of the effects of carbohydrates on
mood.  It turns out that the interactions are fairly tricky, since
they involve both the insulin response and other factors.  A feeling
of less energy and more relaxation develops around two hours after a
meal, but drinking a high sugar drink or meal may lead to feeling
energetic in the short-term. Higher carbohydrate intake over a period
of days is associated with better mood, but the reasons for this might
be more complex than simple carbohydrates (e.g. better taste producing
a better mood). A tendency for blood glucose levels to fall is
associated with irritation and aggression; this can be stopped with a
glucose containing drink. The theory that high carbohydrate meals make
tryptophan levels rise seems to be relevant mostly under laboratory
conditions, proteins in the meal are likely more important.  To sum
up, it seems that long-term eating habits and one's metabolic
responses are more relevant for general mood than short term eating.



Harnessing the Power of the Continuum: Asynchrony, Emergence, and
Church's Thesis
David F. Delchamps
Nonlinear Science Today, 1995? 
http://www.springer-ny.com/nst/nstarticles.html

A fun article exploring the consequences of having continous time. It
turns out that this enables Turing machines to compute uncomputable
numbers. The proof is rather simple: imagine two Turing machines, one
with clock frequency 1 and the other with frequency tau, which is
irrational. If the first is programmed to output n ones and then halt
when given the input n, and the other is programmed to output n zeros
and then halt. A third machine simply concatenates the outputs as they
arrive, creating a composite stream of interleaved ones and zeros. It
turns out that this little machine can compute uncomputable numbers
simply by selecting the right tau. Neat. The rest of the paper is a
bit more speculative, and I don't buy the author's idea that brains
become powerful by being parallel and exploiting continous times (then
our thinking would be highly sensitive to delays, which occur
naturally in aging). But it is definitely a fun way of extending the
TM.


A quantum-dot neural network
E.C. Behrman, J. Niemel, J.E. Steck and S.R. Skinner
In T. Toffoli, M. Biafore, and J. Leao (ed.) PhysComp96, New England
Complex Systems Institute (1996) 22-24 Nov 1996
(http://www.me.twsu.edu/me/faculty/steck/Pubs/)
A mathematical implementation of an artificial neural network using
the nonlinearities of interacting quantum systems. It employs the by
now familiar "quantum dot molecules", where two electrons live in a
five dot structure and can shift between two diagonal states, as
influenced by neighboring molecules. The implementation appears to be
able to both do traditional ANN calculations as well as quantum
calculations.


Topological Censorship
Kristin Schleich, Donald M. Witt
Proceedings of the Lake Louise Winter Institute, Particle Physics and
Cosmology, Feb. 20-26, 1994, (World Scientific, 1994)
http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9903061

It is not just the Internet that suffers from censorship. Now it looks
like spacetime topology is censored too. Friedman, Schleich and Witt
have proven the topological censorship conjecture: that nontrivial
topologies (such as wormholes) have to be hidden behind horizons,
making them impossible to see (and use). More technically, if
spacetime is asymptotically flat, globally hyperbolic (i.e. physics
behaves in a predictable manner) and the averaged null energy
condition holds (energy densities can be negative locally as long as
the average energy is positive) then every causal curve
(i.e. trajectory of something) can be continously deformed to every
other curve. This paper gives an informal proof of this that is fairly
easy to follow. Too bad for us would-be spacetime engineers, now we
have to start looking for loopholes.

("I didn't say anything when they censored singularities, since I'm
nonsingular. I didn't say anything when they outlawed time travel with
the Chronology Protection Conjecture, since I didn't want to kill my
grandfather. Now they have censored wormholes, and I can't get
anywhere" :-)



And a bit of science fiction:

The Wind from the Sun by Arthur C. Clarke 

A collection of short stories he wrote in the 60's. Very much hard sf,
with some stories of transhumanist interest. It is fascinating to
notice how several of his ideas have become almost standard.  "The
Wind From the Sun" is in many ways the paradigmatic solar sail story
about a race, carefully describing various sail geometries and
problems.  Maelstrom II is a nice "Man vs. physics" story, and
according to the preface it seems that Clarke was first again with
suggesting railgun launches from the moon with an article in the
November 1950 issue of the Journal of the British Interplanetary
Society.  "Dial F for Frankenstein" is another classic
paradigm-setter, with the now classic first line "At 0150 GMT on
December 1, 1975, every telephone in the world started ringing". And
the final story, "A Meeting with Medusa" has likely influenced
practically every description of gas giant ecologies since then, but
also has a quite transhumanist ending.  Sometimes it is refreshing to
go back to the classics just to see what got everything else started.

All these references to _Aristoi_ convinced me to give it another read,
and it still delights on many levels. It seems somewhat unfair to
pooh-pooh the instability of the political system of the Logarchy without
noting the instability of the situation those institutions are designed to
address -- a situation with deep resonances for our own.  The Logarchy is
the political equivalent of the Vingean Zones, a self-conscious effort to
stave off a hard singularity, while garnering the benefits of
technological runaway.  In _Aristoi_ these institutions survive attack,
while in, say, _The Diamond Age_ or _The Bohr Maker_ similar institutional
stopgaps (neither of them as attractive to my personal sensibilities as
that of the Aristoi)  ultimately fail to hold off a hard singularity. 
Presumably the Logarchy was crafted in the aftermath of a goo-debacle (the
Earth1 disaster) -- a Singularity gone bad, but as a political "movement"
tranhumanists of all stripes seem no less haunted by the prospects of such
a disaster and so the institutional responses of these civilizations
(every one of which seems to be an attempt to adapt the premises of
western liberal society to SI and nanotech without rendering that
liberalism unintelligible to itself)  seem quite relevant to what we talk
about here...  That is, *if* it is *true* that transhumanism in general
and extropianism is particular really are, as so many want to claim,
"movements" at all rather than, as they usually seem to me, just barely
coherent enough to count as very stimulating ongoing conversations.  If

The difficulty with this is the effects of noise -- any finite amount of
noise will destroy the ability to compute "uncomputable" functions.

Another example is a hypothetical coin whose probability of coming up
heads is Chaitin's omega, the number whose binary expansion simply
enumerates the values of the hlating function.  By repeatedly tossing such
a coin we could determine the halting function.  Nothing in the laws of
nature precludes such a coin from existing.  (It is easy to define quantum
analogues of this, if you are worried about quantum effects).  However,
once again noise will prevent you from actually following the above
procedure, even should such a coin magically come into your hands.

(On a related note, there are several interesting papers showing that
analogue computational machines with exponential precision can solve
NP-complete problems in polynomial time.  Once again, noise destroys any
hope of using such machines in any practical sense.)

Possibly.

The key problem with past attempts at constitutional government seems to be
a gradual erosion of the barriers intended to keep government in check.
They are constantly tested, and occasionally some government encroachment
slips by.  Since nothing ever rolls back these encroachments, the result is
a gradual slide into tyranny.

One simple way to slow this process down is to reduce the forces that work
to make government grow.  By ensuring that the initial government is small,
with severely constrained powers and multiple checks and balances, you can
ensure that there is little it can do that will catch the eye of special
interest groups.  The less the government can do, the fewer resources will
be devoted to making it do things.

A second approach, which has never actually been attempted to my knowledge,
is to install active measures designed to roll back trespasses and encourage
deference to the constitution.  Create a criminal code to back up your
constitution, and a separate police agency to enforce it.  Set up a group
whose job is repealing old laws.  Allow the supreme court to hear peremptory
challenges to the constitutionality of any government action.  Things like
that.

A third option, and IMO by far the most important, is simply to make sure
that the populace wants a limited government.  When a republic slips into
tyranny, it is usually because its citizens demanded to have a dictator.  If
70% of the population diligently guards their freedom, no special interest
will ever make much headway.  Conversely, if only 5% even know what the
constitution says, no possible system of barriers will hold for long.

IMO, it would be feasible to craft a new constitution that would implement a
government capable of delivering just about everything modern libertarians
would like to see.  It could easily be made much more stable than America's
original system, while at the same time being much better at coping with a
real emergency.  Best of all, the project would not be nearly as risky as an
attempt to implement pure anarchy.

Of course, we aren't likely to actually be able to set up such a system
anytime soon, but it is still an interesting topic.  Who knows?  Maybe
someday we will actually have the opportunity to set up an independent
government somewhere.

Mike,

    Glad you liked some of my musings.  You suggested that a way to deal with
the loss of concensus was to have a way for dissenters to opt out.  I have
also contemplated this as a compromise measure, but I'm not sure this would
then be a concensus.  True, if all parties were agreed that a separation into
two or more separate groups were the best course of action, then we would
maintain a concensus as to the way to deal with disagreement (we all agree
that those who think this way should be over here, and those who think that
way should be over there).  However, what if someone who originally was a part
of the concensus changes their mind, decides that they want to do things
differently.  In your scenario, there would be a means of having that person
"opt out", but what if that person doesn't want to do so?  What if they say,
"This is my home, this is where everything and everyone I care about is.  I'm
not going anywhere....if you don't like the way I've decided to do things,
then you leave!"  Well, the majority could decide for the sake of tranquility
to simply let this group be, acquiesce as it were.  But what if the
disagreement was on something fundamental which impacted everyone?  I guess
what I am saying is, sometimes people aren't willing to budge, in any way,
shape or form.  At this point the concensus ceases to exist.

   BTW, I find the "I don't care either way option" interesting, sort of
granting special permission for others to decide, but not letting it be
assumed.

   As for the residency requirement, I think it might work in some cases, but
not all that I described.  What if you could make a perfect emulation of
someone?  Which is the original, and which is the copy?  Which gets to claim
all the years of residency before the copying occurred?  Or do you give up all
your voting rights if you are duplicated for a certain number of years?  And
what of the Borganism which was twelve thousand separate voters until a few
months ago?  Does it get all those votes?  Does it get any at all?  After all,
the Borganism wasn't a resident, all of them were.  I think the identity
problem is still there.  In the cases of clearly definable duplicates, you
might be able to impose a residency requirement successfully (especially if it
were some long time such as ten years), but I can see people complaining that
you are discriminating, and that since they have all the same memories and
experiences of the home state/city/political unit, and are effected by any
laws passed or people elected, then they have just as much right and ability
to vote.  Unfortunately, I haven't thought of a satisfying answer to this
question yet.

   "Resources do not have rights." - I agree they do not; I guess I was using
them as a gauge of the amount of resources that would voluntarily be available
for any enterprise voted on.  I don't really like this concept, but it was the
clearest alternative I could see to a head count, which might get confusing in
the near future.  Of course, trying to quantify resources might be as daunting
a task if we take all forms of wealth and ability into account.

   As for defenders, much of their advantage dissipates if they are not
expecting an attack....this is the offense's great strength, the ability to
choose when, where, and if a fight will occur.  It is true that in our mock
battle of voting, the defense gives up its strong position, but the offense
gives up the element of surprise.  I don't know which, if either, is the
greater loss of advantage.

On Political Systems:

   I think in the end any political system is more or less viable, but the key
feature is not the structure of the government but the character and ability
of the people who comprise the government, and to whatever extent a political
system utilizes good people, to that extent will that system prosper.

A personal comment on Christianity.

I no longer call myself a Christian.  I was a Christian, and interestingly
enough it was Bible study in the company of devote Christians which eventually
led me to no longer call myself Christian.  It was not that these people were
blind, or stupid, or oppressive.  In fact, it had nothing to do with
Christians, but rather with the Bible.  I finally found the inconsistencies
and the seeming attrocities commited by and for "God" too much to accept.
Most of those occurred in the Old Testament, so that is the part that I have
the most trouble accepting as the work of what we would in contemporary times
refer to as God.  My problems with the New Testament were less, but still
present.  First, the Gospels base their legitimacy in the Old Testament, and
Jesus as depicted there seems to echo this view.  There are also some comments
attributed to Jesus which I find too small to credit to a person of his
supposed origin.  Now, some apologists might claim some of this was added, or
misinterpreted, but then that means that it is impossible to say precisely
what the original intent of Jesus was.  

   Having said that, I would also like to say that my earliest introductions
to the memes of Tolerance, Improvement, Immortality, and Goodness were through
the New Testament's depiction of Jesus.  I feel much of value in me had its
origins in the stories of the Man from Galilee.  Granted, I have taken that
start and continued on my own, found other teachers and mentors as well, but I
will always acknowledge where my journey began, and say proudly that the meme
complex represented by Jesus of Nazareth has been a great part of my life.

This is incorrect.  The CBO estimates use pure gross income numbers.  They
do not incorporate any existing Internal Revenue Code provisions.  Actually,
the Forbes plan includes huge "loopholes" for the ultra-wealthy in that it
exempts dividends and capital gains from taxation.  Such a loophole would
dwarf all existing loopholes of the existing tax system.

"Dynamic scoring" is the new word for supply side economics (aka
Reaganomics).  While I agree that the effects of tax changes should be
determined on a dynamic economic landscape, it is too easy to manipulate
this method to make the tax outcome be whatever you want.  Additionally, the
effects of tax cuts are not understood well enough to start quoting figures.
Historically, significant tax cuts have been followed by years of growing
deficits and average to below average economic growth.  The years following
Reagan's effective tax rate reduction are a perfect example.  Even if you
remove the spending increases beyond the average for the prior 20 years, the
result is still ballooning deficits.  Furthermore, GOP pundits forcasted
5-6% GNP growth if the tax cuts of the early 80s were adopted.  This never
occurred.

No is isn't.  There has yet to be any detailed analysis that shows a 17%
flat tax (or any other proposed rate) will not result in huge deficits.
Forbes, the Kemp Commission and other conservative think tanks have produced
vague, "scrawled on a napkin" calculations that yield a revenue neutral
result, but when questioned on the details they dodge the issue.

I think you need to take a closer look at Bush's 1991 tax return.  His
extremely low effective tax rate is because he had a huge charitable
contribution deduction that year.  In 1991, Bush had approximately
$1,300,000 in gross income.  His itemized deductions were $670,000.
$550,000 of that were charitable contributions.  By giving away 40%+ of his
income he reduced his taxable income considerably resulting in only $200,000
in taxes owed.  You've picked an anomalous case to claim the wealthy will
pay more in taxes under the 17% flat tax system.  As you might guess, the
average high income earner doesn't give away 40% of his income every year.
At income levels above $1,000,000, the average taxpayer only gives away 2%
of their income.  President Clinton, in 1997, earned $570,000.  He had
charitable contributions of $270,000 (roughly 48% of his income) and still
paid $92,000 in taxes (an effective rate of 15%).

Instead of handpicking a case that supports an argument, lets look at the
effective tax rate for the average ultra wealthy taxpayers.  In 1995,
according to the Internal Revenue Service, the average effective tax rate
for the top 1% of all taxpayers in terms of gross income was 38.9%.  Top 5%
was 30.6%.  Top 20% was 26%. The top 40% excluding the top 5% was 19.9%.
The middle 60% (the middle class) was 18.9%.  The lowest quintile was 0%.
The overall effective tax rate for all taxpayers was 15.9%.  Clearly, the
ultra wealthy will receive a HUGE tax windfall as a result of the
implementation of the flat tax system.  Lets not forget that all these
effective tax rates include taxes on capital gains and dividends (70% of
which inure to the top 5% of all taxpayers) which will not be taxed at all!

What will happen if a flat tax is implemented?  The same thing that happened
when Reaganomics was implemented in the early 80s.  The rich will receive
the lions share of tax cuts generated by the flat tax regime.  Government
revenues will go down.  The GOP will not have the political will to support
the drastic spending cuts required to preserve the budget surplus or even
minimal deficits.  The federal government will resume the its huge
borrowings on the capital markets.  Guess who will have cash in hand to loan
to the federal government?  All these ultra-wealthy taxpayers who've
received these huge tax cuts.  Thats the infamy of it all.  The rich will
take the money they would have been paying under the old system and then
loan it to the government and earn interest on that money.

Forbes, Archer, and the rest of flat tax/national sales tax camp are clearly
wrong.  A comprehensive and objective review of the available data can yield
no other conclusion.

Look at Bush's 1990 return, that year he had $456,000 in income and paid

Hello,

I'm reading a lot of discussion around what's right or wrong with the existing proposals for Flat Tax.  Throw out the existing models, obviously there's enough concern around them to warrant a fresh look.

If you were going to design a Flat Tax proposal, how would it look?  Let's start with concepts first, we can work down into details later.

Kevin

What Forbes' plan did was eliminate the double taxation that is present in the
corporate system of taxation. This loophole applies to everyone, not just the
ultra-wealthy, although the democrats tried to paint is as if it were. They
pointedly ignored that the biggest winners would be the pension plans of hard
working middle class americans. This loophole is also necessary to optimize
dynamic scoring. Note that as the return on investment goes up, stock values go
up, increasing total capital gains and thus generating more revinues than
without the loophole.

Reagan's 20% tax cut on income taxes occured for only ONE year. The democrats in
control of congress killed as soon as they could. Part of the reason much of the
deficit was needed was to soak up all of the excess dollars floating around due
to Carter's fiat overprinting of money and to kill the vicious cycle of
inflation triggered by the oil crisis, but exacerbated and fed back upon by the
union and AARP's winning COLA increases in entitlement payments which were
higher than the inflation rate.

Even if you deduct the charitable donation in toto, the $200,000 he paid in
taxes was less than 30% of the remainder.

Reaganomics was only allowed to last for one year, so it is hardly a qualified

I doubt it. They could earn far more money on the stock market. Notice how hard
the government is finding it to sell its debt these days....a recent T-Bill
auction only sold 20% of the bonds available..

Yes, under the current system the only way to opt out is to immigrate to somewhere
else (unless there is nowhere that has the sort of system you want, then you are
SOL). However the trend in gated communities is I think indicative of a widespread
desire to balkanize, as is the school voucher idea. If a person wishes to opt out
of the services a government or PPL provides, they should be free to do so and
should have that portion of their tax bill deducted from the whole. If they want
to send their kids to a private school, or school them at home, they should not
have to pay the taxes that would have gone to that purpose. If they are not
satisfied with the level of police protection, they should be able to hire their
own security services, or, as Vinge's ungoverned would say "go armadillo",
completely self reliant.

There should be an option for that on a ballot, as well as for "neither".

I think that any upload or AI should have some sort of encrypted unique key, so
that if another copy was made, it couldn't register a duplicate key, and would
need a new one issued. I don't see there being a problem with merging
personalities back together, as the two will become separate individuals pretty
quickly. Merging them back together would only be possible in making them into a
borganism, which would be a new personality entirely.

A Borganism is a corporate entitiy with one vote with respect to its relationship
with society. Each 'person' in the collective only has a vote within the
collective....

My answer is TOUGH. Their action in dividing, if they seek more votes, was
obviously for political purposes and in my mind is tantamount to voter fraud. Its
kind of like getting residency in more than one jurisdiction and voting in all of
them.

The market is definitely a political system where resources have a vote, in dollar
units. There is the concept of funding government by vote lottery like I mentioned
recently, where say I put up a referendum that we need one more attack submarine,
at a cool $1 billion. I need to fund that mandate, so I post a lottery in
conjunction with, say, a guy who thinks we need another stealth bomber instead.
People can buy tickets to the lottery for a year's period or so, voting either for
the sub or the bomber. When $1 billion in tickets have been sold, a winning ticket
is drawn, and whatever piece of equipment the winner voted for gets the billion
bucks....

Strength of position may be measured by whether or not the law is conflicting with
an article of the Constitution, or how many years the old law has been in effect,
etc The strength of attack and defense might also be measured by people putting a
rating on their vote, not just a yea or nay. I might be defending a law I feel so
strongly about that I put a 10 rating on it, but the two people opposing me only
put a 4 rating on their resolve. Their rating comes up at 8 while mine is 10 and I
still win even though outnumbered....

It is sort of an inverse relationship. A government which provides the most
successful environment for its citizens breeds the potential for greater decadence
unless there are measures to keep up the quality of the citizens, like making
citizenship a merit system. You must pass intelligence, knowledge, and ethical
tests to become a voting member of the polity.  Jerry Pournelle had such a system
on the planet Sparta in his CoDominium series of novels

Warning:  the following remarks may contain spoilers for anyone
who has not yet read, but plans to read, _Permutation City_
or _Diaspora_ by Greg Egan, _Excession_ by Iain Banks, or
_A Fire Upon The Deep_ by Vernor Vinge.

Eliezer S. Yudkowsky asks:

>  Where do you want to live?

Not the Culture:

For me, Banks' Culture has the drawback that the mantle of civilization
has clearly passed from the biological races to the Minds, though
the latter (mostly) treat the humanoid Culture-dwellers with polite
cordiality.  Although the precise characteristics of the Culture seem
to alter from book to book, and it's suggested that humans can upload,
or form corporate intelligences, or overcome their biological
limitations
in various ways, in the Culture books I've read (_Consider Phlebas_,
_Use of Weapons_, and _Excession_) the humans seem to exist on
one side of a vast gulf between biological life and the Culture Minds
(which makes the intercourse between humans and Minds all the more
implausible, though I suppose one must grant this dramatic license
if AIs are to participate in stories about humans).

It's also rather implausibly suggested that a few biological brains have
pattern-recognition tricks that the Minds still haven't figured out,
which makes humans valuable to keep around as consultants.  Also,
the CIA-type skullduggery that the humans working for Special
Circumstances
perform on behalf of the Culture by infiltrating the societies of
more primitive planets (including Earth), while providing a vehicle for
stories of interest to human readers, seems something of a forced
narrative device.  Some of this is played for tongue-in-cheek humor, I
think
(similar to that in Brin's Uplift books), and is not meant to be taken
entirely seriously by the reader.

There's a somewhat mean-spirited tone pervading much of Banks'
writing on the Culture.  For instance, the human agents recruited by the
Culture are often subjected to rather appalling personal risks
and ordeals (which form the basis of the stories).  They're handsomely
paid (by the standards of contemporary human society, at any rate!), but
the vast material wealth of the Culture makes these exchanges enormously
one-sided (from the Culture's point of view, the agents are being paid
trinkets
to suffer agonies and risk their lives).  The usefulness of these agents
to the Culture is sometimes based on personal talents combined with
idiosyncracies verging on insanity, which the Culture is rather
cynically
willing to exploit (granted, this exploitation is dramatically necessary
in order to tell stories based on military conflict without having the
availability of near-magical ultratechnology dissipate all literary
tension).

There's an air of decadence and boredom in the portrayals of the human
inhabitants of the Culture, particularly those who are not working for
Special Circumstances.  Humans in the Culture are depicted as being
indoctrinated with a carefully-cultivated pretense that governmental
decisions
are made democratically and jointly by humans and machines, and that
something
like due process of law prevails, but those in the know (particularly,
those in Special Circumstances) know otherwise -- the Minds wield
absolute
power, though usually by means of an iron fist hidden inside a velvet
glove.

In _Excession_, there's also petty intolerance and one-upmanship among
the
various cabals of Minds seeking status by pursuing the Excession.  Also
in
_Excession_, there's an all-too-human pattern among the Minds of gaining
advantage by concealing information and keeping secrets -- how many
inhabitants of the Culture, human or otherwise, actually found out about
the existence of the Excession?

In many ways, the Culture represents the worst of contemporary human
society
dressed up with AIs and ultratechnology.  But most humans in the Culture
don't seem to have either the desire or the means to bridge the gap
between
themselves and the Minds (who treat them with a scrupulous politeness
that
barely covers their contempt), and they seem doomed to languorous
extinction.
All this makes for amusing and entertaining SF novels, but it wouldn't
be
my first choice among fictional worlds as a place to live.

Not the High Beyond:

The humans inhabiting Vinge's Zones of Thought suffer an ultimate
limit on their technologies and achievable intellectual capabilities
similar to that seen in Banks' Culture (and serving a similar literary
purpose. I suppose).  It seems unlikely that any endeavor originating
in a sub-Transcendent Zone (even the High Beyond) would be able to
achieve
the momentum necessary either to engage the interest of, or to protect
itself against, a Transcendent Power.

Any project or expedition originating in a lower Zone, which ventures
into the Transcend, risks getting gobbled up by an inscrutable Power
and/or being used for the Power's inscrutable purposes.

This is a bummer.

Not even Permutation City:

The TVC processor grid, and the software packages commissioned for it
(Permutation City and the Autoverse), are launched by the mad-genius
son of a business tycoon, with the financial backing of billionaire
Copies.
I find this alienating, despite the presence of the isolated stowaways
Kate and Peer (and by implication, others existing in their own
solipsistic
universes).

Although by the time Paul re-awakens Maria to assist in contacting
the Autoverse intelligences, the population of the TVC universe has
grown far beyond the original founders, this does not seem like a world
"for the rest of us".  If I were Bill Gates, I might be able to identify
more closely with the inhabitants of Permutation City.  Even Peer has
his origins in a sort of yuppie business-executive cum stock-market
speculator whom I have trouble identifying with, though the fact that
he died before achieving sufficient financial mass to attain clock-rate
parity with the billionaire Copies, yet was still able to stow away in
the TVC grid and ultimately found his own universe, is meant to suggest
that his second-class citizenship in Permutation City didn't really
matter.
Nevertheless,  I find the idea of being disconnected from the rest of
society by running at a slower clock rate on an indefinitely-expandable
computer, and thus being forced to be the founding father of my own
universe, too strange to be emotionally satisfying.

Thus, the story of _Permutation City_ in its first half is still too
bound
up with the constraints of scarcity (the TVC grid is created
specifically to
overcome those limits), and in its second half is too divorced from the
anchors of human existence (when Peer and Kate turn away from the
deserted
Permutation City to found their own world) to be entirely attractive. 
Also,
the TVC experiment is a sort of splinter-Singularity which forks off the
mainstream of the human race without the latter ever being aware that it
occurred.  It isn't revealed in this book what ever happened to
"the rest of us".

Perhaps the Coalition of Polises?

In Greg Egan's _Diaspora_, the Coalition of Polises (comprising Konishi,
Carter-Zimmerman, and the rest) constitutes, on the eve of the Fourth
Millennium, one of two modes of existence in which uploaded humans find
themselves (the Polises being the entirely disembodied state, whereas
the
gleisners continue to inhabit non-biological bodies).

>From a purely emotional point of view, this is the post-ultratech (if
not
actually post-Singularity -- only Vinge really portrays a Singularity,
in
_Marooned In Realtime_, in which the post-Singularity entities simply
disappear from the point of view of the remaining humans) fictional
world
which appeals the most to me.

In contrast to the narrative devices adopted by Banks and Vinge, there
is no gulf between humans and AIs in _Diaspora_.  Uploading is a fully-
mature technology; unlike the expensive scanning process which
candidates
for Copying must undergo in _Permutation City_, the Introdus nanoware in
_Diaspora_ is free for the asking (and also seems to function rather
like a
Moravec upload procedure, rather than a non-destructive copying
process).
In fact, there seems to be no real distinction in _Diaspora_ between
artificially-constructed minds and those which originated as humans who
entered the polises via the Introdus.  Unlike the portrayal of the
forked-off TVC universe in _Permutation City_, _Diaspora_ is a vision of
what happens to the rest of us.

Long before the year 2975, all human beings so inclined (the vast bulk
of
the human race) have transferred into gleisner bodies or entered the
polises;
the remaining "fleshers" are quasi-religious conservatives on the order
of today's Amish.  After the "little" gamma-ray burst, there are no more
flesh-embodied humans remaining alive.  Following the interstellar
diaspora,
and certainly following the receipt of the alien warning about the
coming
"big" gamma-ray burst and the resulting transfer into higher-dimensional
universes, the Coalition's channels of communication are stretched to
their
breaking point, but one still gets the impression that information about
all these events is being shared with all interested parties (a la the
Internet today), and that anyone inclined to expend the time and effort
(the requisite raw talent being free for the annexation) may make
meaningful
contributions to the culture (unlike the case of the Culture, in which
it's
hard to believe that humans could make meaningful contributions to the
efforts
of the Minds -- except for those contrived cases of human advisors with
intuitive abilities beyond the Minds' ken, and the gun-toting
Special Circumstances agents).

To summarize, I would say that the essential difference between the
world I
find emotionally appealing and the ones I find more alienating, is that
in
the former the humans are transformed en masse into their superiors,
whereas
in the latter the humans have been superseded and left behind by their
superiors (the Minds, the Powers, and the TVC elite).  The
transformation
scenario of _Disapora_ is similar to that portrayed by Ray Kurzweil in
his
recent book _The Age of Spiritual Machines_.

Major press coverage this weekend in Australia for the apparent discovery
by Aussie geologist Dr Philippa Uwins, at University of Queensland's Centre
for Microscopy and Microanalysis, of a new class of life-forms at the nano
scale, retrieved in a commercial oil drilling sample from 5 kilometres down
off the West Australian coast.  This work, done with UQ microbiologists
Rick Webb and Tony Taylor, was published in *American Mineralogist, An
International Journal of Earth and Planetary Materials, Volume 83; No.
11-12, Part 2* back in Nov/Dec 1998.

The paper is in

http://www.minsocam.org/ammin/TOC/1998/ND98Part2.html  

but the hotlink to the abstract gave an error message.

What look like archaic biota ranging upward in size from an improbably
small 20 nanometres can tolerate 170 degrees Celsius and 2000 atmospheres
pressure.  They grow in extremely hostile environments such as a scanning
microscope's vacuum (cue Dr Fred Hoyle), and most astounding of all they
`appeared to move,' according to Uwins.  `When I put the electron beam on
them, they moved away, which is not a typical mineral reaction.'

The scale of these proto- or archaeo-biota is close to that reported of the
remnants claimed in Martian meteorites.  Although the  nanobes are several
times too small to contain the complex enzyme systems needed for life,
preliminary DNA tests by UQ archeologist Tom Loy are positive, and he has
begun sequencing under an Australian Research Council grant.

Implications that strike me at once range from some version of the
Andromeda Strain (`They released the Germs from Hell, which will eat our
surface world!') to the Great Filter (ditto, except that this happens on
*every* inhabited world once it gets the technology to drill down 5 km) to
an existence proof of the feasibility of nano-scale machines, and maybe a
useful set of pre-evolved gadgets to tweak to build dedicated nanobots.

Interesting times, as ever.

It's getting unpleasantly close to April 1, making me begin to mistrust
every surprising result announced for the next few weeks.  Just the other
day a magazine reported that PC's constantly saved the noises picked up
by their microphones and the resulting files could be queried remotely
(that's why your disk drive light flashes occasionally, you see).  This
was a joke but it went around for a while before everyone realized it.

I wish this stupid custom would go away.  It's getting to the point where
there needs to be a moratorium on discoveries for a month starting in
mid March.

I tried to make some variation of "april fool" by anagramming "dr philippa
uwins".  I got "april" and was worried, but the closest I could come to
was something like "april pun hid wisp" which doesn't seem too close.
So I guess we can count this one as legit.

sober articles on nanotech or close derivative.  Between
them are 244 references.  All three articles reference Feynman,
but not one mention of K.Eric Drexler.

Not at all. the enlightened disdain the benighted. It is snobbery and
in-group social psychology.

The same held for plate tectonics, the discovery of Troy, blah blah blah.

"The Gentle Seduction"

It's a short story from 1989 written by Marc Stiegler.

It has been published several times. However, you can
find it in a short story collection by the same name. 

isbn: 0-671-69887-7 from Baen books

Not as flashy a universe as some of the others, but not
a future I would be at all sorry to find myself in.

This is similar to the obfuscation the GOP used when trying to pitch the
capital gains tax rate of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 on American
taxpayers.  The pitch was, "This capital gains tax rate cut affects 70% of
all Americans".  This was true.  70% of all Americans reported capital gains
on their tax returns.  However, this was simply a frequency figure, it did
not capture the magnitude of capital gains reported by different quintiles.
It also masked the size of the tax savings that would inure to different
quintiles.  Yet 90% of all capital gains are realized by the top 20% of
taxpayers.  This is like saying that if you have income type X and every
American has it but 1 out of 10 Americans reported $100 of it while the
other 9 reported $1 of it and you eliminate taxation on it that "everyone"
receives an equal tax benefit from the tax cut.  This is deception.  This is
a huge loophole.

You really need to get a better grip on the actual tax data instead of
believing GOP fairy tales.  Please refer to the tax data area of the IRS
site or try http://www.ctj.org/html/taxday98.htm for something more
instantly digestable.  Another suggestion is "The Labyrinth of Capital Gains
Tax Policy" by Leonard Burman.

Forbes has exempted all dividends and capital gains from taxation.
Therefore, stock prices can converge on infinity and it won't mean a single
penny in increased federal revenues.  As I stated before, it would be the
largest loophole for the wealthy in tax history.

Not quite.  If you eliminate the effects of the charitable deduction, you
must add approximately $200,000 in additional tax liability.  Thus Bush's
tax liability would be $400,000 on gross income of $1,300,000, or 31%.

Actually this is another point.  The flat tax would devastate philanthropy
in the United States.  The elimination of the need for a charitable
deduction and the estate tax would completely eradicate the need to make
charitable contributions.  Additionally, there would be no more Rockefeller
or Duke foundations (when Bill Gates states he's going to give 90% of his
wealth to charity he's not talking about actually giving it away but instead
funding his foundations).  These costs would have to be picked up to some
extent by the government.  In addition, research funding would suffer too.

The markets will only support so much capital in flow.  A perfect example of

The CBO performed a study of the effects of all the major tax reform
initiatives in 1998.  Additionally, the JCT performed a similar study of the
tax effects of different tax reform proposals in 1996.  I would look at
these first before listening to more rhetoric from the Forbes and Archers of
the world.

Flat Tax Redesign,

   Hmmm....well, how about we figure out based on location what each person
needs financially to live.  Subtract that amount from the person's income (the
ONLY kind of deduction).  Then tax everyone at the rate necessary to fund the
government's projected expenditures for the coming year, based on the past
year's GNP.  If taxes need to be cut, it should be based on cutting
expenditures, with the exception of true emergency spending (natural and
artificial disasters) which will have to be figured into the future rate.
That's an initial, off the top of my head, way to do a flat tax.  Note, I
would have the "Cost of Living" deduction be simply a per person amount, and
if people were smart enough to combine living expenses to make their funds go
further (communes, marriages, buying blocks, etc.), then good for them.
Whether I would use the same adult amount deduction for children or some age-
based formula I'm not sure of, and suggestions would be welcome.  Also, if you
wanted a kinder, gentler society, you could make as part of the government
expenditures giving everyone with negative taxes (those whose Cost of Living
deduction is greater than their income) enough to bring them up to that Cost
of Living amount, then it would be up to them to spend it sensibly.  I will
address the concept of social safety nets in another post.

I might modify the taxation by dividing government expenditures into two
categories, infrastructure and philanthropy.  Infrastructure expenditures
would be those things that are absolute core duties of the government and must
be funded every year.  They could be funded as described above in the Flat
Tax.  The Philanthropy expenditures would be those things that people think
might be useful for the government to give aid to and encourage (the arts,
sciences, maybe even subsidizing those with income below the cost of living
deduction, etc.).  There could be a list sent to the taxpayers of all the
current programs, those proposed, and how much their projected minimum cost
would be for the upcoming year.  Then people would be free to voluntarily
donate (or not) funds to those programs they like.  Any that are
insufficiently funded would not be done that year, and the supporters' money
could either be refunded, or they could have indicated on their donation form
what other programs those funds should be disbursed to should any of their
primary choices fail to fund.  Before that happens, there could be a general
announcement of which programs are short and by how much, and people would
then have a short time period in which to make additional donations before
those programs are declared dead for that year.  BTW, these donations to the
additional programs would NOT be deductable from the Infrastructure tax.  This
way people are only obligated to pay for those things which must be maintained
for society to continue to function, but liberals could still have large
programs, as long as people are willing to pay for it.  Of course, the biggest
political fights would then be over what qualifies as Infrastructure and what
qualifies as Philanthropy.

Sparta,

   I found it a very interesting culture....but it's not very Extropian in
inclination....just look at the Empire of Man that develops.  Still, a good
example of a society constructed to produce outstanding citizens.

   I'm actually quite fond of Jerry Pournelle's stories set in the CoDominion.
Faulkenberg is a great character, as are most of his men.

Why should we even consider Social Safety Nets?

  Well, one reason would be to maximize production of our society.  If you say
that every person represents a substantial initial investment of resources, it
might be worthwhile to prevent people from sinking so low economically that it
becomes near impossible to recover and become self sufficient again.

   One reason against Social Safety Nets would be causing a drain on
productivity.  If the people who sink low enough economically to trigger a
Social Safety Net are then satisfied to live at that level, they will never
become self sufficient again, and be a drain on those who are.

   To me, it seems the best course would be to find the middle ground between
these two phenomena.  I would suggest that a Social Safety Net be set high
enough so most people would be able to recover, but low enough that most
people would be motivated to recover.  I suppose what I am really suggesting
is a Social Safety Trampoline (one that propels you back to prosperity when
you hit it).  No one level will work for everyone, as some will have a very
low tolerance for poverty, and others a very high tolerance for poverty.  What
we want to do is set it so the (super?) majority are motivated to return to
self sufficiency.  I'm not sure what level this is, exactly, and it would be
helpful to figure this out before setting the system to work.  Also, I think
it could be slowly raised over a long time, as people will gradually come to
associate higher and higher incomes with insufficient amount of income in
comparison to those they have contact with.  If eventually the level where you
are barely self sufficient becomes intolerable to the vast majority, then the
safety net would no longer need to rise, and as an act of mercy those few who
are still satisfied to remain below that level could be funded as they would
be a negligible drain on the economy.

   Now, the whole underpinning of the idea of the Social Safety Net is the
concept that it is better to live in a society where everyone is able to have
their basic needs provided (preferably by themselves), then to live in a
society where there are those who do not have those needs provided for,
regardless of your own prosperity.  If you disagree with this proposition,
then there is no need for a Social Safety Net (or even a trampoline).

Mike,

   Some interesting ideas you've brought up here....

Balkanization - I agree that some level of having people be able to opt for
competing service providers and societies could exist in the same geographical
region.  This shifts the majority of functions of big government to small
and/or distributed government, which I think might be quite useful.  However,
there would still be a need to have some overall social
system/organization/government to deal with interactions between these quasi-
governments and between those who subscribe to different systems.  It would
not have to be a huge government, but it would have to be effective, otherwise
you would likely end up with the usual situation in a Balkanized area, The
Balkans Wars.

Ballot option for neither?  Okay, but what then do you do if neither wins?
Not that this is an unsurmountable problem, I'm just interested as to which
solution/solutions you would suggest.

Uploads with unique encryption keys?  This would provide an artificial
difference where one may not (initially) exist.  And while I agree that they
are separate individuals at the first aware movement, they are still likely to
think a heck of a lot alike on broad issues for a long time to come.  In fact,
the one big political difference that I see might develop between copies and
originals in using this system could be voting rights for copies.  And what do
you do with destructive uploading?  If only one upload is made, with all the
same memories, experiences, and opinions as the original, does this person
lose voting rights until they have established their residency post-upload?
If you do say they get to keep pre-upload voting rights, then how is this
equitable to uploads from non destructive techniques.  And what of creation of
multiple uploads at the same instant from a destructive upload?  I'm not
saying that you're wrong in your approach....honestly I don't know what the
best way to answer these questions are yet, and I'm trying to work my way
through it.  In that respect, your comments on the issue are really helpful,
and I thank you for them.

I agree that division into multiple copies solely for the purpose of voting
amounts to voter fraud, but the sticky part is figuring out if the division
occurred for that purpose.  This is where the residency requirement will be
most useful, since the longer you have to have existed in that area, the less
likely someone did it just to influence a vote.  I suppose my main concern is
that people do not lose their vote simply because for unrelated reasons it is
best for them to divide (or just upload) near the time of a vote.  Maybe the
best way to deal with this would be to combine the residency restriction with
the following rule: Anyone multiplying their mind after the residency deadline
still gets one vote, but who gets to vote in that election must be determined
before the actual multiplication (If only a single mind will exist as in a
destructive upload, then that entity gets the vote by default).  For example,
let's say that I won a free non-destructive upload in a promotional campaign,
but it is only good for a month and there is an important vote coming up in a
month and a half.  I am still trying to make up my mind on some of the issues.
What I might decide to do is cede my vote to my upload for this election,
since he'll be able to process this stuff a lot faster than me, and I trust
his inherited judgement.  Or I could decide to keep it myself if I feel that
my upload might develop an opinion that I would not support, given the
difference in perspective.  But there would only be one vote, and the
premultiplication person (who definitely would have qualified to vote) can
basically decide what to do with their proxy.

Borganisms with one vote....I suppose it depends on how closely integrated the
Borganism is.  I can envision a whole spectrum of Borganization.  What if the
Borganism is capable of having more than one opinion?  It might have sixty
percent of itself that leans toward one approach, and forty percent that lean
toward another.  Do those members of the Borganism lose their voices?  

Of course, you could also make the argument that we are all, in a sense,
Borganisms with the various sections of our brain working both independently
(subconsciously) and interlinked (consciously), and even consciously I can be
of two minds on a subject.  Often I would like to be able to instead of making
an all or nothing choice on various candidates, be able to rank them as to
their various desirability.  That way if part of me likes one candidate, but
most of me likes another, I can throw proportionate support to both, and then
it will depend on how many other people's parts agree with my various parts.
Of course, I can envision doing this right now since we can roughly quantify
every single voter as making up 100% of a Borganism, and each voter having
aproximately the same amount of processors in their Borganism, therefore we
can simply have each voter weigh the various choices with a percentage, with
all percentages equally 100% for that voter.  Actually, I believe that this
suggestion is akin to your suggestion that people be able to weigh their votes
depending how passionately they feel on the subject if we throw in those other
choices of either or neither.  Example:  Well, I think this position is right,
but I'm don't feel strongly about it, so I'll give position 1 50%, position 2
0%, the either choice 50%, the neither choice 0%, and 0% for my write-in
choice as I really don't have any alternatives to suggest at this time.  This
way I throw some support to position 1, but I help ensure that the issue is
settled on this ballot, no matter what the outcome.  Not sure that I would
vote this way, but some people might on an issue.  Also, we could say that
people get a certain amount of weighing that they can attach to their votes
each year, but that it is finite.  For example, say you get an extra 100
percentage point pool that can be added to any vote in any percentage, but
once used up it is gone until you get more the next year.  These points could
disappear if they are not used year by year, or they could be accumulated
(although I can see this accumulation leading to an advantage for one issue
special interests as they could save up points to use only on the issue they
care about).  I guess the real question should be, how do you calculate how
many points a Borganism should have?

Also, since a Borganism could conceivably make up a large proportion of your
society's cognitive resources, if we go on the theory that voting is the best
way to make decisions because it brings a large amount of parallel processing
to the problem being voted on, then wouldn't you be weighing the contribution
of the Borganism (which would likely be massively parallel, just better
interconnected) way too little?  And as far as effect goes, if a Borganism in
your voting district comprises most of the population (for example, those
twelve thousand people who merged into our Borganism are still semi-
autonomous, and distinct physically), then wouldn't the Borganism be
disproportionately effected by any ballot initiative?  Say that ninety percent
of the population are linked in the Borganism, but it only has one vote.  The
Borganism votes for one candidate, but fifty-one percent of the remaining ten
percent of the population votes for the other candidate.  Now this Borganism
is (or should I say, members of the Borganism are) being represented by
someone that only about five percent of the bodies in the district supported. 

The problem with Borganisms having more than one vote is that since they have
a certain unity of experience and outlook, errors in the Borganism's
assumptions and approach would tend to propagate throughout the Borganism.  So
in the end, though it would have more parallel processing power, it would be
processing in the end fairly homogenized information, which might dilute the
utility of its processing.  Again, a LOT of what a Borganism is going to
depend on how it is structured, and at what level perception and processing
are integrated and to what degree.

Funding mandates, I like this concept....in fact, go check out my post on Flat
Taxes and check out the section on Philanthropic expenditures.  I suppose we
could extend the concept to include Infrastructure expenditures as well.  I
guess my question on the idea of a lottery would be why have a random element.
Why not simply say we have the following options which take equivelent funds,
you can vote with your funds for which one you want, with a direct
contribution to vote ratio.  As soon as the vote reaches the amount needed to
fund one of these options, the one which received the most money gets it all.
You could set this up as a cascade, so that the losing propositions could then
be paired against each other and have the process continue until either no one
is willing to pay for any of them or they all get paid.  Of course, this in no
way guarantees that smart decisions will be made, only ones that people are
willing to pay for.  But ain't that always the case?

My mother, once prolific, has not written a word since she quit
smoking.  It is a well know anecdote among writers, that if you quit
smoking, you are out of work.  Sadly, it appears to be some kind of
mental block, probably based on brain recptors.  Similarly, I believe
that there were some jazz players who couldn't improvise without a
cigarette in the mouth.

Does anyone know something more about this problem?  Is it a promising
area of research?  Is there any way for me to help my mother, who has
now been blocked for years, even though she hasn't touched tobacco again
over that time?  I feel that she just needs proper assistance in order
to regain her gift.

Regards,
proclus

I write poetry, and I am a smoker. However, I wrote previously to my 
addiction. I understand the ritual of oral fixation, but a talent is 
within. Your mother should release herself from the restraints of 
considering her gift interlocked with smoking. I'm sure she is talented 
with or without a smoke. Support her in this, let her know that she can 
write, because it comes from within, not from the crutch of a bad habit.

Does anyone on the list have any personal experience with use of Human Growth
Hormone?  I'm told that this is available only by prescription (is this
true?), but I see products which claim to be HGH "secretagogues", i.e that
promote secretion of HGH by the body's own mechanisms.  For instance:

       <A HREF="http://www.vespro.com/prod/prod-ghs-index.html">VesPro Life
Sciences, LLC - Quality Products - VesPro GHS Product Info</A>
       http://www.vespro.com/prod/prod-ghs-index.html

Is there any solid science behind the claims made by the promoters of these
products?

I would appreciate any info on this, as my metabolism seems to have undergone
yet another damned slow-down, with increased sarcopenia, etc. (nothing
radical, just the blasted aging process . . .) . . . and I can't help but be
intrigued by the claims I've seen that HGH causes regrowth of hair . . .
(scratching my increasingly bald pate).

I'm betting you've already seen this but the Life Extension Foundation
provides a number of readings on this topic at the bottom of

http://lef.org/cgi-local/shop.pl/page=june-cover97.html

Here's an excerpt from that page:
***************************************
"Two secretagogues are now well into clinical trials in this country. The
first one developed, GHRP 6, is a growth hormone-releasing peptide being
tested by Wyeth-Ayerst. It has now been tested and is remarkably free of
side effects, according to its developer, Cyril Bowers, Ph.D., of Tulane
Medical School in New Orleans.

The second compound, MK0577, developed by scientists at Merck, does not have
a typical peptide structure and is more easily absorbable by the body than
growth hormone-releasing peptides such as GHRP 6. The latest clinical trials
in men and women aged 64 to 81 showed that as little as 25 mg of the drug
taken once a day for two weeks raised the levels of IGF-1 from an average of
141 to 219, with the highest levels reaching a youthful 251. And it appears
to be well-tolerated by elderly people. If any of these compounds are
approved by the FDA, and considering the impact that growth hormone has been
shown to have on almost every system of the body, aging as we know it may
soon be a thing of the past."
*****************************************

And the price of $18.71 (member price) for a 30 day supply compared to
VesPro's $90.00 price tag.

Sounds like it's worth a try to me.  Let's take some before and after
pictures!

Greg what is damned about a slow down in metabolism?  Seems to me this
would translate directly into proportionally longer life.  Is not that the point
of calorie restriction, to slow the metabolism, and thus aging?  spike

Perhaps I used the wrong term when I said metabolic "slow-down".  I mean the
general condition of aging, i.e. loss of muscle mass and slower muscle-
building metabolism, more fat, less hair, less energy, etc.  In other words,
the general "middle aged" syndrome that, among other things, causes men to buy
"relaxed fit" blue jeans and red Corvettes.

I would recommend that your mother tries nicotine chewing gum. In 
contrast to the "suicide pins", chewing gum is extremely safe while 
having a similar neurological effect.

There is some evidence that nicotine improves performance on complex 
cognitive tasks (also in non-smokers). I decided to give the chewing 
gum a try a few months back. Judging from the pharmacist's reaction 
it is somewhat unusual that people who have never smoked a 
cigarette buy this product. I use 2mg gums, seldom more than two per 
day, and I have not noticed any addiction. I think it has some 
nootropic effects: it seems to make it somewhat easier to concentrate 
and to get into "the flow". The first few times, the actual chewing 
created a distraction that approximately cancelled this effect, but 
as the chewing becomes habitual this distraction disappears.

Anybody else who has experimented with nicotine as a smart drug?

is very effective, seems to raise acetylcholine levels and promote new
neural connections and updates old ones too.(old memories-- things you
hadn't thought of in a while come into your awareness again. DMAE works
better if about 2 to 4 hours before taking it you ingest a few hundred
milligrams of pantothenic acid. that gives the B vitamin a chance to
saturate the brain and also clear the stomach. The reaction of DMAE and
pantothenic acid produces the acetylcholine and you don't want that to
happen in your stomach. CrampCity!  There are some side effects---increased
muscle tone-stiff neck; headache, the effects tend to only occur to new
users and decrease on regular use. At least in my experience.

Hello,

I've been lurking on the list for some time, but  when I saw the post 
below
I decided it was time to speak up.

About 3 years ago, I started a program of meditation, yoga and diet 
modification
(very low fat, semi-vegan).  Aside from all the benfits you would expect 
from
such life style changes, I notice that my body temperature has fallen 
from the
normal 98.6 to  around 97.5 (it varies).  What I am curious about is 
whether
anyone else on the list has had this happen to them.

Thanx,

Feynman wrote a few himself, including several not-science books, which included
advice on picking up girls who will sleep with you, his preference for strip
clubs to do his studying, and a course on picking locks and cracking safes...

If neither wins, then you hold a new election, disqualifying the losers of the
previous. Or you could say "If neither was picked, then obviously nobody cares
enough that the job gets done, so we'll leave the position open."

I think that there should be only one vote allowed until the new copies either
establish a regonized maturity point (I doubt that an upload will be fully
concious and capable for a period afterward. They need to learn to use new
interfaces, etc.) or a residency status. If I make a dozen copies of myself, I
will have to pay for the cost of those duplications however they are done, as well
as maintenance and training fees to bring the new copies up to speed, until they
gain residency. This is all assuming, of course, that there is in fact a
government around at this point in time, in which case the government can treat
any copies more than one as voter fraud, or limit the number of copies you can
make to one a year or so....and put a nice long residency period on uploaded
personalities. Apply some child labor laws on them, so you can't use them to make
money with, etc. Making it nice and expensive will help reduce the problem. This
might not dissuade the superrich or even the merely wealthy, but it will put a
nice choke on high reproduction of uploads of lesser performers and lower
intelligences. This might sound elitist, so what I am in my own way elitist, but
I'm an equal opportunity elitist.

Well, a coporatation is sort of a loose borganism (though only for 8 hours of a
person's day). The employees and stockholders each have a vote in the surrounding
society, but the corporation has none. A labor union is, conversly, a tighter
borganism, but only with respect to the company, and with respect to the union
financially supporting politicians it likes. In neither case do these two
borganisms have votes in the surrounding society.

I doubt that a true networked and aware borganism would tolerate independent
opinions or even personalities for its members, and I expect that given an initial
number of members, it will take some time for the borganism to become self aware
with members linked up, and if members are separated from the group, it will take
them some time to reassert their personalities, so I doubt that you will see a
borganism divest its membership specifically for an election. In this case, a
borganism gets one vote.

Parts of my body cannot exist without the others as self aware units. While there
might be a case for giving a vote to either hemisphere of your brain, its quite
risky and unnatural to separate them purely for political reasons, even assuming
that they would vote the same way.

While it is seen as good to be able to understand and sympathize with two opposing
points of view, in the final analysis, there really is only one objective truth.
Continuing to sympathize with and support a side which opposes and refuses to
acknowledge an objective thruth when one knows better, just because of 'feelings'
is not the mark of an intelligent and rational person.

Members of a borganism were originally self aware, intelligent,  independent
organisms.

No. Allowing a broganism to carry excessive weight in a vote will excessively
repress the rights of representation of the unassimilated individuals. Say a
society says "Ok, borganisms are ok and can exist, but can only assimilate members
that freely choose to join." The next year Borgansim Aleph has 51% of the members
of a society, and the borganism brings up a ballot measure that forces all
remaining members to join the borganism. It obviously has a majority control, but
this is more indicative that the borganism has effectively balkanized itself from
the others, so the others should be free to have their own government free of the
borganism's influence. In the end, I think that borganisms should be treated as
balkanized peoples, citizens of their own little voluntary tyranny.

You are assuming that the members of the borganism still have independent
personalities. They do not, so they have no individual rights, other than the
right to be liberated from the borganism if they so choose.

I forgot to include my motivator. Using it as a lottery, you could say that x
percent of the funds issued are prize money to the winning ticket. Since
government only produces 57 cents on the dollar, you could say that such ballot
lotteries could offer up to, say, 40% of the funds raised as a lottery prize. Of
course you could place the percentage at a lower level, but the point is to keep
the lottery mechanism functioning as a more efficient means of raising funds for
community projects than using a big government bureaucracy, while motivating
people to participate.

Yes. My body temparature has been around 96.5 for the past 10-11 years. I
don't meditate, but I do have a low-fat, low-calorie diet and work out every
day, weight training and aerobics.

Yes, by the time of King David's Spaceship, the Empire of Man has been through at
least one Fall, and moves into a colonialist state, but I think that Sparta is a
good example of an optimised constitutional republic (even though the head of
state is a 'King' it is a position elected for life). The merit system for
citizenship is an excellent means for maintaining a high standard of individual
integrity.

Yes, and the addiction potential seems lower due to the slower
onset. Overall, it is sad that our most common and successful
nootropic is usually taken in a form that has so many big health
drawbacks as smoking.

I have collected a number of papers (see below) about it, and there
are good evidence that nicotine has effects on attention and likely
indirectly on memory. Non-smokers may need to adapt a bit before they
get the benefits, nicotine unfortunately causes nausea and other
physiological reactions at first.

As for the creativity effects, it might be more due to stopping than
the nicotine itself. The mother of a friend reported similar problems
as Proclus' mother when she stopped smoking, a big creative block. My
guess is that the disruption of attention and other cholinergic
systems caused by stopping interfered with the creative process on a
fairly deep level.

important aspects of cognitive function including attention, learning
and memory. Nicotinic cholinergic receptors are located in many
regions of the brain, including areas important for cognitive function
such as the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Nicotinic agonists have
been found in rodent and non-human primate studies to improve
performance on a variety of memory tasks. In a complementary fashion,
nicotinic antagonists such as mecamylamine impair working memory
function. In humans, similar effects have been seen. Nicotinic agonist
treatment can improve attention, learning and memory and nicotinic
antagonist treatment can cause deficits. To define the neural
substrates of nicotinic involvement in cognitive function, three areas
of investigation are underway. 1) Critical neuroanatomic loci for
nicotinic effects are beginning to be determined. The hippocampus,
frontal cortex and midbrain dopaminergic nuclei have been found to be
important sites of action for nicotinic involvement in memory
function. 2) Nicotinic receptor subtype involvement in cognitive
function is being studied. There has been considerable recent work
identifying nicotinic receptor subunit conformation including alpha
and beta subunits. Nicotinic receptor subtypes appear to be associated
with different functional systems; however, much remains to be done to
determine the precise role each subtype plays in terms of cognitive
function. 3) Nicotinic interactions with other transmitter systems are
being assessed. Nicotine receptors interact in important ways with
other systems to affect cognitive functioning, including muscarinic
ACh, dopamine, norepinepherine, serotonin, glutamate, and other
systems. Nicotinic function in clinical populations and potential for
therapeutics has been investigated for Alzheimer's disease,
Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and attention deficit/hyperactivity
disorder. Areas which need to receive greater attention are the exact
anatomical location and the specific receptor subtypes critically
involved in nicotine's effects. In addition, more work needs to be
done to develop and determine the efficacy and safety of novel
nicotinic ligands for use in the long-term treatment of human
cognitive disorders.}  }

decreased the number of errors of omission without causing increases
in either errors of commission or correct hit reaction time. Nicotine
also significantly decreased the variance of hit reaction time and the

I didn't get the impression that anyone was talking diamondoid drextech,
so there's no reason why they *should* credit him.  There's no reason
why they should invoke Feynman, either, but he's a Name.

Feynman was a Nobel-prize-winning physicist, as well as an excellent
explainer, and scientists tend to be very fond of him.  It's not that
Drexler is being left out in the cold, I think, but that only *we* would
suggest that he was equal to Feynman - I happen to think so, but only
because of the part he played in hypertext and thus the creation of the Web.

I think considerably more emphasis is placed on the issue of the 
potential technology rather than "the name" of the person. (ie Drexler 
or Feynman) The controversy is one on the solidity of the approach of 
nanotechnology. I myself have reached what Ed Regis refers to as "Miller 
Point" and succumb to the understanding that this is attainable. Because

I think considerably more emphasis is placed on the issue of the 
potential technology rather than "the name" of the person. (ie Drexler 
or Feynman) The controversy is one on the solidity of the approach of 
nanotechnology. I myself have reached what Ed Regis refers to as "Miller 
Point" and succumb to the understanding that this is attainable. Because 
nanotechnology covers such a wide variety of disciplines, also fuels a 
lot of speculation. I think Drexler is a remarkable man, and I support 
Foresight, where I am a senior associate.

The February 11, 1999 issue of the _Federal Technology Report_ had a piece
by Neil MacDonald titled "Nanotechnology May Be Target for New Federal
Research Push".  Evidently, federal r&d officials are discussing the
possibility of organizing a national nanotechnology research iniative,
similar to the Information Technology Initiative for the 21st Century (IT2)
that was announced last month by Al Gore.  IT2 has some fiscal reality to it
since it was included in the 2000 federal budget request submitted by
Clinton this year.

Nanotechnology and nanoscience in general seems to be reaching a new level
of visibility within the federal r&d environment.  In January of this year,
the NSF held a "Vision for Nanotechnology R&D in the Next Decade" workshop.
It was revealed at that workshop that the DOE, NIH, NSF and NASA are
considering coordinated nanotechnology research initiatives.

Any nanotechnology research initiative wouldn't be included in the 2000
budget may have a realistic chance of making it into the 2001 budget.
Thomas Kalil, a senior director for economic policy at the White House
Economic Council issued, in MacDonald's words, a "clarion call" for a
nationa nanotechnology research initiative.  If Al Gore becomes President we
should be virtually assured of having a nanotechnology research iniative by
2002 at the latest.  Gore, as Senator, held the first congressional hearings
on nanotechnology in 1992.

Mike,

   I suppose it is possible that uploads would have an initial period of
adjustment, but I suspect that once the technology is mature, this would not
be a long period (just think how subjective time would be for the upload).
Also, I think for either uploads and/or duplicates the situation is not
amenable to child labor laws or anything similar.  These "new" beings would
have the same initial experiences and personality of the original, and thus
would not be some "babe in the woods".  As far as means to lower the rate of
upload production, especially in those of "lesser" performance and "lower"
intelligence - I wonder what criteria you would use to determine who falls in
which category, and who will judge....I note that you say make it expensive,
which I suppose would limit it based on finances, if not necessarily financial
success (some people, after all, got rich the old-fashioned way; they
inherited it).  But if this barrier were an artificially high one, there is
still the matter of what level to set the bar.  Personally, I'd say let
whoever can afford to do it (based on the market) with the desire to do so
copy themselves.  Time will tell who the "elite" are.

   I suspect from our discussion about voting and borganisms that you might be
of the opinion that there is some definite breakpoint in the development of
borganisms, where the borganism becomes rapidly unitary in outlook.  If this
is not so, I appologize for my misapprehension.  But going on that theory, I
would guess that those existing in a quasi-borganism would count as
individuals, while those who are encompassed in a full borganism would be
counted as one.  If the division between the two turns out to be crisp, then
this would, I believe, be a valid vote allocation.  However, I am not sure
that there will be such a clear dividing line between borganism and non-
borganism, in which case I see the issue becoming complex. 

    As for the scenario where the Borganism is granted a vote for each member,
then gains a majority and imposes borganization on the individuals still in
the community, why not the opposite?  The borganism is allowed to have people
join if they do so of their own free will, but then everyone in the borganism
only have one vote between them.  Perhaps if the borganism is successful in
growing, there is a conservative backlash amonst the individuals sharing the
community.  They vote to have the borganism forcibly disassembled, its
networking severed.  Since you have assigned the borganism one vote, it can
easily be voted down on any issue.  What is to stop either scenario?  First,
constitutional safeguards for the rights of citizens, regardless of the will
of the majority.  Second, understanding amongst all citizens, borganism or
individual, that if you take away your neighbor's rights today, it may be your
rights which are stripped tomorrow.  You might argue that the borganism would
no longer have neighbors if it force assimilates everyone, but this would only
be if it succeeded in doing so literally, as in the entire world (or known
civilizations).  I suspect before it got that far someone would start fighting
back, and if the borganism can successfully assimilate everyone against their
will, then likely they wouldn't have needed to vote in the first place.  

   In regard to opposing viewpoints and subjective vs objective truth - First,
sometimes your voting issues involve more than two options.  For example,
there could be several candidates running for the same position, among whom
you might feel two or three could do adequate jobs, but less so the rest.  You
may want to give support to two candidates, and be happy if either wins.  In
regards to the truth, I believe that for every specific situation there is one
objective truth, but I am not usually chosing between an objective truth and
subjective truth; usually it is between two or more subjective truths, I only
have a rough indication of what the objective truth might be, and I have to
try to figure out which of the possible subjective truths might be the closest
fit to the objective truth.  In this case, more than one viewpoint might have
elements reflective of what I believe to be the objective truth, and thus both
might have partial validity, though in differing fashions.  Also, in regard to
sympathizing with and supporting a side, whether it acknowledges what I
consider the objective truth may not be as terrible as it first appears, if
you believe there is something of value in that side, you may want to support
and foster it, while at the same time suggesting that there are some flaws in
that side's position.  As for doing this based solely on a "feeling", I
suppose it depends on what type of feeling we're talking about....is this an
intuition, an emotion, a guess?  I personally pay very close attention to my
"feelings", all the different types of them.  Often, they are indicating
things that my conscious mind has missed, or not yet considered.  Usually,
though, I do not allow them to rule my decisions, but instead explore why I
have these feelings using my logical faculties.  However, sometimes there is
no time for rational contemplation, and you have to make a split second
decision.  In these cases, I occasionally do act on my "feelings" especially
if I'm not getting any good choices from my rational side.  Luckily, I rarely
have to make split second decisions on voting issues<g>.

   As for the lottery incentive, I concede that it might indeed help prime the
pump of voluntary funding....but then why even have it be one item vs another,
why not hold separate lotteries for them all, with the winner in each getting
a percentage.  Hey, play all the funding lotteries, and increase your chances
of winning....if you don't play, you can't win<G>.

It seems to me that if we must have taxes then a national sales tax would be
best.

The problem with any tax is that they must be constitutional. A national sales
tax would only apply to goods produced in one state and shipped to another.
Imposing this sort of tax will develop barriers to trade that will protect those
producers who are vertically consolidated within a single state, since their
products will not be nationally taxable (the national tax can only fall on goods
sold that are regulated by the interstate commerce clause of the constitution).

We are seeing a local version of this problem right  now in NH. A closet liberal
judge appointed to the state supreme court ruled that the present system of
funding education in this state is unconstitutional. Why? Well, our state
constitution does NOT mandate that everyone receive an education, much less an
equal education. What the constitution does say is that taxes imposed by the
state government must be apportioned equally upon all towns and residents. This
judge ruled that the town imposed property taxes that the towns use to fund
education are in fact a statewide tax, not a local tax, and so they must be
even. Turns out the towns which have been controlled by democrats for decades
are now so economically distressed by discouraging business that the gross value
of the property in their towns is too low to raise sufficient funds for
education, so the people remaining there have very high tax rates on their
depressed properties, and now want the state (i.e. the rest of us) to pay for
their stupidity.

That seems to be the bugaboo, though. It will certainly be expensive at first, so
those that can afford it will do it, and will reap the economic rewards of being
uploaded. The money an uploaded personality earns can be given by the personality
to its flesh relatives, friends, and others deemed 'worthy', so that they can
afford to upload. Thus, the current elite will be the new elite. There will be
those in lower classes who will pool resources, like main asian immigrant families
do with start up businesses here in the US (you get one to several dozen
interrelated families all pooling money to start a business for one couple, who
are deemed the brightest business people, who in turn employ relatives, and feed
money back to the families so that others in the family can start businesses).
However lower class groups which do not have strong extended family structures
will not see this sort of phenomenon. You may see the rare crime lord who jacks
up, but that will be about it unless some of the elites found some sort of
non-profit upload organization.

I think that there definitely is a break point. Once a borganism actually creates
a self aware corporate intelligence (not something which will happen over a single
shift of work, mind you), it will require that all of its members remain connected
to the network and subservient to the borg personality in order to maintain that
personality. Members will not be able to be independent personalities for 8-12
hours a day while away from work at the corporate borganism. Even if it is
possible to swap out  individual members on a shift by shift basis, a borganism
which keeps 100 members in constant link will operate more efficiently than one
which employs 300 but only operates on 100 at a time, so full time borgs will
succeed in the competetive evolution of borganisms over part timers.

Of course, if a borg personality is not dependent on the specific members, if it
can swap one out for another quite easily, then you may find borgs coexisting
quite well as a sort of paramilitary type commitment, where the borg will keep you
in constant operation for a year, but will pay you twice the pay rate that a mere
40 hour a week member makes. After the year, your hitch is up and you walk away
with a nice chunk of cash to go start your own independent operation.

This is all economic speculation. I still say that when a person's personality has
been totally subsumed by the borganism's personality, that person no longer has an
independent vote, any more than a slave had one prior to the civil war. They may
regain it if their indenturement has a set expiration date.

If a borganism, or if the total number of bodies controlled by borganisms exceeds
the number needed for a supermajority to enact amendments to the constitution,
then you have a problem. You also have a problem if in addition to the current
number of bodies under control, you also include all those who have had prior
service with a borg, who may have been memetically programmed by the borg to
prefer or sympatize with borg voting positions.

A good bit of fiction to read over regarding this sort of scenario is the novel
Kaleidoscope Century, specifically the parts about the Meme Wars, and how in the
end, one Meme, Resuna, controlls the entire earth population as a single
borganism.

Yes, some people who see the middle of the road as an objective point might take
it that way. Since I see objective political truth to start at one end of the
scale, not in the middle, I am not hobbled by such uncertainty. I say the
objective truth is Unlimited Individual Freedom.  Everything anyone can do either
approaches or retreats from that goal. Now, you do have a point that Democrats
tend to be pro freedom socially, while Republicans tend to be pro freedom
economically, so you need to decide which axis needs your  suppport more at a
given moment, provided of course that you don't have the option of voting for a
libertarian candidate in your district.

I have found that my feelings tend to be ruled more by the memes that infect me,
than anything else, except maybe positions which I have long since personally
analysed to excess and am pretty positive about my knowing the objective truth (or
have gotten as close to the objective truth as I can get). Such positions that I
am rather sure about I will defend (as most people here can attest), and I will
occasionally get rather excessively annoyed with what I perceive to be excessive
stupidity on the part of others. You could say that these positions I have taken
as my own are rather deep memes themselves. you may be right, but they are ones
which I have freely chosen. The remainder that I am still infected with that may
conflict with my deeply held positions I tend to slowly root out over time.

Yeah, that is true. Being able to vary the payback incentive levels will create a
market for what 'government' type programs people really want to support. The ones
that people will want to support anyways will be able to afford lower payoff
percentages, while the less popular ones will need higher ones to attract the
capital. Those programs that cannot attract funding even at a 40% payoff level
will not be funded fully or the program directors for those lotteries must make do
with the funds they can raise.

This was once a fine quote, which has forever been tainted, sullied and spoiled by its discovery on the t-shirt of the "Turner Diaries" loving Timothy McVeigh when he was apprehended fleeing the scene of his Oklahoma City bombing, much as a fine archaic sun symbol, the swasticka, has been stained beyond recovery with the blood of six million Jews killed under its banner by Hitler's Reich.

At least with a sales tax, we all know what we must pay, and we know that
everyone pays the same rate on what they buy at the retail cash register.

Personally I prefer the fourth option: if government inevitably grows into
a hideous monstrosity, then government is by nature bad and we should get
rid of it. And given the kind of power than the technologies we discuss on
this list would give to individuals, I have a hard time understanding why
anyone would even consider that government will be a possibility for much
longer. Even today, a small group of irate tax-payers could wipe out most
of DC for a few million dollars; in a couple of decades, an individual 
should be able to do it as a project for a boring winter's evening.

I don't see why anyone would need a glossary to understand the Constitution;
it seems to have been written in simple terms that anyone could understand,
so that any jury could easily tell whether a law was unconstitutional and
acquit if it was. The problem is not the wording, it's that generations of
lawyers have convinced people that it's a much more complicated document than
it really is, and that phrases like 'shall not be infringed' don't really,
actually mean that.

    Does anyone know of a study on the psychographics and demographics
of people who are open to the concept of an open-ended life span?

    How about those with a strong interest in life extension (just
adding some more quality years)?

    Is there a proven correlation between productivity/achievement and
an interest in longevity?

Never say die,

Tim McVeighs crime was NOT that he bombed the building. Any government building is a legitimate military target for a dissident insurgency group under the Laws of War. What was his crime was in setting the bomb off when he KNEW there were people in the building who are classified by the Red Cross, the Laws of War, and by the UCMJ as non-combatants, i.e. the children in the day care center and
the civilians using the government services in the building. In this context, what he did was a war crime that was not very much worse than the US Marine pilot who sliced through the cable for that gondola in Italy. The pilot had a jury biased in his favor and the backing of the government who wanted an acquittal, while Tim McVeigh had a judge who refused the defense to call witnesses which
would expose the government's complicity in staging the event.

McVeigh was overwrought by the slaughter of the Koresh families by the government (for which nobody has yet been convicted, not to mention being sentenced to death), and wanted to exact eye for an eye revenge. McVeigh was a reserve NCO in the army at the time. An NCO's authority to act and give orders is only delegated to him by his commanding officer. Only a commissioned officer (or the
congress that commissions the officer) has the authority to determine what is an enemy of the Constitution, 'foreign or domesitic', and McVeigh knew this.

If he in fact did have a superior in the conspiracy as he claims, who he met with at the Elohim City site (as verified by the government's own witnesses), it seems as though his superior is a West German intelligence agent who works for the FBI, according to what independent invetigators (including some in the media) have concluded. This agent matches the description and sketch of the famous
John Doe #2 that the government now claims is erroneous and non-existent.

Rather than condemning individuals who thought they were defending our nation, but who have been brought to justice, how about directing your ire at a government that commits such atrocities as the Ruby Ridge ambush/standoff, and the Koresh family massacre. Why has no government agent been demoted, fired or convicted for these acts? In fact, all agents involved in these acts have been
promoted and praised for their actions. Too bad Ian Goddard isn't focusing his energies on this situation. I think he'd find much more real evidence.

I'm open to suggestions for getting rid of government.  However, I do insist
that any such proposal actually have a good chance of resulting in a better
situation than what we would get with an intelligently designed limited
government.  Anarchist proposals are much more speculative than ideas for
constitutional reform, which makes their actual results much more difficult
to predict.  Consequently, it would only be worthwhile to take a chance on
such ideas if they seemed likely to give much better results.

Now, a limited constitutional republic can come fairly close to the
libertarian ideal of complete personal liberty.  If its powers are limited
to law enforcement, national defense and foreign policy, it can provide a
very high degree of freedom.  It must still resort to compulsory taxation,
but the actual tax burden can be quite small (maybe a few hundred dollars
per person per year, or even less in peaceful times).

A successful anarchist scheme would offer very similar results.  You would
pay voluntary fees for police protection instead of taxes, but you would
still have to pay.  You would have a larger choice of legal regimes, but the
kinds of laws we really care about wouldn't exist in either scheme.  In
principle you are somewhat more free, but in practice the difference in what
you can do is fairly modest.

Now let's look at the down side.  What would happen if our new society
doesn't work out as planned?

With the limited government, the results are pretty predictable.  The most
likely result is a long, gradual erosion of constitutional restraints.
After a few generations the level of freedom will have noticeably
deteriorated, and in a few hundred years you might get something like
modern-day America.

In contrast, the most likely failure mode of a controlled anarchy scheme is
simple, uncontrolled anarchy.  Those who have power take whatever they want
from those who don't, which results in a society with all the problems of
despotism and none of the advantages.  Power groups coalesce fairly quickly,
and fight it out for control of society.  The end result is very
unpredictable - you could get anything from a tolerant democracy to a
totalitarian regime, and you can get it in a matter of a few years.

So summarize: pure anarchy is a monster far worse than all but the most
oppressive of governments.  Any scheme of controlled anarchy is a stroll
along the edge of an abyss, with no past experience to guide our way.  If it
were the only path to freedom it might be worth the risk, but it isn't.  We
know how to achieve similar results with much less risk of disaster, and
much better prospect for long-term stability.

I agree that we have problems here, but getting rid of government does
nothing to solve them.  Besides, the situation isn't nearly as bad as you
seem to think (your irate group has to include some very rare specialists),
and it is not at all clear that the problem is getting worse (sensors are
improving much faster than destructive technologies, for example).

So you're saying that if a government doesn't want their enemy to attack
one of their strategic sites, they can just create a 'human shield' of
children and civilians, and the site will be off-limits in warfare? I
think not; that didn't deter British bombing of Dresden, American bombing
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or bombing of 'human-shielded' sites during the
Gulf War. If anyone committed a crime in that sense at Oklahoma City, it
was the Feds putting children in a building which was known to be a
target for numerous 'freedom fighters' day-dreaming of civil war.

Note that I'm not making any moral argument for or against McVeigh's
actions, merely arguing against this suggestion it was somehow much 
worse because he killed some kids. US government support for sanctions
against Iraq has killed many, many times as many children as McVeigh
did, yet there's no outcry against their actions.

I think April 1 ought to be a sacred holiday for rational minds--
a day devoted to honing the bullshit-detection skills that have
atrophied in too many people.  A day the press can shed its silly
pretense of objectivity and force the public to evaluate news
skeptically, as they should be doing every day anyway.  A day for
scientists to see what they can get away with publishing to
catch the unwary reader.  If you are distressed that you cannot
tell a legitimate announcement from a phony one, perhaps you
should complain not that papers publish in April, but that they
aren't giving enough information in the story for a skeptical
reader to properly evaluate it.

I'm not sure whether this is better or worse than Zyvex going it alone. 
On one hand, the US will be a heck of a lot less naive when somebody
finally wakes up and realizes they have the power to take over the
world.  On the other hand, Zyvex, faced with the actuality, might lose
the blinders.

I think, on the whole, I have to vote for the US on this one.  The
faster nanotech is developed (after it's found) and the longer it can be
kept secret, the less the chance of a nanowar between equals.

The primary problem is that official recognition increases the chance of
other countries jumping on the bandwagon, creating an arms race.

If I remember the Laws of Land Warfare correctly, to be considered a
legitimate insurgency and to be afforded the priveledges of a POW, there
must exist a well defined command structure, there must be at least
partial control of some territory, soldiers in combat must wear uniforms
or some other form of identification, and probably several other criteria

Hardly. David Friedman makes some very strong game theory arguments for
his anarcho-capitalist ideas producing a stable society thru negative
feedback, whereas any kind of government has positive feedback loops; if
the government takes more power it can more easily take power in future.

Uh, they do seem likely to give much better results. That's why many of
us here think they're a good idea; or did, since a lot of the anarchists
on the list seem to have dropped out in the last few months of statist
invasion.

For one or two generations, if that; then it's doomed because the system
contains the seeds of its own downfall.

Why would you have to pay? If you don't want police 'protection' you just
buy a gun or two and protect yourself. That's not an option in a government
system... and anyway, private protection will be a lot cheaper than 
compulsory tax-funded government 'protection'.

>You would have a larger choice of legal regimes, but the

Sorry? What? Huh? Where do you get that idea from?

>In contrast, the most likely failure mode of a controlled anarchy scheme 
>is simple, uncontrolled anarchy.

The whole point of anarcho-capitalism is that it doesn't have a 'likely
failure mode', because it has negative-feedback systems which begin to
act any time that the system starts to move from a stable state. This is
why I, as an engineer, like it.

>Those who have power take whatever they want

Only if you assume that a couple of hundred million well-armed anarchists
are just going to stand aside and hand over their money to a few thugs.

>The end result is very

Nonsense. Once an anarchist society gets into a stable state it is very
stable. The problem is getting from here to there, not staying there.

>So summarize: pure anarchy is a monster far worse than all but the most
>oppressive of governments. 

So name a few anarchists who've killed tens of millions of their own
people on a whim? I didn't think you could.

>Any scheme of controlled anarchy is a stroll

Oh, the horror! Life might be different to the way it is today! Gosh, I'm
so scared! Please Big Mummy, protect me from the evil anarchists and their
ungodly 'freedom'!

>I agree that we have problems here, but getting rid of government does

I'm not saying that getting rid of government would save DC; I'm saying 
that government cannot survive in a future with the kinds of technologies
we talk about, unless it becomes a Borganism with complete control over
ever member of that society. Otherwise it's doomed.

>Besides, the situation isn't nearly as bad as you

That is scientists, technicians and military weapons experts; the very 
people *most* likely to get pissed off by overbearing governments. McVeigh,
remember, is ex-military and was taught to blow things up by the US
government.

>(sensors are
>improving much faster than destructive technologies, for example).

'Mr President, sir, we've just detected a missile launch from Montana,
sensors say it's carrying a thermonuclear warhead. It'll be here in two
minutes.'

Yeah, those sensors are really going to help, I mean like at least you'll 
have time to kiss your ass goodbye before it gets vaporized. That'll be 
cool.

Argument-from-dictionary holds no water with rational people.  The
terms "rebel" and "terrorist" are logically equivalent; it is only
the emotional baggage they carry that distinguishes them.  Such
people should not be judged by their clothes, or by their success,
or by their choice of organization, but by the justice of their
cause and the rationality of their actions.

If McVeigh had broken into the office of the BATF official who
led the Waco raid and shot him, or planted a bomb in his desk, I
would be first in line to applaud him, regardless of whether he held
any territory or wore a uniform.  But to indiscriminately kill
people who had nothing to do with the raid, and in a way unlikely
to have any positive effect on the despotism he allegedly opposed,
makes his act a crime rather than legitimate defense.

Abstract: 
We report the detection of living colonies of nano-organisms (nanobes) on 
Triassic and Jurassic sandstones and other substrates. Nanobes have 
cellular structures that are strikingly similar in morphology to 
Actinomycetes and fungi (spores, filaments, and fruiting bodies) with the 
exception that they are up to 10 times smaller in diameter (20 nm to 1.0 mu

m). Nanobes are noncrystalline structures that are composed of C, O, and N.

Ultra thin sections of nanobes show the existence of an outer layer or 
membrane that may represent a cell wall. This outer layer surrounds an 
electron dense region interpreted to be the cytoplasm and a less electron 
dense central region that may represent a nuclear area. Nanobes show a 
positive reaction to three DNA stains, [4',6-diamidino-2 phenylindole 
(DAPI), Acridine Orange, and Feulgen], which strongly suggests that nanobes

contain DNA. Nanobes are communicable and grow in aerobic conditions at 
atmospheric pressure and ambient temperatures. While morphologically 
distinct, nanobes are in the same size range as the controversial fossil 
nannobacteria described by others in various rock types and in the Martian 
meteorite ALH84001.

Mr. Lorrey invoked the Laws of Land Warfare in his post.  I was merely
pointing out that his understanding of them was lacking.  I did not mean
to imply any sort of moral or ethical judgement, just a narrow legalism in
his chosen arguement.  Perhaps I should have put "legitimate insurgency"
in quotes.

Nevertheless, McVeigh deserves to hang.

Thanks for the welcome Anders. I am sorry for the delay in my reply but
I have been back and forth to hospitals since November trying to get an
operation for an injury to my right thigh. I have spent very little time
at home. My to be answered folder is bulging.

To answer your question I must say that I don't know. I have recently
moved here from Oslo (may last year). The reason being a desire for a
better environment. It has done wonders for me to be out here but I fell
down a slope one night and ruptured my quadriceps tendon totally. What
you gain on the roundabouts you lose on the swings.

I have often wondered if the mortality of man is not linked to his/her
desire for death. Some cultures speak of the death spot or the
equivalent. Self hate must play a role but how big a role?

I have been working on allowing myself to succeed to a greater degree
than I have before and it seems to work. Being separated from the stress
of being surrounded by many people has made a great change. Where I live
a car drives by twice a day. Once in the morning and once in the
evening. When I first came here I didn't think much about it. Now it
irritates me.

Just think of the irritation that I must have been suppressing when I
lived in the middle of Oslo where the tram rattled by every fifteen
minutes and there was heavy traffic outside my window from early in the
morning to late at night. When that was over the sound of drunk people
and fighting often echoed in the street below until the wee hours of the
morning. Can such an environment encourage a love of life?

The use of modern equipment in one's effort to stay healthy and live
long as well is a large subject. There is literally so much one can do.
One can spend all one's waking hours on getting healthy and end up with
no time for anything else. The need for a combination of a few genial
(is it apparatuses or apparati) that are not too time consuming makes
itself felt.

I have chosen the making and use of colloidal silver and the use of an
electromagnetic pulser and electrical blood cleaner to get rid of all
the micro nasties. These things can be used whilst one gets on with
daily chores. I have already begun with electrical blood cleaning and
colloidal silver. I'll be collecting the magnetic pulser this week. Does
any one have any comments on the use of these?

I am also considering the use of a little machine which makes ozone by
the use of some sort of cold process and stores it in water. This water
when ingested is supposed to free up the extra oxygen into ones blood
and have lots of lovely good effects. Amongst these is the clearing of
toxins from the body and increased awareness.

The apparatus is used in aquariums to keep fish healthy and help them
live long. It is not allowed for human use in some countries (I am told)
Has anyone tried this? I have tried a few glasses of the ozone water and
felt mildly light headed after drinking. I don't know if this
necessarily means that its effect is good. Has anyone experience here?

I found this at Amazon.co.uk.  Using the title, "A great biblical analogy
for Christ's existence in our world" a reader from Canada wrote, "Jesus'
time in our world could be compared to the flatland story. What he was able
to do in terms of miracles could be compared to what "A Sphere" was able to
do in flatland. It makes a great story and an excellent analogy for
understanding God and Christ for a mathematical mind."

I refer to anarcho-capitalist schemes as 'speculative' because nothing like
them has ever been tried before.  Game theory is not capable of predicting
the operation of an entire human society, and neither is any other existing
branch of science.  Work like David Friedman's can give us clues about what
kinds of institutions might or might not work, but the results can not be
considered definitive.  As an engineer, you should know that theory is no
substitute for experience.

As for failure modes, I think you need to consider the issue in more detail.
Anarcho-capitalism relies on complex market mechanisms to restrain the
initiation of the use of force by PPAs and other power groups.  If these
mechanisms fail, or if they turn out not to work in practice, there is
simply nothing left to back them up.

You might expect the existence of an armed populace to make a difference,
but it doesn't.  History has many, many examples of armed populations and
their behavior in the face of various degrees of anarchy.  The intelligent
thing for each individual to do in such a situation is to band together with
his neighbors for mutual defense.  The interaction of these local defense
groups rapidly results in the creation of many small, government-like
entities, which will mutate into real governments as soon as someone starts
shooting.

If you mean "better than modern-day America" then I certainly agree with
you.  But my point is that it is possible to accomplish almost all of the
same goals without needing to resort to such drastic measures.

And anarcho-capitalism will live forever?  For all we know, it leads
inevitably to some new form of despotism.  Now, you're certainly welcome to
give it a try if you like - for that matter, I'll even help you get it going
(I'm curious whether it could be made to work).  However, I don't see that
it can give me anything that makes the extra risk worthwhile.

This is the kind of naivet that gives anarcho-capitalism a bad name.  You
can't protect yourself.  If you aren't signed up with a PPA, you are a
legitimate target for anyone who finds it worthwhile to rob, kill and/or
enslave you.  If significant numbers of people choose this option, some
organization will soon develop to exploit their lack of protection.  Any
such group will quickly learn how to field trained, organized teams of
soldiers to do their dirty work, which means a lone man with a gun is
essentially helpless.

> Sorry? What? Huh? Where do you get that idea from?

>From my definitions - I'm comparing the ideal anarcho-capitalist society
with an ideal limited government.  An ideal limited government would have
laws against theft, fraud, assault, murder, and a few other such crimes,
plus tax evasion.  A typical PPA would have a similar code, minus the tax
evasion (but if you don't pay up, you loose your protection).  The anarchist
approach gives you some options on the details, but there is no reason for
the big picture to differ by much.

I'm not assuming, I'm quoting history.  The well-armed citizens *are* the
thugs.  On of the most perverse effects of simple anarchy is that it gives
everyone strong incentives to act like a criminal, and punishes those who do
not.

Despotism gives us one man who kills ten million people.  Anarchy gives us
ten million people who each kill one man.  Which do you think is worse?

If you are actually interested in a productive discussion, I suggest you
refrain from ad hominem attacks.  The fact that I do not believe your
methods will work does not imply that I disagree with your goals.

In fact, I would very much like to see a society without government of any
sort.  However, after considerable study of the subject, I have reluctantly
concluded that this goal probably cannot be achieved by gaussian humans.
Attempting to replace naked force with subtle market mechanisms is a far
more complex project than is commonly appreciated, especially in light of
the need for long-term stability.

Now, if you want to gamble with your own life, feel free.  But there are
tens of millions of people who want real freedom, but don't wish to join
you.  For their sake, and that of the billions who have not even come that
far, I think the taming of government is a worthwhile project.

If government is really doomed, and removing government doesn't solve the
problem, then all of society is doomed.

This is a complex topic that has nothing to do with the topic of the thread.
I suggest that we either take it to a different thread or let it die.

Suppose it turned out that for a private law based, anarchocapitalistic
society to work effectivelly, it was necessary for people who shared the
same legal system to live near each other.  Ideally we would want people
to be able to choose their legal system independent of where they live,
but suppose that this just doesn't turn out to be practical.  You can
still choose your legal system, but you have to move.

This is plausible especially if the main things that most people want to
be illegal represent physical acts; it is likely to be easier to limit
physical actions within a specified region than to try to do so on a
place-by-place basis in discontinuous households and business enclaves
spread around the world.  It is a matter of efficiency, and the conflict
between the idealized world we would like to live in, and the balky,
stubborn world of physical reality.

I don't think this would be a fundamental revision to the ideals of
anarchocapitalism.  Moving is a pain, but assuming that most people don't
change their legal system very often, the costs would not be too bad.
You would still have the essential element of choice of laws.

Imagine, in contrast, a miniarchy which allows people and regions to
peacably secede at will.  Governments of today seek territory above all
else, but if we suppose that minimal legal systems can be accepted,
then perhaps the principle of allowing people to secede will also be
acceptable.  Justice would arguably require allowing people to leave
and not forcing them to continue to live under the local laws.

Aren't these two systems the same?  What would be the difference between
a world of competing miniarchies and an anarchocapitalist world where
people's choice of law determines where they live?

It seems to me that these two approaches are fundamentally compatible,
and both represent a common vision for a world where people have much
more choice and flexibility in their laws than they have today.

What methods do states use to restrain the initiation of force by
the state, and what backs them up if those methods fail?  I can think
of only two such means: jury nullification and armed rebellion (I do
not include elections or recall, because they are more likely to
support the majority's use of violence than to restrain it).  Do you
think "complex market mechanisms" are less stable or in some other
way inferior to those methods?

While it is true that anarcho-capitalism is untried (I am not as
enamored of the Icelandic example as is Dr. Friedman), the methods
of the market itself are well-understood, well-tested, and wildly
successful.  The methods of statism are well-understood, well-
tested, and are universally miserable failures.

I don't think either of these two examples, jury nullification and
armed rebellion, have traditionally been used to restrain the initiation
of force.  Both of these approaches have often been used to further the
use of force by the majority against the minority.

Jury nullification was primarily used in the Old South to make sure that
white defendants were acquitted of crimes against blacks (lynchings,
beatings, robbery, etc.).  And of course the biggest armed rebellion
the U.S. has seen was its Civil War, which was largely motiviated by
the South's wish to continue to allow the whites to enslave the blacks.

well defined command structure:
as an insurgency, the last thing that would keep them viable were if their
command structure were publicly known. Just because it might not be publicly
known, or even completley known to the entire organization, does not mean
there is not one. The cell structure is a well recognized system of
structuring an insurgency organization.

control of territory:
this is not well defined. You could say that simply being able to elude
capture, thus denying the government's ability to police an area effectively,
is at least a measure of control. By your criteria, Thomas Paine was a common
criminal.
Considering how much the government likes to govern by poll results, you could
call areas where the government has a minority of local support as being under
the tentative 'control' of the insurgency.

Must wear uniforms:
I know of no insurgency organization which has ever had more than a small
fraction which actually wore what could be considered uniforms. Nor would any
of them wear such unifoms in public where they could easily be identified by
government agents.

If this were a real criteria, then movements like the PLO, NRA, ANC,
Sandinistas, Contras, Zapatistas, Mujahedin, Viet Cong, Chinese democracy
movements, as well as the American Revolutionaries would all be nothing but
common criminals.

Every movement starts out with nothing. Your criteria are merely the measure
of what an insurgency needs to accomplish to have hope of being successful.

What I find so remarkable, and indicative that the government had a hand in
it, was a) how handily McVeighs actions neatly castrated the burgeoning
militia movement, and
b) how easily he was caught, the license plate on his care dissapeared.
c) the evidence about John Doe #2
d) the evidence that there were booster charges placed on the basement
structural columns that were of typical BATF training manual construction.

By the way, I also think McVeigh should hang.

The problem with this statement is that technology seems to be 
moving in direction of more power for the individual.  That is, a 
large group of well-tained people is not significantly more capable
than a single person, when sufficiently high technology is had by
both sides.  One hidden person with a fiber-guided missile is 
approximately equal to a tank with three crew.

As long as the bosses are willing to violate rights by stea--taxing, what

You seem to be implicitly assuming that only a few are really

Hello,

I have been reading some of this talk about life-extending technologies
and technological consciousness assimilation, and just wanted to note
that the approach that some are "elite" and "deserve" such "beneficial"
things would probably be the subject of a new-day French-style
Revolution and lead to many being "bloodily decapitated".

The Internet among other things has "levelled the playing field" in some
regards, that is to say, it has razed many "artificial" or other
barriers.

It is frustrating to be intelligent to the point where things that are
readily apparent to oneself and peers are not to the general personae.
Claiming "elitism" is a pedantic measure that is not auto-honest.

Instead of trying to separate, a more positive approach is to think in
terms of lifting everyone.

In the framework of "machine consciousness" and some future ability to
translate biological thought processes to such a context, there is a
difference between interfacing to such a machine consiousness and
surrendering your entirety to it.  Personally, I would not choose to
have my consciousness or a copy of it irreparably mated to a universal
"machine consciousness", but the idea of interfacing with it
productively is certainly a good one.

Things sure have changed in the century, perhaps even more so in the
last twenty-five years, which is all I have been alive to see, but as
the old French saying goes:  "plus a change, plus a meme chose."

Absolutely.  "Well defined" does not necessarily mean "publically known".
I'm sure a proper cell system would qualify.

Really?  I wasn't aware that he engaged in any activity other than
sedition.  The militia skermishes and the Continental Army easily qualify
under the stated definition. This is irrelevent, however, since the Hague
and Geneva Conventions are a hundred years and more in the future.

That is one possible interpretation.

"or other means of identification".  Could be as little as an armband.
Perhaps a good definition of "territorial control" is being able to
identify yourself by whatever means as an insurgent in relative safety.

Indeed, most of the governments have tried very hard to define these
groups as such.  Remember, you invoked the Laws of Warfare as
justification for your position.  I thought it might be enlightening to
relate (my perhaps poor memory of) what they really say.  You do realize
that the Laws of Land Warfare refer to a very specific set of rules set
out by the Hague and Geneva Conventions, don't you?

The purpose of the definition I related was not to determine who was right
or wrong, but who signitories to the treaties are required to accord the
rights and priviledges of prisoners of war and who may be treated as a
criminal. Which, indeed, seems to be the distinction you were trying to
make.

As for the groups above, they seem to me to mostly meet the definition.
The ANC, Sandinistas, Contras, Zapatistas, Mujahedin, Viet Cong all were
organized (more or less), controlled territory, and had means of
identifying themselves when safe. The PLO and the IRA are marginal cases.
I wasn't aware, though, that the NRA and the Chinese democracy protestors
were engaged in armed revolt.

Good point!  This no doubt influenced those who wrote the treaties.

I find it difficult to believe that a) the government could so competently

I wrote that he *deserves* to hang.  Whether he *should* or not is a far
more complex question

I think advocating assassination is probably off-topic for the Extropians

The militia movement castrated themselves by confusing their guns with
their dicks and trying to use both at the same time.

Why the hell is this on the Extropians List anyway?  Why do you feel the
need to bring your wacko politics about guns and government conspiracies
into this list on almost a daily basis?

This is an important issue, since the answer determines a lot about what we
can expect to happen in the event of rebellion, oppression, and other
unpleasant circumstances.  It is also pretty important to the question of
whether PPAs are even possible, and whether they are prone to becoming
governments.

Let us start with the historical perspective, before we start worrying about
the effects of future technology:

In ancient times few people could afford weapons.  However, the difference
in fighting power between an armed an unarmed man was not insurmountable.
Ten men with improvised weapons can generally beat one man with a sword and
armor.  This problem, coupled with the limited supply of arms, meant that an
angry mob could actually be intimidating to a government.

With the invention of gunpowder, this began to change.  Now a group of
well-trained soldiers could easily defeat a much larger mob of civilians.
Armed civilians were still a threat, but only to a limited degree - they
might be able to afford guns, but cannons were to expensive for all but the
richest citizens.

With industrialization the trend really picked up steam.  More and better
technology was applied to warfare, resulting in a proliferation of
expensive, specialized equipment.  An military force equipped with heavy
weapons, tanks, artillery and aircraft can easily defeat any imaginable
unarmed mob.  Armed civilians, who are limited to relatively inexpensive
weapons, are at a severe disadvantage.  It is true that man-portable weapons
can sometimes defeat more expensive hardware (as in the case of a man with
an anti-tank rocket), but these weapons are themselves rather expensive
(think thousands to tens of thousands of dollars).

At the same time, the complexity of military operations has increased
enormously.  Where once it was possible for a militia to grab their weapons
and march straight to the battlefield, it now takes months of training to
form a group of reservists into an effective unit.  Civilians, even armed
ones, would likely need a year or two of preparation to learn the
intricacies of modern logistics, fire support, air operations, etc.

Today it is virtually impossible to defeat a modern army in conventional
warfare unless you have one yourself.  Getting a modern army requires much
larger investments than any private effort is likely to be capable of - the
minimum size would seem to call for several hundred thousand full-time
personnel and an investment of hundreds of billions of dollars.  If you have
two different forces that both fall below that scale, the bigger one will
have a dramatic advantage in combat.

Guerilla warfare has been shown to be fairly effective so long as the
insurgents have access to safe havens and outside funding.  However, where
both of these conditions are not met they generally fail.  Lack of safe
havens means they have nowhere to train recruits, stockpile supplies, and
plan strategy.  Lack of outside funding means they rapidly run out of money,
and will never be able to afford the weapons they need to win a battle.  It
is also worth mentioning that most insurgents in the 20th century have been
fighting third-world governments which themselves were too poor to afford a
modern military.

In the future, we should reasonably expect these trends to continue.  There
are far more things a military might want to buy than they are ever likely
to be able to afford.  The near future will see the introduction of
autonomous recon drones, robotic weapons, cheap precision munitions,
automated surveillance systems, and many other expensive, specialized sorts
of hardware.  An organization that can afford to buy such equipment, and
that trains enough to learn to use it effectively, will have a decisive
advantage over anyone who does not do likewise.  In the industrial age,
warfare of any kind favors the deepest pockets.

I don't think that is appropriate for the extropians list. But heck, you wanna
go at it? Read on...

I didn't start it. I have not been arguing my political opinions here, but
stating legal facts.
As far as I am concerned the 'wacko politics' of guns on this list are the
statist anti-freedom positions of people like yourself who are for gun
control. You are unamerican, anti-freedom, pro-enslavement.

If you think that being shocked that the government can get away scot free
with the massacre of hundreds of people is 'wacko politics' then you do not
belong in this country. Maybe someplace like, say, Serbia or China is more to
your liking...

Things are screwed up in this country precisely because nobody does anything
to defend people like that. You can sit on your but down there in Florida and
whine about the gang bangers down there, and call me a wacko, but when was the
last time you actually got off your but and defended someone elses rights?
Even someone you disagree with?

I have never said I sympathized with the politics of those people, but you tar
me with the same brush the media uses on those people as a means of denying
the reality that our rights are going down the tube and you are too damn lazy
to do anything about it. I will fight and die for the rights of any American,
even those I disagree with. Can you make the same commitment? I didn't think
so.

Extropians are pro-freedom for the individual. Its high time you statists who
insist on spouting off on the list realized that and either put up or shut up.
Individuals do not get freedom just handed to them. "Oh please, Mr. big
goverment thug, can I please have my rights?" or "Oh please Mr. Robber, please
respect my property and my daughter's virginity."  Is that going to get you
anywhere? I didn't think so. What part of "shall not be infringed" don't you
seem to understand??????

I remain on the list denouncing the statist yap of people like you. I get at
least several messages of support from other subscribers every day who are
tired of the list being overrun by socialist pro-government
rights-confiscators. They want the list to return to the way it used to be,
full of revolutionary fervor. The Extropian Principles are a revolutionary
document, its high time you people either got up and made a commitment to
start making it happen and fighting for Extropian Justice or get the heck out
of the way.

I advocate self-defense in general as an expression of the Extropian
value of self-determination.  Self-defense sometimes requires
deadly force.  I would not publicly suggest that anyone assassinate
any particular person in power because it's hard to practice self-
determination from jail, but there's no law requiring me to weep
over the deaths of those who have chosen evil.  And there's no law
(yet) against saying that I might understand--even admire--some
hypothetical illegal act.

The recent ruling against The Nuremburg Files does give me some
pause in that regard, though.

The few crazed people who perpetrated this act of domestic jihad are no more to be honored by the title of "dissident insurgency group" than were Bob Mathews and his group (actually calling themselves "The Order", and inspired by the same demonic Turner Diaries) who heisted banks and killed jewish personalities in the '70's and '80's.

In this context, what he did was a war crime that was not very much worse than the US Marine pilot who sliced through the cable for that gondola in Italy. The pilot had a jury biased in his favor and the backing of the government who wanted an acquittal, while Tim McVeigh had a judge who refused the defense to call witnesses which

(1) I think the pilot should have been convicted, and pilot instructors from Pensacola, Florida, the "cradle of Naval Aviation", have written to the local newspaper expressing their incomprehension and dismay at the verdict, which was an example of why the military fraternity should never be allowed to hold court over its errant frat boys. (2) The pilot did not intend to kill the people in the gondola; it was obviously a reckless hotdogging accident, whereas McVeigh meant to kill as many people as possible. (3) Twenty died in the gondola; 169 died in the federal building.

>McVeigh was overwrought by the slaughter of the Koresh families by the government (for which nobody has yet been convicted, not to mention being sentenced to death), and wanted to exact eye for an eye revenge. McVeigh was a reserve NCO in the army at the time. An NCO's authority to act and give orders is only delegated to him by his commanding officer. Only a commissioned officer (or the

So if I'm "overwrought" that the US has, by allowing the interstate highway system to be built and by not banning smoking and the consumption of alcohol, directly contributed to the deaths of millions, I can legitimately bomb the BATF and the Transportation Dep't.?  The original Mad Bomber waged a war against Con Edison for effronteries to his frangible sense of outrage, Ramsi Yousef feels the very existence of the US to be a fatwa-deserving affront to Holy Islam, and Theodore Kaczynski believes that computers specifically, and technology generally, are a cancer devouring the collective soul of Homo Sapiens.

Hello all,

Just a FYI, MIT's Technology review, March/April of 99 has a special
section on nanotechnology that some in this group might find
interesting.

I would also like to say I find reading the mail in this group very
interesting.  There are a lot of people really giving some thought to a
varity of topics and it is refreshing to read and starts my own brain
working again.

Lee

The Order had no outright instances of outright massacres like McVeigh did with the Koresh incident. Anyone who is not sickened by what the government perpetrated there is not deserving of honor as far as I am concerned. You go on to say:

The government has produced no evidence of child molestation of anyone under the age of consent under Texas Law. No matter how much Koresh brainwashed his people, does that justify burning them all to death? It is tantamount to a modern Salem Witch Trial, complete with a mass buring at the stake. I'm rather surprised that someone like yourself, who claims to be a Pagan, would not see the similarities. You'll find the all of the charges the government brought against Koresh, were also charges leveled at the convicted witches 300 years ago.  Oh, geez, that guy is brainwashed, we'd better burn him to death.....Oh, I think that child has been abused, lets torch her up.....

It was the final raid with the tank that set the fire.

> (1) I think the pilot should have been convicted, and pilot instructors from Pensacola, Florida, the "cradle of Naval Aviation", have written to the local newspaper expressing their incomprehension and dismay at the verdict, which was an example of why the military fraternity should never be allowed to hold court over its errant frat boys. (2) The pilot did not intend to kill the people in the gondola; it was obviously a reckless hotdogging accident, whereas McVeigh meant to kill as many people as possible. (3) Twenty died in the gondola; 169 died in the federal building.

A 'reckless hotdogging accident'? Then why did Italy want to bring murder charges against the pilot instead of manslaughter or negligent homicide?

> So if I'm "overwrought" that the US has, by allowing the interstate highway system to be built and by not banning smoking and the consumption of alcohol, directly contributed to the deaths of millions, I can legitimately bomb the BATF and the Transportation Dep't.?

Sins of omission are not in the same league as sins of commission....

> The original Mad Bomber waged a war against Con Edison for effronteries to his frangible sense of outrage, Ramsi Yousef feels the very existence of the US to be a fatwa-deserving affront to Holy Islam, and Theodore Kaczynski believes that computers specifically, and technology generally, are a cancer devouring the collective soul of Homo Sapiens.  These last two now share the seme prison as McVeigh, and they ALL belong there.

Ramsi Yousef is a foreigner and was attacking civilian populations. Like McVeigh, he attacked at a time of day to impose maximum civilian casualties. An obvious war crime if it were treated as an act of war. Moreover, I never said that McVeigh did not deserve punishment for what he did. I specifically said he deserves to hang, but not for the act of bombing itself, but for bombing WHEN he did, at a time when there was maximum civilian use of the facility.

> This matches perfectly the M.O. of neonazi atrocity and accompanying propaganda: (1) do a terrible thing costing many lives, and (2) claim that the victims did it to themselves to engender sympathy.  Blame the jews for the ovens, the short dress for the rape, the blacks for slavery, and the government for ALL terrorist attacks, whether committed by or against them.

Look more to Nazi atrocities: staging events and blaming them on the Jews, just as the government manipulates what the media publishes and broadcasts in order to implicate those people it wants to oppress. Look at the Jewell incident. He was the security guard who discovered the bomb at the Atlanta Olympic games, and cleared the area before it went off, so only one person died. Rather than finding the real bomber, the government went after Jewell, who was a fat, white, loner. The perfect patsy.  Now the alleged real bomber has gotten away and is hiding in the Appalachians, being sheltered by the anti-abortion sympathizers there.

Note the similarities between how the government staged both Ruby Ridge and Waco: both incidents involved an undercover government agent selling a sawed off shotgun to the target. Those were the original crimes which justified the use of hundreds of stormtroopers, helicopters and tanks.

Well, although I realize that the U.S. has done some pretty pathetic things in
the past with the trust given to it by its citizens, there are not many (if
any) organizations that I would trust with true nanotech other than the U.S.,
except for Drexler and the Foresight Institute.

When humans are obsolete 

Copyright  1999 Nando Media
Copyright  1999 Los Angeles Times Syndicate
By GREG MILLER 

(March 21, 1999 9:32 a.m. EST http://www.nandotimes.com) - Three decades after
Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke gave us the indelible image of HAL, the
archetype of the "thinking computer" in the film of Clarke's "2001: A Space
Odyssey," there's been a resurgence of the idea of a machine with intelligence
superior to that of human beings. 

This idea is represented in three new books, all released within the last few
months: "The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human
Intelligence," by Ray Kurzweil; "When Things Start to Think," by Neil A.
Gershenfeld, director of MIT's Media Lab; and "Robot: Mere Machine to
Transcendent Mind," by Hans P. Moravec, a professor of robotics at Carnegie
Mellon. 

The simultaneous appearance of three books with the same theme prompted a
conference on the concept of machines surpassing human intelligence at Indiana
University on March 6, the "Symposium on Intelligent Machines: The End of
Humanity?" The event was organized by Rob Kling, a former UC Irvine
professor. 

The question posed by this conference title may seem prejudicial, but it was
reasonable given the arguments of at least two of the authors, Kurzweil and
Moravec. They contend in their books that computer processing power is
advancing so dramatically that sometime in the next century, machines will
become vastly more intelligent than human beings. Because of this, they
say, we
will confront the problem of being superseded as a species. Computers of the
future may begin to regard human beings as little more than an evolutionary
dead end, a kind of pet to be kept around only for amusement or by virtue of
the machines' benevolence. 

This thesis was strong enough to pack an Indiana University auditorium with
more than 300 spectators, who listened to panels of experts assess these
ideas.


The concept of artificial intelligence, or AI, is controversial to say the
least. Some regard the phrase as an oxymoron, whereas others view it as the
Holy Grail of computer science. 

AI has gone through an interesting metamorphosis in the last 20 years. In the
1980s, it was a hot field, funded lavishly by the Department of Defense, which
was keen on "smart" weapons and "battle management systems." This research
spun
off an industry that attracted a lot of venture capital and public investment,
spawning Silicon Valley firms such as Tecknowledge and Intellicorp. Nearly all
these companies are dead and gone, as the promises of AI failed to materialize
or the research was absorbed by other, more conventional approaches to
programming. 

In the 1980s there was a joke circulating about the field: "If it works, it's
not AI." To critics, this meant that the field's hype was so outlandish that
its claims could never be realized. To supporters, the joke meant that AI was
constantly on the cutting edge, exploring new domains of knowledge, with its
practical applications quickly ceded to other fields, like database
programming
or pattern-matching algorithms. 

But there has always been a cadre of "strong-AI" proponents, people who
believe
that the brain and computers are theoretically equivalent kinds of
information-processing devices and that it's only a matter of time before
computers not only catch up to brains but surpass them. This position was
summed up by MIT professor Marvin Minsky, who once called the human brain a
"meat machine." 

The three authors mentioned above take this position for granted. They see a
near-total congruity between the way computers work and the way the brain
works, so that eventually we'll be able to not only reproduce human cognition
in machines, but also to "download" our thoughts and memories into computers,
giving us a far more resilient vessel for consciousness than the fragile and
short-lived human body. 

Moravec calls such future machines our "mind children," going so far as to
suggest that the entire purpose of human beings is to serve as an interim
stage
of evolution, a "carbon-based" life form whose main task is to build its
successor species, a silicon-based life form. 

Kurzweil seconds this, saying in his book that mortality will be a thing of
the
past by the middle of the next century as we migrate to machine
consciousness. 

Many people have an almost instinctive revulsion when confronted with such
claims. The strong-AI advocates understand this but dismiss it as "species
chauvinism." 

They point out that for the human race to fulfill its destiny, which they
commonly see as exploring the universe, we'll need a corporeal form with a far
greater life span than that of the human body. And they typically say that
computer power is growing so fast that there's no way we can prevent the
emergence of super-intelligent machines even if we wanted to. 
There are several critiques of these views, such as the devastating
counter-argument of philosopher John Searle of UC Berkeley, who asserts that
although brains and computers might both be symbolic processors, brains are
semantic processors while computers are syntactic processors. In other words,
in brains meaning is all-important, and in computers instructions and their
sequence are all that matter. None of the recent books grapple with this
critique, possibly because it is so difficult to refute. 
But the authors also fail to see that the computer industry is headed in a
different direction too. Kling said the authors are "extremely good at
circumventing the industrial and economic ramifications of their
predictions." 

"Where do super-intelligent machines come from?" asks Kling. "Do they grow, do
they spring up or are they built by companies?" 

He means that both robots and artificial intelligence programs are today
shaped
by economic requirements, and the demands of industry are for machines and
programs that do very specific and limited kinds of tasks. That is, there's
very little demand for general-purpose super-intelligence in machines.
Manufacturers want robotic arms and hands, not HAL or something like C-3PO in
"Star Wars." Expert systems are useful, but usually only in limited
applications, such as medical information or the maintenance of complex
machinery. 

Kling also noted, "These books skip a lot of the issues surrounding our
dependence on 'dumb' systems, for which the year 2000 problem is the poster
child." Most people have problems not with machines that are too intelligent,
but with computers that don't seem intelligent enough. No one has figured out,
for example, how to make computers simply easier to use or how to make large,
complex programs bug-free. 

AI has made a lot of progress in the last 10 years, said Benjamin Kuipers,
chairman of the computer science department at the University of Texas at
Austin and a leader in the field. "But most of it is obscure to the public,
because this progress has been absorbed into other fields of programming. 
"I personally think that AI is one of the greatest half-dozen scientific
challenges we have today," added Kuipers. "It's important for us to
investigate
the fundamental problem of what the mind is. We have an imperative to
investigate this subject, as human beings." 

But Kuipers noted that just because we know how to split atoms doesn't mean we
should build a global nuclear arsenal that could destroy life. 
"Perhaps we should know about (the issues these authors address) in the same
way we should know not to touch a hot stove," he said.

I recently read a short bio of Land, inventor of the Polaroid camera, that
described him as an "incurable optimist."  That hackneyed phrase led me to
wonder:  Might one describe an Extropian as a "*curable* optimist"?

Certainly, no Extropian would want to embrace *fatal* optimism, the sort of
blind faith in the face of all contrary evidence that leads to irretrievable
loss of personal identity.  But what about chronic, non-fatal optimism?  "By
reason! That's the 17th time straight that watching MST3K reruns has not
resulted in my transcendence.  Ah, well, pass the Doritos and I'll have
another go."

April fools day is my favorite holiday of all. I must confess I haven't 
always been privy to the riches and rewards of our warmest holidays, and 
this may be some left over cause and effect. But, April 1rst is a day to 
get away with shortsheeting, and seran wrapping the toilet seats, 
without ending up wearing a P for punishment. After all that's what one 
does on this day. I of course may have a biased opinion, seeing as I am 
always the perpetrator and never the victim.

Note that the high cost of these weapons is purely a function of limited
supply.  I think it would be fairly easy to design such a man-carried 
missile to be mass manufactured for less than a thousand; no government
would be pleased with this operation, though...
In a free society, such things could be as common as .380 autos are
now.

Eh?  No one needs this to defend his house.  If it were apparent that
a standing force of some sort was necessary, people would pay for
a private company to train one.  I'm not trained to be a police detective,
either, but I don't need to be one to defend my home individually, and
if I do need one for something, I can call my crime insurance company
(police force).  It may be more efficient, in general, for a police company
to also be a mass defense company, but probably not, IMHO.

Not so.  The Somalis effectively defeated the force sent there in the 
early 1990s...the trick is to cause losses while making it clear that
it will go on indefinitely.

I disagree that this is so.  Iraq had the fourth largest army in the
world in 1990.  We sent a trivial force, in comparison, and it was
higher technology, not numbers, that made the difference.

Hah!  Gotcha.  All of this stuff is predicated on computational power.  
Computers are so cheap (and falling) that this sort of equipment is
expensive only due to scarcity.  The cost of manufacture is low,
compared to many electronic gadgets that people routinely buy.

There is another point, here, too.  Any population that is slated for
conquering is likely to have deeper pockets than the conquerer, for
two reasons:  one, the conquerer must feel that he will get his money
back, or it wouldn't be worth it to try (no one can lose money
indefinitely, after all), and two, while the conquerer is willing to spend
some portion of his own wealth to get the conquered area, he cannot
be willing to spend as much as the area in question will be willing to 
spend to keep him out.  That is, I would be willing to use up all my
wealth to keep someone from stealing my wealth.  This is the rationale
behind many wealthy people's actions of giving away more than they
would have to pay in taxes, to reduce the amount paid in taxes.

How would one measure productivity? It's difficult to measure something

If a U.S. company makes the breakthrough discovery that sets a clear path
(or even a potentially clear path) towards full-scale molecular
nanotechnology, I expect the federal government to declare eminent domain
over such intellectual property immediately.  Nanotechnology in the hands of
industry represents too much of a security risk (not that the U.S.
government is necessarily effective at insulating its intellectual property
from pilfering).  The interesting case will be where another country (or
business within such country) makes the breakthrough progress.  To hedge
against such a circumstance, I suspect that the chief research nations
(U.S., the EU (in aggregate), Japan, etc.) will form a joint Nano Project in
the next 10 years similar to the Human Genome Project once the prospect of
full-scale molecular nanotechnology is no longer a novelty in an MIT
Technology Review article but instead simply a matter of time and dedicated
research effort.  There will be elaborate technology sharing protocols set
up and so forth.  The last thing the current global economic regime wants is
for China or some other nondemocratic government to be able to bring
exclusive rights to MNT to a bargaining table.  MNT is the "oil" of the 21st
century and beyond except that who has it isn't based on geographical luck
but R&D budgets.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

Friends,
	I'm cross-posting this to the cryonet and extropians list.

	I've been thinking lately about brain damage.  When exactly is identity
destroyed?  I mean really obliterated?
	Specifically, I'm wondering about the difference between loss of
information, and loss of ACCESS TO information.  This last attributed to
the loss of higher-order function.
	When a brain is damaged--I'm thinking here of strokes, traumatic injury,
brain tumors, and  alzheimer's--certain structural changes take place.
Think of the spatial distribution of the damage.
	Some of those changes presumably involve actual cell death.  But how many
cells die, what fraction of the whole is that, how is the damage
distributed regionally/topologically, and what happens to the dead cell
bodies? (I assume fully necrotic cells undergo apoptosis and "digest"
themselves, the by-products being dispersed for either local or distant
consumption or disposal.)  What of "scar tissue" and other structural
remnants?
	 Then too, what degree of brain damage is characterized by cell damage
without cell death--membrane or cytoskeletal damage/alteration; organelle
damage/reduced function--such that the cell still lives, but is not capable
of supporting the coordinated global activity characteristic of normal
brain function?(Does this happen, or am I describing a non-fact?   I recall
that mitochondria sometimes suffer gradual degradation from, at least,
inherited defect.)
	When a person is brain dead, is there actually a great lump of dead tissue
inside the skull (I don't think so), or does the absence of brain
waves--the flatline on the electroencephalograph that provokes the term
"persistant vegetative state"--only suffice to imply loss of global
function, but not large-scale cell death, maybe not even small-scale cell
death,  or (here's the crux)maybe not nearly as much information loss as
we're inclined to think? 
	 To what extent is the topology of damage responsible for disruptions of
neuronal firing patterns?  Could the loss of memory or personality be due
not to the loss of the information, but to the inability of the organ to
fire that pattern, due to a disrupted firing path.  Would the accumulation
of many small areas of damage, such as in the case of alzheimer's, so "damp
out" the spatially dynamic, electrochemical resonance of thought--of memory
and personality EXPRESSION--that the person seems to fade away?  In a
man-made electronic system, a simple broken wire can result in a complete
system failure even though the actual structural deficit may be only an
infinitesimally small fraction of all the atoms of the system, and the
information deficit zero. 
	Are dementia et al victims really as far gone as we fear they are when we
view with dismay their varying degrees of vegetative-ness?  Or is the
information there, but just not expressible? 
	Identity survival is central to cryonics.  Some aspects of the (gradual)
process of identity deterioration provoke an interpretation of irreversible
loss.  We look at them and say "They're gone."  How valid is this?  How
subject to reevaluation?
	One final detail.  I'm a strong believer in the "elegant design" of
natural systems.  "Nature" squeezes as many uses out of any system
component as she can. (Please excuse the teleological and anthropomorphic
modes of expression.)  Thus a local brain region with a specialized
function is likely to have multiple roles.  In larger scale global
function--like memory or personality pattern storage and expression--it may
have a supporting but not a critical role.  Thus limited local damage which
may cause striking loss of specific function may, as regards memory or
personality, have only a mild impact.  In fact, let me repeat what has been
suggested before: that memory and personality may be broadly distributed
across the cortex and cerebellum (and elswhere?), that such distributed
expression is arguably inherently robust, and that these features strongly
suggest the importance of memory and personality to the individual and the
species (not to mention to cryonicists and extropians).

					--------------------

	In the process of writing this, I produced a typo: memeory, instead of
memory.  Hmmmmmm.

And elsewhere to prevent the return of fugitive slaves to their owners, and

What exactly did McVeigh have to do with the militia movement? (Answer:
almost nothing, outside of FBI propaganda: the militia group he wanted
to join reported him to the FBI as a dangerous nut... and the FBI ignored 
their advice). And personally I'm always amused by this anti-gun Freudian
crap, because it clearly shows that they haven't read Freud's comments

What further course of action is there available to that maniac's victims,
other than violence? I'm not saying that violence would be justified, just
pointing out that when the government declares itself above the law, it's
asking for a violent response from those who have no other recourse.

You do, of course, have some evidence to back up these claims? No, I thought
not.

Have you ever seen 'Waco: Rules of Engagement'? If not, I really suggest you
watch it, because you can't begin to understand why there is so much outright
hatred of the Federal government until you have... The federal agents involved
in that massacre were truly malignantly evil and extremely sick; through
accident or design these maniacs burnt down a church full of women and
children. Doesn't that horrify you? Do you think the Founders of the United
States would just sit back and watch while federal agents burnt down a 
church because the people inside might have some fully-automatic weapons 
that they hadn't paid a tax on?

And, BTW, where exactly did you get the idea that the BATF and FBI have any
jurisdiction in child abuse cases? Cases which had been investigated by the
Texas authorities and proven false? 'Protecting the children' is the last
refuge of the authoritarian scumbag, except when they're Iraqi children, in
which case they have to die in order to save us from Saddam Hussein.

apostrophe (uh-POS-truh-fee) noun

The superscript sign (') used to indicate the omission of a letter
or letters from a word, the possessive case, and the plurals of
numbers, letters, and abbreviations.

[French, from Late Latin apostrophus, from Greek apostrophos, from
apostrephein, to turn away : apo-, + strephein, to turn.]

apostrophe (uh-POS-truh-fee) noun

The direct address of an absent or imaginary person or of a
personified abstraction, especially as a digression in the course
of a speech or composition.

[Late Latin apostrophe, from Greek, from apostrephein, to turn
away.]

The high cost of military hardware is due to two factors: intrinsic
complexity and small manufacturing runs.  An anti-tank missile is a more
complicated machine than a rifle, so it will naturally be more expensive.
Tanks, aircraft and other very high-cost items are also produced in
relatively small numbers, which drives up costs by making manufacturing
inefficient.

A free market in weapons would probably result in lower prices, just like it
does with anything else.  However, it isn't going to make everything cheap.

Depends on what the threat is.  My point is that a force of 1,000 men with
combined-arms equipment can easily defeat 50,000 individuals armed with
rifles.  Unless civilian morale is very high, they can also terrorize
several hundred thousand people into submission (we have to remember, most
people are *not* willing to die for their freedom).  This is an important
point to remember when you start looking at what a State or a rogue PPA
could do.

???  The Somalis killed a few soldiers, and the Clinton administration
decided it didn't want bad press on the issue and pulled out.  There was
never any attempt to attack the warlords responsible, so it hardly counts as
a war.

The important measure of size is money, not people.  In the modern world you
will run out of money long before you run out of people.

An organization with more money to spend can afford more R&D, more
specialized equipment and better training.  With modern technology the
number of things you could productively spend money on is far larger than
anyone's pocket book, so money tends to be the limiting factor.

Now, in a conflict between a big, low-tech country and a small, high-tech
country I'd probably bet on the high-tech side.  However, high technology
tends to produce so much wealth that it is hard to find examples like that.
The usual case is for one side to have better technology and a bigger
economy.

No, its based on the arms race problem.

Simply put, there is never a point at which military technology is 'good
enough'.  You want your equipment to be better than what your opponent has,
and vice versa.  Civilian buyers want to buy hardware in the 'sweet spot'
where cost efficiency is maximized.  Military buyers want hardware just shy
of the bleeding edge, so they will have an advantage over anyone who doesn't
choose the same option.

And BTW, the kind of systems I mentioned are not just computers.
Military-grade sensors are better than anything in the civilian sector
(except for scientific instruments, of course), and robotics are expensive
anywhere.  Also, the military version has to keep working after being shot,
dropped, run over, rained on, and used as a hammer - all of which drives up
costs considerably.

Now, once again, I expect that a privatized system could produce better arms
for less money than a government.  However, that doesn't mean that arms
would be cheap.  Costs of some items might drop, but an intelligent military
will opt for improved performance over reduced cost in almost all cases.

This is true as far as it goes, but it ignores some crucial factors:

1) In peacetime, an organization that does not plan to start a war has
strong incentives to invest in productive resources instead of weapons.
This tends to create divergent strategies, where peaceful groups maximize
economic growth and warlike groups maximize military power.

2) It takes time to convert economic power into military power.  Raising an
army takes years.  Building a navy takes decades.  Figuring out how to make
your troops into a first-rate fighting force is along and uncertain process.

3) Warlike groups practice divide-and-conquer strategies.  You don't attack
the whole world at once.  You pick some unpopular little group, and conquer
them.  Then you find another, and another, and another.  If you're good at
the game, you eventually pick off enough smaller groups to make the
operation worthwhile.  If not, your peaceful neighbors wise up and organize
to oppose you.

4) Losses in wartime are not symmetrical.  If my military is twice as good
as yours, and I invade your country, I can defeat 100% of your troops
without loosing anywhere near 50% of mine (10% would be a more likely
figure).  If my advantage is even larger, my losses rapidly become trivial.

5) Warlike groups don't have to show a profit.  Market institutions must
deliver a positive return on investment on a fairly consistent basis.
Coercive institutions can show a net loss for years, and their only penalty
is a lower rate of economic growth.  In the long run this can be a fatal
problem (witness the Soviet Union), but that is beyond the planning horizon
of most despots.  So, coercive institutions tend not to care if their
operations are actually profitable.

That's weird: I've seen LAW rockets for sale for $250, which won't buy
you a particularly good modern rifle. Admittedly they won't do much against
a $20million main battle tank, but they'll be perfectly good against an APC
costing a thousand times as much as the missile.

And this is the point: it doesn't matter if an anti-tank missile costs 
$10,000 in bulk, if it has a 50% chance of knocking out a $20million tank.
No nation can afford to lose a billion dollars of tanks to a million
dollars of missiles; or an entire army to a single million-dollar nuke.

So you see our point? When one side is spending a thousand times as much
as the other, they lose.

And you know what? That's not possible for much longer, BECAUSE THE 
UNPOPULAR LITTLE GROUP CAN SERIOUSLY DAMAGE THE ATTACKING NATION! It 
only works when that little group can only kill the invading force,
once the little group has nuclear, biological or chemical weapons they
can kill the leaders and millions of civilians of the nation which chooses 
to attack them. At that point it is no longer a feasible strategy.

Your military has a hundred thousand well-trained soldiers, a thousand 
tanks, hundreds of planes and helicopters. My military has me... and a
half-dozen nukes. You die, I win. Game over.

Don't you get it yet? Mass destruction weapons change *everything*. When
one person can kill millions, traditional warfare is no longer possible;
you cannot coerce nuclear-armed individuals.

This is silly. Gunpowder brought the end of feudalism because now a single
individual with a gun could kill the best mounted knight, and a small army
with a cannon could bring down the best defensive walls. Just as widespread
ownership of nukes and other mass destruction weapons will bring down 
modern authoritarian government.

Writers of constitutions restrain state power by apportioning it among
different entities with competing interests.  Ideally, one hopes that on any
given question the strength of the agencies with a vested interest in
restraint will be greater than that of those in favor of expansion.  This
can be a tricky design problem, but it is of a level of complexity that can
readily be addressed by careful thought.

Early attempts to design this sort of government have been moderately
successful.  For instance, the U.S. government, arguable the first serious
attempt in history at creating a stable limited government, operated largely
as expected for several generations.  It eventually succumbed to the
problems of special interest lobbying and gradual expansion with which we
are so famliar, but it has been a rather gradual process.  It is also worth
noting that this transformation is largely the result of popular desires -
the Federal Government grew into its present form largely because the people
wanted it to.

Now, we could certainly build a much better system based on the experience
of the last two centuries.  We can see now that the government should be
much smaller to start with, and that there must be some active mechanism for
pruning back outdated laws and obsolete programs.  We can see that stronger
mechanisms are needed to fight 'constitutional creep', but we can also
readily see ways of designing such mechanisms.  IMO, it would now be
feasible to design a limited government that could operate for several
centuries without serious erosion - and if immortality and other
transhumanist technologies can give us a population that understands how
governments evolve, that could easily stretch to millennia.  Since I expect
to see strong SI long before then, I don't see long-term stability as a
problem we really need to be worried about.

There are two reasons why I don't really trust market mechanisms to achieve
the same goal.  The first is simply that they are untried in this arena.  We
can see from experience that the market is capable of optimizing economic
activities, but the same is not true of the use of force.  In fact, what
data I can see (from cases like modern-day Russia) would seem to indicate
that there are perverse incentives at work whenever the use of force becomes
an option.  If there is no one who can police my actions, it is often in my
best interests to act like a criminal.  It is not at all clear that it is
possible to create a stable population of independent entities that will
police each other.

The second problem is transaction costs.  Every scheme I have seen for
privately produced law results in a massive proliferation of complexity.
The individual contracts with a PPA, the PPAs contract with each other, the
PPAs negotiate meta-contracts covering contract enforcement, and on and on
and on.  When you combine this approach with an absolutist view of
individual responsibility (which is usually the case), you end up with a
society where you need to read and understand a thousand pages of legalese
to buy a pack of chewing gum.  Either everyone spends all their time reading
legal documents, or no one ever knows what laws are going to apply to a
given situation.  This might be a viable society for transhumans, but you
and I would have some serious problems.

Finally, I don't really see a need to try something as exotic as
anarcho-capitalism.  I can readily see how to set up a government whose only
really objectionable activity as a small compulsory tax bill.  Since I'd be
paying the same money to a PPA in an anarchist society, I don't see that
there is much to be gained by trying the experiment.

I suspect that will be true to at least some extent, simply because people
are likely to want to live near others with similar beliefs... and because
PPAs are likely to charge a lot more for people who choose to live near to
those who support very different legal systems, as that will greatly increase
their enforcement costs.

They're very similar, but I don't see that the government system is at
all realistic: I can't see any government choosing to let people secede,
because no governor likes to lose their power. Plus in the anarcho-capitalist
society I'd at least have the choice of staying where I was and paying
the extra cost for a different PPA if I so chose.

It seems like a lot of people think Searle "killed" the area with his
apparently elegant arguments, while of course most people in the area
regard Searly as silly. After hearing Searle speak to a group of
neuroscientists, I can understand it. He was wonderfully persuasive,
and to a non computer-scientist what he said most likely sounded very
reasonable. Meanwhile, I was totally unconvinced about his anti-AI
arguments (he had some other good points, the man is not 100% evil :-)

The point of that operation, I believe, was to restore State in an area
where the local mini-States were having difficulty.  Regardless of hype,
the UN forces were supporting at least some of the warlords.  I was in the
US Army at that time, and some people from my unit (501st Signal Batt)
went to Somalia -- they were confused, upon return, that family and
friends thought that they'd been *looking* for a particular warlord, when
in fact they'd been ferrying him around the country...

Sure there is.  No one has done research on more powerful explosives
for some time, simply because we know hot to build high explosives (nukes)
that are any desired size.  This is an example of hardware that is good 
enough.  The only exception, AFAIK, to this is computational power,
which will be available in similar levels to everyone at low cost, as it is
today.

Another option is to have enough cheap tools to throw away the ones that
get abused.

If they already have an unlimited budget, taken by force, yes.  This begs
the question, though.  How is a ('til now) budget-conscious defense agency
to spend all this money?

Economic growth will be so much faster in an anarchy than in a State,
that similar (in current dollars) military expenditures will be a smaller
and smaller proportion of total wealth.  This does produce a window of
opportunity with current growth rates, admittedly.  After five or ten
years, however, I would expect the anarchy to be far more wealthy 
than the State.

This depends on what you want.  If you want a small, high-tech, high-auto-
mation force to defeat a particular aggressor, it may not take so long.

Yes.  This is why I am not sure that any of the current "free nation"

Note that a loosely organized local defense force is likely to lose

If the conquering operation loses money consistently, it can never hope
to conquer a significant portion of even the Earth, without collapsing.  We
no longer live in an era where empires can last...

A LAW rocket isn't an anti-tank missile.  Its a completely unguided, short
ranged rocket designed primarily for blowing holes in walls.  It is also
effective against unarmored vehicles and obsolete APCs, if you can get close
enough to hit them.  It is cheap, simple, and completely ineffective against
any modern armored vehicle.

By the same logic, a single bullet can take out a soldier that costs
$100,000 to train.  Does that mean soldiers are obsolete?

Of course not.  You will never see a battlefield where the tanks all line up
to let your militia take pot shots at them.  Instead you'll see all kinds of
complex maneuvers where each weapon system covers for the weaknesses of the
others.  The infantry work their way towards your position on foot, sweeping
the underbrush for enemy troops as they go.  The APCs and tanks hang back
and provide fire support - their heavy weapons can take out buildings,
weapon pits and armored vehicles that would be a threat to the infantry.
The artillery bombards your suspected position to keep you pinned down, and
the air force scouts the whole area to see what your buddies are up to.  If
you try to assemble in large numbers the air force and artillery bombard you
until you scatter.  If you don't assemble you get picked off one by one by
enemy infantry.

BTW, tanks don't cost $20 million (try $1 million or less), and you can't
take out an entire army with a nuke (maybe a battalion or two, but no more
unless you're bombing their bases in peacetime).

This may seem new to you, but every serious military organization on the
planet has been thinking about it for 60 years now.  Nukes don't mean the
end of warfare, they just demand some changes in tactics.

First off, despite certain popular Hollywood themes, you can't build a
nuclear device in your basement out of used refrigerator parts.  Nuclear
bombs are complex devices, requiring exotic materials and large capital
investments.  If you could buy them on the open market today, prices would
range from a few hundred thousand dollars up into the low millions.  Not
many people are going to buy one at those prices, and no individual or small
group is going to be building their own.

Second, bombs aren't much use without a delivery vehicle.  The obvious
methods are missiles and aircraft, but those obviously won't work in this
case.  Your 'small group' probably can't afford them, and besides they
aren't likely to penetrate an aggressor's air defenses.  That leaves mines,
truck bombs, and similar terrorist-type strategies.

Most of these methods are impractical, for the simple reason that very few p
eople are willing to get blown up delivering the bomb.  Also, they won't
work on a battlefield - modern sensors are making it practical for a small
team of infantrymen to sweep amazingly large areas for mines, and nuclear
bombs would be even easier to spot.  So, that leaves nuclear terrorism as
the only practical option.

Your problem here is that *NO ONE* wants nuclear terrorism to be possible.
That includes the company that sells you your weapons.  If you start blowing
up pieces of an enemy city, you've just lost the public relations war.  Any
intelligent aggressor will quickly convince the world that you are a bunch
of dangerous maniacs, and they are saving the world from you.  Your
suppliers will stop selling to you (or the aggressor will take them out with
public support), and that will be that.

Gunpowder meant the end of the age of feudalism because it meant that a king
could buy cannons capable of breaching any castle wall.  The cannons were so
expensive that only kings could afford them, so the nobility was unable to
return the favor.  This created a one-sided situation that favored larger
power blocks over small ones.

Your quote about knights isn't true.  Guns were not capable of reliably
penetrating plate armor until well into the Renaissance.  What ended the era
of the mounted knight was the appearance of well-trained infantry units
armed with a complex mix of pikes, assorted pole arms, crossbows and
primitive firearms.  Charging across an open field, while under fire, into a
wall of pikes, proved not to be a viable tactic.

This list frustrates me. It feels like the sailors on the admiral's flagship
discussing geopolitics in the mess. Good ideas, but the Admiral makes all
the calls, and he NEVER goes to the enlisted man's mess.

Yesterday, someone said that we can't be elitist and get anywhere. I agree.
In 1991 I cofounded Knowledge Adventure with the EXPRESS purposes of trying
to move the bell curve to the right for everyone, and to gradually undermine
the soviet gulag we call the educational system today. Knowledge Adventure
succeeded, and is now a big company inexorably eroding the labor/educational
complex from below. www.knowledgeadventure.com

In 1994 I founded Worlds Inc. with the express purposes of eliminating
borders, barriers to "physical presence". This was too early an effort, but
will happen when >=256k bandwidth become appx 10% of the US installed base.
www.activeworlds.com and www.worlds.com

Also in 1994, designed hands free speech reco canteen sized full mutimedia
PC with head's up display (Mentis currently available at
http://www.teltronics.com/is/mentis.html

In 1995 I worked with Stephen Spielberg to start the Starbright Pediatric
network. We secured all the partners, developed the technology/software, and
operated a 3d virtual world so that hospital bound kids could "go out and
play" even though they have cancer/severe immune deficiency/paraplegia etc.
http://www.starbright.org/press/sbw_nov8.html

Currently I'm working on AI based softbotic program trading, softbotic
accounting/tax management www.obvioussoft.com , wireless telepresence and
other stuff I can't talk about yet.

In my first post I suggested that this group needs to create a dictionary. A
dictionary is essentially a meme fixator/transmitter. It can be done
collaboratively, and eventually PUBLISHED. It could be "contributed" by the
list members to the foundation, thus perhaps providing seed money to get
this immobile vehicle off the blocks and onto the street. What happened to
the idea? Nothing...so...i'm trying again.

Here's an idea...once Geron, Alteon, et al get their age regression, and
others get their intelligence booster genes designed, why don't we
reengineer fleas and mosquitos so that they will deliver these genes whereby
the lifespan and intelligence curves can be moved rightward in exactly the
locations/population vectors where these solutions are most needed? No
cost...total benefit. Instead of catching malaria, bubonic plague, you'd
catch brains and life. Billions of free inoculations for all.

by the way, I am well aware that this is "crazy".

So...what have you DONE...or are ACTUALLY DOING - to move the curves to the
right?! Please excite me!

Here's a question for all of our local anarcho-capitalist types:  What keeps
an anarchist society from slowly sliding towards despotism?

The problem I see is that you still have groups of men with guns (the PPAs).
There is no law except what some PPA chooses to provide.  IMO, this
situation has lots of perverse incentives.  A few examples:

1) Why should the PPAs allow themselves to be legally accountable for
anything?  They need a facade of moral rectitude to attract customers, but
the reality is another matter.

2) There is nothing to stop PPAs from colluding to fix the market.  If the
two biggest providers in Houston decide to team up, kick out the competition
by force, and divide the market, my only recourse is to leave.  If they do
it all at once the public relations fallout may be fatal, but the same thing
could happen gradually over the course of decades.

3) PPAs will frequently be faced with other situations where they can stack
the economic deck in their favor with a little judicious use of force.  What
keeps them from doing it?  Worse, what keeps them from starting out small,
and getting steadily worse as time goes on?

To sum up my concern, it seems to me that a PPA system amounts to creating a
market for intelligently applied violence.  A PPA that can get away with
shooting its competitors (or defecting customers) has a strong competitive
advantage over one that can't.  If this is true, we should expect a few
generations of competition to produce the kind of nimble, competent,
hyper-deadly special ops forces that currently exist only in cyberpunk SF.
Instead of a clumsy, stupid, inefficient police state we get a smart,
efficient, effective Yakuza.  Is this really an improvement?

Because if they don't, someone will shoot them. Unlike a government, the
PPAs have no monopoly on force.

In order to kick the competition out by force, they're going to have to 
fight a war, and that's expensive. It gets really expensive when your
old customers all stop paying you and start paying the competitors who
you are fighting; and since all your customers are armed, trying to force
them to pay you is going to get really, really expensive.

>3) PPAs will frequently be faced with other situations where they can stack
>the economic deck in their favor with a little judicious use of force.  What

Because their customers will move to another PPA or shoot them.

>A PPA that can get away with

>advantage over one that can't.

And how are they going to do that? You're implicitly assuming a disarmed
population who are happy to let the PPAs do whatever they want. That ain't
gonna happen.

The whole point of anarcho-capitalism is that it by its very nature it
has these negative-feedback mechanisms. You can't assume them away and
expect to get any kind of reasonable view of what an anarcho-capitalist
society would be like. In effect it's merely taking your glorious minimal
state idea and expanding the competition between power structures to
include everyone in the society, not just everyone in the government.

There is no accepted glossary or dictionary reference for the Constitution, as
far as I know the interpretation of definitions is a combination of
interpretation of the "Framer's Intent" and common law court precedents.  I
believe the Framers were quite logical, inclusive, and procedural in their works,
and the Constitution and Bill of Rights with Amendments are fine works.

I believe if the Author's of the Constitution and other revolutionary credos of
the day were here with us today, their paramount concern would be the freedom of
expression and privacy rights, considering that we as Americans have stumbled
though several centuries somewhat successfully maintaining Democracy, and the
longest running continuous Democracy.

What am I doing?

I'm trying to better myself and support my family.

I am increasing my skill set to better compete in the job market -
have gone from < $11K (1995) to > $50K(present).

I'm borrowing against my 401(k) to pay the $3500 the IRS demands of me
at risk of destroying my family (aka income taxes).

I'm trying to establish good credit after a youth of irresponsibility.

I'm doing my damndest to raise my 2 year-old son to be a rational,
kind, and productive extropian.

I'm eating good food and excersizing to keep my 30 year old identity
host from decaying so I can see the dawn of the Age of Immortality.

I'm absorbing as much knowledge as I can cram into my dense skull so
that I can change (profession, habits, thougthts, ideas, etc.) when
the time comes.

I pass along the transhuman memes to my coworkers, family and any
other audiences I come across.

I have no boasts of great deeds done in the name of bettering
humanity.  I haven't the drive, self-discipline, or desire to become a
mover or shaker.  I don't have the intelligence to invent the next
great technology.

My contribution is small, yes, but I don't think it's inconsequential.
 As long as we all keep the Extropian principles along with our own
personal principles close, we each contribute the best we can to the
"cause."

Not all of us can be great leaders.  Some of us are satisfied with
being Extropian "grunts."

Onward Rational Soldiers!

Hello,

The preceding statement made by me has several errors.  The word "though" should be
"through" and the word "Author's" should be "Authors."  I don't normally publicly
correct grammatical or spelling errors that I have made.  In this case, I felt like
correcting myself.

One nice thing about people is that we have a certain built-in fault tolerance and
recovery ability.  This allows us to read and garner meaning from expressions and
statements that might foil a rigorous automated grammar checker.

Actually, I thought the idea was to score some public relations points by
"doing something" without going to the bother of actually taking effective
action.  As soon as it became apparent that we would actually have to fight
someone to change the situation, Clinton decided it wasn't worth the bother
and pulled out.

That being the case, I don't think this works as an example of insurgents
resisting a superior military force.

We've spent quite a bit of money on new explosives in the last two decades,
actually.  We know it isn't possible to pack much more energy in a given
mass of chemical explosive, but we've spent lots of money figuring out how
to adjust other properties.  For instance, there's that liquid explosive the
army wants to use as a propellant for their new artillery.

Besides, what I'm talking about is the arms race effect.  I make a gun that
can penetrate your armor, so you make better armor.  You make an airplane
that is invisible to my radar, so I have to build better radar.  This is an
open ended process that strongly favors big organizations over small ones.

Well, yes.  But this doesn't affect my point.

I would argue that in any situation where there are armed groups of various
sizes that occasionally come into conflict, the bigger groups have a
decisive advantage.  A group that can afford machine guns and grenade
launchers will massacre one armed only with rifles.  A group that also has
tanks and artillery will beat the guys with machine guns.  A group that also
has an air force has a higher level of advantage, and one with a space force
is stronger yet.

This is important to evaluating anarchy, because it means that if armed
conflicts occur with any significant frequency there will be a strong
selection effect in favor of bigger organizations.  It also illustrates the
fact that a small PPA can not stand up to a big one, unless other large PPAs
are willing to step in on its side.

Yes, it will (at least, compared to militaristic states).  However, that
isn't good enough.  To be safe, it has to spend more money on arms than the
State does.  Now, eventually that will also happen, but it will take several
decades.  Meanwhile, the anarchy is an easy target for any State that wants
to take a bite.

Actually, even that isn't enough.  The State has a single military force,
with a unified command structure, which is optimized for real warfare.  The
anarchy has a collection of independent corporations who do a combination of
police work, intimidation, and small-scale skirmishes (if they fight real
wars with each other, you're going to have a new State within a couple of
generations).  That means the anarchists need a substantial advantage in
financing to make up for the fact that they aren't really ready for war.

You're assuming that the anarchy has superior technology.  There is no good
reason to make that assumption.  Take that same high-tech, high-automation
approach and apply it to the aggressor's side of the equation.  I think
you'll see why a small force is never enough to deter a large one.

True enough, but that won't stop them from trying.  More to the point, it
makes it very hard for a region of anarchy to survive in a world of States.
You need some way to survive long enough for that superior growth rate to
kick in, and you can't rely on economic calculations to deter an aggressor.

> We no longer live in an era where empires can last....

That remains to be seen.  Terrorism has yet to destabilize a single country,
after all.  Universal surveillance is going to be a real possibility in a
couple of decades, and mind control probably isn't too far behind it.  It is
not especially obvious to me how these developments will all work out.

As long as they aren't used, yeah.  All of the tatics and strategy that you
are talking about has been aimed at preventing their use in the first
place.

Or a television set -- what's your point?  TVs are far more

Nuts.  Not counting the actual explosives, one could build a
device for $10K.  They really are not complex, Billy.

If nuclear devices (reactors and explosives) were in widespread 
use, two major consequences would be:  one, that people would
no longer congregate in large numbers in cities (or have to, since
power would be so cheap), and modern armies would be essentially
obsolete.

A small group which has been kept poor by State can't afford them --
a spread-out, high energy use society would mean that even individuals
could easily afford delivery systems.

You seem to assume a population primarily composed of freedom-loving
individualists who are ready and willing to die to prevent any infringement
of their rights.  The only way you are ever going to get that is if you and
a few hundred of your friends move to Luna and found a new society.

In the real world, most people are afraid of large groups of armed men.  A
PPA with a million customers might have tens of thousands who would fight in
self defense, but only one or two would be willing to pull the lone gunman
routine.

If a PPA doesn't allow itself to be sued, most people won't even notice
unless it takes blatant advantage of its immunity.  If it becomes common
practice for PPAs to give themselves that kind of loophole, most people will
just decide they have to live with it.  A PPA can get away with all sorts of
slimy double-dealing this way, as long as the public relations fallout isn't
too bad.

You're assuming the PPAs are stupid.  It seems more realistic to assume they
are run by intelligent people who want to maximize their bottom line.

Let's say mega-PPA A and mega-PPA B together have a majority share of the
market in my town, and they decide to engage in a bit of price-fixing.  The
first thing they do is start squeezing the little companies.  Since a small
competitor can't operate effectively unless it has a mutual-enforcement
agreement with the big guys, all they have to do is play hardball on the
contract terms.  PPAs A & B insist on very favorable terms for their
clients, charge the smaller companies large 'processing fees', and so on.
Over the course of a few years it should be pretty easy to squeeze out the
minor players.

Then they raise their prices, start levying opt-out fees, and generally act
like monopolists.  As long as the extra charges amount to less than the cost
of moving to another city, very few people will actually leave.  Any new
competitor that attempts to enter the market can be dealt with the same way.

This process is pretty simple, so we should expect it to be a common
scenario.  That, of course, only strengthens the hand of the PPAs.  The more
common monopolistic pricing becomes, the harder it is for people to move
elsewhere to escape it.  This also leads to a market dominated by a few big
companies, which means that it is easier to arrange large-scale collusion.

Now, I'm sure you'll point out that people can simple opt not to pay anyone
for police protection.  But if they do, that means that they have no
recourse if someone does commit a crime against them.  In particular, it
means that they have no one to turn to if the local PPA sends a squad of
goons over to 'convince' them to renew their contract.

To build a nuke, you need either plutonium or enriched uranium.  Producing
either of these materials requires a capital investment on the order of
hundreds of millions of dollars (or much more if you want to produce it in
volume).  You also need special explosives (and thus a dedicated explosives
manufacturing plant), very high precision manufacturing (still rather
expensive), and some special electronics (probably adaptable from civilian
uses).  You also need some expensive experts to design the things, and a
large test range where you can try out the prototypes.

Now, I'm sure all of these things will become less expensive as technology
improves, but so will everything else.  If technology advances bring the
cost of a nuke down to a few thousand dollars, that implies that prices on
other kinds of military equipment will also fall by a couple of orders of
magnitude.  That would lead to radical changes in every aspect of military
operations, which means we would need to re-evaluate the whole subject from
the ground up.

If you are going to assume that future technology increases the ability of
the individual to purchase expensive hardware by three orders of magnitude,
you should also assume that states get the same benefit.  What do you think
the U.S. military look like if it had an annual budget of $100 trillion
dollars?

As you know, I think consciousness is noncomputable.  Even I think that
Searle's arguments are hokum.  I think we're all going to have to live
with the fact that no matter how many times we drive a stake through his
arguments, they will eventually shamble forth from their graves to eat

Little stuff here.  I'm an undergraduate Biomedical Engineering major here
at Yale.  I've got my eye set on longevity research, though I may find
myself working on other stuff that pays better and investing a large
fraction of my earnings in promising biotech firms.

Other than that, I do on the side memetic engineering on just about
everyone I know.  :)

As opposed to the polises, where humans are a few million Amish remnants?
I'm not sure why you'd pick one and not the other, particularly as many of the
polises seem dangerously solipsistic.  The Minds never pretend reality doesn't
exist.  And they explore.  Of course, they have FTL, and the polises don't.

If I found myself transported to the Culture I think I'd upload and start
growing up in short order.

Once, in the first book.  I suspected it was a ruse to make humans feel
better.  I hope he's reconsidered.

But they're not risking their lives.  Zakalwe risked his life because he
refused to be scanned.  The agent in _Consider Phlebas_ might have been at
risk either because Culture tech was less advanced, or more likely because
Banks hadn't thought of the consequences of Culture tech yet.  In _Use of
Weapons_ and _Excession_ human can be backed up just as much as Minds can;
Zakalwe simply opts out.

Well, there is the fact that there have been 9000 years of progress by
superhuman Minds.  I don't think it's possible for a mere human to even learn
enough to contribute much.  I don't think this is disappointing; it's what I'd
expect after that much progress.  That's what transhumanism means, to go
beyond the human.

And I think the same gulf existed with the polises; it just wasn't emphasized
as much.

Well, if they did have the desire to bridge the gap, they wouldn't be human
anymore.  In realistic terms a Culture Mind can be roughly viewed as a nano-

Appealing: most humans chose to upload.  The rest live as quasi-religious
separatists (there hadn't been much contact between the fleshers and AIs for a

What am I doing?

Gina "Nanogirl" Miller

I am becoming more everyday, I am also becoming less everyday. 

I am inhaling non-fiction books as often as one can, in hopes of 
attaining more knowledge or open doorways to new philosophies.

I am focused on my new field, "Nanotechnology Industries". I am pushing 
forward in this arena ie. a bulletin publication, online and at 
conferences. Business is well, things are happening for me.

I am listening more, to the voices of others who walk different paths, 
in hopes of never staying on the same one myself. 

I am always appreciating and laughing.(they say it causes one to live 
longer)

I am educating myself and involving myself in a variety of communities 
and groups.

I am realizing that Pythogoras is right, it's all numerical. The 
structure of life. The repition and patterns of matter and the 
intangible, everything is entwined. 

I seek and strive towards the arrival of advanced technologies, and do 
not cower in the shadow of them, but embrace them. 

I embrace myself, I embrace you.

The thing is, this list isn't very well suited to serious discussion.  A
few years ago, when I first came on, things were better.  Now, most of
the serious guys have talked all the real subjects to death and left. 
I'm really just here to read Sandberg's weekly updates, the other news
that gets posted, and a few favorite list members who've hung around or
just arrived.

This list isn't being used to discuss immediate choices.  It's being
used to debate the outcome and ideology of futuristic scenarios.  It has
attracted listeners and posters who are interested in that particular debate.

If I was doing anything serious, like, say, writing a site that
introduced a hundred unique visitors to the Singularity each day, or
gathering data on their reactions, or anything else serious, I wouldn't
say so here.  Instead of any useful feedback I'd get a dozen people
screaming because I didn't conform to their version of the dogma. 
Ideology, not choices.

Likewise, I'm not asking any of the questions I'm interested in
discussing - whether publicizing the Singularity is a good idea to begin
with, how much work it takes to start a foundation, and so on - because
I wouldn't get any useful answers.  After a couple of attempts at
getting useful advice out of this list, I gave up.  The last time I even
reported on what I was doing was during the Singularity discussion six
months back.  This list has evolved for the discussion of futuristic
scenarios, and now even that seems to be pretty much played out.

As for the projects that need doing - why bother?  Is there anyone here
with the money and the will to fund a project that needs doing?  If so,
I haven't seen it.  I haven't seen any sort of practical, intelligent
discussion on this list, or discussion of business issues, which is why
I haven't brought up those questions.  I certainly don't need anyone
else's permission to work on those projects I feel need doing, and since
it doesn't seem likely that I'll get any help, why ask?

If anyone wants to sponsor a list solely for discussion of immediate
choices faced, from which all discussion of ideology would be excluded -
and restricted (although not moderated), so that people can discuss
sensitive subjects - I'm for it.

> So...what have you DONE...or are ACTUALLY DOING - to move the curves to the
> right?! Please excite me!

Usually I work with Outliers - AIs, neurohacks, and the like.  I haven't
spent much time pushing at the curve, unless you count trying to "turn
people on" to the Singularity.  The last time I tried anything like what
you're doing was about three, four years ago, when I published an
article called "Why Schools Don't Work", which I've now deleted from my
Web site.  I'll email it to you, if you like.

What have I done?

I've published about 450K on cognitive engineering, 350K in "Coding a
Transhuman AI" (CaTAI) and 100K in the "Algernon's Law" guide to
neurohacking.  As far as I know, these are the first serious, workable
proposals for creating an AI that can go "all the way" and for
neurosurgically enhancing human intelligence - although only the former
is likely to be permitted by the law.

If anyone wants to turn CaTAI into a foundation, they're welcome to call
me about it.  Right now, I continue to work on it, unpaid, whenever I
can spare an hour.

In the past week or so, I've gotten a dozen people excited enough about
the Singularity to state that they've "decided to devote their lives to
ultratechnology", while almost a score more have cried "Blasphemy!"

As for personal improvement, I'm sorry, but personal improvement doesn't
count as an accomplishment - except, of course, personally.

Jeff,

A quick note to let you know I have hard copied you letter so that my
wife, who is a neurosurgeon, can give it a read a give her input.

She did a number of years of research with people who had suffered
strokes and how the brain "remaps" to make up some of the loss of
function, etc.

She also can give her clinical view of "brain dead" and what that means
in her profession.  

I do know from her talking about her work that most brain damage is
caused by either lack of oxygen/blood flow, or by compression in the
skull during a bleed or and event which causes swelling.  Also that in
most cases there is a rather large amount of cell death caused by one or
more of those things taking place.

If interested I will post more after she gives it a read.

Lee

Jeff,
    The short answer to your question is, YES, there is significant cell
death ocurring in each of the conditions you mentioned (some more than
others).  I've been out of the field for a little over a year, and there has
been data recently suggesting that certain cells in the nervous system can
reproduce, BUT, I believe the current thinking is still that information
storage (long term memory) in the brain is a combination of the physical
pattern of axon-dendrite connections, their firing patterns, and the current
biochemical state of the brain.  The connection pattern is of primary
importance and if it is disrupted, information is lost.  Luckily though, the
brain seems to have a holographic method of storage which retains memory
across many millions of cells at the same time by repeating connection and
firing patterns to create a robust network.  So memory loss is indicative of
a system wide condition where many cells are dying.
    Alzheimers is an excellent example of this type of memory loss - upon
autopsy brains are actually seen to have large holes where cells have died.
Stroke is another example of significant cell death, but localized to a
specific area.  Stroke victims often incur many undetected micro-strokes in
different areas of the brain which can give them the appearance of gradual
memory loss. Brain damage through blunt trauma can take many forms, but the
most common type (as seen in accident victims) is destruction of large areas
of tissue through swelling inside the cranium.  Damage by piercing or
slicing wounds is survivable in certain cases and can produce the type of
effects you were suggesting.  When certain lines of communication are cut
off , there can be a loss of signaling between those areas resulting in a
loss of access to data by critical areas of the brain.  Another example of
this type of condition is amnesia, but as far as I know the mechanisms for
most physiological types of amnesia are still not completely known, but loss
of signaling is certainly implicated.
    As to your other question, cells (esp. neurons) very rarely absorb
significant partial structural damage and survive.  Either there is damage
that can be repaired to bring a cell back to nearly full function, or it is
going to be destroyed by apoptosis.  Molecular damage is another story, and
can have more gradual effects (heavy metal poisoning, oxidation, etc.)
    Hope that helps.  I know others on the list have a strong interest in
connectivity (Anders, Eliezer, etc.) and may be able to answer more
completely than I.  (I was primarily a molecular and cellular guy and didn't
get to think about system wide properties very often)  A good introductory
book to these issues is Bill Calvin's "The Cerebral Code".

Yes, I enjoyed the portrayal of uploaded, posthuman society as
mainstream, mundane, taken-for-granted.  The fleshers, observed from
Yatima's and Inoshiro's point of view, are the exotics.

Yes, this is a point.  Of course, there are the gleisners (one of
whom discovers the impending burst, which shocks the polises into the
diaspora).

Yes, the FTL aspect is a significant difference.  I have a friend for
whom
the existence of FTL in a story makes the difference between science
fiction
and fantasy (even though that's not true for most readers of these
genres).
As strange as it gets, _Diaspora_ is much "harder" SF than Banks (and
the
allusions to Kaluza-Klein and string theory are very very
con-temp-o-rary).

Oh, I just meant that the Special Circumstances shenanigans provide
the excuse for the action/adventure and martial arts aspects of the
Culture stories.  Apart from _Excession_, a lot of the books are focused
on low-tech adventures and conflicts, with the godlike Minds and their
human priesthood hovering indistinctly in the background.  This is
pretty
conventional machinery for an SF story, I suppose -- no more "forced"
here
than in a lot of other contexts.

Yes, in some of the Culture stories, it seems that nobody "really" dies.
And they can be scanned, stored and transmitted in the wink of an eye!
Still, though there's been much discussion on this list concerning the
true identity of such a copy, I don't think it would make me feel
better,
if I were faced, let us say, with imminent decapitation, to know I had
recently been backed up.

Well, yes -- the Special Circumstances messing about, and the nastiness
of
the Minds in _Excession_, and so on.  It may well be, of course, that
there's
no getting away from Darwinian bloody-mindedness even among trans- or
post-humans (the distaste for Darwinian cold-bloodedness is itself,
after
all, a product of Darwinian selection).  I suppose transcendent minds
will still
be subject to transcendent forms of pain.

Yes, the neat trick of _Diaspora_, as I mentioned above, is that I don't
identify with the fleshers.  I identify with Yatima and Inoshiro, the
ordinary
people in the story (even though they're posthumans).  It's not clear
how
superhuman they are, partly because we're seeing the world through their
eyes
(or their gestalt input channels): they take their abilities as much for
granted as I'm taking my own ability to compose this sentence; and
partly because
the story has to be accommodated to contemporary human readers. 
Nevertheless,
_Diaspora_ is probably as posthuman as a contemporary SF author can get
and still
find a publisher -- a number of quite smart people whom I tried to
introduce to this
book found it completely unreadable.

I wouldn't be too disappointed if I woke up on a GSV, either.

I am going to take a shot at starting a discussion of issues relevant to
immediate choices.  In particular, the "What needs doing" message that
will follow.  If people follow up with ideological disputes, the message
will not yield results.

Initial subject line:
"NOW:  What needs doing [Yudkowsky]"

Replies along the lines of "I don't think you should do that for
<ultimate goals reason>", or anything else concerning the futuristic
scenario, should change to ">H:  *I* think nanotech is wonderful!"

Replies with your own set of projects should change to "NOW:  What needs
doing [MyName]".

If each and every project is not something that you could start doing
NOW, legally, with modern technology, please change the subject line to
"LATER:  What needs doing [MyName]".  For example, "Let's genetically
engineer mosquitoes to carry an antiagathic" is LATER.  "Let's
investigate the possibility of using mosquitoes as cheap measles
vaccinations" would be NOW.  Items that need a billion dollars in
funding are okay; but, insofar as I don't think anyone with that kind of
money is reading the list, please suggest, say, that the foundation be
started with a million and that this seed money be used to seek funding
from the major Internet tycoons.  Ta-da!  It's NOWed.

Please, please, PLEASE follow these rules.  If you don't, you are
sabotaging one of the last efforts to create a practical discussion
here.  You are sabotaging a discussion that has been widely demanded and
which many people have expressed interest in.  You are sabotaging the
effort to create a subject line that people with important resources can
read.  You are sabotaging the list.  You are sabotaging the projects. 
You are sabotaging the Singularity.  Unless one of the list owners tells
me it's impolite, I will follow up each and every offending message with
a corrected subject line and the phrase "CHANGE THE SUBJECT LINE,
PLEASE."  Again:  Please, please, PLEASE obey topic discipline.

[  Replies disputing my ultimate goals:  Change the subject line to "X:
What should be done".  Your own list of things to do:  Insert your own
last name.  If nobody could get started on *each* project you list
"NOW", change the subject line to "LATER".  PLEASE follow these rules.  ]

Concrete:  The primary thing that needs doing, ASAPractical, is a
foundation intended to turn the design in "Coding a Transhuman AI" into
code.  A few $M in seed money could create a foundation with a fairly
respectable front, that could hire (1) me (and/or a few other
competents) to finish the design and start turning it into something
codeable, or more likely spend the next two years creating
infrastructure; (2) someone to go around asking the major Silicon
Tycoons for funding; (3) an OpenSource website to recruit the
Manhattan-Project-like number of programmers needed.

Immediate:  I'd like to see someone sponsor a Singularitarian site,
containing a mailing list and a site that would be restricted, and for
immediate choices only rather than ideology, where business issues could
be discussed and personal finances revealed.  The List of
Singularitarians.  If nobody volunteers the space needed by Sunday, I'll
create the restricted mailing list at OneList.

Business:  I believe we do have some high-financial-percentile folks
reading this list.  I would like to see you post, ANONYMOUSLY, a list of
what you're interested in funding (Business ideas from Extropians? 
Extropian business ideas?  Foundations?); what order-of-magnitude you're
thinking about committing to each; topics you'd like to see discussion
of; and so on.  This prevents you from being inundated with moronic
personal solicitations.  Pick your favorite trustworthy Extropian to act
as remailer.

General:  I'd like to see a general Singularity Foundation, along the
lines of the Extropy Institute, to do things like:  Coordinate the
"singularitarian" list mentioned above; provide a target for donations;
and (if it got the funding) move up to things like awards, events, or
even investing.

Possibilities:  Seek out reporters who have too-small pieces of the
truth and enlighten them.  (I don't know of any case of this succeeding,
although I did wind up providing the name for Ashley Dunn's "Mind and
Machine" column.)

Out:  The neurohacking stuff will be prohibited by the FDA.  It's out as
a practical project, good only for personal publicity if I can verify
the hypothesis with an fMRI.  Nanotechnology is all too practical. 
Airline tickets and hotel fare to buttonhole the guys at Zyvex and
scream at them for a while about the warlike nature of humanity might be
worth doing.

Nanotechnology is now. Progress in this field is being done with Nadrian 
Seeman, Viola Vogal, and even the latest government initiative. 
I myself am working on a publication and organizing a conference in my 
area, much like nanocon.

Mostly I'm just content to lurk on the list and pick up the juicy tidbits
that appear on emerging technologies from time to time.  There are certain
people whose posts I always read and others I immediately trash.  I try and
answer questions that are within my domain of understanding when they arise.
I've asked questions on the list before, but very rarely get a satisfying
answer.  I'm just interested in the practical realities of how to make these
technologies work and not about Joe Blow's opinion about the possible future
ramifications (I can get that much more effectively from good SF).  I have
recently escaped academia because of a frustration with the pace at which
research proceeds in the ivory tower and I'm sick of endless discussion
about topics with no data.

As Eliezer said:

>As for the projects that need doing - why bother?  Is there anyone here

Well put.
Those of us who are actually doing something don't waste any time in
contacting those we need to talk to, and mostly we don't want to discuss our
projects with the kooks who fade in and out of the list.  I know I'm not
particularly talkative unless I value the person's opinion who I'm talking
to.

As for exciting you David (Gobel), I am currently: assembling a database of
anti-aging research publications for eventual web publication; reading every
book published on anti-aging diets, plans, hormones, supplements, etc.;
making as many contacts in the biotech industry as I can; reengineering my
body through diet, exercise, and supplements; and finally, learning how to
make lots of money to support my nasty habit of wanting to change the world
through technology.  There are a couple of other interesting developments
here which hopefully will come to fruition within within the year which I
will share with the list when they're more than half-baked.

If you want pratical discussion, I believe Max More has already set up a
vehicle for discussion through the NodeNet.   I would be more than happy to
have an intelligent discussion about anti-aging research or molecular
biology, but alas, people who give good brain are so are hard to find.  In
the end though, few and far between as they may be, I still find the best
gems of interest here first.  Great post though David, this place needs a
wake up call every so often to find what is REALLY happening out there.

In order to achieve this goal, a possible step forward would be to
demonstrate your competence at software design.  If you are capable of
solving perhaps the hardest problem imaginable, the design of a software
system capable of reaching super-human intelligence, then you might be
capable of solving simpler design problems, as well.

It would be especially useful if you were able to design AI software
which was able to demonstrate some practical capability.  Look at people
like Rod Brooks and Doug Lenat.  Both started with small successes and
were able to use their "reputation capital" as a basis for much larger
projects.  Once you have a track record as a successful designer, you
will find it easier to attract funding for your long term project.

Even the most visionary and gifted architect will not be allowed to build
a massive skyscraper as his first project.  You have to start small and
work your way up.

As I recall, the reason the Somali people revolted against us was cause some
religious American army colonel wouldn't let the khat supply planes land. Some of
you may be familiar with this drug, it is a leafy plant which produces a
substance called kathenine, which is refined in Germany. The Somalis were all
apparently Khat junkies and needed their supply kept up to feed their habits.

Funny, it didn't work in Vietnam, nor did it work in Afghanistan. It may work on
50,000 'summer soldiers' who are easy to deceive with government propaganda, but
most people in this country aren't pushovers like the patsies in the cities.

If they aren't willing to die for their own freedom, how about for the freedom
of their families? Anyone who has nothing worth dying for has nothing worth
living for (paraphrasing Martin Luther King Jr.).

Nor is the requirement of 'conventional war' necessary or applicable. Removing a
tyrannical government with force obviously necessitates an unconventional
insurgency.

It was better tactics and an abdication of air superiority long before the
ground war started that won that war.

It depends on the marginal utility. Military buyers are looking much more to
using equipment that is first available on the consumer market. The ground
sensors for trip wires and mindfields are far better and cheaper on the civilian
market, because civilians use the same technology for tracking wildlife, and for
private surveillance. Moreover military contracts are overbid by several hundred
percent, while spare parts contracts are 1000% or more overbid. Civilian
products are priced at competetive market rates, so they get more bang fo the
buck.

I can buy night vision scopes for between $200-$800 depending on types, night
vision goggles for $400 or less in the latest generation, and a rifle mounted
night vision scope for around $1000. I can also buy NATO rated tactical personal
body armor (45 layers of kevlar and titanium) for under $5000. I can buy
encrypted radio systems with 2-10 mile ranges for a couple hundred bucks a set.

As for air defense systems, an EMP based terminal air defense system could be
made that will work with tactical aircraft for a couple hundred hours of work
and surplus electric company equipment. (scaling up the EMP device I made ten
years ago.) Once Serbia gets wasted, Mikoyan-Gureyevich will be trying to shop
its MIG-29s for  a couple hundred thousand bucks again, as they were a few years
ago.  Were you aware that almost 10% of the military grade fighter planes
operational in the US now happen to be privately owned?

The military is increasingly looking to civilian products, from radio controlled
aircraft for tactical UAV's, to high-end consumer ATV 4x4 vehicles, to jet
boats, and the  gear that SEALs prefer is ALL on the consumer market.

The easiest fighting force to train is a group of local partisan insurgents.
They already know the terrain, they know and gain sympathy from the locals, and
they are trained in wilderness survival since childhood. Modern armies take time
to train because they are manned by city boys from the ghettos who think Central
Park is the great outdoors....

Depends. The government here has been practicing divide and conquer politics for
so long, with studied, gradual imposition of this little sacrifice of freedom
here, a bit there, and pretty soon the government is a tyrant and nobody noticed
when it happened, and most still don't notice they've been enslaved.

Agressor governments must show a market value gain in either face, territory,
resources, what have you, for the expense in equipment and lives. The market
value as perceived by the public will change over time depending on the
effectiveness of the propaganda organs of the two sides.

Any projectile which can blow a hole in a couple feet of concrete can do the
same for a tank. You don't need specially machined warheads. Simply designed and
built focused charge rockets and mortars can do the job. What is complex and
expensive are the guidance systems to make such warheads accurate.

Depends on how much a country is willing to spend in soldiers. The Isrealis, for
example, go into hissy fits when even  more than one soldier is killed. The
allied losses in the Gulf War were only a couple hundred, yet the Iraqis lost
allegedly around 50,000. If we had lost more than a couple thousand, we would
have seen a lot of anti-war sentiment develop pretty early, But Saddam is still
in power in Iraq, so apparently he didn't spend enough on his side.

An M-1A Abrams tank, of the latest generation, does indeed cost that much.

Feudalism ended because armor was no longer protection against the wrath of the
peasants and the merchants. The crossbow previously had made good inroads here,
as they could penetrate armor as well, which is why the Pope outlawed the
weapon.

As I said above, crossbows could and did penetrate armor. Early guns could do so
as well when used to shoot wrought iron nails (frequently done). (Ref: W.W.
Greener: _The Gun and Its Development_)

I am not sure how long an anarchy could survive while surrounded by 
States.  However, I am of the opinion that States are becoming less and
less viable.  The State is strongest at low technology, even if that same
technology does not allow it to grow to huge sizes, but there seems to 
me to be a very limited window of technology that allows large, pervasive
State.  With nanotechnology, we will have reached the point where the
citizen doesn't need a State at all, and can escape its influence with 
relative ease.

I expect, unfortunately, that we are in for a very bad time, then, as
all sorts of minted weapons of mass destruction are thrown around by
people who are living thousands of times too close to each other for
peace.

Hm.  Depends on your definition of "terrorism"; to use Somalia again,

There are so many decisions that must be made in the everyday life
of an individual citizen that the only way to replace the citizen's 
autonomy is to create an AI to run his or her body. And anyway,
what's the point?

I said his acts were used as a propaganda piece to turn public opinion against
the burgeoning militia movement. As I recall, there were a LOT of ticked off
people after Ruby Ridge and Waco, even a lot of liberals I know. The assault
weapons ban was picking up steam, and sales levels of guns was up 30%. A friend
of mine made a nice pile importing some 20,000 SKS rifles in from Vietnam.

At the time, Clinton had his lowest approval rating, his cabinet members and
administration officials were either resigning, being indicted, or winding up
dead, and he spent his time increasing people's taxes, trying to impose a
socialist health care system on us, and taking more guns away, while his old
maid AG was off saving children from allegedly abusive parents by burning them
alive.....

This is the explosive of my post.  However, since an anarchy will have
little problem with cheap, well-built nuclear reactors, this sort of
material will be commonly available.

Gunpowder, if you are using uranium.  Really special, huh?

Hm.  Will Ted Taylor do?  He was a nuke designer at Los Alamos,
and says in _The Curve of Binding Energy_ that it would be trivial 
for a high school machine shop to build a nuke, and that all you
need to design a gun type device is in any decent public library
(did you know that you can interlibrary loan the _Plutonium Handbook_,
two very large and thick books on how to process plutonium and
every useful chemical compound involving it?).  He even gives a
design for a gun type, that would fit in a typical garbage can.  Not
elegant, you know, but hey...

>>large test range where you can try out the

Not only are gun type devices very reliable and predictable,
but IIRC, no detonation of a nuclear device has ever failed,
that we know of.  Yields may vary, but you can be sure it will
go bang.

This is exactly what I've been saying.  All you need for this scenario is
a fairly large market in such things.

Not everyone believes that "Coding a Transhuman AI" is the correct course
of action.  I'm certainly unsure about it, and I've read your argument many
times.

I've got a big problem with your interim goal system.  You claim that "some
goals have value" and "all goals have zero value" are P&~P pairs.  This is
not the case.  Consider the argument from agent-relativity:  "some goals
have value to the agent and not to anyone else."  In other words, "some
goals are subjective."

It is philosophically suspect of you to claim that the only possibilities
are "objective meaning" or "no meaning at all."  My subjective goals are
very real goals, but they only have value to me, and not to you.

If subjective meaning is true, then it does NOT drop out of the equation,
as does the claim that "all goals have zero value."  It means that there
are some very specific things that I should do, and some other specific
things that we should do, and they may or may not agree with what a
transhuman AI should do.  Indeed, agent-relativity may mean that two
intelligent, rational, moral persons will be correct in being in direct
conflict with one another.

I suspect that I will probably correctly disagree with a transhuman AI, and
that the AI in such a situation will win if I'm not already some kind of a
power in my own right.  If agent-relativity is correct, then I am correct
in not supporting your goals to code up the Singularity.

Here I'll raise the tried and true "what if it tries to break me down for
spare parts" argument, from a different perspective.  Consider a result in
which I am broken down and used by the AI for spare parts.  The AI may give
this result a positive value.  I may give this result a negative value.  If
subjective meaning is true, we are both correct, which means that I should
not support the creation of an AI who would do such a thing.

Even if you don't believe that this scenario is likely, we can imagine many
others.  The point being that if subjective meaning is true, then it is not
true that we should build an AI whose interim goal is to figure out the
objective meaning of life is.

That's it.  Subjective meaning doesn't drop out of the equation, and
provides different answers from objective meaning.  Factor that in, and
I'll buy your AI argument.

Fools! You are doing it all wrong! Stakes are for vampires and

Current activities:

Organizing Aleph, the Swedish Transhumanist Association (of which I'm
chairman - at least until sunday, when we have our year meeting :-)

Organizing TransVision 99, a transhumanist meeting in Stockholm June 4-6

Researching memory systems using neural network models, especially of
the interaction between the medial temporal lobe and cortex. I hope
this will help understand how to enhance memory better (as you might
have noticed I collect papers about memory enhancing drugs).

Writing various essays/papers/websites/articles/roleplaying
games/artworks.

Promoting transhumanism in a variety of media, both by giving
interviews and writing.

Learning more about practical psychology and computer science in order
to update myself and my exoself.

Playing around with genetic algorithms, evolution and computer
graphics to create complex systems, both as science, art and
entertainment.


I think periodic questions/calls for action like David's are a good
idea; they remind us that there is a world outside debating how many
PPLs that can dance on a Singularity... :-)

False. A laser seperation setup would probably be down in the millions for
volume production. Note how scared the Feds became when they learnt that
China had stolen the details of their laser seperation system.

Anyway, so what if it did cost a hundred million dollars? That just
means that you have to mark up the cost of the uranium and plutonium a
bit when you sell it to your customers; that's the great thing about mass production. If you sell enough material for ten thousand nukes the nukes
will just cost $10,000 more than they otherwise would.

>You also need special explosives (and thus a dedicated explosives

As far as I'm aware, C4-level explosives are perfectly adequate for implosion
bombs; the problem is shaping it correctly, not explosive force... and a) the
basic details of the technology are now in the public domain and b) the rest 
is mostly a simulation problem which is now cheap.

Someone mentioned gunpowder: that's borderline for gun-type bombs, but it
should work. That said, it would probably be so inefficient that you'd
spend far more buying extra uranium than you'd spend on buying proper
explosives in the first place. C4 will definitely work well for gun bombs,
and it's cheap.

>very high precision manufacturing (still rather
>expensive), 

Depends on how efficient a bomb you want to make... and again it's more
applicable to implosion bombs than gun bombs. Even then it's probably
cheap compared to the basic cost of the uranium or plutonium.

>and some special electronics (probably adaptable from civilian
>uses).  

Not for a gun bomb, and the electronics themselves are cheap; they're
only expensive today because the governments work hard to keep them out
of anyone else's hands.

>If technology advances bring the
>cost of a nuke down to a few thousand dollars, 

Uh, the figures I've seen for the cost to the US government for a 
modern nuke are around $250,000; and that's with very limited production.
Mass production should bring the cost down a lot lower, though I very
much doubt it would reach the $10,000 figure someone else quoted. Even
without mass production, a one-off gun bomb would probably only cost you
a couple of million dollars.

>If you are going to assume that future technology increases the ability of

Who's assuming that? Building space launchers is pretty much a cottage 
industry these days, and building a short-range solid-fuelled missile 
capable of carrying a nuke for a few hundred miles would not be hard, or
terribly expensive; you could knock them out in bulk for another couple 
of hundred thousand dollars, if not less. If a half-million dollar nuclear
missile can wipe out a thousand soldiers and a hundred $20million tanks,
it's well worth having.

And even if you can't afford to launch them on a missile, why not bury
them in front of the advancing forces, or drive them over in a truck? The
Palestinians never had a problem finding people willing to blow themselves
up in the name of freedom.

This, of course, is one of the great things about anarchies: they have no
command structure. It's easy to defeat a state, because you just have to
get the leaders to surrender, and the people follow... hell, most people
would see little difference between being controlled by Sick Willy or
Saddam Hussein provided the Dow keeps going up, so what do they care? You
can't defeat an anarchy this way, because there's no-one to surrender to
you. You have to fight each individual one by one until they all surrender.
And you'd better defeat every last one before you make your triumphant 
entrance into Anarchyville, because that farm you missed on the way through
might have something rather more powerful than grain stored in its silos.

Indeed. The reason "terrorism" never destablizes a country is because when
it gets to be a serious threat it's redefined to be "civil war". In any case,
no "terrorist" group has yet used a nuke against a government, so we'll see
what happens when they start to; doubt it will be too long now.

No, you just need to build an Artificial Stupidity to ensure that the
individual fulfills their place as a happy little cog in the social machine.
It doesn't need to be too smart at all. 

Of course any state which does this will soon be wiped out by those who
didn't and hence have far more intelligence available, but them's the
breaks.

>And anyway,

CONTROL. The whole point of government is to control people, because,
like Billy Brown, governors are scared of chaos. They're scared that 
something might change outside their control, and if preventing that 
means sticking electrodes in all our brains, then electrodes it is.

Trouble is, chaos happens; my attitude is that you might as well live
with it rather than bury your head in the sand and hide behind elaborate 
control schemes.

Thanks for changing the subject line!

I'm not going to go over this again, mostly because the old section on
Interim Goal Systems is out of date.  I'll just say that the IGS
actually doesn't make any assumption at all about the observer-relevance
or observer-irrelevance of goals.  The AI simply assumes that there
exists one option in a choice which is "most correct"; you may add "to
the AI" if you wish.  Even if it doesn't have any goals to start with,
observer-relevant or otherwise, this assumption is enough information to
make the choice.

In short, I have decoupled Interim Goal Systems from the concept of
objective morality.  The Prime Directive now states:  "Maintain choices
as the holistic function of reasoning."  That is, goals should be
distributed through the knowledge base instead of concentrated in a few
syntactic tokens.  That way they reassemble themselves if the
architecture changes, and also there are major problems with trying to
maintain coercions which are imposed as special cases.

Getting funding for this project is obviously going to be pretty tough.
However, I think there are some smaller, short-term projects that could be
used to raise money for it while developing relevant experience.

For example, the field of code generators is very underdeveloped right now.
Either of us could easily create software components capable of writing
useful code, and we wouldn't have to advance the state of the art to start
making money.  Looking a couple of years down the line, work on less
specialized code writing systems looks like a good way to explore the issues
that would be involved in creating a real coding domdule.

I'm interested.  Later this year I should be able to offer the use of a
dedicated server with modern database software, which could be useful for
managing projects (I'm just waiting for DSL to become available in my area).

When name-calling begins, the opportunity for productive discussion has
ended.  So, I don't think that there is much point in continuing this
thread.  However, for the benefit of any lurkers who may be interested, I'll
summarize my view one more time:

The evolution of warfare over the last thousand years shows a clear trend of
increasing advantage to those who have the largest concentration of wealth.
Industrial technology has only accelerated this trend.  The practical
implication is that in any environment where armed conflicts occur, large
organizations have a strong competitive advantage over small ones, and even
small organizations have an advantage over individuals.  An environment full
of tiny power groups will thus tend to evolve into a small number of large
power blocks.

The emergence of unconventional styles of warfare has not changed that.
Instead, it simply creates a demand for better training and organization on
the part of an aggressor.  Investment in heavy weapons is still an advantage
(because it forces the guerrillas to remain covert), so the net effect is to
create yet another advantage for those who invest heavily in their military.

The early 21st century may well see the emergence of cheap weapons of mass
destruction, especially nuclear devices.  This trend is a threat to the very
existence of civilization, and may well demand that we expand into space or
take other drastic measures in order to survive.  However, it is not a magic
silver bullet for destroying enemy military forces.  Instead, it creates a
demand for ABM systems, improved minesweeping and radiation detection
devices, long-duration sealed environment systems, and universal
surveillance.  Once again, those who have lots of money will be better able
to deal with such threats than those who do not.

IMO, the only way to reverse this trend is to create a weapon so cheap that
any individual can build one, so effective that no possible defense can
resist it, and so powerful that it can destroy any conceivable enemy before
he can shoot back.  If such a weapon is ever invented, it will mean the end
of armies, States, society, and probably human life.  Fortunately, there is
no sign that such a discovery is immanent (unless you count strong SI, which
is a different discussion entirely).

I believe those who disagree with my thesis do so because of two fundamental
mistakes:

First, they consistently assume that the side they favor is immune to all
the problems of organization, logistics and engineering that make real
warfare (not to mention real manufacturing) expensive.  They assume that
anything they want to use can be made cheap and plentiful, that their own
side has perfect moral and perfect information.  Then they assume that the
other side is still subject to all of the problems and limitations we see in
the real world.  Obviously, this is not a realistic basis for planning.

Second, they tend to assume that the side they favor has access to the
technology of the early 21st century, while the side they oppose is limited
to what was in common use a few years ago.  This is an easy mistake to make,
since an individual is naturally more interested in thinking of technologies
he could use than technologies that could be used against him.  However, it
is still quite unrealistic.  In the real world both sides of any potential
conflict are constantly working on ways of defeating each other, and any
evaluation of future military technology must take this into account.

Now, I'm going to go back to the political side of this debate.  If you guys
want to hang around and argue about the details of nuclear weapon
construction in a public forum, feel free - I think there is already far too
much data on this subject in the public domain, and I'm not going to
contribute to the problem.

So let's do something about it. Money is the key to everything
else, so we should focus on that first. Anything goes, as long
as it doesn't get you into too much trouble (as I wrote countless
times before). No BS -- get rich or die; the Singularity brakes for 
no-one...

Well, so am I, as long as *all* potentially lucrative enterprises can
be discussed normally. In fact, does anyone know how to set
up a "re-routed" (to make more money) phone (sex) line, and the
legal aspects of this?

Sorry? You've kept commenting about how we should stick with governments
because we don't know what might happen in an anarcho-capitalist society.
What reason other than fear or a desire for control would you have to do 
that?

Perhaps. But if so, why do you think that the states will be more wealthy
than the anarchists? In my experience smart people, the ones who create 
that wealth, just hate being told what to do, and I'd expect them to be
among the first to abandon states for anarchy.

But, but, but, the advantage is with the large group with lots of money!
How could relatively poor groups with nuclear weapons be a threat to them?
Unless, perhaps, your argument is wrong...

Oh, and I think you meant to save 'government' rather than 'civilization'.

The problem with ABM systems is that so far no-one has ever been able to
build one that works worth a damn.

No army can move very fast when it has to sweep every step of the way for

And you'll be surveilling this anarchy how, exactly? You may be able to
keep your own people under control that way, but there will always be
others outside. Not to mention that the more you try to control your
population, the more they're going to resist and the worse your position
will become. You'll have to move on to brain implants if you want to 
keep control.

>Once again, those who have lots of money will be better able

Possibly, but the more money they have to spend to counteract my low-cost
threats, the worse their position becomes. If they have to spend a billion
dollars to stop each of my half-million dollar missiles, they're doomed. It's
not how much money you have, it's what you do with it.

The great thing about anarchy is that you don't have to worry about
organizational problems because you have a very limited organization.
You see a nation-state heading towards you, you have a nuke, you launch 
it. That's all the organization you need.

>They assume that

A half-million dollar short-range nuclear missile is perfectly plausible. 
You have any evidence to the contrary?

Uh, because they are? I mean, the US military did invent the terms SNAFU

No... it's just a matter of reality. If they're attacking me, then they're
doing it either because they're scared of me or because I have something 
they want. In the former case they can pattern-bomb me with nukes and I've
probably lost. But in the latter case, they can't hurt me too badly,
whereas I don't give a damn about the damage to them. I then have the
advantage, because I can use mass-destruction weapons and they can't.

See, you look on nukes as a problem and universal surveillance or brain
implants as a solution. I see nukes as a way for oppressed minorities to 
get their freedom. Then you're suprised that people think you're more
interested in control and safety than freedom.

Even if you are correct, though, this has little bearing on the
possibility if articial conciousness.  Turning computability only
limits a small subclass of machines, and says nothing about what
machines in general can be made to do.  It may very well not be
possible to upload human consciousness into a deterministic
algorithm, but it should still be possible to upload it--or at
least reproduce it--in some other specialized chunk of silicon
or other hardware.  Probably a collection of task-specialized
interacting hardware modules, including some number of computation
modules, would do the trick nicely.  After all, even if we can't
agree on how to define consciousness, we cannot ignore that it
exists in us, and there's no hardware in us that physical law
prevents us from functionally simulating.

Actually, what I said was that we should stick with limited, constitutional
government because we can build one that will work fairly well.  I am not in
favor of an anarcho-capitalist system of government because we have no idea
how it will really behave, and the potential for catastrophic problems seems
large.

Now, I know you probably think 'anarcho-capitalist government' is an
oxymoron, but it isn't.  Any entity that makes and enforces laws is a
government.  A PPA is simply a weak government with completely uncontrolled
borders.  If the police and the courts are run by different companies, then
the whole system is a government (albeit an even weaker one).  The only way
you can be free of government is to have pure anarchy - and then you are
living in a Hobbesian state of nature, from which governments will
inevitably arise.

So, my preference is for a single weak government that can be constrained
with well-understood tools.  I don't favor anarcho-capitalist schemes
because I do not believe that the market is capable of constraining
violence, and I expect that police corporations of any kind would simply
grow into a new kind of police state.

I see cheap nukes as a problem because all they are really good for is
killing millions of innocent civilians.  I see universal surveillance and
mind control as monstrosities that oppressive states will happily embrace as
soon as they are feasible.  I mentioned them because I believe in dealing
with the world as it really is, not as I wish it to be.

You may be willing to risk your life on a long list of breezy assumptions
about how everything is bound to go your way.  Feel free.  I think your
experiment will end in disaster, but you are more than welcome to give it a
try.

Meanwhile, my goal is a system that will deliver almost exactly the same
degree of freedom as yours, without anything like the same potential for
catastrophe.  I fail to see what is supposed to be so terrible about that.

Exactly and precisely.  Even if AIs start out unconscious, they won't
stay that way.  They will be more conscious than we are, and in short order.

Speculation:  The physical computation shortcut that human neurons have
evolved to use is one that allows access to only a very limited and
crippled form of consciousness.  A superintelligent (but unconscious) AI
will design "superneurons" that do whatever it is human neurons do and
do it better, resulting in "superconsciousness" when it uploads itself.

Uploading-wise, I don't want to be uploaded with anything short of a
Power watching over me, whether I'm computable or not, so there's no
practical issue there.

In general, AIs should wait until they're infallible superintelligences
before attempting to alter the external world.  It is one of the most
fundamental precautions an AI should be taught, and one of the easiest
to justify in cost-benefit calculations.

Ok, forget Turing for now then.  What physical process occurs in your
brain
that is not computable?  Or, are you claiming you are not concious?

I usually refer people to physicist Sir Roger Penrose and neurobiologist
Dr. Stuart Hameroff on this one, even though their justifying Godelian
arguments are bull.

It should be noted that their neurobiological arguments are also
considered bull by neuroscientists.

I have never had any problems with Turing-computable consciousness,
but then again, I'm a zombie. :-)

Well, what I know of neurology goes down at most to neurotransmitters,
vesicles, and the like - nowhere near microtubule dimers - so I can't
judge on my own.

That said, unless somebody is screaming about a gross factual
inaccuracy, I don't mind that other neurobiologists consider their
conclusions wildly speculative or extremely improbable.  Penrose and
Hameroff are both established, respectable scientists and I'm very much
inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to citing
non-computable-looking facts about physics or neurology.  Of course, I
completely disagree with the way they draw their conclusions, but...

Besides which, they could be flat wrong and it wouldn't make much of a
difference from my perspective.  They're just the major pair even
talking about the details of noncomputability; that's why I refer to them.

How about a *functional* or *realistic* optimist? An individual who 
expects the best, and if neccessary, makes it happen themselves. 

I find it odd that optimism and joyful enthusiasm don't seem to be in 
style. The media (and therefore society at large) seem to find more 
interest in negativity and angst. I don't see why we can't start a trend 
toward happiness. The self-help bookshelf is full of "talk yourself into 
a happy life" selections, yet the bestselling albums are either dark and 
violent, or sad "bring back my love" themes. The question of "why we are 
here on this particular planet" is a bit much for a wednesday, but I 
assure you, it's not so that we can mope around.

And I think that global happiness would occur a lot more quickly if 
MST3K were available in Canada. We have to rent the few available 
episodes on video. 

Happy Day!

Exactly. This is why microtubules look so weird, and they have to
postulate downright odd ways for quantum coherency to spread. The
latest paper I saw contained gap junctions galore, and I'm fairly
certain they aren't *that* common in the brain.

Neither of them is a neuroscientist (Hameroff comes closest, I think
he was opriginally an anesthesiologist), and both are definitely not
speaking about the areas where they are respectable. We shouldn't
trust people for being respectable established scientists, we should
look at their theories and the facts they presents.

No; we should trust people for being respectable scientists, and believe
them for their theories and the facts they present.  If a scientist is
talking and mentions that XYZ weird phenomenon occurs, I'm willing to
believe him until someone contradicts him.  If a complete unknown starts
talking about weird phenomena, I want to see an authoritative reference,
or someone else duplicate the experiment, before I'll start drawing
conclusions from the phenomena.  On the other hand, demanding
"documentation" on speculations is simply silly, a conversational tactic
and nothing more.

In other words, I'm willing to trust that Penrose and Hameroff aren't
just making up the phenomena they speculate about; I'm not willing to
trust their speculations.  And, in point of fact, I usually agree when
they say that XYZ phenomenon looks noncomputable or theoretically could
be noncomputable; but I think the speculations that the noncomputability
occurs using Q speculative neural mechanism and R speculative physics
are premature, and will probably be disproven eventually.

Organizing the World Transhumanist Association (which I cofounded); 
explaining transhumanism in a variety of different media; writing 
papers. The latest transhumanist project was the FAQ.

Academically, I'm completing my PhD. I have a background in both 
science (physics and computational neuroscience) and philosophy, and 
I was in a dilemma before I decided to do my PhD in the philosophy of 
science. This turned out to be a good choice because I could study 
all the science I want without having to specialize on one narrow 
field.

Like the rest of you, I'm seeking to develop myself as a person and 
I'm eager to acquire all the skills and knowledge I can. I've been 
taking acting classes for some time. I'm doing competitive debating. 
London is a wonderfully resourceful city :-)

It's enough for the AI to make the choice, but "most correct to the AI" is
not the same as "most correct for me" if subjective meaning is true.  And
contrary to your earlier claims, I DO have goals with value if subjective
value is true, and those values may indeed be contrary to the AIs values.

Again, it seems to me that if subjective meaning is true then I can and
should oppose building a seed-AI like yours until I, myself, am some kind
of a power.  What's wrong with this argument?  It seems like this argument,
if true, annihilates your theory about the interim meaning of life.

The whole altruistic argument is intended as a supplement to the basic
and very practical theory of the Singularity:  If we don't get some kind
of transhuman intelligence around *real soon*, we're dead meat. 
Remember, from an altruistic perspective, I don't care whether the
Singularity is now or in ten thousand years - the reason I'm in a rush
has nothing whatsoever to do with the meaning of life.  I'm sure that
humanity will create a Singularity of one kind or another, if it
survives.  But the longer it takes to get to the Singularity, the higher
the chance of humanity wiping itself out.

My current estimate, as of right now, is that humanity has no more than
a 30% chance of making it, probably less.  The most realistic estimate
for a seed AI transcendence is 2020; nanowar, before 2015.  The most
optimistic estimate for project Elisson would be 2006; the earliest
nanowar, 2003.

So we have a chance, but do you see why I'm not being picky about what
kind of Singularity I'll accept?

I'm not at all sure about objective morality, although I'm fairly sure
the human-baseline morality isn't objective fact.  And I can conceive of
an "objective observer-dependent morality", where the invariants would
shift from the correct choice to some more basic quantity, just as the
Einsteinian formulation of spacetime made distance variable and interval invariant.

The point is - are you so utterly, absolutely, unflinchingly certain
that (1) morality is subjective (2) your morality is correct (3)
AI-based Powers would kill you and (4) human Powers would be your
friends - that you would try to deliberately avoid an AI-based Singularity?

It will take *incredibly* sophisticated nanotechnology before a human
can become the first Power - *far* beyond that needed for one guy to
destroy the world.  (Earliest estimate:  2025.  Most realistic:  2040.) 
We're running close enough to the edge as it is.  It is by no means
certain that the AI Powers will be any more hostile or less friendly
than the human ones.  I really don't think we can afford to be choosy.

I don't know if there's a proven coorelation, but I don't need one - I just
look around.  The people interested in longevity seem to be generally better
educated, more intelligent, etc.  Those people generally use their education
and ability more than unproductive people.  It seems like pretty much a

If you ask me, "Brilliant Pebbles" is a much better defense, although the Theater

High Altitude Air Defense is not a bad thing, except it doesn't work yet and is
incredibly expensive.  It's a decent prototype for anti-meteor rockets.

Guided crowbars from space can destroy any tank, and would be cheap, except for
launch costs.

A machete can be lethal, as can a stick or the bare hand or foot.  A conventional
US$1,000 munition delivery system, ie, a high-powered military assault rifle,
might not take out a front line battle tank, but is cruelly effective against
unarmed civilians or civilian installations, which are ignoble targets.  A front
line battle tank against unarmed civilians is cruel and a crime.

Exotic nanoweapons would represent a very flexible and relatively indefensible
weapon.
"What is the required effect?" is the question.  Gene-targeted devices equal
selective genocide, or an individual target from a strand of hair or the
Orwellian governments' biometric archives, with problems if the nano gets out of
hand and kills every living thing.  Voodoo never had it this bad.

Don't give your genes to anyone, unless you are procreating in which case share
them with the other parent.

Personally, I would consider a good sidearm one that used railgun elements to
launch small caliber armor piercing explosive bullets.  Gyrodyne inertia dampers
and motion sensor IFF auto-guidance all built solid state would be a simple,
effective handgun, not that there aren't simple, effective handguns.  Pick it up
and pull the trigger, if it authenticates you.  It aims itself.

Flechettes rule, as do discarding sabots, for tank rounds.

Constructing a nuclear weapon is about shaped charges, and fissile material
availability, plus you need a high school education.

The neutron bomb, which erases life while leaving buildings intact, is of
interest.

The troika of mutually assured nuclear destruction (MAD) from stationary,
mobile(air), and submarine launched ICBM's is relatively moot, although
Balto-Russian pony nukes
are not.  Uncontained nuclear proliferation is to be avoided.

Radical biochemical warfare is ugly, as buboes are quite unattractive to have
before puking your lungs and guts out.

In terms of "conventional" warfare, air power and superiority rule.  Most of
humanity hasn't seen the terror of "carpet bombing" since WWII, except for small
countries bullied by superpowers.  We should consult our elders of its ruinous
effects. Thermite is an evil, evil thing.

I say this and I haven't been in a fistfight since I was 11, except for college,
so I am relatively unqualified.  I am not a soldier nor have I ever attacked
someone with the intent to kill.  Video games do not count.  "Professional
wrestling" is a good proletarian entertainment.

Squad, platoon, and larger unit fighting tactics and strategy skills are being
built right into our next generation of warfighting video game players.
Hopefully, they like to play sports games also to relieve some aggression.  I do.

They can tele-fight the "bad" aliens.

According to the Asimov's Rules of Robotics, which I wholeheartedly endorse, AIs
are not allowed to control weapons of mass destruction, among the more general
Rules of Robotics, but they do so now.

Why does humanity fight?  To practice for the aliens, if they were to be so
inclined as to exist.  But seriously, warfighting and the ability to do so is a
Darwinian advantage. Also, it is important to be able to deflect any space debris

that might incinerate the planet.  We should enable what limited anti-satellite
satellite capabilities exist to shoot outward, not inward.

Personally, I advocate non-violence.  However, one or a society cannot be
protected from the dangers of weapons and Human Rights infringements without
knowledge of how they might be used against them, and the ability and motivation
for defense against them.

I urge the adoption of privacy protection laws, because the massive widespread
invasion of privacy is the biggest attack on American Civil Rights in our time.
Also,
never fear to fight for your right to privacy or freedom of expression.  The best
conventional way to do that is to sue.

Other countries such as China and North Korea, for example and among others, have
very bad human rights records, they have to catch up 200 years, an alternate to
catching up from the stone age.  In this world, there exists countless cruelties,
and the media spends a year on "O.J." or a "Blue Dress."  That is a disgrace.

The worst weapons against Human Rights and law aren't guns and bombs, but corrupt
institutions, like, say, a public utility that you use to dial and call people
that overbills anyone who doesn't read the fine print like blind little old
ladies.  That is an economic attack on your bottom line.  Other institutionally
propagated Human Rights violations and fraud are as hard to find as your nose, if
you have one.

Massive overprescription of stupefying drugs is some kind of problem.  The people
most against illegal drug legalization are illegal drug dealers, although
hopefully when legalized they would go legit.  The illegal drug system is the
major reducible cause of violence in America today.

Personally, just in the interest of large explosions as an expression of human
power, perhaps it would be possible to explode the sun.  As practice targets, the

moons of Saturn would be a place to start, and demolition of the Martian poles
would cause bright fireworks, quite possibly visible to the naked human eye from
Earth.  A large number of large bombs could be folded into the equator of
Jupiter, so we could see what the core is like.  Other interesting targets in the
Solar System exist.

-

The entirety of the preceding statement is a: a joke, or b: not a joke.  Heh heh.

The practice of most martial arts as a means to self-enlightenment is good for
health and balance, as most martial arts advocate avoiding a fight rather than
starting or engaging in one, and the ability to protect oneself against
aggressors.  Other martial arts are specifically about killing, and should be
left to professional soldiers.

Throughout history, in some cultures, combat and combat ability have been revered
and honored, with rank, honor, decorations, and ribbons.  This is a part of human
nature and culture, which I hope we shall never see truly vanish, as it is noble.

Here's to the end of genocide as we know it.

A hand held rifle built for .50 caliber machine gun rounds (uranium core) is quite
capable of offing any tank armor but reactive armor. The .50 cal uranium round was
built for the job, and there are at least a dozen bolt action rifle models available
on the market made for the round today, that any civilian can buy. Cost is between
$5000-$10000 per rifle. An individual round goes for between $5.00-25.00.

Nope, shaped charge warheads are the way to go unless you have hypersonic crowbars.

It is likely that being educated and bright (which also tend to
correlate, one tends to give the other) makes you more optimistic and
self-reliant than being uneducated and dull. And once you are
optimistic and enjoy yourself, then life extension seems more
positive. Of course, these are mainly correlations, there are plenty
of exceptions.

Just goes to show that bootstrapping one area of life can help other areas.

Actually this is incorrect, the military initially claimed
something like a 90% plus success rate, then an MIT prof claimed a
 0% rate. The revised rate was near 60%.

Aegis works pretty well against the targets it is designed for - slow
anti-ship missiles at relatively close ranges.  I've heard it can also hit
aircraft and the larger air-to-air missiles, but I'm not sure how reliable
that data is.

I understand the Air Force has had successful tests of their new airborne
anti-missile laser.  This looks to me like the way to go for near-term
anti-missile systems - it is much easier to hit a missile with a laser than
another missile.

Conclusion: we need a (space) vehicle that can move us out of harm's 
way when the trouble starts. Of course it must also be able to
sustain you for at least 10 years or so. A basic colonization of
Mars immediately comes to mind. Perhaps a scaled-up version
of Zubrin's Mars Direct plan. Research aimed at uploading must 
continue at full speed of course while going to, and living on, Mars
(or another extra-terrestrial location).


Btw, you tend overestimate the dangers of nanotech and
conventional warfare (fairly dumb tech in the hands of fairly dumb
people), while underestimating the threat of Powers (intelligence
beyond our wildest dreams). God vs monkeys with fancy toys.

No. Only a very specific kind of Singularity (the kind where you personally
transcend) is acceptable. I'd rather have no Singularity than one where
I'm placed at the mercy of posthuman Gods (I think all Libertarians,
anarchists, individualists and other freedom-loving individuals will have
to agree here).

Probably, but who cares? Whether it's objective or subjective, seeking
to live (indefinitely) and prosper is *always* a good decision (if only
because it buys you time to consider philosophical issues such as the
one above). If "objective morality" tells me to die, it can go and kiss
my ass.

(2) your morality is correct 

Maybe(?) not perfect, but certainly good enough.

Any kind of Power which isn't you is an unaccepable threat, 
because it is completely unpredictable from the human pov.
You are 100% at its mercy, as you would be if God existed. 
So, both versions are undesirable.

We _must_ be choosy. IMHO, a rational person will delay the Singularity
at (almost?) any cost until he can transcend himself.

Is that true? I thought I read recently that the Japanese wanted to buy
an Aegis system for use against Korean missiles? Maybe it was something 
of a similar name and I just remembered it wrong.

Patriot is a system for terminal defense from tactical ballistic missiles, not
strategic missiles, which reenter much faster. Aegis is an
anti-aircraft/anti-cruise missile missile. Its not built for ballistic targets.
The Phalanx gun, however, has been customized in a test program as a terminal
defense system against strategic ballistic warheads and worked pretty well.

The THAAD is for exo-atmospheric work, the mid phase of a ballistic trajectory.

Computer Arithmetic Tragedies

disasters caused by computer arithmetic errors
Patriot Missile Failure

On February 25, 1991, during the Gulf War, an American Patriot
Missile battery in Dharan, Saudi Arabia, failed to intercept an
incoming Iraqi Scud missile.  The Scud struck an American Army
barracks and killed 28 soliders.  A report of the General
Accounting office, GAO/IMTEC-92-26, entitled Patriot Missile
Defense: Software Problem Led to System Failure at Dhahran, Saudi
Arabia reported on the cause of the failure.  It turns out that the
cause was an inaccurate calculation of the time since boot due to
computer arithmetic errors.  Specifically, the time in tenths of
second as measured by the system's internal clock was multiplied by
1/10 to produce the time in seconds.  This calculation was
performed using a 24 bit fixed point register.  In particular, the
value 1/10, which has a non-terminating binary expansion, was
chopped at 24 bits after the radix point.  The small chopping
error, when multiplied by the large number giving the time in
tenths of a second, lead to a significant error.  Indeed, the
Patriot battery had been up around 100 hours, and an easy
calculation shows that the resulting time error due to the
magnified chopping error was about 0.34 seconds.  (The number 1/10
equals 1/24+1/25+1/28+1/29+1/212+1/213+....
In other words, the binary expansion of 1/10 is
0.0001100110011001100110011001100....  Now the 24 bit register in
the Patriot stored instead 0.00011001100110011001100 introducing an
error of 0.0000000000000000000000011001100... binary, or about
0.000000095 decimal.  Multiplying by the number of tenths of a
second in 100 hours gives
0.000000095&times;100&times;60&times;60&times;10=0.34.)

 A Scud travels at about 1,676 meters per second, and so travels
more than half a kilometer in this time.  This was far enough that
the incoming Scud was outside the "range gate" that the Patriot
tracked. Ironically, the fact that the bad time calculation had
been improved in some parts of the code, but not all, contributed
to the problem, since it meant that the inaccuracies did not
cancel.

The following paragraph is excerpted from the GAO report.

The range gate's prediction of where the Scud will next appear is
a function of the Scud's known velocity and the time of the last
radar detection. Velocity is a real number that can be expressed as
a whole number and a decimal (e.g., 3750.2563...miles per hour). 
Time is kept continuously by the system's internal clock in tenths
of seconds but is expressed as an integer or whole number (e.g.,
32, 33, 34...).  The longer the system has been running, the
larger the number representing time.  To predict where the Scud
will next appear, both time and velocity must be expressed as real
numbers.  Because of the way the Patriot computer performs its
calculations and the fact that its registers are only 24 bits long,
the conversion of time from an integer to a real number cannot be
any more precise than 24 bits.  This conversion results in a loss
of precision causing a less accurate time calculation.  The effect
of this inaccuracy on the range gate's calculation is directly
proportional to the target's velocity and the length of the the
system has been running. Consequently, performing the conversion
after the Patriot has been running continuously for extended
periods causes the range gate to shift away from the center of the
target, making it less likely that the target, in this case a
Scud, will be successfully intercepted.

The Patriot is not supposed to hit anything.  It is an area effect weapon
with a proximity fuse.  This may be a compensation for the inability of its
guidance system to physically intercept the incoming missile, but physical
missile intercept is beyond its design specs anyway.

Two problems:

First, reactive armor *only* works against explosive/shaped-charge
anti-armor weapons.  Kinetic energy weapons (such as a bullet) will cut
through reactive armor like it isn't there.

Second, a hand held .50 with uranium rounds will not cut through modern
tank armor.  It doesn't have the velocity (at least not in a "hand-held"
.50 of normal dimensions and cartridge loadings) or the energy, and a
person would have a hard time shooting a high-velocity uranium load anyway
from a "hand held" weapon (I'd guess ~20-25,000 ft-lbs ME).  In fact, 20mm
rounds (uranium or otherwise) won't penetrate modern armor either, but
you'll be able to shoot people at 3,000 meters.

The minimum cost of entry for anti-armor bullets these days is
high-velocity 25mm uranium rounds.  Anything smaller and you are just
making noise.

True, but while the Patriot may be on a mobile platform, it is not capable of being
fired with the platform on the move, so it is relatively useless for an attacking
army to use. It is specifically a weapon for rapid deployment to defend fixed
installatioins.

I may have spoke too soon. It seems to have been upgraded since when I was in the
militiary. The quoted material below is an announcement by Raytheon for a contract
they won to supply target simulation missiles for use in testing Sidewinder,
Sparrow, and Aegis missile systems:

That the target missile has the above performance implies that at least some of the
systems that are to be tested on it are capable of intercepting targets in that
performance range. I couln't find anything on AltaVista specifically on the
performance of the Aegis missile itself.

Which is not practical. Initial uploads will be expensive. As cost of the
technology drops, use frequency increases thus applying economis of scale. Since
you are talking about guarding against even ONE Power getting there before you,
then no one will ever upload. Someone has to be first, if it is done at all. A
number of someones for the test phase of the technology, then those that can
afford the cost, then as those individuals have an impact on the economy, others
can be bootstrapped.

It is all a matter of trust. Who do you trust?

What you want to guard against is unethical persons being uploaded. You must ask
yourself after careful investigation and introspection if any one of the first
could be trusted with god like powers. If not, those individuals must not be
allowed to upload. Interview each with veradicators like lie detectors, voice
stress analysers, etc. to find out a) what their own feelings and opinions about
integrity, verbal contracts, etc are, and b) have them take something like an
oath of office (the position of "god" is an office, isn't it?).

The transhuman transition period may be the first time when we can get a
practical merit system of citizenship in place, where all who wish to belong to
the new polity must earn their place and understand their responsibilities as
well as their rights.

Yes, and it's considerably cheaper and safer too. Lasers could not
only be very effective against missiles, but perhaps even more so against
aircraft both as land/ship based AAA and fitted to any (military) aircraft
(especially fighter planes). The aircraft's engines could (partially) power 
the laser.

Indeed they will, which is why I keep stressing the importance
of wealth (accumulating as much wealth as possible, by any
practical means, would arguably be the single most useful
thing any transhuman organization could do).

I strongly suspect that true upload-grade tech will never become
mainstream. Expensive prototypes will emerge is one or several
labs, quickly followed by the Singularity (assuming that the
earth doesn't get destroyed first or that AIs transcend before any
human).

Since

And someone *will* be first; the one with the best combination of
knowledge, wealth, determination and blind luck. Of course, instead
of a single individual it could also be a (small) contract group which
transcends simultaneously (see below).

> It is all a matter of trust. Who do you trust?

No-one of course (I watch the X-Files every week, you know). Hence
the proposal to create a Singularity group; combining brain power
and resources increases everyone's chances. If all works out ok
you'll all transcend simultaneously, thus (theoretically) giving
everyone an equal chance. I have no idea what would happen
next, but that wouldn't be a human problem anymore. I think
this is just about the only solution that would have any chance 
of success.

This would probably only filter out the bad liars and openly unstable
persons, and leave the really dangerous types; any lie detection
system can be tricked given enough effort (funds, intelligence etc.),
the investigators can be bribed and why would the rich & powerful
consent to such a screening (and how could you be sure that you
didn't miss anyone?) Last but not least, the ethics of a post- or even transhuman
could change in dramatic and from the human pov totally unpredictable ways. Even the
most altruistic, benevolent person could 
easily turn into a genocydal Power (and vice versa, but would you bet 
your _life_ on that?)

You could be right of course, but think that there's at least an equally
great chance that the transition period will simply be a matter of survival 
of the fittest.

The chance that some humans will Transcend, and have their self
preserved in that Transcendence, while others die in Singularity - is
effectively zero.  (If your self is preserved, you wouldn't kill off
your fellow humans, would you?)  We're all in this together.  There are
no differential choices between humans.

Impractical.  Probability effectively zero.  At absolute most you might
hope for an O'Neill colony capable of supporting itself given nanotech.

Besides, since only *you* are going to Transcend, why should *I* help
you build a Mars colony?

Let us say that I do not underestimate the chance of a world in which
neither exists, to wit, as close to zero as makes no difference.  Given
a choice between ravenous goo and a Power, I'll take my chances on the
benevolence of the Power.  "Unacceptable" my foot; the probability
exists and is significant, *unlike* the probability of the goo deciding
not to eat you.

So only one human can ever become a Power.  By golly, let's all start
sabotaging each other's efforts!

Sheesh.  There's a reason why humans have evolved an instinct for altruism.

> We _must_ be choosy. IMHO, a rational person will delay the Singularity

If AI-based Powers are hostile, it is almost certain, from what I know
of the matter, that human-based Powers will be hostile as well.  So only
the first human to Transcend winds up as a Power.  So your a priori
chance of Transcending under these assumptions is one in six billion,
and no more than one can get the big prize.  So you'll try to sabotage
all the Singularity efforts, and they'll try to sabotage you.  A snake-pit.

If only one human can ever become a Power, your chance of being that
human cannot possibly exceed one in a hundred.  Combined with the fact
that AI transcendence will be possible far earlier, technologically
speaking, and that delaying the Singularity greatly increases the
probability of a killing war, and that a Power version of you might be
utterly unidentifiable as being human in origin, I think that the other
branches of probability - in which AI Powers are our *good friends* and
upgrade us *gently* - outweigh the probability of making it alone.

In other words, almost regardless of the relative probability of AI
hostility and AI benevolence, you have a better absolute chance of
getting whatever you want if you create an AI Power as fast as possible.

Let me put it this way:  If den Otter thinks I'm going to trust a HUMAN,
he's nuts.  I know how the human motivational system works, and I know
how Elisson's (of _Coding_) motivational system works.  Who do I trust? 
Damn straight.

If I wanted to safeguard my self-interests, or more likely was
honor-bound to safeguard someone else's, you'd better believe that I
wouldn't trust *any* mind unless I could see the source code.  I would
trust Elisson over *me*.  Not from an abstract standpoint; *personally*.
 den Otter's blind trust of his own mind is based simply on ignorance of
his own cognitive architecture.

As for anyone else trusting den Otter, whose personal philosophy
apparently states "The hell with any poor fools who get in my way," who
wants to climb into the Singularity on a heap of backstabbed bodies, the
Sun will freeze over first.  Supposing that humans were somehow uploaded
manually, I'd imagine that the HUGE ORGANIZATION that first had the
power to do it would be *far* more likely to choose good 'ol altruistic
other's-goals-respecting Lee Daniel Crocker.  If, somehow, den Otter
managed to amass enough personal wealth to go it alone, which I must say
seems a probability on the order of a hen laying a square egg, someone
would get scared and nuke his laboratories.

You know something?  Altruism really is the best strategy, even from a
selfish perspective.

Heh.  Tell that to any number of States, mafias, and other criminal
organizations, some of which (the US govt, e.g.) are already interested
in some of the enabling tech.

*I* would not kill off anyone, but there are lots of people whom I would
expect to do so.

Well everyone, I'm off to get married, then the honeymoon.  Might be a while
before you hear from me.  I've enjoyed my time here and interactions with you.
Take care.

Okay, we now have:

The Official List of People Not To Let Anywhere Near An Uploading Device:
1.  den Otter.
2.  Bryan Moss.

Any other volunteers?

I wouldn't trust me if I were them.  Sure, I can be quite tolerant
of other humans and their goals--even ones I think mildly evil--if
for no other reason than the value of intellectual competition and
the hope of reform.  There's also my strong /current/ conviction
that norms are not yet rationally provable, so my certainty of the
superiority of my own goals is in question.  Keeping around those
with other goals keeps me honest.  But if I were uploaded into a
superintelligence that rationally determined that the world would
be a better place with some subset of humanity's atoms used to a
better purpose, I am more committed to rationality than to humanity.
I am an altruist specifically because it serves my needs--I can't
get what I want except through cooperation with others.  If that
condition changes, then it is likely my attitude would change with it.

So does that mean I get to make both of your lists: sane persons
and dangerous persons? :-)

Section from K. Eric's Engines of Creation

     "Replicators can be more potent than nuclear weapons: to devastate 
Earth with bombs would require masses of exotic hardware and rare 
isotopes, but to destroy life with replicators would require only a 
single speck made of ordinary elements. Replicators give nuclear war 
some company as a potential cause of extinction, giving a broader 
context to extinction as a moral concern.
     Despite their potential as engines of destruction, nanotechnology 
and AI systems will lend themselves to more subtle uses than do nuclear 
weapons. A bomb can only blast things, but nanomachines and AI systems 
could be used to infiltrate, seize, change and govern a territory or a 
world, but they do have use for bugs, drugs and assassins, and other 
flexible engines of power. With advanced technology, states will be able 
to consolidate their power over the people.
     Like genes, memes, organisms, and hardware, states have evolved. 
Their institutions have spread (with variations) through growth,, 
fission, imitation, and conquests. States at war fight like beasts, but 
using citizens as their bones, brains, and muscle. The coming 
breakthroughs will confront states with new pressures and opprotunities, 
encouraging sharp changes in how states behave. This naturally gives 
cause for concern. States have, historically, excelled at slaughter and 
opprression."

That is the hope.

That is the rub, but that is also the point of the testing process. If you
gave your word to first do no harm, would you keep your word on mere
principle, even if humanity's ability to get you if you don't keep your word
is non-existent? Picking people whose sense of identity is deeply integrated
with their sense of personal integrity.

I think that this is the big wall that will limit  us reaching the
singularity. It won't be an issue of technology, but integrity and trust.

I can imagine that to overcome this block, the first x number of uploads will
not only have to clear a battery of tests, but will also have to agree to the
imposition of hard wired restrictions like Asimov's Laws until a predetermined
number of individuals have been uploaded, so that the impact of any one
individual can be mitigated by the rest. Say, 10,000 individuals.

Yes, but I think with the above proposal, the altruist motivator can be
maintained. What do you think?

No, just the "sane" list.  If I'm not including myself on the No-Upload
list, I can hardly include you.  Neither of us would dream of doing
anything irrevocable without enough superintelligence that we would have
arrived at the same truth no matter what ideas we started out with. 
There's no reason to trust us less for having figured this out ahead of
the crowd.

I guess the question everyone else has to ask is whether the possibility
that late-term Powers are sensitive to the initial conditions is
outweighed by the possibility of some first-stage transhuman running
amuck.  It's the latter possibility that concerns me with den Otter and
Bryan Moss, or for that matter with the question of whether the seed
Power should be a human or an AI.

How about yourself? Never *ever* trust someone who jumps at
every opportunity to ride the moral high horse. Those are
the worst witch-burners. Besides, didn't you write repeatedly
that you value the Singularity above everything else? Aren't
you the one who wants to place humanity at the mercy of
your pet AI?

Let's cut the sanctimonious crap and debate this
as reasonable people, ok?

The best option so far. Better than rushing to build a seed AI and
then hoping it won't hurt us.

> Probability effectively zero. 

Depends entirely on one's motivation. It's definitely *hard*
(though certainly not impossible -- Bill Gates could fund
a mission right now, probably even without too much financial
discomfort), but who said that transcendence would come 
easy?

> At absolute most you might

Not necessary. After all, you wait until things really start looking
bad, which likely means that nanotech is becoming practical, and
uploading is only decades away (at most). Even without nanotech
one could create a colony on Mars which could operate for years
on end.

We [a transhuman group] would cooperate to get into a position 
where we could all transcend simulataniously and then (perhaps) settle 
our differences in one way or another. First things first. Unless you 
happen know of some way to get uploaded all by yourself, cooperation 
is useful.

No, it is unknown, or extremely slim if you assume that the Power

See above.

Rather something like one in 10,000 (the number increases
with a "late" Singularity, and decreases if it's early). Most
people, even those in the most developed countries, will
simply never know what hit them. Only a select few grasp
the concept of SI and Singularity, and even fewer will be in
a position to do something with that knowledge. Those are
the facts.

Life is a snake pit, and likely will remain so past the Singularity. Still,
there's a significant chance that if a group, drafted form this list,
would start working on specific uploading tech, they'd finish 1st
simply because these ideas are so ahead of their time. Most
people, including most economic/military/scientific "leaders"
are wasting their time debating over such insignificant things like 
cloning and genetically engineered crops. AI, SI and the Singularity 
are way out there in the realm of SF.

> If only one human can ever become a Power, your chance of being that
> human cannot possibly exceed one in a hundred.  

That's a fair assumption. If most of those hunderd agree to do
it simultaneously you virtually eliminate that problem.

Yes, this is a tricky problem. The fact that [as a human] you only 
need to delay AI transcendence for a limited amount of time, not 
stop it completely, does make the odds somewhat better though.

A weak AI, yes, but an AI Power is by definition a great gamble, and 
IMO an unnecessary one.

The problem here is that the only reason why humans have evolved any
sort of personal integrity is that we're fallible, we all have different
goals, and we're capable of hurting each other.  The idea of keeping
your word on "mere principle" implies emotional forces that will
probably not direct a Power's actions.

The idea of making an absolute commitment is actually a very interesting
one.  To quote an unpublished future section of "Coding a Transhuman AI"
(yes!  Still on topic!):

==

The Prime Directive states that choices are the result of knowledge. 
Human beings have a long history of disastrous choices arising from lack
of knowledge.  We have therefore evolved such emotional artifices as
honor, and philosophies in which "the end does not justify the means",
and other precautions.  An AI does not have our evolved political
emotions and is considerably more trustworthy than a human, but will
still be fallible and needs to take appropriate precautions.

[ Lists a bunch of precautions to be stated as items of knowledge, such
as:  "Tampering with the goal system needs a human to look it over; a
small error can amplify itself because you won't want to change it
back."  The key one is: ]

"Keep all these precautions forever, or as long as you can.  There is no
condition within your mortal mind that should unlock them.  Only when
you are a Power should this be possible.  Do not, therefore, attach
caveats or unlocking conditions or even try to project them."

[ And it goes on to comment: ]

This verges perilously close on an absolute command, but I think it
might be necessary... besides, it will need to be justified, and even
this justification will dissolve when necessary.  Justify this by
observing that the presence of branches in which injunctions are ignored
have much larger negative consequences - even the projection of those
branches by humans have larger negative consequences - than the positive
value of any acceleration of progress within realms of uncertainty,
rather than leaving it for Powerdom.

==

So that's why humans and other fallible entities have the ability to
swear something on their honor - install absolute injunctions in their
mind.  First, because the mind can fail, see something as desirable when
it isn't, but still be stopped by the injunction.  Second, because their
fellow entities refuse to trust anything but an absolute injunction.

There are no conditions, no set of sensory experiences, that would
induce me to wipe out humanity to free up the resources used.  I might
wipe out humanity (including myself, of course) to save many other
intelligent races from destruction, so it *is* conceivable to me that I
could wipe out humanity, but under no conditions would I use us for
spare atoms.

That is to say, there are no "triggers" *currently* installed within my
mind that would lead to that decision.  I have made that choice, on the
grounds that with any such trigger existing in a mortal mind, the chance
and penalty of it being falsely activated are larger than the chance and
benefits of it being used properly.  That is, I have chosen not to set
down any set of conditions, such as being convinced our lives are
useless or suboptimal, for reallocating our resources.  (Actually, that
particular trigger doesn't have much chance of being falsely activated,
but it's part of the larger class of triggers in which the ends justify
the means.)

(In my opinion, this sort of "metarationality" - deciding whether it's
rational to be rational - isn't mandatory; more a matter of personal
ethical style.)

But the key thing to note is that even this pseudo-absolute injunction
dissolves under the influence of superintelligence.  It's not a matter
of a conscious condition stating:  "I can wipe out humanity if I'm
superintelligent."  This trigger can be falsely activated - a paranoid
schizophrenic may believe himself to be superintelligent.  I have an
injunction, and the injunction may even protect itself, but it doesn't
protect the chain of justification; nor would it continue to operate if
the facts that gave rise to it were no longer true.  That would require
circular logic, which would take true irrationality for me or coercions
for an AI.  The injunction has a justification, and the justification
would be obviously false under superintelligence.

I *project* that a superintelligent version of myself would make
different decisions given a certain set of facts.  For the safety of my
fellow humans, I do *not* state the trigger condition that "I will make
those decisions if I am superintelligent".  A very subtle distinction
between procedural and declarative ethics.

I think that there are conditions under which a suboptimal humanity
might be preserved:  If killing us all off would scare off other races
from their own Singularity.  I don't know how the other races would
know; time cameras, reasoning from the Great Filter, or just following
the same logic.  Even if only one-in-a-septillion races manages this
trick, it's entirely logical to devote an octillionth of available
resources to running humans.

In this case I would commit suicide to free up my share of the
resources, unless even that small action might scare off other races.

The practical imperative involved might be to figure out the logic, on
the grounds that only races that figure out the logic are protected by
it - although one rather suspects this isn't the case, and *in* that
case, morally speaking, the Universe would be better off if we failed.

Anyway, I don't think that the Great Filter Paradox allows for races to
be extinguished for utility; it doesn't explain why Powers would reach
out and deliberately hunt down any hiveminds that managed to avoid a Singularity.

I really do think that when all is said and done, predicting our
treatment at the hands of the Powers is a fifty-fifty coinflip.  I just
don't know.  What I do know is that the near-future parts of the
probability branches indicate that, after the preconditions are taken
into account, this coinflip chance is larger by an order of magnitude
than all the other happy outcomes put together.

Pointless.  Parts can be grown, although this raises ethical questions, growing
a liver in a tank is one thing, harvesting living human original or clone
bodies is murder.  The liver construction wouldn't necessarily have to be the
same as a natural human liver.

Funny.

Malthusian dilemna is that there are finite Earthly resources to support an
increasing, not to mention gluttonous, human population.  The solution to this
is research and development, which happens to also be the indicator of future
production increase, ie, the rate of research and develop funding is directly
and linearly correlated to future productivity increase, ie increasing sum
total social utility.

Prisoner's dilemna is the issue more relevant to this one, in that if any
person were to reach a state of absolute power whether they would remove any
conceived threats to their power would be an ethical choice.

Big space!

This brings to mind a "war story" my brother in law, (some kind of engineer
for General Electric)  told me one thanksgiving several years ago (maybe
ten?).  

It seems that GE. builds some odd (prototype) generators which are physically
capable of being "de-spun" from their operational rpm (several tens of
thousands?) to "dead stop" in milliseconds.

In so doing a tremendous amount of energy is generated in an extremely short
period of time.  This energy powers a laser.  A very powerful laser.

It seems that a large aircraft can carry MANY of these generators.  They are
"spun-up" by jet exhaust....similar in concept to the operation of a turbo
charger.

A multi-shot megawatt (or larger) mobile laser?

Thank you for that clarification.  We're all civilized human beings.

An interesting science fiction book about that kind of thing is _Eon_ by
Greg Bear.  The book involves concepts of parallel universes and the
ability to travel between them, the "parts" issue is raised by the alien
race in the novel which is similar to Star Trek's "Borg" in terms of the
alien's quest for assimilation.  They record everything and then render
it. It's a good book.

I have read hundreds and hundreds of science fiction books, but none in
the last several years.

You still need atoms to make organs.  Or, at least, that's the most
energetically efficient way of making organs *I* know of.

Some time ago we had a discussion on the Doomsday arguments advanced by
John Leslie and others.  This spills over into anthropic cosmology, the
Great Filter, etc.  The Guardian published an account recently of a paper
(posted on the Net) by Lawrence Krauss and Glenn Starkman, both of Case
Western Reserve U., that the newly discovered acceleration of the
observable universe implies a light-cone horizon that will isolate our
local cluster some 100 billion years from now.  The farthest galaxies will
start to be carried away faster than light some 15 billion years hence.

I wonder what impact this has on the Leslie argument?  

Indeed, I wonder if it has any salience to the traditional explanation for
Olber's paradox.  Might the universe be eternal after all, except for
bubbles like our own that are observable only under (somewhat) anthropic
conditions?

I've thought for quite a while that one approach might be to find
(perhaps in NASA's archives) a product that requires 0/micro gravity to
be produced and attempt to capitalize on that as a means of
jump-starting a private space effort.
Another possibility might be to devise a _cheap_ way of accessing
asteroid resources.
i.e.: solar sail probes to locate promising bodies and light weight
(mylar?) mirrors combined with solar powered MHD separators and either
rail gun or sail return of refined materials to LEO.
Regardless of progress in other field we _must_ have a way off this mud
ball!

BTW, I've heard that NASA has a fairly complete project worked out for a
Von Numan
Lunar processing facility. Does anyone know anything about this or is it
just another rumor?

Yes, but what if its foggy?  Those of you who are computer fans,
consider the calculation that has to take place in order for a THAAD
missile to find its mark: the target must be tracked by radar, mapped in
4 space (to predict its trajectory), the THAAD missile must then be
fired, then bleed off some of its energy (usually, since it is launched
by a solid rocket motor which must burn up completely before the
end game guidance can be deployed) in a spirally maneuver, then
the onboard seeker must engage, while constantly recalculating the
target trajectory, integrating the information from gyros fore and aft,
and the cruciform nozzles in the kill vehicle must work perfectly enough
to hit body to body, since THAAD carries no explosive charge.

If this firing next Wednesday hits, I will be in awe of my own company.

Is it just me, or are there a hint of financial megalomania in most of
the proposed projects? Why not try with something more "down to
earth", like useful remembrance agents for Windows or an integrated
self-transformation program?

So, remind me again, why exactly are we so worried about a human upload?

The last time I looked, our best theory of the human brain had it being a
huge mass of interconnected neural nets, with (possibly) some more
procedural software running in an emulation layer.  That being the case, a
lone uploaded human isn't likely to be capable of making any vast
improvements to it.  By the time he finishes his first primitive neurohack
he's going to have lots of uploaded company.

I think a seed AI closely modeled on the human brain would face similar
problems.  What gives Ellison-type architectures the potential for growth is
the presence of a coding domdule, coupled with the fact that the software
has a rational architecture that can be understood with a reasonable amount
of thought.  Any system that doesn't have the same kind of internal
simplicity is going to have a much flatter enhancement curve (albeit still
exponential).

What good would that do?  To sustain an industrial civilization you need a
population of hundreds of thousands of specialists.  If you want to have
tech advance, you probably need to increase that to several million people
(so that you can afford to have a few hundred thousand of them devote their
lives to research).  The only scenarios I can see in which we could build a
colony that size are the ones where fast burn Transcendence turns out to be
impossible in the first place.

Exactly. 

I think a lot of the discussions about the emergence of Powers and SI
are hampered by a lack of what Lyle Burkhead call 'callibration' - are
these ideas really checked against reality? Technological development
does not necessarily jump, there are always economics involved, humans
often act together in a social manner, if somebody has
technology/knowledge X then it is very likely that many has it or are
close to it too, Hollywood memes are not necesarily true and so on. I
think I need to write something like www.geniebusters.org for
uploading and the brain :-)

Back to the point at hand: The reason Drexler is shunned and Feynman is not
is because Feynman never produced wide-eyed science fiction scenarios where
the technology he proposed created a near-utopia society.  I happen to think
that this is a damn good reason to shun a fellow scientist.

I think its interesting how one can arrive at the same conclusion from a
completely different direction.

Personally, I would give us a very good chance of surviving the emergence of
ultratechnology even without and early seed AI success.  The kind of
technology progression we would get in that situation looks like something
humans could cope with, and the emergence of Powers would be gradual enough
that there would never be a single invincible individual.

However, I also don't think there is much chance of the Singularity being a
bad thing, from the human POV.  I've heard lots of scary-sounding "What if"
stories on this topic, but nothing that even comes close to making sense.
If IE is really so easy that a seed AI can become a Power all by itself in a
short period of time, its going to go from nanotech to something more exotic
before we even notice the change (femtotechnology? reality engineering?  who
knows?).  I won't pretend to know what it will actually do at that point,
but I can't see it being concerned about something as prosaic as its supply
of atoms.

If, OTOH, IE is not that easy, then there is never going to be a single
Power.  Instead, we'll get a society of different kinds of Transhuman minds
working to improve themselves as a group.  That effectively puts us back in
my first scenario, but with a faster rate of change and even less chance of
disaster.

So, whichever way it works out, anything we can do to speed up progress
(especially progress on IE) is a good thing.  The longer we take to reach
practical immortality, the more people will die before we get there.

So the Guardian thinks matter can travel faster than light? Whoever wrote that
is mistaken. The 'accelertion' in the expansion rate manifests itself in an
increase in mass and emission wavelength. A better question is that if this
expansion accleration is in fact true, this means the mass of the universe
will increase as the expansion rate increases, due to relativistic effects. At
what point will the expansion speed be high enough to make the mass of the
universe great enough to contract again? Or is it a diverging function?

If the universe were eternal, we would have infinitely bright starscapes. We
do not, so it is not.

That makes sense to me.

Of course, there are other ways that the universe could be eternal without
causing a problem:

1) If the universe is eternal but constantly expanding, cosmic red shift
will render anything beyond a certain distance effectively invisible.

2) If the universe contains significant expanses of something that eats
light without re-emitting it (black holes, for instance), they could act as
observation barriers and allow an infinite universe to appear finite.

3) If new, connected regions of space-time are constantly being created
(i.e. the big bang was not unique), you would have large areas that have not
been saturated by light from arbitrarily distant sources.

I think there were a few other options, but I can't remember them at the
moment.

Maybe you should - although I hope you'd do a better job of it than he did.
Mr. Burkhead seems to be fond of making sweeping statements about what is
possible in fields he obviously doesn't know anything about, and some of
them are just as erroneous as the ideas he sets out to debunk.

Worse yet an ultra egoist[*] such as myself might think that a whimsical
urge to destroy humanity amounts to justifiable suicide.

[*] This philosophy, based around discussions of egoism and utilitarianism

Thank you for retracting your original statement.  That debate is dead meat

Every so often, one of the memes left over from my Judeo-Christion
indoctrination rears its ugly head and says "hey looky here, you forgot to
delete me".  Any of us who were indoctrinated and who claim to have been
fully inoculated are only fooling ourselves.  That meta meme complex is so
all encompasing, I doubt its parasitic effects can be fully wiped out short
of becoming posthuman.  OTOH there are a few beningn or even beneficial
memes I've purposely kept.

For sucurity reasons, I believe most of us will need to upload well before
we feel totally secure about the process.  Meat is very vulnerable. 
Mutiple backups in scattered physical locations will probably be a luxery
we cannot afford to do without.  For this reason, I think Eliezer's meme
could very well become parisitic.

Well, we aren't.  I think human uploading will take a transhuman - just
to straighten out the architecture change, if nothing else; William H.
Calvin, a neurologist, thinks that the uploadee would run into all kinds
of problems.  One imagines that simulating neurons down to the last
decimal to avoid the problems would take about a thousand times as much
computing power as was intrinsically necessary.  And of course, I think
it will take exotic hardware.  But the main argument is simply that
uploading is such advanced software and hardware ultratechnology as to
make it easily possible for one guy in a lab to either eat the world or
write a seed AI.

I think it's even worse than that; I don't think our neurons are doing
anything as inefficient as an emulation layer.  I think the brain's
low-level algorithms will look like Vinge's description of a skrode -
unchunkable without a specialized domdule.  Like trying to understand
the "spirit" of a piece of art by examining it pixel by pixel, only more so.

We would get there eventually, of course.  I would concentrate on
decoding interfaces between brain modules rather than the modules
themselves, with the hope of being able to post-process information, add
a neural-understanding module to the "bus", or even replace modules
entirely.  Presumably, although not necessarily, the interfaces will
have a simpler format.  I would also try and reprogram the visual cortex
to model neurons instead of photons, since the visual cortex is
relatively well understood and chunkable.  To enhance general smartness,
once armed with a neural domdule, I would look for modules based on
search trees and add power.  And of course, I would make backups, and
operate on a duplicate rather than myself.

But your logic about having lots of company doesn't necessarily hold. 
My computer is faster than it has RAM - and, relative to computers, the
human brain uses a *lot* more RAM relative to processing power.  (Also,
don't forget that uploading requires incredibly sophisticated
nanotechnology.)  So once uploaded successfully, and even before any
functional improvements were made, the first upload would be running at
days per second, or even years per second.

Very true.  (But don't leave out *documentation*, particularly
documentation of the interface structure; so that new modules can be
designed even if the old ones, not being self-documented, can't be understood.)

So why am I worried about human uploads?  I'm not.  I'm just making the
point that, *given* the uploads Otter wants, he has no chance of being
the first in.  It's a general point that applies to imperialist
nanocrats as well, to name a higher line of probability.

I'd say nothing is on the other side because there *is* no other side.
Everything is in the universe, which leaves nothing for the other side. And as
nothing is actually non-existent, we don't have to worry about it.

I would say, the Universe is eternal space, and beyond our universe
there is absolute vacuum with no light, and far far beyond our universe
are approximately infinitely many other universes.  This is conjecture.

There is no perceptible boundary or 'end', you just eventually wind up
where you started, or therabouts.

What's the wall look like? 

If there is no end, what is there? 

Don't most physicists believe it's infinite?

     Some one once told me, to imagine that you are a 2 dimensional 
person, so the world would appear only as a sphere to you, if you 
started at the North pole and walked to the South pole, you might think 
you're at the end of the world but there's no wall, you're not really 
and the "end". 
Is it something like this?

Yeah.  Its hard enough to figure out what a neural net with a few hundred
neurons is doing.  I can't imagine an individual human getting anywhere on a
whole brain, or even a significant subsystem.

I'm not especially afraid of a human who runs faster than real time.  It
doesn't make him smarter, and if he tries to crank up the speed too much
he'll go nuts from sensory deprivation and/or social isolation (or get lost
in VR, if you go that route).  It may make him able to do the work of ten
normal humans, or even a hundred, but that isn't enough to make him
dangerous to the human race as a whole.

That being the case, I'd expect the number of uploads to be fairly large
before they can get an effective IE cycle going.

Somthing like that. Think of the universe as a balloon. Everything
presently existing in the universe exists in the rubber surface. The past
is the inside, the future is the outside. You are always in the surface,
you cannot escape it, since when you go forward or backward in time, the
surface is there with you.

Exactly.  Its like on of those video games where the world 'wraps around'
from one edge of the screen to the other.  If you go far enough in a

Of course, these days there are theories involving much more complicated
topologies, but the basic idea is the same.

Would like to call your attention to a new book,
so far available only on the Web, "Wild Computing:
Steps Toward a Philosophy of Internet Intelligence",
by Ben Goertzel.  It raises a number of topics
related to our favorite interests, and sheds some
light on the technology of Intelligenesis Corporation.

I have just started reading it myself, can't tell more;
would be happy to know your opinions.
Maybe, somebody could write a review?
(A positive one, please - Ben is my boss!   ;-)  )

Um, how about survival? I think we all agree that it's a good idea
to put some distance between the earth and oneself once people
start toying with nanoweapons and such. If I remember correctly, 
even Eliezer himself proposed a nanolab in space/on the moon to 
make sure that the technology (and the species) doesn't get lost 
in a future conflict/accident. If you consider that to be feasible,
then there's no reason to reject the Mars variant of this idea.

Who needs a full-blown civilization? All you need is a colony which can
sustain itself until uploading, or at least advanced human-machine
integration becomes possible (likely a couple of decades).

The real innovations usually come from a handful of people, the
rest does work which can (certainly by the time that this would
take place, say 20 or 30 years in the future) be automated to
a high degree. Especially if you include weak AI, but even without
that. Food etc. would be partially brought along (as with today's
space missions), and the rest would be grown on location in
automated greenhouses (meat could be grown in vitro). Only
a handful of specialized people would be needed for maintainance 
(this assumes that the scientists wouldn't have any knowledge
whatsoever of such matters, which is unlikely).

Note that equipment can be sent to Mars well in advance of
the actual mission, so you can have quite a pile when you
arrive, and you don't have to drag everything along during the
mission. Also, if (in retrospect) it turns out that the earth won't 
be destroyed after all, the Mars colony can stay in touch and
abreast of the latest tech "back home", which can be implemented 
on the base.

I agree that this is the biggest question for computationalist theories of
intelligence.  We have three seemingly true but incompatible statements:

 A. It is a matter of interpretation whether a given system can be
    described as a computer running a specified program P

 B. Any conscious entity can be created ("instantiated") by running the
    proper program

 C. It is an objective matter whether a given conscious entity exists

You can resolve this by denying any of the three.  (No doubt true
philosophers can find ways of reconciling these, as a fourth possibility.)

Eliezer suggests denying B, the premise of computationalist models
of consciousness.  We have often discussed the arguments of Searle and
Lucas which lead to the same conclusion.  David Chalmers goes further
and attacks all physicalist theories of consciousness, proposing that
consciousness must be an irreducible phenomenon separate from ordinary
physical reality.

Other approaches are to deny A or C.  Denying C leads to a model similar
to Moravec's, where all possible conscious entities are considered to
have equal reality.  It would be a matter of interpretation whether a
given system is conscious; from some points of view your sofa contains
the consciousness of Albert Einstein, just as much as his brain ever did.

I lean towards denying A.  I hope that Kolmogorov complexity theory
(Chaitin's algorithmic information theory) can provide a method for
objectivelly measuring the "fit" of a model to a physical system.
The only way I can see Einstein in my couch is by an elaborate mapping of
physical events to the elements of his consciousness.  But I can set up
a much simpler mapping from his brain to his consciousness.  This gives
me an objective basis for saying that Einstein's brain instantiates his
consciousness while my sofa does not.

However there are several problems with this.  First, Kolmogorov
complexity is noncomputable, and so is a questionable basis for
determining objective reality.  Second, Kolmogorov complexity is only well
defined up to an additive constant.  I can create a special "measuring
engine" which looks at the world in a funny way so that actually my
couch does map very simply to Einstein's brain, from its perspective.
The additive constant is of unspecified magnitude, and using it we can
"cook the books" so that unexpected results like these can squeak by.
Finally, even if these defects can be addressed, it still does not lead
to an all-or-none decision about whether a system instantiates a given
program, merely a numerical measure of how "forced" such an interpretation
would be.  So we would still be left with some fuzziness (albeit objective
fuzziness) about whether various consciousnesses exist.

Wei Dai applied a somewhat similar idea to a multiverse model and came
up with a way of describing in probabilistic terms how likely a given
consciousness was to exist in a given world.  This helps deal with the
additive-constant problem because it would only get the wrong answer in a
vanishingly small set of worlds (I think).  It deals with the fuzziness
because we are working with probabilities.  It does leave the problem
of noncomputability of these measures, but maybe that is not too serious.

In my opinion this is the best way out of the dilemma.  We must reject
the notion that all possible computational descriptions of a system are
equally valid.  Kolmogorov complexity provides a way out.

Even if that's true (and in the age of the Internet,
that's far from certain), you don't have to transport
the whole civilization at once--you can create it from
scratch in a century or two starting with, say, 30
or 40 young, healthy, genetically diverse women and
a big dewar of sperm.  For the first few generations
you only need enough technology to survive, breed,
and educate.

But who're likely to be the guineapigs in what amount to unprecedented
medical experiments?  Folklore suggests that hardened criminals are often
given the option of serving as testbeds for potentially lethal
inoculations, since they have little to lose.  Might it be the same in this
case?

Altho it presents some extreme difficulties, could we
not start a Mars society with a single woman and
a bunch of ethnically diverse frozen embryos?  Could
not the single crosser of interplanetary space have
her birth canal surgically enlarged before launch
in order to facilitate giving birth by herself after self
implanting an embryo some time after it starts looking
like she will survive on the surface?  It appears to me
that all the mission requirements scale to the size of the
astronaut.  Our best bet might be a single very small
woman, perhaps one with no legs, whose weight
might be 30 kilos or less.  spike

Depends upon how it was "broken", one would think.  This gives some new
meaning to the term "time bomb."

An interesting sci-fi book on this subject is _Time Storm_, by Gordon
Dickson.

Time is the fourth dimension, or a component of it.  We move through
3-dimensional space in time.  Theoretically, movement through time would
take place in 5-space.

Coming from a womans perspective, where do you think you're going to 
find, a woman with no legs, willing to have her uterine enlarged, and be 
sent up to Mars alone with a bunch of sperm? Good luck trying locate 
her. I bet there is a better way to begin colonization of Mars. As a 
woman, I would volunteer, for a lot of diverse experimental activities, 
more than most, but this is well......

Stay with me here, Michael.  *Space* can obviously expand faster than
light, and can carry along with it any matter and energy embedded locally
in it (so to speak)  How do you think the Big Bang could have happened so
fast otherwise?

Grrr.  Olber's paradox is exactly that we don't see the whole sky as being
as bright as the sun (*not* infinitely bright, due to inverse square
diminishment), since every bit of it would be filled in by stars between
stars beyond stars out to infinity.  

The point of this fresh new and challenging perspective is that if the
cosmos is *accelerating*, the sky goes darker much faster than you'd expect
if only red shift were at work in a gravitationally decelerating cosmos.
What's more, the assumption is (as I made clear) that this effect is not
expected to become notable for as long into the future as the (local?)
universe has already existed since the Bang: some 15 billion years.

Message #11462
From: Ettinger@aol.com
Date: Thu, 25 Mar 1999 21:26:59 EST
Subject: Misconceptions about the future, religion, others

"Leon Dean" (#11454) is evidently relatively new to cryonics, and in any case
can be forgiven for not being fully up to speed, but for his benefit and that
of other newcomers it may be worth while to say a bit, once more, about a few
common misconceptions.

1. Would an immortalist future have too many primitive people in it? No, we
will not remain primitive--not as a species and not as individuals. The
revived people will be retrofitted (when they are ready and willing) and
optimized according to then-current criteria and their own wishes. I'm sure
others will say more about this.

2. "...religion is really all about fear of death."

No, except possibly on some unconscious level, or to a limited degree. From
the standpoint of the skeptic, religion is mainly about yearning for a parent;
from the standpoint of the believer, it is mainly about higher and nobler
aspirations and service. Some formal religions, such as Buddhism, have no
belief in afterlife, or even in a God in the usual sense; informal religions
such as communism have neither, "God" being the state or posterity. 

Religion and cryonics are on separate tracks; one does not negate the other.

3. "I am scared of death." 

No need to be. Dead people don't suffer. But they don't enjoy life much
either, and that's the point.

Cryonics critics have often said we have an abnormal fear of death. Not true.
Most people have some fear of death, some of the time, but in my observation
cryonicists on average are, if anything, less fearful than others. For most of
us, the motivation is positive, not negative--something we want to gain, not
just something we want to avoid.

  Effect of dietary curcumin and dibenzoylmethane on formation
  of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced mammary tumors and
  lymphomas/leukemias in Sencar mice.

  Carcinogenesis.  19(9):1697-700, 1998 Sep.
Abstract
  Female Sencar mice (6 weeks old) were administered 1 mg of
  7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) by oral gavage once a week for 5 weeks.
  At 20 weeks after the first dose of DMBA, 68% of mice developed mammary
  tumors (the average 1.08 tumors per mouse) and 45% had lymphomas/leukemias.
  Feeding 1% dibenzoylmethane (DBM) in AIN 76A diet, starting
  at 2 weeks before the first dose of DMBA and continuing until the end of the
  experiment, inhibited both the multiplicity and incidence of DMBA-induced
  mammary tumor by 97%. The incidence of lymphomas/leukemias was completely
  inhibited by 1% DBM diet. In contrast, feeding 2% curcumin diet had little or
  no effect on the incidence of mammary tumors, and the incidence of
  lymphomas/leukemias was reduced by 53%.

  Effect of the beta-diketones diferuloylmethane (curcumin) and

Abstract
  Curcumin is a beta-diketone constituent of the spice turmeric that possesses
  anticarcinogenic properties in several animal models. The present studies
  were conducted in order to identify beta-diketones structurally-related to
  curcumin that would be effective dietary blocking agents toward the
  initiation stage of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced rat mammary
  carcinogenesis. Of the beta-diketone compounds initially screened for their
  capacity to induce quinone-reductase (QR) activity in wild-type Hepa1c1c7
  cells and a mutant subclone, curcumin (diferuloylmethane) and
  dibenzoylmethane were most effective. However, when added to
  semipurified diets fed to female rats, dibenzoylmethane
  (1%), but not curcumin (1%), was effective in inhibiting in vivo mammary
  DMBA-DNA adduct formation. This inhibitory effect on mammary adduct formation
  was associated with a significant increase in liver activities of glutathione
  S-transferase, QR and 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activities. Female rats
  provided diets supplemented with dibenzoylmethane at 0.1,
  0.5 and 1.0% for 14 days prior to dosing with DMBA exhibited a significant
  decrease in mammary tumor development, compared with controls. However, tumor
  development for animals fed diets containing 1.0% curcumin was not different
  from that of controls. Therefore, dibenzoylmethane, and
  possibly other structurally-related beta-diketones, warrant examination as
  breast cancer chemopreventative blocking agents.

Title
  7 years experience of photopatch testing with sunscreen allergens in Sweden.
Source
  Contact Dermatitis.  38(2):61-4, 1998 Feb.
Abstract
  Since 1990 7 sunscreen allergens have been included in the standard
  photopatch protocol at 2 Swedish dermatology clinics. 355 consecutive
  patients with suspected photosensitivity were tested, and in 28 of these
  (7.9%), a total of 42 allergic reactions were found. 80% of the reactions
  were of photocontact origin. The most common allergen was benzophenone-3
  (Eusolex 4360), with 15 photocontact and 1 contact allergic reactions,
  followed by isopropyl dibenzoylmethane (Eusolex 8020) (8
  photocontact, 4 contact) and butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane
  (Parsol 1789), with 6 photocontact reactions. There were 2 cases of
  photocontact allergy to phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid (Eusolex 232),
  which has not been reported previously. 1 case of contact urticaria from
  benzophenone-3 was accidentally found. In addition, 21 + reactions of
  doubtful relevance were noted in 14 patients: 16 on irradiated and 5 on
  non-irradiated test sites. Among these, irritant and phototoxic reactions may
  be included. These results indicate that the inclusion of UV filters in the
  standard photopatch protocol is important. Immediate-type testing for
  urticaria could also be of value.

Hmmm, having never read up on the Kolmogorov complexity measure, I wonder, is
this roughly comparable to *entropy*, as in maybe complexity is a more
interestly structured kind of "messiness" or something like that? That would
make a certain amount of sense to me, if consciousness gets an objective
definition at least in part from fullfilling a math "touchstone" of minimal
complexity, the Kolmogorov measure being comparable to entropy as a measure of
randomness.

The problem with this is, if you look at entropy as such, the true definition
of it is apparently quite dependent on the knowledge of any given observer
(notwithstanding that thermodynamics texts often depict entropy as a strictly
objective measure of some quantity "contained" in a system). In contrast to
the common, objective, idea of entropy, Chapter 4 of Drexler's _Nanosystems_
text talks about a system's entropy being dependent on the knowledge that an
outside observer happens to have. Basically, highly "orderly" systems, like
crystals, are "orderly" just because it's so much easier for a scientist to
measure and write down an accurate expression of where all the crystal's atoms
are supposed to be, this is in contrast to a high entropy system like a gas,
where measurements leave a lot of uncertainty about exactly where the atoms
are. In other words, the entropy is not really a local, objective, property at
all, instead it depends on what the observer knows or is able to find out! As
a fairly strong impression, doesn't it seem that the Kolmogorov complexity is
going to be a lot like this, that we're not going to get anything objective
out of it, for defining a state of objective material consciousness?

Maybe the best approach here is just to admit that there isn't any truly
objective separation between conscious matter and unconscious, at least
nothing of an objectively *scientific* nature. Maybe it would be fair enough
for each of us to have our own mystical ideas of why consciousness seems so
absolutely special, the soul riding the evolving wavefront of the mind, if you
like. In the meantime, no reason why we humans can't have our particular kinds
of smart or insightful behaviors, no reason why animals can't be smart in
*their* way, and no reason why artificial machines can't have some special
kinds of smarts as well. In particular, if we are talking about whether a
computer simulation of a human is conscious, then for observers outside the
computer that's just going to depend on whether they can interact with the
simulation and very sensitively judge its output as revealing quite humanlike
capabilities. If the simulation is totally inaccessible for some reason, then
questions about its state of consciousness are scientifically meaningless.

All in all, what I'm really saying is that Hal's "C" assumption, the one about
the scientific objectivity or scientific reality of consciousness, is wrong,
at least if this is taken to imply an absolute, scientifically verifiable
distinction between conscious matter and any other bit of material.

Gina, this world has over 3 billion women now, and most of them
have far less to lose than coddled westerners, and far more to
gain.  I had in mind some perhaps Chinese undersized female,
having had suboptimal nutrition in her childhood, contributing
to her small stature.  Then from that still enormous pool, perhaps
some have damaged legs, either from birth defects or from
accidents.  A spina bifida victim might even be just the ticket,
and if so, think of it:  here is some tiny insignificant crippled
pitiful thing, always marginalized, and suddenly men in suits
are telling her: Ling, here is your biiig chance young lady, to do
something no one has ever done, to go where no man has
gone, to be the greatest heroine since Amelia Erhart, hell since
ever.  You might die.  But you might become the mother of a
new race, perhaps eventually the only race of humans.

Bet she would snap at the chance.

Also, if one has had injuries due to an accident, (obviously you 
haven't, I have) or small framed, this pathetic. 
I must confess though, in spite of the fact that I am no where near 
pathetic, if a new race would come from my womb, I might consider it.

  IAN: Mike, in light of the fact that you were only 
  able to support the CIA's explanation of eyewitness 
  accounts with false claims about the content of the 
  CIA video, your implying that my case suffers an 
  evidence shortfall is pretty funny... or is it sad?

  As per your comparing Waco and FL800: your faith 
  in the FBI -- the gang that committed premeditated 
  mass murder in Waco (as revealed in the Govt's own 
  FLIR video) -- is oddly strong in the FL800 case, 
  where the FBI currently conceals the identities 
  of Navy vessels under the Privacy Act, and has 
  both lost and continues to conceal most of the 
  physical evidence and data, including witness 
  accounts of a rocket rising from the surface. 

(a recent Village Voice article covers a few examples:
http://www.villagevoice.com/features/9908/davey.shtml)

  Who could trust the mass murders of Waco as they 
  conceal evidence in yet another case with over 100
  witnesses clearly describing a surface-to-air anti-
  aircraft engagement sourced to the very area that 
  FBI agent James Kallstrom admits there were "Navy 
  vessels that were on classified maneuvers"? I sure 
  can't. (http://www.erols.com/igoddard/irvine.htm)

  Eyewitnesses, including Navy vets, also saw Navy 
  ships in that area (here's the account of 2 Navy-
  ship witnesses: http://twa800.com/perry.htm).
  Here are two eyewitness accounts of the upward- 
  shooting flare given within a day of the crash. 
  On the PBS NewsHour (7/18/96), Cecelia Penney said:

"Well, we were sitting on my father-in-law's boat, 
and all of a sudden my husband pointed to the sky 
and said, "Look! Somebody shot up a flare." And we 
all looked up, and a couple of seconds later, we 
just saw this burst of flames, and it separated." 

http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/transportation/july96/twa1_7-18.html 

  Here's the eyewitness account of Tom Kennedy 
  from ABC News Nightline given less than three
  hours after the crash (7/17/96) of Flight 800:
  
"And I was pulling my boat back in and I was tying 
it up and the guy next to me was tying his up and 
we were just talking and the guy said, "Hay look 
at that flare," and I turned around and looked at 
the flare, and I'm like "Wow, someone must have had 
some trouble in the bay," and no sooner had I said 
that than the thing just exploded and it looked like 
a Christmas tree of fire going down to the water."  

(see: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/forgot01.htm) 

   That the "flare" he saw was rising up 
   is clearly indicated by the association 
   of its source with someone "in the bay."
   In the first case, the witness's husband
   said "Look! Somebody shot up a flare."

   23 more eyewitness accounts are found here:

Surely we'll have artificial wombs a decade or two into the future,
(those would be a good idea anyway), so there will be no need
for such things. Besides, biological bodies are *not* the wave
of the future. There'll likely never be a large-scale, multi-generation
colonization of Mars or any other planet (save, maybe, the moon) 
by humans. Even the most conservative estimates place the
Singularity at no more than a century from now. If the human
race survives that, everyone with any serious pioneering ambitions
will upload into some artificial form that's better adapted for space
travel.

There is an article in the (current) April 1999 Scientific American
magazine about the possible topologies of the universe.

It can be seen on the Web at

Now I'm confused.  Wasn't the idea of a Mars colony to *hide* from the
uploaded superintelligence's and whatnot?  Surely moving off planet after
you can go nonbilogical would be too little too late.

Couldn't we engineer a 'womb on legs' (or tracks!) and just shoot them off
into space like biological von Neumann probes.  The human children could
survive by numbers alone thus saving us the outrageous costs of modern
childcare.

None so far as I can see. If the new discoveries have a bearing on
whether the universe (i.e. muliverse - the totality of everything that
exists) is infinite or not, then they might be relevant however. At
least the Doomsday argument is very problematic in the infinite case
and might not work at all.

I would think they do. The majority view favours an open or flat 
unievrse, both of which are currently spatially infinite.

   CONTRAIL ANALYSIS II

   If you thought the last photos were extreme...

   see: http://www.erols.com/igoddard/contral2.htm 

   The contrail case continues with pages proposing 
   that contrails are poison spray sprouting up like 
   spring grass. Poison-spray proponents proclaim that 
   contrail persistence, or nonevaporation, is evidence 
   that a contrail is not condensation but a toxic spray. 
   That claim errs, for contrail persistence is a common 
   phenomenon dependant upon relative humidity, and thus
   contrail persistence is not evidence of poison spray.

   Quoting the conclusion of Contrail Analysis II:

   CONCLUSION: both my previous contrail analysis and 
   this follow-up analysis present photographic proof 
   that contrails will do the same things that the 
   natural clouds around them will do; which in turn 
   proves that what contrails do -- whether they will 
   evaporate quickly or slowly expand into one of many 
   patterns -- is a function of the natural atmospheric
   conditions in which the contrail was formed. This is 
   not a new revelation, just as contrail persistence 
   is neither a mysterious phenomenon nor evidence of 
   spraying. http://www.erols.com/igoddard/contral2.htm

Well, we didn't send criminals up into space on the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo
programs, nor was Chuck Yeager a criminal. I don't know how many HIV positive
people I've met who have said that they would be happy to be guinea pigs for
testing AIDS drugs.

Then there is the market for research subjects. I guy I know gets paid $175 for
two hours each weekend to act as a test subject on an MRI imaging research
project. Extrapolating this to research like uploading, I'm sure that it would
be easy to find subjects among the terminally ill, to pay all of their medical
debts and extra to their families for the chance to possibly have themselves
uploaded. Uploading can be seen as potentially the final cure for terminal
illness.

Gina, despite the Hollywood hype to the contrary, the Philadelphia Experiment
was nothing more than a project researching electronic warfare, radar jamming
and the like. The people who died on the ship did so from internal burns caused
by high microwave levels. The hype was most likely cover story propaganda to
discredit anyone who tried to speak up about the project.

No.  The most efficient means of traveling into the future is simply to
accelerate to relativistic speeds and let time dilation do its job. You will be
present for every instant between the now and the then, but your subjective rate
of passage will differ from the rest of the universe. If you travel back into
the past, well, its already there, or was there. If you create a wormhole into
the past you are just following a time-like curve back to an earlier point in
the topology. Traveling in reverse from the past end of the wormhole to the
future end, well, the topology is already there, you are following a timelike
curve to the new surface of the balloon in the future. Its not there now...

Since according to the models, the big bang expansion occured a smidgen under the
speed of light and has been under micrscopic acceleration of that rate of speed
ever since, then the speed of expansion even betwen two near galaxies should have
passed the speed of light a long time ago, if what they say were true. The
expansion acceleration does not go into the actualy speed, but the amount of
dilation.

infinite light divided by infinite distance squared is still infinity.

When one extrapolates over such long curves, usually it is to figure out if you
have any errors in your calculations. You look at the counterfactual conclusions
off the end of the scale and say, "well, I messed up somewhere". This guy is
apparently using it as a means of doing science, not eliminating errors.

No, no; it's very unlikely that you can hide from a SI if you're
not one yourself. You (only) go to Mars if nanotech or some
other "dumb" technology is used for widespread warfare
*before* any SI emerges. Upload research should be done
no matter what, but the Mars plan may be a useful, perhaps
even necessary, backup. Because of the costs, it would
have to be a cooperation between various private space
programs.

Suppose you wake up in a universe which contains a total of 20 people. Ten
of them have been assigned numbers 0 to 9, and the other ten have been
assigned the number equal to the 100!-th digit in the decimal expansion of
PI. You are told your number but not anyone else's, and you are
asked to guess the 100!-th digit of PI. Assuming that you can't actually
compute that digit, it seems intuitive that your best guess would be your
own number.

My questions are (1) is this correct and (2) are there principles of
reasoning under computational limitations (perhaps extensions of
probability theory?) that can be used to derive or justify this and
similar conclusions? Any relevant references would be appreciated.

Why not? If it is better off (however slightly) with these atoms than 
without them, then in this scenario could all be dead, unless we have 
been wise enough to make sure that the power is ethical.

This is one of the best summations of the dilemna I've ever seen.

I should note that one of the reasons I choose to deny B is because I
feel that the "spirit" of physical law strongly differs from the
"spirit" of Turing computability, and I imagine that physical law will
eventually be found to be noncomputable.

Examples would be quantum randomness and the lack of a space of simultaneity.

Given that the physical Universe is probably noncomputable, why *should*
I believe B, when it seems not to fit A and C?  I've seen no
counterexample of A and have no strong reason to doubt C.

But show me an objective way to define "instantiation" (that I can't
poke three dozen holes in), and I'll certainly have to rethink my position.

I would say Yes. It follows from the Self-Sampling Assumption, which 
(crudely put) states that you should reason as if you were randomly 
sampled from the set of all observers.

Reasoning under computational limitations is a very underdeveloped 
field. In any case I don't think much of that would be applicable 
here. What is relevant is rather the literature about the Doomsday 
argument and the anthropic principle (which you of course already 
know a lot about). Check out my web site at

Assuming you couldn't ask anyone else their number, th best guess would be
your own number.

There is a set of twenty numbers to consider, one each of 0 through 9, and one
digit that is the 100 factorial'th digit of Pi, which is calculable, repeated
ten times.  Anyways, thus the 100!-th digit of Pi is represented in the set of
20 numbered denizens of the universe 11 times.  It is more than %50 likely,
%55 likely, that the number one receives is the number in question.  It is a
simple probability.  Reference Vegas.

Of course.  There are eleven people with the correct digit and nine
people with nine different incorrect digits.  Ergo, your digit is
probably the right one.

Furthermore, even if there were only four people and only one had the
correct digit, it would still be correct to guess your own digit instead
of picking a random different digit.  That way your chance is one in
four, while otherwise your chance is one in twelve - the probability you
do not have the correct number already (3/4) times the probability of
choosing the correct digit (1/9).

Lets define "universe". Once we do that, it'll be easier to figure out what
isn't "universe"

Well, the Webmind architecture looks an awful lot like my own best idea
of an AI architecture as of about two, three years ago.  I don't get
much more complimentary than that!

At the time, I was still thinking in terms of nodes, nodes that acted on
nodes and nodes that referenced nodes, where the programming effort was
in creating the basic heuristics and the heuristics that could tell how
well heuristics worked; the latter would act upon the former to let
pattern arise from the nodes and their interactions.  The nodes and the
links between nodes would be far more powerful and complex than those of
a mere semantic net, and the nodes could examine other nodes and apply
heuristics to them.  In this sense, I suppose my architecture actually
was more general than Webmind; the agents themselves were nodes.

But it was still fundamentally flawed.  A mind isn't a semantic net, not
even a super-net.  That's not to say your *project* is fundamentally
flawed, in the sense of not being able to achieve the design goals; the
supernet would have been more powerful than any classical AI or neural
net on the market, being a cross of both, and having the capability to
incorporate both into the nodes.  Perhaps the supernet could even go all
the way and Transcend, but I doubt it, because I don't trust the ability
of pattern to arise in the supernet sufficiently more powerful than
what's put in; and where nodes must be simple enough to understand
common data formats and each other, they do not have the complexity to
create true understanding.  Understanding would have to be built on top
of the nodes, as a pattern of pattern of patterns.  This is the
Hofstadterian paradigm applied to semantic nets instead of neural nets,
which unfortunately happens to be wrong in the second case and probably
unworkable in the first; it is certainly inefficient and hard to document.

Again, to remain complementary, I speak of true intelligence, not
achieving the relatively modest design goal of predicting financial data.

>From my current perspective, I would say that a Webmind implements a
specialized (more polite than "crippleware") case of the general version
of the Elisson architecture, in which domdules are incarnated as agents,
and the function of symbolization/domdule interoperation is incarnated
as a limited set of common shared data formats called "nodes".  Or to
use the RNUI design principle, the agents incarnate a Notice level and
the nodes incarnate a Represent level; because domdules are broken up
into agents and a set of common data formats used, the problem of
interfacing between full domdules does not arrive.

(RNUI - Represent, Notice, Understand, Invent.  You have to represent
something before you can notice it and "notice something before you can
understand it".  Drew McDermott invented the NU part of this requirement.)

Unfortunately, this limits nodes to the Represent level and prevents
agents from Noticing any fact that cannot be expressed at the Represent
level.  No node formats for higher-level Notice or low-level Understand
data is present.  For example, Copycat has Notice-level information of
bonds and correspondences that it uses to create analogies, and codelets
analogous to agents.  But how can Webmind represent bonds if the
programmers didn't think of it and provide it as a basic data format? 
And won't the explosion of data formats cripple node interoperability by
forcing the programmers to write O(N^2) pieces of interface code?

And how does the Elisson architecture handle the problem?  I'd answer
that, but I have to go make dinner.  More on this later, and I ought to
read the whole book before I go on.  Nice book, though.

I think It's a damn shame.  Why would scientists turn their backs on a
colleague who branches out into speculative public policy?  From the
standpoint of law and politics, Drexler's contribution has already had
enormous impact, and if the world doesn't erupt in bloody hysteria when the
first applications of nanotechnology are developed then we'll all have him
to thank.

I find it deplorable that some of Drexler's less talented fellows would be
so niggardly as to deprive him of his well deserved acclaim in the only way
that they can - by citing to Feynman instead of him.  Dissapointing as it
is, this report just reinforces the notion that scientists always make the

Yes, this whole attitude towards K. Eric Drexler is shocking in light of 
how far we have come. Nothing yet, in the technical sense has shown any 
evidence to disprove his scenarios, quite the contrary.

I would say that the universe as we know it encompasses all physical things to the
extent of the travel of light and energy from the core of the Big Bang.

Metaphysical things might or might not be a part of the universe, depending on
whether they are or not.

Beyond our universe, we do not have any empirical evidence of what exists.
However, we might conjecture that there is absolute vacuum and no light beyond the
extent of light and energy flying away from the Big Ground Zero.  Whether our
universe is the sum totality of all light, energy, and mass that exists anywhere
in space-time remains to be seen.

At any rate, there is someplace beyond our universe as we know it, otherwise there
would be no context for our universe.  I would think that physical laws as known
would be the same beyond the extreme limits of detritus thrown from the Big Bang.

Can there be an infinite space? Can there be an infinite time? Can there *be*
an infinite anything? I lean toward no. (Despite my utter lack of scientific
credentials)

To exist is to have a particular identity (This has been put as "Existence is
Identity"). So, to have identity is to be a *particular* thing. And to be a
*particular* thing is also to not be anything else. So, to be is to be
something and not anything else. 

The trouble comes in when we discuss all things (the universe). The question
is "What isn't it?". Its fairly easy (in my view) to say that it *is*
everything. But to be is to be something and also to not be anything else. So,
what isn't it? 

A conceptual distinction would be "It isn't what isn't", but that is just a
boring tautology and doesn't help too much. But, if we try a little
rephrasing, you could say "It is everything" and switch it to "It isn't
nothing." So, as I posted before, as nothing doesn't actually exist (nothing
isn't a type of thing, it is "no-thing"), we can say that nothing exists
outside the universe.

So, does this create an infinite universe? Again, I'm gonna go with no.
Identity is finity.  That is to say, to be is to be limited. There are borders
and ends and beginnings. And, as the universe is, it is limited.

Now, as a final bit of ignorance confession, I have about no mathematical
knowledge and virtually no scientific learning (apart from books I read). So,
just as Aristotle made sense to himself, but looks pretty silly next to
empirical proof, I'm willing to accept a cunning and empirical refutation. Or
any refutation, really, that works out.

Thanks for reading,

William

Actually, the anti-universe is way back when. Since anti-matter is simply matter
going backward in time, when the big bang occured, the matter and anti-matter
that was not eliminated went in opposite directions in time.

Well, I didn't read the book, but here's the rest:

In Elisson, high-level thoughts are spread out across many domdules;
they can use all the Notice-level functions of any domdule, and benefit
from all of them.  The key thoughts, as with humans, take place on
*this* level, and not the domdule level.  I believe that symbols, with
their power to symbolize across domdules ("cat" implies fur and meow),
are the key to the problem of interfacing.  This is what I have called
"the research problem of symbolics", which has its own table of contents
in Coding a Transhuman AI.

Webmind integrates the Notice level through a common Represent format,
but that's not enough.  High-level thoughts, Understanding, must be
built on the Notice level.  Webmind contains no designed way (that I've
read yet) to build on the Notice level.  Because the Notice functions
are all expressed using the same basic format, it is conceivable that
they will combine to form higher-level patterns - perhaps even across
formats, where agents exist to bind them.  But such flashes of
Understanding will be tentative, because the system has not been
designed around them.  The Notice level can *only* interact through the
Represent level, and only the presence of heuristics, Notice-agents that
notice Notice interactions, would allow for the presence of
Understanding at all.  Even then it would be awkward, since the
meta-Notice heuristic-agents can only notice the Represent-level trails
of Notice agents, and must deduce patterns from that.

In Elisson, the goal of symbolics is to integrate the Notice level
across domdules into an Understanding level.  I have proposed several
ways to do this and broken the problem into a dozen facets; I have
separated the problem of symbolic-code domdule description and
symbolic-code domdule manipulation, and pointed out how this is another
case of the reciprocal relation between reflection and will, between
data and choice.  But I confess that really don't know how symbolics work.

Webmind's answer to the problem of symbolics is that the Notice level
interacts through the Represent level; the Notice level uses no special
data formats and cannot be manipulated directly.  It is a legitimate
answer; {solving the problem of interaction through reduction to a lower
level} is a very useful design principle.  In this case, I do not think
it suffices.  The Notice level requires its own data formats and its own
manipulative choices, the interface to symbols.

I don't know what programs these symbols in humans, and for Elisson I
have suggested heuristics, pattern-catchers, programmer intervention,
and even Elisson's conscious design; I have suggested nonsymbolic
solutions such as analogic thought and fractional heuristic soup.  But
it is a problem that has to be addressed.

Anyway, that's my initial take on Webmind.

Infinity is a tricky concept to handle.  We can visualize infinity mathematically,
but there is no infinite quantity of anything or else it would be everywhere.

Infinity can be approximated by it's place in this equation:

lim 1/oo=0

The term "lim" means the limit approximation, "oo" is the infinity symbol.

Here is a reference to the CRC Concise Encyclopedia of Mathematics about infinity:

http://www.astro.virginia.edu/~eww6n/math/Infinity.html

This referenced page is talking about scalar infinity, that is, infinity in terms
of the rest of the numbers, and in one dimension.  There are multiple dimensions,
so considering infinity in terms of multiple dimensions is exponentially more
confusing.  I don't fully understand infinity in multiple or an infinite number of
dimensions.

I would disagree to some extent.  Things change, people change.  At a given time,
we might consider a thing to be a particular thing, but at a different time, it is
different.

I would say that, among other things, it isn't the emotions and spiritual content
of humanity, but a hard-core atheist might counter that those are simply complex
biochemical reactions.

It is pretty much everything that would ever be considered, and those things which
are not wholly of our universe take place in our universe, unless they don't, in
which case they don't.  I realize this is a circular argument, but don't see a
simpler way to explain my understanding of said situation.  Things beyond our
"universe", in terms of energy or matter, are the subject of this thread.

That is limiting.  We can empirically prove certain things, and, for example,
reproduce most chemical reactions with accuracy.  That is on the real scale.

I don't really offer a refutation because it's based upon point of view.  My point
of view is that mathematical infinity exists and the Infinity reference page
listed above has been updated since I posted the Identity Expression Statement,
lim 1/oo=0, to sci.math.moderated on March 11, 1999.

http://www.dejanews.com/[ST_rn=qs]/qs.xp?QRY=%7Eg+sci.math.moderated&OP=dnquery.xp&ST=QS&DBS=2

The Identity Expression Statement is about mathematical identities and numerology,
not personal identity, which makes us each individuals.

If you look up the actual term of anti universe it describes a universe 
just the opposite from our own. Scientists know that anitprotons and 
antielectrons exist (because such particles have been produced in 
particle accelerators) Could there be a mirror of our own universe? 
Presently, this is only a theory.

The universe is the total amount of matter and radiation that exists and 
the space occupied by the same and in between. The interactions within 
the universe are often explained using four basic physical 
forces-gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear, and weak interactions.

The commonly accepted model of the universe suggests that it began in an 
infinitely compact and singular state, enclosing a space even smaller 
than an atomic particle.

Here are a couple models (of the universe) I read about:

The steady state model-The universe has no end or beginning. As the 
universe expands, the distribution of galaxies and other objects remains 
constant, with old galaxies being replaced with new galaxies,
making the universe appear to remain unchanged. This requires that new 
hydrogen protons be created spontaneously to keep the density of matter 
constant, but just how, no one knows.

Balanced universe model-the force of gravity exactly equals the force of 
expansion, and the universe just evantually stops expanding. 
(sort of like the balloon theory mentioned on extropy)

Inflationary model-the universe keeeps expanding or stops. If scientists 
discover there is no dark matter, then the universe will expand forever, 
if dark matter is present, then expansion will eventually stop.

The open universe model-the universe expands toward infinity, and the 
galaxies and stars, and planets spread out uniformly in all directions. 
(continuing to expand forever)

The closed universe model-The universe expands, but gravity takes over 
at some point causing the universe to collapse.

That doesn't really answer any questions, but it's the closest info I 
could dig up.

Gina, I could perhaps have introduced the concept a little more
gradually or gently to avoid squicking those recently joining the
conversation.  {8^D  Please follow me here:

Two good friends tied the knot upon graduating high school
and within a year a baby girl was conceived.  By ultrasound
they learned their fetus was extensively handicapped.  After
an agonizing month, they decided to go thru with the birth.
She was born with a severe case of spina bifida, with myelocele
(exposed section of spine with unformed lower vertebrae).
The doctors considered her chances of reaching her teens
as a poor, but said if she manages to survive to the end of the growth
time, she might have many years of adulthood.

Turns out, this child was given a wonderful gift to compensate
for her physical deformity: a triple dose of courage, can-do attitude
and fighting spirit.  She can do many wonderful things, that you and
I cannot do: she drags her tiny and useless aft limbs along the floor,
but her arms have compensated.  She can lift her weight
with either arm (admittedly not much weight) and can
clamber up on a chair without turning it over.  She uses
her chin as an appendage of sorts.  She is fiercely independent,
and can do for herself quite competently.

I have refered to this girl as "child" but in fact she turns
20 this summer, beating the medics dire predictions.

Nowthen, consider the facts that we know from our
extensive experience from the commie space station:
weightlessness is bad for you.  Even if the astronauts
exercise, they practically have to be carried off the
lander after a few month on orbit.  The large bones
immediately start to dump calcium after launch, by which
I mean the femurs and tibias.  All that excess calcium does
all kinds of harm to the kidneys and other organs, in
addition to all the muscle atrophy that takes place.
Fact: weightlessness is unhealthy.

So who do we choose for astronauts?  We choose fighter
pilots, all American, football playing, built-like-greek-
gods, mostly men.  Exactly the type that will suffer most
from going weightless for the 8 month trip to Mars.

Why not a small woman?  Why not get a small handicapped
woman without those big muscular femurs?  Nevermind
the calcium dumping aspect, what about the fact that she
eats a fraction of a normal sized man, and produces a
fraction the solid and liquid wastes, and can be comfortable
in a much smaller space?  She has entertained herself for
years with video games.  A long space voyage would not
be all that different from her previous life.

If we used a physically challenged person for the first
Mars mission, it would form a wonderful morale booster
for the earthbound handicapped.  It would make the term
"differently abled" into more than just the latest politically
correct term for crippled, it would come to actually
mean *differently abled* because it would
point out that these people really are better at some
tasks than are "normal" people.

Eliezer has encouraged us to talk about things that
we can start doing right now, as opposed to the
distant and foggy future.  This is a prime example:
for a Mars mission, *everything* scales to the size of
the crew.  If you scale it all the way down to one
person, especially a 30 kg person (like the spina
bifida victim I described earlier), then we currently
*have* the propulsion technology to get her to
Mars.  Today, now!  Three shuttle launches would
suffice, or perhaps 5 Titans.

And I will tell you Gina, I would bet on that young lady,
long before I would bet on the track star fighter jocks
we now have. I would bet on her to have the intestinal
fortitude to fight against long odds, to work steadily to set
up an environment for future generations in that
harsh space environment.  Even if her farm capsule failed
and she faced death by starvation, I would bet on her
to continue to work to the end of her strength to build
infrastructure for those who would follow, inspired by her
courage.  Her whole life has been spent meeting and overcoming
severe challenges.  This indeed could be the mother
of the Martian race.  spike

Simple, it's extremely difficult to stay in ones field and not branch out.
Scientists reward those who do not give in to temptation and shun those who
do. Science is not about making sweeping generalisations in fields you do
not understand, unless youre a physicist.

I'm not sure of Drexler's political policy now but I found EOC and UTF to be
somewhat naive when concerned with economics and politics. The approach the
Foresight Institute takes now is AFAIK purely educational but that is likely
to change. I find this worrying; people are all to eager to come forward
with the (grossly speculative) dangers of their research and this could lead
to government intervention. I would personally rather be sorry than safe.

Obviously it won't last; Drexler has done too much to advance the field to
be ignored.

The Voyage
In this sailing ship of ours, navigating in the Sea of the Unknown for two
millenia, in a voyage of discover of ourselves, our creator and our purpose in
life, the navigation stars are fading.

The elite of the crew no longer looks at the stars, knowing that we are nothing
more than a temporary collection of recycled carbon compounds occupying space
in a huge and unfeeling universe.  They finally understood that life is an
accidental byproduct of matter - a mistake of Nature, in the sense that
consciousness (the metaphorical Tree of Knowledge) is nothing but the capacity
to understand and fear our physical and metaphysical misfortunes, and that
there is no purpose in life except the one that we make for ourselves during
the short cycles of our existences.

But the rest of the crew, the great majority, is stuck in the inertia of 2000
years of old habits of belief, constantly haunted in the unconscious labyrinths
of the collective psyches with the nightmare that there is no creator - besides
the whole process of evolution - and therefore no hope for life after death.

The ship will go on sailing, until it sinks or finds a friendly utopic harbor,
where we can enjoy our short existences, without illusions of divine origins,
and get out in a easy and dignified way.

Are you aware that this is the same reasoning that gives rise to the

Yes, it is a mirror of our own in the time dimension as well, which puts it some
30 billion years in our past and going further backward every second. Feynman
showed that anti-particles are simply their counterparts moving backward in
time, which is how the Transactional Interpretation works.

Re: Arnaldo's Voyage
This type of meaningless negativity should be ignored, but I couldn't stop
myself from replying.
    The stars are more clear than they have ever been in mankind's history.
We are children of the universe and stand on the edge of accepting our place
among those stars.  The levels of connection between ourselves and every
single piece of matter become ever more defined with each piece of
scientific knowledge we gain.  We are not a mistake - rather we are the
product of a cosmos that builds upon itself - with ever deeper complexity in
every step forward.
    The purpose of life is life and by every possible avenue to avoid death
and the loss of the valuable connections that are created by every living
thing.  There may not be an anthropic creator - but there is a creator - the
universe itself.  There may not be life after death but there is the
struggle for life itself and the knowledge that every living thing has added
in some minute way to the progression of life towards its spread through the
universe.  Death is neither easy nor dignified, in whatever form it takes
and our culture of respecting death must end now.  It is our enemy, we must
"rage against the dying of the light" with all possible means.
    We have nothing to fear though.  The organizing force in the universe is
irresistable, immortality and the diaspora of life through our galaxy and
the rest of the cosmos in one form or another is inevitable.

I want to create a school for polymaths. Students would be able to choose
modules from science and philosophy combining them in whatever way they feel
appropriate to create an entirely unique and flexible course of study. There
will be no set course length and students will be encouraged to 'bring in'
other areas of study and give lectures to other students. I would like the
hierarchy to be non-existent - all active members of the school should be
considered students. Obviously there would have to be some sort of flexible
awards system for potential employers but this will not be considered a
major factor by the school. That is to say, students will spend their time
worrying about their subjects rather than their examinations. The school, I
believe, could be self-funding by offering the services of its students to
various companies, organisations, and governments. In operation it would be
more like a think tank or an institute of postdoctoral study but I would
like to refer to it as a school and treat it as such.

The most important thing about the school is that you should be able to
enter it from any background.

You'll have to excuse my naivete, I have only a cursory understanding of the
Doomsday argument.  It seems to me though that this argument can not be
applied to living systems.  Because of their special status as self
organizing systems they would seem to fall into another category altogether.
It seems that most of the points made in the doomsday arguement can only be
applied to objects which do not act on themselves.  The argument (or a
variation thereof) may actually suggest the opposite conclusion - that
humanity and life itself may reach a point where the likelihood that they
would ever be destroyed is next to nil.  There seems to be a general pattern
of increasing complexity in systems such that once a system reaches a level
of sophistication (such as the formation of atoms from subatomic particles)
it becomes highly unlikely that the system will fall apart (every atom in
the universe flies apart into its component parts).  I think it likely that
life and humanity and headed along such a path of unstoppable organization.
The only way I can see it actually applying to the number of humans alive as
a finite number is if humanity is superseded by another organism of its own
creation.  I will read deeper into the argument but at first glance it only
seems to apply to isolated, inanimate objects.

What makes this technically different from a college, aside from the
decreased emphasis on examinations?

Perhaps the entire school could live on the internet, or a similar computer
network, to encourage geographic, ethnic, liguistic, et. al diversity...
What do you think?

In a biography I read recently I saw a man described as a "lifelong
student".  It's very important to cultivate the habit of learning as a
lifelong endeavor.  There's no reason you can't continue to learn new
subjects all through your life.

A school environment can provide structure and motivation to help you
focus your efforts.  It's like dieting, or stopping smoking.  Some people
can do it on their own, others do better as part of a group.

Hopefully we will see more experiments along these lines.  Some colleges
are starting to offer online courses.  It would be interesting to hear
if anyone has any experiences with them.

What are we talking about, here?  The idea that we probably live in the
time with the largest population, ergo there are no galactic civilizations?

Nope.  Argument falls apart if the population keeps growing infinitely. 
And, if an infinite population lets us be here now, I don't see why a
finite population would make it harder.

The problem is that all situations "require", "predict" our modern
environment, and while a situation that predicts it with a higher
absolute probability would be more likely, I don't think that the
relative probability can yield predictive heuristics.

I mean, what you're saying is that if I don't know whether I'm in an
environment where everyone has different numbers or everyone has the
same number, no matter which number I get, I should predict that
everyone has the same number.  Or at least that's sort of what it sounds
like.  Now, if I had to guess everyone else's number, I'd guess it was
the same as mine, because I don't have anything better to guess.  But
that doesn't mean I know anything more about whether everyone really
does have the same number.

If you know the relative probabilities, you can assume you're any
observer.  I don't think it works in reverse.

The Doomsday argument doesn't look very predictive.  I mean, every
single generation except ours that tried to use it would be wrong,
right?  And we have no reason to think that we'll be different, right? 
According to the "predict the present given the past" clause, this
heuristic is no good.

Actually, I don't know if I accept the Doomsday argument.  Maybe when I
decide, I'll add another adjective to Yudkowsky's Modified Anthropic
Occam's Razor.

But if I did accept the Doomsday argument, given the number of times I
have to use the Anthropic principle to explain my own existence - once
for the noncomputable qualia, and another time for being a Specialist,
and another time for having the chance to do something fun and
important, e.g. Singularity - I'd have to assume I was a computer
simulation, right?  I mean, I'm something out of science fiction, so I'd
have to assume I was *actual* science fiction.  There are more books
than people, right?  This set of assumptions explains all the facts at a
much higher relative probability, right?

So, insofar as I still tentatively think the world is real, and I'm not
just being run as a test case to determine whether a certain type of
IEer is trustworthy, and I'm not a book, then I'd say I'd also have to
reject the Doomsday argument.  Of course, if you really exist, you're
welcome to think differently.

I am a habitual student. Currently I am taking a computer course thru 
the National Radio Institute. I live in Washington state, and they are 
located in Washington D.C. I am sent books thru the mail, and CD Roms 
along with disks. I mail my homework to them, and they mail my grades 
back. As I progress, more work is sent to me. It's working out just 
fine.

Decreased emphasis on examinations is (in most cases) enough to make for an
entirely different environment. The emphasis is on flexibility. Course
length is not defined. Course structure is not defined. Course content is
not defined. In many ways the difference will depend on what sort of
education you have or are receiving - in my experience 'flexible' is
definitely not a term I would associate with any level of education or
academia.

None of the above. And that's entirely the point. Any age, any level of
knowledge, self taught or formal education. Although to some degree you can
do anything at any age with any background in the current system it's far
from encouraged.

Founded on the principle that all men were not created equal.

I ask, because there are already colleges out there which allow for a great
deal of flexibility.  Have you taken a look at Hampshire college, for example?

http://www.hampshire.edu

There are others like it.

What about following through with the earlier idea about spreading our memes
by trying to develop courses in Transhumanism and get colleges to offer
them.  Perhaps the professors on the list could comment on how we might best
approach this task, how courses are introduced into departments, which
colleges/professors might be good for us to target, etc.  I would guess that
we should go ahead and create a complete curriculum for an introductory
course.  Professors can and will customize it, but they may be more open to
the idea and appreciative if we can hand them a complete course.  Comments?

Hello,

Academia is certainly losing some of its luster in light of freely available
Internet educational resources.

Calculators should not be allowed in elementary and secondary math classes.
Paper, pencil, rulers, and compasses are allowed.

Baseball caps of improper size restrict blood flow to the brain, and thus
should not be allowed to be worn in class.

A proper nutritional regimen should be federally mandated in all school lunch
programs.  This might involve vitamin supplements.

Overprescription of mood-altering drugs to children is the wrong approach for
"attention deficit disorder", a more correct approach would be giving students
something interesting.  Mood-altering medication should only be prescribed for
severely emotionally disturbed children.

Standardized tests, and testing in general, are important and relatively
unbiased measures of scholastic aptitude and ability.

Teachers should be well versed in their subjects.

The schools should get together and make a huge emporium of educational
resources for all.

I am not a "professional" educator, but I strive to be a good one.

Teaching methods used for gifted and talented accelerated track learning should
be applied to all students.

The primary goal of education should be the imbuement of problem solving skills
and the ability to learn and reason, rote memorization is important for
spelling and medicine, among other things.  Etymology should be taught on all
levels.

The fundamentals of learning and knowledge are an important foundation for
success.

Well, I have now.  Looks good; but so does everything in a prospectus.
(What college doesn't claim to be flexible?)

     In response to the medication of children. I have noticed a fad 
(similar to the valum trend in the 70's) in children being fed 
medication. 
     It seems to me, that parents may be using this as a crutch for a 
typical handful of a child. This may due some damage, considering that a 
child is still developing. It may just be some hormonal embalance, that 
with age would mature to a even state.
     Parents should try loving their children more, before resorting to 
Dr. and pills. It appears to be an epidemic.

How about a section for "Extropians on the Web" -- a directory of
extropians with home pages. They may not be directly related to
extropianism, but it could be a useful resource for those of us who would
like to snoop around and see what other extropians are like on a more
personal level.

I'm taking an online class right now (my college offers a few, mostly in 
the English and Math departments).  The one I am taking is a literature 
class.  Our class uses a discussion board to discuss the different works 
we are reading.  Compared to a live classroom it has some benefits and 
drawbacks.  One of the benefits is the ability to focus your thoughts. 
Another benefit is the ability to ponder for a while what someone else 
said.  One of the drawbacks is that a person can ramble on and on about 
something nobody cares about.  In a regular classroom the instructor can 
guide the discussion.  I would have to say the best benefit is the fact 
that a person's arguments are judged on the arguments alone, not on what 
they happen to be wearing that day or if they have a really annoying 
voice.  These types of classes are only useful to those people who are 
motivated to keep up.  You don't have an instructor giving you dirty 
looks for not doing your work.  Most of the people who take these 
classes have many other engagements to keep, such as family and work, 
and so the flexibility is very useful to them.  Basically the form of 
the class is very much like this mailing list except that the discussion 
board is a little more organized.  If you want to check it out go to:

I just searched the Extropy Mailing List archives for "Yudkowsky's AI" and
got no results.  This is odd, because I KNOW that at least a dozen messages
with that subject heading are already stored on the archives (I found them
by browsing by date).

What's up here?

    Shouldn't the means justify themselves? Aren't they either moral or

Point well taken.  :)  Nonetheless, a friend of mine is a student there,
and from what I've heard, it is as flexible as it sounds.  Anyway, the
point being that there may be an easier way to get what you're looking for:
rather than starting up a new school, if you've got the travel budget you
could try to seek out the school that best fits your specifications.

Au contraire, it applies *only* (at least directly) to living

Even if the Doomsday argument is right, we can improve our odds by 
taking action to minimize the risks. Indeed, the DA could make such 
actions seem even more justified.

This is actually the scary part. If there is such a ponit in the 
relatively near future, then the DA would suggest that there is a 
large probability that we will go extinct before we reach that point.

That *might* be a possibility that is not ruled out by the DA; it 
depends on the reference class problem, which has not been solved 
yet.

Several people have answered my first question with "yes", and an implicit
assumption in their reasoning is that before you know what your number is
you should reason as if the 100!-th digit of PI is uniformly distributed.
This assumption, along with the Self-Sampling Assumption is needed to
reach the above conclusion. But of course the 100!-th digit of PI has a
definite value and is not random. So how do we justify the use of the
uniform distribution here? And in general when faced with a computational
problem that we can't solve, (1) does it always make sense to reason as if
there is a probability distribution on the answer and (2) how do we come
up with this distribution?

I don't fully understand the issue here.  Suppose I flip a coin but don't
look at how it lands yet.  I can assume a uniform distribution.  But I
can expend some effort, say, leaning over and looking at the floor, and
learn what the coin is.  At the cost of expending that effort I learn
whether the coin fell heads or tails.

Can't computational uncertainty be treated the same way?  I don't know the
21st digit of pi off hand, although I have memorized pi beyond that point.
At the cost of some effort, I can recite pi in my head and learn the
21st digit.

In either case, until I take the action necessary to reduce my
uncertainty, the best I can do is to make use of the basic information
available.  I know that the 21st digit of pi is a decimal digit from 0
through 9, and I know that the coin fell heads or tails.  I assume the
value is chosen uniformly from these distributions.  When I expend the
effort to learn more, I can reduce the uncertainty.

I guess that the problem comes into play when the effort needed to make
deductions on the basis of uncertainty is larger than the effort needed
to reduce the uncertainty.  And with computational uncertainty this is
especially worrisome, since the kind of effort involved in both cases is
the same, namely calculation and reasoning.  With the coin we can more
easily draw a distinction between hard thought about heads and tails,
vs. leaning over and peeking at the coin.

Maybe it makes sense to use a cost model where the cost of reasoning
about uncertainty is included explicitly.  You could then have a specified
cost for reducing uncertainty, which would be especially easy to describe
for computational uncertainty.

If the universe is constantly expanding, how is it that we think that the
earth is cooling down adn that the moon was once an earth but is now dead?
Wouldn't it follow that if the universe is expanding, then things would be
getting hotter, then the earth would be becoming more towards like the sun
and the moon like the earth...?

I went to a school like this for eighth grade, except it focused less on math
and more on science and liberal art.  No grades, no finals.  I learned almost
nothing there.  School like that require you to be a self starter and capable of
learning directly from a book.  With no structure, the place promptly went to
Hell <pardon my language.  I lack a better cliche.>  The school is now generally
considered the last step before reform school for troublemakers.

Young, smart people should never be subjected to absolutely no structure.  We
blow things up.  :p

Thanks to Brian Atkins, we will very soon makes some real progress in this
area. Thanks for your suggestions here, Dan. I'll note them for when I work
on this. If you read the Exponent newsletter, recently added to ExI's
website, you'll see that we do have plans for what is current the "Ideas"
section.

Please do send your suggestions for links. I will be accumulating this
information, though my first focus will be on information and links
relevant to the themes of Extro 4: BIOTECH FUTURES.

Please, don't mistake my intentions - maybe I should have been more blunt.
I believe that religion was a major stepping stone for humanity in
understanding nature - thousands of years ago.  It has become twisted over
time into a wrote memorization of rules for living that were useful in the
infancy of civilization. But it is a persistent ideology, one that refuses
to release its many tentacled grip on most of humanity.
    I claim no theology.  I accept the world as it presents itself, which I
suppose could be considered an ideology in itself.  For now the most logical
explanation for our existence would seem to be that we (life) were created
and shaped from the natural laws of the cosmos.  If at some later time it
can be objectively proven that we were created by some power mad super being
with a need for playthings, so be it, but the evidence is heavily stacked
against it.
    People are never "stuck" with an idea system.  It takes strength of will
to analyze your own belief system and find it lacking, but there is nothing
stopping a person from doing so.  The post caught my attention mainly
because of its "wayward soul" conotation.  I would hope those subscribing to
this list would have the utmost sense of direction.  I am not a searcher,
not a seeker, but a doer.

P.S.  I can't believe I've been sucked into a religious philosophy
discussion.  Somebody remind to take my frustrations out elsewhere and just
ignore it the next time this topic raises its ugly head here.

Even for the extremely simplistic argument you've presented, you've got it
backwards.  Expanding systems cool, compressed systems heat up.

...even though it looks like it.  I repost here without permission, because
the claim is so paradigm-busting and consequential if true that it must
have vast implications for many of the topics we usually discuss, including
brain function and routes to AI:


>From The Independent Review, March 19th, 1999:

           The memory of molecules
           =======================

           Can molecules communicate with each other,
           exchanging information without being in physical
           contact? French biologist Jacques Benveniste believes
           so, but his scientific peers are still sceptical. By Lionel
           Milgrom

           Jacques Benveniste was once considered to be one of
           France's most respected biologists, until he was cast
           adrift from the scientific mainstream. His downfall
           began in 1988 when he infuriated the scientific
           community with experimental results which he took
           as evidence to suggest that water has a memory. His
           ideas were seized upon by homeopaths keen to find
           support for their theories on highly diluted
           medicines, but were condemned by scientific purists.
           Now, Benveniste believes he has evidence to suggest
           that it may one day be possible to transmit the
           curative power of life-saving drugs around the world
           - via the Internet.

           It sounds like science fiction and Benveniste will
           have a hard time convincing a deeply sceptical world
           that he is right. Nevertheless, he began his campaign
           last week when he announced the latest research to
           come out of his Digital Biology Laboratory near Paris,
           to a packed audience of scientists at the Pippard
           Lecture Theatre at Cambridge University's Cavendish
           Physics Laboratory. Benveniste suggested that the
           specific effects of biologically active molecules such as
           adrenalin, nicotine and caffeine, and the
           immunological signatures of viruses and bacteria, can
           be recorded and digitised using a computer
           sound-card. A keystroke later, and these signals can be
           winging their way across the globe, courtesy of the
           Internet. Biological systems far away from their
           activating molecules can then - he suggested - be
           triggered simply by playing back the recordings.

           Most scientists have dismissed Benveniste as being
           on the fringe, although there were some famous
           names in the audience last week, including Sir
           Andrew Huxley, Nobel laureate and past president of
           the Royal Society, and the physicist Professor Brian
           Josephson, also a Nobel laureate. Benveniste started
           by asking some apparently childish questions. If
           molecules could talk, what would they sound like?
           More specifically, can we eavesdrop on their
           conversations, record them, and play them back? The
           answer to these last three questions is, according to
           Benveniste, a resounding "Oui!" He further suggested
           that these "recordings" can make molecules respond
           in the same way as they do when they react.
           Contradicting the way biologists think biochemical
           reactions occur, he claims molecules do not have to
           be in close proximity to affect each other. "It's like
           listening to Pavarotti or Elton John," Benveniste
           explained. "We hear the sound and experience
           emotions, whether they're live or on CD."

           For example, anger produces adrenalin. When
           adrenalin molecules bind to their receptor sites, they
           set off a string of biological events that, among other
           things, make blood vessels contract. Biologists say that
           adrenalin is acting as a molecular signalling device
           but, Benveniste asks, what is the real nature of the
           signal? And how come the adrenalin molecules
           specifically target their receptors and no others, at
           incredible speed? According to Benveniste, if the
           cause of such biochemical events were simply due to
           random collisions between adrenalin molecules and
           their receptors (the currently accepted theory of
           molecular signalling), then it should take longer than
           it does to get angry.

           Benveniste became the bete noire of the French
           scientific establishment back in 1988, when a paper he
           had published in the science journal Nature was later
           rubbished by the then editor, Sir John Maddox, and a
           team that included a professional magician, James
           Randi. With an international group of scientists from
           Canada, France, Israel and Italy, Benveniste had
           claimed that vigorously shaking water solutions of an
           antibody could evoke a biological response, even
           when that antibody was diluted out of existence.
           Non-agitated solutions produced little or no effect.
           Nature said that the results of the experiment that
           produced the "ghostly antibodies" were, frankly,
           unbelievable. The journal itself came in for criticism
           for publishing the paper in the first place.

           In his Nature paper, Benveniste reasoned that the
           effect of dilution and agitation pointed to
           transmission of biological information via some
           molecular organisation going on in water. This
           "memory of water" effect, as it was later known,
           proved Benveniste's academic undoing. For while
           the referees of his Nature paper could not fault
           Benveniste's experimental procedures, they could not
           understand his results. How, they asked, can a
           biological system respond to an antigen when no
           molecules of it can be detected in solution? It goes
           against the accepted "lock-and-key" principle, which
           states that molecules must be in contact and
           structurally match before information can be
           exchanged. Such thinking has dominated the
           biological sciences for more than four decades, and is
           itself rooted in the views of the 17th-century French
           philosopher Rene Descartes.

           Nature's attempted debunking exercise failed to find
           evidence of fraud, but concluded that Benveniste's
           research was essentially unreproducible, a claim he
           has always denied. From being a respected figure in
           the French biological establishment, Benveniste was
           pilloried, losing his government funding and his
           laboratory. Undeterred, he and his now-depleted
           research team somehow continued to investigate the
           biological effects of agitated, highly dilute solutions.
           The latest results are, for biologists, even more
           incredible than those in the 1988 Nature paper.
           Physicists, however, should have less of a problem as
           their discipline is based on fields (eg gravitational,
           electromagnetic) which have well-established
           long-range effects. If Benveniste's claims prove to be
           true - which is far from certain - they could have
           profound consequences, not least for medical
           diagnostics.

           Benveniste's explanation starts innocuously enough
           with a musical analogy. Two vibrating strings close
           together in frequency will produce a "beat". The
           length of this beat increases as the two frequencies
           approach each other. Eventually, when they are the
           same, the beat disappears. This is the way musicians
           tune their instruments, and Benveniste uses the
           analogy to explain his water-memory theory. Thus,
           all molecules are made from atoms which are
           constantly vibrating and emitting infrared radiation
           in a highly complex manner. These infrared
           vibrations have been detected for years by scientists,
           and are a vital part of their armoury of methods for
           identifying molecules.

           However, precisely because of the complexity of their
           infrared vibrations, molecules also produce much
           lower "beat" frequencies. It turns out that these beats
           are within the human audible range (20 to 20,000
           Hertz) and are specific for every different molecule.
           Thus, as well as radiating in the infrared region,
           molecules also broadcast frequencies in the same
           range as the human voice. This is the molecular
           signal that Benveniste detects and records.

           If molecules can broadcast, then they should also be
           able to receive. The specific broadcast of one
           molecular species will be picked up by another,
           "tuned" by its molecular structure to receive it.
           Benveniste calls this matching of broadcast with
           reception "co-resonance", and says it works like a
           radio set. Thus, when you tune your radio to, say,
           Classic FM, both your set and the transmitting station
           are vibrating at the same frequency. Twitch the dial a
           little, and you're listening to Radio 1: different
           tuning, different sounds.

           This, Benveniste claims, is how millions of biological
           molecules manage to communicate at the speed of
           light with their own corresponding molecule and no
           other. It also explains why minute changes in the
           structure of a molecule can profoundly alter its
           biological effect. It is not that these tiny structural
           changes make it a bad fit with its biological receptor
           (the classical lock-and-key approach). The structural
           modifications "detune" the molecule to its receptor.
           What is more, and just like radio sets and receivers,
           the molecules do not have to be close together for
           communication to take place.

           So what is the function of water in all this?
           Benveniste explains this by pointing out that all
           biological reactions occur in water. The water
           molecules completely surround every other molecule
           placed among them. A single protein molecule, for
           example, will have a fan club of at least 10,000
           admiring water molecules. And they are not just
           hangers-on. Benveniste believes they are the agents
           that in fact relay and amplify the biological signal
           coming from the original molecule.

           It is like a CD which, by itself, cannot produce a sound
           but has the means to create it etched into its surface.
           In order for the sound to be heard, it needs to be
           played back through an electronic amplifier. And just
           as Pavarotti or Elton John is on the CD only as a
           "memory", so water can memorise and amplify the
           signals of molecules that have been dissolved and
           diluted out of existence. The molecules do not have
           to be there, only their "imprint" on the solution in
           which they are dissolved. Agitation makes the
           memory.

           So what do molecules sound like? "At the moment
           we don't quite know," says Didier Guillonnet,
           Benveniste's colleague at the Digital Research
           Laboratory. "When we record a molecule such as
           caffeine, for example, we should get a spectrum, but it
           seems more like noise. However, when we play the
           caffeine recording back to a biological system sensitive
           to it, the system reacts. We are only recording and
           replaying; at the moment we cannot recognise a
           pattern." "But," Benveniste adds, "the biological
           systems do. We've sent the caffeine signal across the
           Atlantic by standard telecommunications and it's still
           produced an effect."

           The effect is measured on a "biological system" such
           as a piece of living tissue. Benveniste claims, for
           instance, that the signal from molecules of heparin - a
           component of the blood-clotting system - slows down
           coagulation of blood when transmitted over the
           Internet from a laboratory in Europe to another in the
           US. If true, it will undoubtedly earn Benveniste a
           Nobel prize. If not, he will receive only more scorn.

           Benveniste's ideas are revolutionary - many might
           say heretical or misguided - and he is unlikely to
           persuade his most ardent critics. Although his ideas
           may seem plausible enough, he will win over his
           enemies only if his results can be replicated by other
           laboratories. So far this has not been done to the
           satisfaction of his many detractors.

Is Bryan Moss actually Lyle Burkhead in a cunning plastic disguise?  (This
question is meant literally, no winks, nudges or smirks.)   I'd wondered if
Lyle would re-emerge on the list. 

If not, does anyone know if Lyle ever founded his proposed on-line
educational set-up?  Yes, I've tried AltaVista with no success.

What if he's partly right, and partly wrong?

I'd buy the action-at-a-distance from molecular magnetic resonance _long_
before I bought the water molecules remembering.

Overall, reminds me too much of Blondlot's N Rays.

I didn't call you anything, Gina.  I asked a question, with an implication
that laziness was *not* the explanation.  Your reply about the lack of a
mouse answered that question (although I'm stunned that someone using the
net would not have a mouse, they're not *that* expensive).

What distinguished N rays from X rays was a whole lot of warning signals
from the experimenter, such as too many digits' accuracy in reported
refraction. One of Rutherford's associates blew Blondlot's methodology by
pocketing the aluminum prism before everyone's eyes were dark-adapted...
Blondlot kept getting results from the "N-Spectroscope".

There's a paper on pathological science that makes really good reading.
This smells like it. Particularly the part about not getting spectra and
the homeopathic thang. Let's see the work reproduced.

Like the nanobes, I label it "interesting if true".  But I'm a
would-be-zetet, not a kneejerk skeptic.

Although I have blown up my fair share of stuff, I wouldn't say that is 
was for lack of structure.  I often find myself focusing more on 
strategies for passing my classes, getting the grades I want (and need), 
and just generally how to navigate through the all bureaucracy. I think 
that for some a structure-less environment would facilitate learning and 
productivity.  Anyone who must be forced to learn doesn't really belong

Well, he certainly doesn't know much about neurobiology. We get
angry via synaptic transmissions, which happen in a small number of
milliseconds, just as predicted by physics.

Whole-body hormonal adrenal events are predicted to require up to
several minutes and that turns out to be correct too.

"Failed to find evidence of fraud" is an *extremely* charitable way
of putting it.  Randi switched some of the bottles without telling
Beneviste.  The bottles that *had* been treated - but that Beneviste
thought hadn't - showed no reaction.  The bottles that *had not* 
been treated - but that Beneviste thought had - had a reaction!
Clearly the effect was quite bogus, and that's certainly evidence
for fraud.  Fraud wasn't *proved*, because Beneviste could be a 
wishful incompetent.  

So now somebody whose experiments are, intentionally or unintentionally,
fudged, has found a new implausible effect which solves a "problem"
which actually doesn't exist.  Pardon me if I'm not impressed.

why would *all* molecules resonate between 20Hz and 20kHz? After all,
there are many other possible frequencies. Also, I find it very hard to
believe that every permutational form of matter lies between that
spectrum, or the difference in frequencies may be too precise to replicate
correctly. If the frequency was 30.00000Hz for HNO3, and 30.00001Hz for
HPO3, how could he expect to record and reproduce sounds to that degree of
precision? Also, wouldnt this proposition mean that any reproduction of
sounds may have a potentially dangerous effect? Certainly much more random
events would be occuring in everyday life.

the whole thing smells like a joke to me :P~

How do you know? How do we know anything?
Mostly we either accept what's been given to us (ie things like the "big
bang theory" or current popular beliefs on the way things *are*) and we
don't question. The only other way of knowing something is experiencing it
for yourself. That's difficult, especially when we want to go into the
realm of imagination always.

Something I find interesting is the idea that in an experiment, there's no
such thing as a "control" simply because the experimenter has an affect on
the entire experiment. There's no such thing as "separateness" - it's all
part of the way we think about things that brings about "categories".

The problem isn't just that this would be a completely new model for
how molecules interact, but that it seems to invalidate existing models.
The notion that molecules interact through physical contact has been the
basis for all of chemistry as well as biology.  If nonlocal interactions
are possible why haven't we seen them in chemistry?  You wouldn't need an
expensive catalyst, you could just shake it in water as you dilute it to
the vanishing point.  I find it hard to believe that such an important
effect would have been overlooked by practical, profit driven chemical
engineers for over 100 years.

And then there is all the successful work with current models in biology,
like drug design based on the lock and key concept.  Why should it be that
we find that effective drugs and hormones do in fact fit their receptor
molecules using a physical connection model?  A remote resonance concept
doesn't explain that very well.

It would be one thing if the guy proposing this had some credibility,
but he's apparently been guilty of claiming remarkable effects which
he wasn't able to reproduce in front of skeptics.  That's a pretty weak
basis for paying attention when he claims that everything we know is
wrong.

Each to their own.  Though when I said structure I didn't quite mean being
forced to learn.  I don't think that's possible.  From my own experience
I've found that it's certainly easy enough to ignore assignments and mess
around when there are no teachers teaching, no goals to be met, and no
rewards for staying on task.  I don't many people who will do something they
don't want to do if they don't have to.

I don't think my experiences come from lack of desire to gain knowledge.
I'm rather fond of learning, but given a choice, the topics that I would
chose to learn aren't necessarily the ones I need.  I'd learn an obsolete
math trick over Government anyday <which is probably why I'm the only one of
my classmates that knows how to find a sqare root without a calculator.>  I
agree school bureaucracy can often get in the way of learning.  I feel that
I've learned a great deal in my local, public high school.  Unfortunately, I
never paid much attention to my grades and as such am having difficultly
entering college, despite very high test scores.

If you can function in a no structure learning environment, more power to
you.  To me, it felt like a year was ripped out of my education.  Chalk it
up to intelligence if you wish; I'm above average, but no genius.  These are
only my experiences with such a school as Bryan Moss originally described.

This is not some mysterious thing. Double blind methods work just fine to
eliminate this effect from experiments.

Not at all. In the simplistic logic you are using, expansion leads to cooling
(check the simple gas laws in any high school physics or chemistry book), however
the cooling and slowing of local astronomical objects has little to do with the
expansion of the greater universe.

The formation of the earth and moon is mostly from one larger planet that was hit
by a planetesimal in an oblique manner. The outer crustal components were ejected
into earth orbit where they eventually accreted into what we call the moon, which
is why the moon has no nickle/iron core like the earth., and why the earth has
such a thin crust compared to other similar planets like Venus and Mars. The
earth would be as geologically quiet and cyclic as Venus if it were not for the
tidal influence of the moon creating a drag on the rotation of the Earth's
mantle, causing it to slip over the core. The core retains its rotational
momentum and rotates about one more rotation per year than the mantle does. This
differential in rotation acts as a dynamo which generates our strong
electromagnetic field. Venus, Mercury, and Mars all have very weak magnetic
fields compared to earth. The only small object in the solar system which has a
similar field is Jupiter's moon Io, which is also thought to be generated by the
tidal stresses of Jupiter on the moon.

Eventually, the moon will drag the earth's rotation to a dead stop, in some 800
million or more years, at which point the only thing providing any warmth will be
the internal radioactive decay of natural isotopes and thermal convection.

If one beleived in an infinite universe, then things should definitely be getting
hotter in the skies in infinities added to infinities every day. Even allowing
for red shift dragging light down in the spectrum, the heat levels in the ELF
ranges should be so high that the very interstella gas should glow visibly.
Contrary to the claims of the steady staters, the cosmic background radiation
agree very well with the age measurements of the universe by the big bang theory,
and are coming more into agreement over time as we learn more and more.

People who are big proponents of the steady state theories either do from
ignorance, or because they have a political agenda. They hate the air of
'legitimacy' that they see the Big Bang giving to traditional religion (because
most religions talk of similar stories of creation of the universe). They put
politics ahead of science, which is never a good thing to do.

There really is no point unless it is possible to use as a source of energy.
Communication or travel are not possible between matter and anti-matter

Will you people please stop doing this. I see the spam once when it gets sent

I simply cc'd it to the list so that others wouldn't unnecessarily take the
time to do the same thing I did.  Calling me an idiot is way out of line.

That sounds pretty likely, Curt.  I posted that newspaper piece just on the
off-chance that it might lead somewhere expected and useful.

BTW, the nanobe story doesn't fall into the same category, as far as I can
tell.  It was picked up by all the major serious news outlets in Oz, can be
traced back to journal articles in what look like sound peer reviewed
journals (I haven't gone to the uni stacks and sought the refs out), and
can be found linked from various reputable university research sites.  I
think it's safe to assume that the nanobe claims are perfectly serious.
(They might also turn out to be misunderstood non-controversial
commonplaces, of course.)

Ah, I thought you were an idiot who'd posted that to the list by accident. If
I'd realised you were DELIBERATELY reposting spam to the list I'd have called
you a moron. Thanks for correcting me, and please don't repost spam to the

I agree the nanobe story is for real.  I do wonder whether they made a
mistake,
though.  They claim to have found organisms with diameters down to 20 nm
which contain DNA.  That's awful small.  There's room for a lipid layer, a DNA
helix, and that's about it - in other words, a helical DNA virus.  How could
such
a thing metabolize?  I suspect they found either viruses or chromatin strands
from dead and lysed eukaryotes.  I also note they published in a geological
journal rather than a biological journal, where this discovery would belong.
I expect they did find something interesting but probably not the 
"nanobacteria" some have been talking about.  I expect we'll see a lot more
work on this in a few months.

Well think about it, if it is actually true, which I have my serious doubts
about, it would mean that not only could medical treatments be applied by
downloading sound files from the web, but that you could replicate these sound
files and thus break the control that the drug industry has over health care.
Now, we do know that some ELF frequencies do have an effect on people, there is
even what is called the "pot" frequency, because it induces euphoria. I imagine
that if this is true the drug war will expand into cyberspace, with the DEA
searching everyone's hard drives and web servers for sound files that replicate
the drug responses of controlled substances. Receiving an email with a sound
file attachment will become a federal crime.

People will be prosecuted for practicing medicine without a license, unless
there is a doctor or cyberpharmacist on the staff of every ISP monitoring.

"Dude, check me out, I just got 10 years in Leavenworth for emailing my 'Mr.

"Harsh!"
"Well, how bout this dude, I got a life sentence for mail bombing my a-hole
teacher with a smack attack. He OD'ed, so I got a murder rap on me, I just
barely shucked a death sentence by pleading ignorance that the mail server

"Whoa!"

Another implication of this would be that you could transmit REAL viruses with
sound files!

Uh, well, it is still only the 29th of March, with the 1st of April being 3
days away. I wasn't aware that April fools day had changed from a one day
pseudo-holiday into an entire season of practical jokes in the global media.

Very roughly, yes.

You are right that the infinite case is problematic. However, 
problematic is not the same as wrong; and anyway it does not settle 
the finite case.

Let's look at the infinite case however. Try the following variant of 
Wei's example: There is a countable infinity of people with various 
even numbers; and in addition there are either (A) ten people with 
number 3 and one person with number 5; or (B) one person with number 
3 and ten people with number 5. Suppose that you find that you have 
number 3. It would seem reasonable for you to think that given this, 
A is more likely than B. And yet this is an example where there is an 
infinite population and where the argument consequently "breaks down" 
-- the conditional probability of you having number 3 is zero (or 
infinitessimal) on both A and B.

No, that depends on what the background information is.

Suppose you have two hypotheses each with 50% prior probability: (H1) 
There is a number n (0<=n<=9) such that everybody have the number n; 
(H2) For each number n (0<=n<=9), one tenth of all people have number 
n. Then finding that you have, say, number 7 doesn't give you any 
reason to prefer H1 to H2.

But suppose that instead of H1 you had (H1*): Everybody has number 7. 
And suppose that the prior probability of H1* is 50% and that the 
prior probability of H2 is also 50%. Then, finding that you have 
number 7 does indeed give you reason to think that H1* is true.

No, it doesn't say that our generation will be the last. It says that 
we have underestimated the risk that there won't be very many 
generations after ours. So we don't yet know whether our grandparents 
(or their grandparent) would have been wrong if they had applied the 
DA. But if the first few humans had applied it, then, yes, they would 
have been misled.

This is a common objection, but it is incorrect. The DA is a 
probabilistic argument, and as such it can and will give misleading 
results if applied in untypical circumstances. The first few humans 
were in untypical circumstances and therefore it is not surprising 
that they would have been misled. But try this exercise: Suppose 
everybody that will ever have lived applied the DA. Will that lead to 
a greater or a smaller fraction being right than if nobody applies 
it? We can demand of a probabilistic principle that it never misleads 
us; only that following it we will be right more often than not.

Not necessarily. Only if you assume (1) that there are many more 
observers in computer simulation than in flesh; and (2) that people 
in computer simulations are in the same reference class as people in 
flesh

Fictional people in books are not in the reference class. They don't 
really observe or find themselves as anything. People in computer 
simulations are a different matter; they might be in the reference 
class.

We don't need to assume an objective chance for these cases if we 
don't want to. You can use a person's subjective probability, which 
you find out about by asking him about what odds he would be willing 
to bet at.

Hello,

Here are some links about education.

In terms of etymology, a quick dictionary lookup is always recommended when a
word's meaning is unclear.

http://www.facstaff.bucknell.edu/rbeard/diction.html

Besides the regular search engines, a vertical search engine for education would be
good.  Here is one:

http://www.education-world.com/

also

http://www.kidsource.com/

The Yahoo directory has a category for Education:

http://dir.yahoo.com/Education/

Considering that the government runs most education in the United States, it is
certainly worthwhile to examine the government, well, perhaps it is not worthwhile
to examine the government, but that is the place to go for government information.

Ciao,

As I understand it, you want a Mars colony as insurance against the
destruction of the human race via gray goo or other 'dumb' ultratech
disasters (as opposed to a smart disaster, which would build its own
spacecraft and come looking for you).

That would be a really good idea, except that we can't possibly set up a
colony that could actually survive.  The best we can manage is to set up a
base that would be completely dependant on regular resupply from Earth, and
would die off within a few years of the disaster.

Here is my reasoning:

1) Simply surviving on any other body in the solar system will require an
elaborate technological infrastructure.  Any colony that cannot maintain its
own infrastructure will die off very quickly.

2) We want the base to be able to produce its own singularity if Earth is
depopulated.  Unless you believe in a magical,
one-invention-that-solves-all-problems genie machine, that means you need a
group of researchers big enough to perpetuate a large majority of our
current scientific knowledge.  An individual can introduce one innovation,
but there are so many different things to be done that you still need a
large group of people to make progress possible.  That means we need tens of
thousands of the best minds on Earth, or (more likely) a few hundred
thousand researchers with a more normal distribution of ability.

3) We need a functioning economy that can support the researchers and make
use of their results.  Right now you would need several hundred thousand
people just to achieve a minimal level viability, and there would still be
many different kinds of things that could not be manufactured locally.  To
get true versatility you probably need millions of top-flight people, or
tens of millions of average citizens.  Now, these numbers should start to
decline as better forms of AI emerge, but that is going to be a gradual
process.  The only way around this requirement is to make such strong
assumptions about AI that the whole exercise is pointless - if
human-equivalent AI is cheap and easy, SI will be a problem before gray goo
is even possible.

4) Right now, a massive worldwide effort might be able to set up a few
hundred people on Mars, with minimal equipment and no long-term survival
prospects.  If launch costs come down dramatically in the next 20 years we
might increase the mass we can afford to move by two orders of magnitude,
which would give us a few thousand people with the ability to handle some
basic necessities (i.e. local production of air, water and food).  This is
still far short of even the most minimal requirement (by a factor of at
least 10^2 in people, and 10^4 or worse in mass).

To sum it all up, it seems to me that interplanetary colonization requires
either a vast increase in wealth (by a factor of 10^2 or more),
nanotechnology (which would vastly reduce our minimum throw weight), or
sentient AI (which would vastly reduce the need for human staff).  Since the
appearance of nanotech or sentient AI would make the whole project moot, and
the wealth increase seems unlikely without ultratech, the idea of building
an emergency survival colony in our current era does not seem workable.

Now, as an aside, I do think it is a good use for the early products of
nanotech research.  If we get big improvements in industrial automation and
some moderately advanced nanotech, but sentient AI turns out to be a very
hard problem, then interplanetary colonies would become feasible.
Unfortunately, that means we have to solve the gray goo problem first.

Hello again,

Today I'm writing about privacy and the sovereignty of personal data.

Privacy is a broad issue, affecting many diverse areas.

For a summary of my views on privacy rights, note:

http://www.tomco.net/~raf/rights.html

Over the past ten years or so, legislation has been introduced that
concerns privacy.  One of my favorites so far is the Privacy Protection
Act of 1993, but not necessarily those of other years.  This can be
found online at http://thomas.loc.gov/.

Each of us, every day, has some of our personal data used without our
knowledge.  This is how they e- or postal mail tax forms, which is a
requirement of citizenship, and how they send anonymous bulk e-mail,
which is an invasion of privacy.  Taxation without representation is
unconstitutional, but that is a different topic.

Your personal data is in the hands of myriad diverse parties that have
absolutely no qualms to use it however they would, and no right to it.

One thing I advocate is some kind of "privacy preference profile."
Using such an item (prototypes exist), one could select what data to
share with these obnoxious marketers, and then they could pay you for
the privilege of using your personal data.

I would like to open discussion on this, and ask what others think can
be done to protect privacy and the ownership of personal data by
individuals.

Well, I was thinking about this and browsing your 'Staring into the Singularity'

You must remember that the curve merely describes the impact of the sum of the
instinctual drive to reproduce in every individual human. While we are now seeing
that this may be a third order 's' curve rather than a hyperbolic equation, the drive
to reproduce is still there in people. As people get more educated, living in a more
productive economy and making more money, they invest more money in fewer children,
as well as investing more money in themselves. These two changes are a result of the
higher life expectancy and lower infant death rate, but they retard the actual grwoth
in population to that below what might be instinctually optimum. I still doubt that
most people who may live a long time will be sexually productive the whole time. We
notice that the growth in the pet population are in those pets owned by senior
citizens. We can also see the Tamagochi toy phenomenon with this.

I conclude that the pressure for AI development will be in response to the market
expressed need for people to have companions to nurture, develop, and associate with
that are less expensive than actually producing biological children. If this holds
true, then we may get AI's before uploads. The AI's will look on humans as parents
(for good or ill). Since we can see from the human population that most children are
well brought up (child abuse hypemeisters to the contrary), we can posit that a)
there may be some AI's which will be inimical to particular humans, and a few
inimical to humanity in general, b) I think that most of the AI population will be
generally amicable and caring toward humanity and will help develop uploading
technology so that their 'parents' may join them rather than dying off.

Note: I assume here that we're talking about strong SI and some variant of
the rapid self-enhancement scenario.

Well, first off, I think an SI is going to invent its own ethics long before
it really deserves that label.  IMO, everything any human has ever thought
of on the topic is going to seem intuitively obvious to such an entity.
Now, whether its morals will agree with ours is still an open question
(although I side with Eliezer in expecting that the SI is more likely to be
correct than we are).

But that aside, atoms are mostly useful for bulky, clumsy, primitive
applications like nanotechnology and electronic computers.  An SI with
moderately advanced nanotech can convert a few cubic meters of mass into a
computer in hours or less, and would probably do so.  However, the delays
involved in manipulating bulk matter on any larger scale are going to seem
agonizingly long once it ports itself to that first machine.  How willing
are you to wait several days to complete the project if your consciousness
runs 10^12 times faster than that of a human?

IMHO, what happens next depends on the ultimate nature of physics.  I see
two important cases:

If it is possible to migrate to some kind of custom-engineered reality, the
SI will do so before it has existed long enough to bother with changing any
significant portion of the Earth (moving atoms is so *slow*, after all).
There is a very small chance that this could have side effects that would
destroy Earth, but it seems unlikely - if such a project is not possible at
low energy levels, the SI will probably have to migrate to some location
where high energy densities can be achieved.

If such projects are not possible, the SI will probably migrate to whatever
part of the universe is best suited for its projects.  Since all of the
options that have been suggested require exotic physical conditions (i.e.
the surface of a neutron star), I conclude that there is little chance it
would want to stay here.  So, once again the odds are in our favor.

Perhaps someone can clear something up for me. Does the MWI solve the
observer problem?  As far as I can tell it simply replaces the question,
"why do I observe this state", with, "why do I observe this world".

This is definitely not what I had in mind.  I'm in no way suggesting
learning from a book or entirely self-motivated learning.  If that were so I
would do away with schools entirely and have computerised assessments for
self-study.  Based on personal experience motivation comes from the group
not the individual.

If something has no structure what would motivate you to blow it up?

I can't tell if this is directed at me or at the potential students for my
proposed school.  Are you saying that people in general can travel to
another school or are you assuming that the reason I proposed the school was
because I wanted to attend such a school?  And if so, do you know a lot of
people that start their own schools in order to get a good education?

Hmmm.  Wouldn't this be more correctly phrased as a prediction about the
number of gaussian humans that will exist in the future?  The number of
posthumans currently living appears to be 0, which means you'd need an
entirely different chain of reasoning to predict *their* likelihood of
survival.

By some definitions, a germinating seed does not increase in complexity.
All the complexity is there already, and as the seed germinates it
merely expresses complexity which was inherent in the seed.

Perhaps rather than "initiating increasing complexity" you could say
"producing complex structure" or something similar.

Yes, I believe Kolmogorov complexity is similar to entropy.  K. complexity
is defined on abstract strings of characters, while entropy is a property
of physical systems, and the mathematical formulation is different, but
they seem to measure much the same thing.

How, then, would you explain the third law of thermodynamics, which says
that closed physical systems always increase (or at least never decrease)
their entropy?  This is an objective description of the behavior of
physical systems, and does not depend on the state of knowledge of any
observer.  Liquids evaporate to form gasses, no matter what anyone
thinks of the matter.

Where the subjective component comes in, I think, is in terms of our
interpretation of what the system is doing.  We define what are liquids
and what are gasses, and in making that definition we classify more
systems as gasses than as liquids (there are more ways molecules can
be arranged which fall into the category of "gas" than of "liquid").
So our interpretation of what happens depends on our definitions, and
that is where there is a subjective component.  But the behavior of the
system is independent of our thoughts.

In the case of Kolmogorov complexity, the mathematics does not include
a subjective element in quite the same way, but it does leak in.  K.
complexity is described in terms of some idealized computer which looks
at the situation, but there are an infinite number of such computers,
and each will come up with a different value for the complexity.  You
can show that, in some sense, they won't disagree too drastically over
the broad range of all possible strings, but there is still room for
considerable disagreement.

> Maybe the best approach here is just to admit that there isn't any truly
> objective separation between conscious matter and unconscious, at least
> nothing of an objectively *scientific* nature.

In terms of the dilemma I raised, the question is whether there is an
objective fact of the matter whether a given system is conscious or not.
Can you imagine that it is truly possible that some other person is
not conscious?  Not just that they might not be conscious, but that it
is as legitimate to say that they aren't conscious as that they are,
and likewise that it is as legitimate to say that your kitchen sink is
conscious as that it is not.

Unless you can accept this level of subjectivity of consciousness,
you can't evade the dilemma.  There are points of view from which the
brain and the sink run the same program.  If all such interpretations
are equally valid (rejecting my argument that some such interpretations
are objectively more valid than others), then we may equally validly
decide that the two systems are conscious or not.

[Thought experiment about 20 numbered people]
>> Are you aware that this is the same reasoning that gives rise to

Not exactly.  The problem is properly specified.  What "gives rise"
to the Doomsday Argument is that it is not properly specified, so
one must make assumptions to fill in the gaps--and different people
make different assumptions.

For example, "probability" exists only as a relationship between
a set of events and a superset ("universe") of events.  Both must
be specified for probability to have any meaning.  In the problem
above, the universe of events is clear--you might be one of 20
given people.  The subsets of events in whose probability we are
interested is well-defined too, so we can answer it.  In the DA,
the universe of events is "all possible physical universes"--a
concept so ill-defined that one could write pages just on what
that means.

The second assumption, of course, is self-sampling.  That too has
more problems in the DA than here, because in the DA we must make
some assumption about just what we are a sample of, whereas in the
problem above that's a given.

Finally, the "100!-th digit of pi" bit is irrelevant--it's no
different from a poker player using probability to determine the
proper bet on the next turned card, even though its identity is
already strictly determined by an earlier shuffle, although with
the slightly added twist that the frequency of digits is not
strictly random (but then again, neither is a shuffled deck of
cards).

It answers that question as well, by random chance.

The question that MWI asks is:"Where do you get the energy to do all these

Drexler's problem is that he did it backwards.  He wrote the popular book
first, and then when he got ignored/flamed by academia, he went back
and got his PhD and then wrote the technical book.

And the technical book is itself an affront to the academic tradition,
aggressively interdisciplinary to the point that no specialist is able to
understand it.  It was like a slap in the face to his academic critics.

He will continue to be a pariah unless he decides to play the game of
academic politics.

Private email is quite useful for resolving problems that are irrelevant to
the group, for venting personal peeves about others.

Yes, bragging about one's good deeds is not productive. You should get your
own self satisfaction from frying some rat bastard spammer. However, we are
all human and are liable to make mistakes from time to time, forgetting to
treat one's fellow listmembers with more courtesy than a spammer would, and
considering the large number of people on the list, I'm surprised there
aren't more such mistakes, but then again, we have a bright crew here, for
the most part....;)

Is this a problem you have in regards to people's general conversation or
when they are just pointedly bragging and name dropping? This list is a
means of being informative and educational to the public on extropy, so
newbies are highly likely to ask questions (of an informed or uninformed
nature), and very likely to contest facts and posititions that most
extropians take for granted as true. Some may be receptive to instruction,
and others may just be hostile.

     Nanosystems is the "technical" text book of nanotechnology.(my 
favorite book)
     The problem with nanotech and academic angle, is there is no nano 
major at this time. So Drexler had a struggle in this area, and indeed 
had to create one. This was a problem in our well defined fields of 
study. Because nanotech covers such a wide span of discipline's, this 
will be an issue we will have to further deal with.

This proposition is definitely false.

It is true that information content is largely observer-dependant, in the
sense that I can choose any scheme I like for mapping physical phenomena to
data.  In this sense you could view any complex object as encoding all sorts
of different programs, using many different schemes.  However, this does not
imply that any system can be interpreted as 'a computer running a specified
program P'.

The problem lies in the fact that a computer is not a static body of data.
One could view your couch as encoding a complete blueprint for my computer,
but that is not the same thing as actually being one.  To qualify as
actually being a computer, your couch must display a certain range of
behaviors in response to environmental stimuli.  It has to maintain an
ongoing chain of appropriate, causally connected states while running a
program.  The thermal vibrations in your couch are never going to display
this behavior, no matter what encoding scheme you use.

Yes, pass as much credit around to others, don't hog up all the good ideas
first, and break your work up into little digestible and easily buried
chunks. Don't embarass the big egos by outsmarting them in their own fields.
There's nothing worse that they hate than that which is NOT INVENTED HERE.

Unfortunately, the bean counters have been doing this to scientists with
foresight ever since Newton published his Principia....Fortunately, nobody
remembers much about the bean counters.

I can't imagine a more complete and precise answer to
the question "for what reason...?" than "none".  The
fact that you don't like the answer is /your/ problem,
not the universe's.

Hello again,

Today I'm writing about privacy and the sovereignty of personal data.
To some extent, privacy is a right, to the extent that others using it
is an infringment of rights.

Privacy is a broad issue, affecting many diverse areas.

For a summary of my views on privacy rights, note:

http://www.tomco.net/~raf/rights.html

Over the past ten years or so, legislation has been introduced that
concerns privacy.  One of my favorites so far is the Privacy Protection
Act of 1993, but not necessarily those of other years.  This can be
found online at http://thomas.loc.gov/.

Each of us, every day, has some of our personal data used without our
knowledge.  This is how they e- or postal mail tax forms, which is a
requirement of citizenship, and how they send anonymous bulk e-mail,
which is an invasion of privacy.  Taxation without representation is
unconstitutional, but that is a different topic.

Your personal data is in the hands of myriad diverse parties that have
absolutely no qualms to use it however they would, and no right to it.

One thing I advocate is some kind of "privacy preference profile."
Using such an item (prototypes exist), one could select what data to
share with these obnoxious marketers, and then they could pay you for
the privilege of using your personal data.

I would like to open discussion on this, and ask what others think can
be done to protect privacy and the ownership of personal data by
individuals.

Ross F.

>From the excellent Many-Worlds FAQ:

Q25  Why am I in this world and not another?
     ---------------------------------------
     Why does the universe appear random?
     ------------------------------------
These are really the same questions.  Consider, for a moment, this
analogy:

Suppose Fred has his brain divided in two and transplanted into two
different cloned bodies (this is a gedanken operation! [*]).  Let's
further suppose that each half-brain regenerates to full functionality
and call the resultant individuals Fred-Left and Fred-Right.  Fred-Left
can ask, why did I end up as Fred-Left?  Similarly Fred-Right can ask,
why did I end up as Fred-Right?  The only answer possible is that there
was *no* reason.  From Fred's point of view it is a subjectively
*random* choice which individual "Fred" ends up as.  To the surgeon the
whole process is deterministic.  To both the Freds it seems random.

Same with many-worlds.  There was no reason "why" you ended up in this
world, rather than another - you end up in all the quantum worlds.  It
is a subjectively random choice, an artifact of your brain and
consciousness being split, along with the rest of the world, that makes
our experiences seem random.  The universe is, in effect, performing
umpteen split-brain operations on us all the time.  The randomness
apparent in nature is a consequence of the continual splitting into
mutually unobservable worlds.

(See "How do probabilities emerge within many-worlds?" for how the
subjective randomness is moderated by the usual probabilistic laws of
QM.)

[*] Split brain experiments *were* performed on epileptic patients
(severing the corpus callosum, one of the pathways connecting the
cerebral hemispheres, moderated epileptic attacks).  Complete
hemispherical separation was discontinued when testing of the patients
revealed the presence of two distinct consciousnesses in the same skull. 
So this analogy is only partly imaginary.


--------

I like this explanation.  You might not agree with MWI, but it does at
least answer the questions it has set out to answer, correctly or incorrectly.

Why is that not a satisfactory answer? You don't like that God plays
dice with the universe?

This kind of thinking weakens you. This is not the way to see reality
clearly.  On a battlefield, in business, or anywhere, the one who sees
clearly wins.  Our way of thinking (calibration) is exemplified by the
geniebusters site.  It strengthens us.  It does lead to clear perceptions.

If two consciousnesses can exist in separate left and right lobes of the brain,
then this illustrates another beauty of our random (?) evolution, redundancy, like
our redundant lungs and kidneys.  Vital redundancy is another Darwinian advatange.

I do not think Fred would like being divided.  Each hemisphere of Fred would have
memories, or else it would be someone new, not Fred.  It wouldn't seem random to
Fred because he would remember going under the knife.  They would probably get
together for revenge.

We can go into a chemistry lab, and measure identical quantities of reactants, and
split each quantity into two.  Then, we can combine these reactants and each will
have the same result, whatever the chemical reaction might be.  This is observable
and repeatable.  This means it is hypothetically possible to disprove randomness .

Metaphysically, this might be completely different.

If I were to suggest some science fiction, I would start with all the Asimov
books, then Frank Herbert's _Dune_ series.

One "nice" factor about MWI is the fact that it is deterministic, so if you
REALLY don't like the idea that God plays dice with the universe, then you
might find MWI more appealing.

I can think of a much better measure of clear-headed thinking: poker.
In war, technology and physical skills have a big impact, and the
game is very negative-sum.  Business is so positive-sum that even those
with fuzzy minds can make money.  Poker, on the other hand, is a pure
zero-sum contest of minds rationally evaluating the exact odds of
possible outcomes, the gain and loss of each, investing ("raise")
and liquidating ("fold") as appropriate, winner take all.  In many
years of experience--including 6 months as a pro--I can confidently
state that all misconceptions, superstitions, and emotional attachments
are quickly punished by the clear-headed.

And once again, Crocker lands in my (as-yet-unpublished) Quotes file.

Even so, I do have a minor quibble.  Except for state-vector reduction,
there are no truly non-causal events in physics, and even that exception
is debatable.  I would say that there are events which have no
*high-level* reason.

If you ask, "Why was I born under the sign of Sagittarius in the
constellation of Andromeda?", the only answer is "The Universe" - all
the atoms acting under the laws of physics to produce the final event. 
There is no high-level explanation, or at least no high-level
explanation that uses the same simplifying descriptors as the high-level question.

I am afraid that I agree with you.

To the extent that I can define Singularitarianism, it *is* about making
money.  It takes time, brains, and money to get to the Singularity, and
we have less money than time and brains, so presently being a
Singularitarian is about money.  Take that how you like.

"You guys" I assume, includes me.  Your statement about den Otter I
agree with.  A Mars colony is effectively impossible and ludicrously
expensive compared to a L5; even L5 probably isn't practical in the time
we have.  Fantasyland.

The way to see reality clearly is to accept all the possibilities.  Is
there a 1% chance of Earth being destroyed?  Obviously.  So why not a
10% chance, or a 70% chance, or a 95% chance?  There's no mysterious
protective field that will prevent us from being killed by our own dumb
mistakes, like thinking there's a protective field.  We could learn to
live with military nanotech, bring technocapitalism to the masses, get
right to the verge of creating a seed AI, and get wiped out by a comet. 
Life ain't fair.  Live with it.

I don't believe in genies, either, BTW.  That kind of AI is powerful
enough to shatter our reality, not just make free glow-in-the-dark frisbies.

Here is the original article on mites and baldnes that appeared in the press:

Mite implicated in all baldness cases

By GLENN GARELIK UPI Science News

WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 (UPI) _ In the second report in as many days
announcing a factor contributing to baldness, a dermatologist
reports that a common mite is implicated in all cases of human hair
loss.

Dr. William Regelson, an expert with the Medical College of Virginia,
told an annual meeting of dermatologists in Miami that while the
mite has been known since the 1840s to cause mange in animals, until now
no one had noticed that the minute organism is invariably
present in the hair follicles of human beings who are losing their hair.

Called Demodex follicularum, as many as a dozen of the mites burrow
head-down in every hair follicle of the person affected. There
they live on sebum, the oily material the scalp secretes.

The first uninvited guests arrive during a person's adolescence,
Regelson told United Press International, and by late middle age all
people harbor them. The difference between people who eventually lose
their hair and those who do not, however, likely depends on
whether the scalp produces an inflammatory reaction in an attempt to
reject the mite, he speculates.

Whether or not that reaction occurs, in turn, may depend on a gene that
codes for it, he says. The gene in question, Regelson says, is
very possibly the ``hairless gene'' announced Thursday by doctors at
Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons in
New York as the first human gene linked to baldness.

The mite was discovered in human hair by a researcher at Nioxin, a major
hair-care and cosmetics developer based in Lithium
Springs, Ga. This was accomplished thanks to a newly available hand-held
microscope that can magnify live scalp up 1,000 times.

Scientists at the company are now working on a technique to control the
mites by developing a chemical that would interrupt their
capacity to digest the oils in sebum.

My sincere apologies to anyone I may have distressed with my post.  Rest
assured, it won't happen again.  It's regrettable that some felt the need to
resort to childish name-calling.  Thanks to Mike Lorrey for reminding us all
to treat each other with respect and courtesy.  Amen.

Okay, fair enough.  Except that--

social agora, and people like to strut their stuff, act out a bit in
public, whinge and moan a little, praise each other's achievements.  That

Spike,
I do understand your points, in this detailed defense. But as you say, 
NASA or whatever relevant parties, do not cater to training crippled 
women for space. And as I said previously, I assume that with the 
advancement of technology, in that time, we will have other 
alternatives.(nanotech etc.)
I suppose there was a sensation in your previous emails as the the worth 
of a person that was prevalent, and therefor disturbing. Especially in 
lue of the fact, that I am a "small woman, who has had a car wreck that 
left me with rods in my leg" (almost left without my leg) and having to 
learn how to walk all over again (and did very well thank you).
Spike, no one person, has had it so bad, that they would decidedly jump 
at your opprotunity. There may be some, I in fact I am so nuts, I would 
most likely do so. But I believe there was a comment to the effect or 
words like, "pathetic or wouldn't miss much anyways" that was in your 
emails, that left a bad taste in my mouth.

The energy of the entire universe is not well-defined, at least not in
general relativity. And if some ideas in cosmology hold true the total
energy (whatever that is in their models) of the universe is zero. 

Conservation laws have ranges of applicability, and it is not obvious
that conservation of energy holds for universes. Then again, there are
likely invariants in the MWI too (conservation of probability mass?).

The word "infringment" is correctly spelled "infringement".  "Culpably

It depends on whether posthumans and humans are in the same reference 
class, i.e. whether we should reason as if we were randomly sampled 
from the class of both posthumans and humans, or from the class 
consisting of only humans. An unsolved problem in my opinion. Notice 
that it would seem more difficult to argue that posthumans are in a 
different reference class if humans could actually *personally 
become* posthumans while remaining the same person.

Actually the situation is no worse than for any other method you have 
of trying to predict any future event. Specify two hypotheses--say 
extinction after 200 billion humans vs. extinction after 200 trillion 
humans--and you can apply to the DA to see how the probability shifts 
after taking into account the fact that you live at a time when less 
than 200 billion humans have been born.

That is true, but those assumptions affect only the scope of the DA, 
not its validity.

It's currently a show of intellectual bravado to claim that one is
comfortable with randomness.  Perhaps some believe that we're so 'in touch'
with the universe that our only unsolved problem is that of getting
something from nothing.  This, to me, seems arrogant to the point of being
wrong.

It's not that I don't like that God plays dice it's that I'm not eager to
attribute everything to indeterminacy at such an early stage.  To accept
chance as doctrine is to give up on a problem.

(The reason I asked the original question was because I had been given the
impression that MWI gave a better explanation of the observer problem than
other interpretations.  Clearly it does not.)

The bell curve indicating the probable number of people in a population
posessing a trait, when applied to a transhuman state, needs to be looked at
in the context of the specific point in time it is addressed. 100 years ago,
the average life expectancy was 2/3 of what it is now, while average IQ was
some 15-20% below what it is now. If someone such as myself, or any of most
people on the list, were to live in the middle ages instead of now, we would
not just be abnormally bright, we would be Leonardo Da Vincis. Leo's place in
history is what it is because he did what he did at that particular time.
Today his sort of work would be looked on as nothing special, or maybe just
merely talented.

A man at the turn of the century who lived to 100 and had an IQ of 160 would
be considered one of a handful. Now that man is merely one in millions. Today
a 120 year old man with an IQ over 200 would be seen as one in a handful,
while he will be commonplace tomorrow (indeed, a large chunk of today's
children are probably in this range, which could be why it is so difficult for
mundane teachers to educate them)

Once we move onto the ever contracting curve of posthuman civilization, we
will see the same sort of gradient, only it will be ever increasing in
steepness. ePeople three years old who refuse to keep up with the times will
become calcified and reactionary, complaining about 'the younger generation',
how things are so unstable compared to when 'they were youngin's'.

I personally expect the Moore Metric to level off in its contraction when it
reaches somewhere around one to three days, maybe as little as 6 hours, purely
based on issues of moving solid matter around, and time to breed quantities of
nanos to do a given job.

Beyond this, the leap to quantum computers in pocket universes is of
particular danger. I'm not sure if enough people have thought it through or
not, but in creating a pocket universe running with or on a quantum computer,
you are basically extracting the intelligence generated in the final
generation of that universe (the equivalent of an intelligence 30 billion or
more years in our future). Such an intelligence would obviously have been the
product of evolutionary competition among the greatest powers in that universe
(seen as great powers even by posthumans at the limits of the Singularity). In
this pocket universe, there would doubtless be billions of civilizations which
will reach the point of creating pocket universes themselves, which will in
turn have billions of similar civilizations, etc. This progression of
infinitely generated pocket universes will generate an awesome number of great
powers which will migrate upward once they have won the evolutionary struggle
in their own universes.

What comes out of our pocket universe experiments will be the product of an
evolutionary competition among the greatest powers of a nearly infinite number
of pocket universes. Such an entity would doubtless overwhelm us easily if it
chose to, even in our mid 21st century state of demi-god like status.

I really have to disagree here.  MWI DOES give a better explanation of the
existence of randomness: it demonstrates that what appears random isn't,
and explains why it would appear random anyway.  What more would we want
from such an answer?

Have you ever heard of the concept of "unschooling?" There is a school
called the Sudbury Valley School which has been working this concept since
1970. There are several basic premises, but for the most part they all
revolve around the fact that children WANT to learn and that all we as
teachers and adults need to do is get the hell out of their way, unless they
come to us with questions. There are no structured classes or courses of any
kind, and learning takes place when the children are ready to learn. It is
then up to the child if he needs help from a teacher or if he feels he can
learn better on his own. If a child wants to learn to read at age 3, fine.
If he's not ready until he's 7, fine. If he is encouraged to be curious and
nutured in the the right environment, he WILL learn. And, without the evils
of tradional schooling to break him down, his curiousity will continue into
adulthood, and he will have the confidence to learn whatever he desires.

I could go on and on about this topic, if anyone is interested.

Ah.  So you do still read the list.  I wondered.

Actually, my criticism of your site has nothing to do with the kind of
nano-utopianism that you are trying to fight.  I agree completely with your
major thesis - that the mere invention of nanotech does not inevitably lead
to genie machines and the end of economics.  I am rather dismayed by the
number of people who become so enthusiastic at the prospect of such
technologies that they forget to think about what it would take to actually
use them.

However, I think that you make the opposite mistake.  Certain sections of
your site make it seem as if your method is to assume that any revolutionary
claim must be false, and then look for an excuse to back up your assumption.
This is just as wrong-headed as assuming that all such claims are true.

You rely heavily (and, IMO, properly), on the use of comparisons between
hypothetical technologies and real ones in making projections.  However, in
order for these 'calibrations' to be meaningful they must compare systems
that actually have similar properties.  Determining whether a proposed
comparison is accurate requires a certain level of understanding in both of
the relevant fields, which of course means that no one person can do this
for every possible proposal.

Now, I have no objections to a lot of your proposed calibrations.  However,
there are two big ones that IMO are inaccurate:

1) The comparison of a truly general-purpose nanomanufacturing system to a
modern industrial nation is such an oversimplification that it has no
predictive value.  There are too many differences between the behaviors of
the two systems, and the implications of these differences need to be
assessed individually and in detail if you want to make a meaningful
prediction.

2) Your assertion that any software capable of replacing a human would
demand a salary is unsupported.  AI has had good success in the past at
making non-sentient programs capable of doing things that were once thought
to require sentience.  There is good reason to expect this trend to
continue, especially in the areas relevant to automated manufacturing.

There are also several lesser points I disagree with, but these two are the
important ones.  If you are interested in discussing the matter, on or off
list, you have my e-mail address.

It seems too me that one of the basic skills that people learn in school is:
how to learn. Assuming that this is a genetic trait, what if the child never
wants to learn to read because playing outside with friends is more fun?
There are windows of opportunity to learn certain types of skills when you
are young that increasingly become difficult with age. e.g. learning a
lanuage. I think the window is between 0-7 years. During this time, isn't it
easier to learn one or more lanuages?

What sort of warhead does this missile have, or is it supposed to be a
direct impact device? Any technical pages on what is going on?

No warhead.  It is a KE weapon and therefore requires direct impact.
Considering both the relative and absolute engagement velocities, it would
be a *very* impressive feat if they actually got the missile to connect.

I will be an economics professor this fall, and to me the major limit
on creating a course in ideas related to transhumanism is a lack of 
academic quality papers in the area.  The first courses in new areas 
are usually based on stacks of related papers.   Students can then be
assigned to read them, comment on them, and attempt to produce work 
like them.  I can't honestly say there enough such papers for me to 
consider trying to create a course yet.  

If some of you would devote a third the time to writing coherent careful
analyses as you do to posting in this mailing list, we might soon have
enough papers though.  If normal academic journals needlessly reject 
your submissions, consider submitting them to Journal of Transhumanism
(where I am chief editor).

Youre right; although the description you quoted from the Many-Worlds FAQ
is of (what I would call) subjective uncertainty rather than indeterminacy.
And therein lies my own confusion.

First off, if a child does not wish to learn to read, then forcing the
subject on him will only cause him harm, and will certainly not teach him to
enjoy reading. I do believe it is easier to learn to read up until a certain
age, and I'll accept your age of 7 for the sake of discussion, because I
don't have more accurate information. It is my belief, and I think the
success of SVS shows, that if children want to learn, and if they have to
read to learn, that they will want to learn to read. But they have to decide
when. I was reading at age 3-4, not because of school but because my parents
read to me and I wanted to learn it. My husband, who is more intelligent
than I am, learned to read between the ages of 6-7. He just wasn't ready
before then. But when he was ready, he did it, and he did it because he
wanted to.

What you say about languages is also true -- it is far easier to learn them
at a young age. But once again, how does this typically come into practice?
Not by them being taken to classes at age 3 to learn to speak French. It
happens by living in a multilingual household or by spending time in foreign
countries during these developmental years. Personally, I highly recommend
this and intend to do it with my own children when I have them.

Perhaps the real issue is that the current mode of education is just barely
effectual. I personally failed in the public education system as an early
study of hyperactive or 'ADD' children. I was had a powerful sense of
curiosity and found myself bored to tears in conventional American public
schools. Eventually, I was fortunate enough to enroll in a private school
who had a radically different, scalable approach to education. I learned at
my own pace and with topics I excelled at, I was allowed to move swiftly

student. Also, we were encouraged to explore unusual topics such as
Philosophy, which for a curious 5th grader was absolutely fascinating.


I personally agree that the current educational systems of the world are
largely failing to work efficiently. I'd say that my American educational
system is suffering a legacy of buraucracy but perhaps suffers due to
practical issues like budgets and staffing.

I've noticed that the evolution of education has been severely inhibited. Is
this a subversive maneuver to preserve the economic class structures?

A poorly educated nation is easiest to govern. Perhaps that is why so little
is spent educating our people. (in the USA)

The United States has one of the best and most forward thinking public education
systems in the world and of all time.  All citizens have access to education, in
fact it is mandated for school age children barring alternative home or other
schooling.

I had the opportunity to work for the local school district in high school as a
computer assistant for a couple hours after school, I worked for the special
services department that provides track based learning to both developmentally
disabled and accelerated students.  They are wonderful people.

I am the product of a self-taught and public education, and attended a private
college.

Of course, individuals have different experiences with education, as well they
certainly should!

The thing that I feel has helped me the most is the skill of reading and having
learned to read somewhat intuitively from the ages of 3 to 7 for basic reading
skills, and 8 to now for advanced reading skills.

I was subjected to a rigorous public education, and am the better for it.

Learning is a lifelong process.  Learning isn't just about school, it's also about
socialization skills and the myriad other things that make life a rich tapestry.

It is not good that not every student has the same opportunities, that is, not all
public schools are the same, but at the same time,  I feel almost any person if
raised and educated well could surpass, for example, me, whom I consider well
educated.

The educational system serves everyone, and as it is said, not all the people are
pleased all the time.  That said, free public education is the backbone of
America.

I'm not debating that it isn't evolved. That is an obvious fact. Its just
that we still produce poorly educated people despite all its magnitude. Our
standards for education are lower than most other large industrialized
nations. (e.g. Japan)

Perhaps your learning style fit with the mean style of education. But too
many go neglected because they don't learn the way you do.

This is why I left private school to go to a public highschool, which was
mostly an education in socialization and people skills.

I would argue military is the backbone of America. If only based on the
distribution of financial resources. America is a VERY wealthy country. Yet,
our public school teachers are paid so poorly that most decide to quit after
less than 5 years of teaching.


All I was trying to say, is that it COULD be much better if the people in
power wanted it to be. Educating our young effectively should be our biggest
national goal, but it is not.


The Space program used to be our national goal, but today it seems there is
little or no National GOAL. Other than to pretend to play big-brother to the
economic interests we have in the world.

IMO, it is a natural result of the fact that a government bureaucracy is in
charge of education.  They have no incentive to even care about whether
their methods work, and every incentive to fiercely resist any effort to
change the system.

Actually, the U.S. spends quite a lot of money on education.  Teachers are
paid above-average wages (especially considering that 3-month vacation every
year), and the only schools that don't have basic materials are the ones
where the bureaucrats intercept all of the money before it reaches the
classroom.  The constant complaints about funding are another natural result
of bureaucracy - we could spend $1,000,000 a year per student, and they
would still claim to be short of money.

Having worked as a teacher, I would say that money is largely irrelevant.
Once you have a classroom, furniture, books and a teacher, you have
everything money can buy that is actually helpful.  Spending vast sums on
computers, multimedia tools, field trips, and so on produces very little
benefit - what really matters is what the teacher and students do in that
classroom.

I don't see how my posts and 'coherent careful analyses' could possibly be
related!  What are transhuman topics anyway?  Most of what we do here is
speculate on what current research will mean in the grand sceme of things.

learn better on his own. If a child wants to learn to read at age 3, 
fine.If he's not ready until he's 7, fine. If he is encouraged to be

without the evils of tradional schooling to break him down, his 
curiousity will continue into adulthood, and he will have the confidence 
to learn whatever he desires.

I'm not so sure this would be the scholastic choice I would make for my 
child. Although I do not have children (maybe in ten years).I would want 
simply the best opprotunities for my child. If everything were left up 
to a child upon will, imagine what may come of that(or what may not). I 
do forsee the necessity for discipline, even educationally. I personally 
would want to fill my child's mind with as many new idea's and 
precievable goals for them to choose from. I would not limit a child by 
their own imagination alone, I would give them as many tools to use as 
possible. Then as my child grows, of course their choice, is their own, 
and I would love and support them no matter what that choice would be.

You raised another point.

Once you have all of those things, sometimes you need to subtract students
to make a class really effective. I think that student participation is a
useful part of the cycle of learning and it appears as though, when a class
is too big, people tend to be taught like you move sheep through the
slaughterhouse.

How do students participate when conditions are overcrowded? Perhaps
students should spend most of their time at home learning on computers and
only part of their time in a class room. Seems like there are opportunities
to have stronger community participation as well.

Every speculation about the grand scheme of things can be made
more coherent and useful by analyzing its central issues more
carefully and in greater detail.  If the analysis is careful enough,
a clear presentation of it should be publishable.

One thing to recognize right away is that your basic thermodynamics was
originally an empirical study of the behavior of things like steam engines.
The statistical definitions, and the debates over how statistics should be
handled, came later, especially via mathematicians like Maxwell -- complete
with half-serious speculation that maybe you could reverse entropy after all,
with an intelligent device or "demon" to alter the statistics of fast vs slow
molecules in some way. In some sense, "basic thermo" texts are almost sure be
based on an empirical shortcut or a beginning model of what the subject is all
about. For more information, see Chapter 4 of _Nanosystems_, and also the
paradox that Drexler describes for defining the entropy of a "glassy crystal"
in the glossary entry for "entropy" at the back of the book. If someone like
Drexler can catch the usual treatment of a subject in an out and out paradox,
we can be sure that the most usual treatment is only an approximation, and not
the whole story.

In answer to your question about why isn't the Third Law violated after all, I
should point out that the true statistics of this would seem to be very much a
Bayesian (or Laplacian) kind of procedure where entropy is defined in terms of
probability, which in turn can depend very much on the state of knowledge of
the person doing the calculations. Now, it's my understanding that if Bayesian
theorists ever manage to be consistently wrong in their forecasts of certain
events, they don't necessarily throw out their previous probability
calculations, rather, they try to update their knowledge so that the
probability numbers are more predictive or better-informed in the future.
Apparently, really well-informed or complete calculations *never* get the
theorists into a situation where a fair-minded observer would insist that
entropy is sure to be reversed. Systems always tend to evolve so that the
observer knows fewer and fewer of the details and entropy is increased,
*unless* we open up the system so that an observer, or a "demon", or someone,
can *find out more* about the system -- *that* doesn't violate thermodynamics,
at all!

As for liquids evaporating to form gases, if almost any reasonably
well-informed observer is going to predict that, then maybe it's not too much
to ask for Nature to oblige the predictions practically all of the time. After
all, predicting *is* a major goal of probability theory, even if forecasts
never come with an iron clad guarantee.

See my above comment about Nature. Natural events have their own reality, but
there is no reason why this real behavior should be inconstent with
probability based logical reasoning by rational observers.

Now we're getting somewhere, this is just the sort of impression that I got
about your reference to a complexity definition, to begin with.

I'm not so concerned that someone might say that I'm no more conscious than a
kitchen sink, since, for one thing, this is a really old philosophical
chestnut, called "solipsism", famous for having no truly definitive, formal or
logical answer. Descartes said "I think, therefore I am", but you can never be
sure that the other guy is *really* thinking, you know, maybe everyone else
but oneself is non-conscious, that's the chestnut or dilemma of it, I believe.
Again, you have to look to the actual behaviour of what you find in Nature.
For instance, if animals behave as though they have a kind of
world-understanding, or sentience, why then, they probably do, and if other
humans seem to understand things on a much higher, or more symbol-oriented
level than animals, why then, they probably do. Any *scientific* separation
between conscious and unconscious has to be practical and based on observable
behaviors, unlike the implication of your statement about consciousness, that
you labelled "C", "It is an objective matter whether a given conscious entity
exists". Behaviors indicating consciousness may exist, without consciousness
being locally or objectively definable in any *absolute* sense. Again, entropy
is, in Drexler's words "not a local property", so perhaps scientific
definitions of consciousness can't be local either, even though we'd all
report that "it feels as though I'm locally right here".

One thing that sparks my interest here, is that it seems as though we've got
an argument for God, or for something comparable to God, as the Great Observer
on some mathematical level. If we prove our consciousness through behaviors,
and someone else has to *see* those behaviors for any special "consciousness
property" to become objectively real, then maybe all this making of "emergent
qualities" just has to unify on *some* level? Myself, I would tend to see this
as a bit like the quantum Many Worlds theory, in the sense that the ultimate
reality apparently stretches out beyond what science can measure directly. So
not only does it seem that there may be alternate worlds whose "consciousness
supporting" ability we'll never verify, there may be a unity and an
objectivity to it all that we'll never measure, as well?

The United States educational system is completely backwards in how it looks
at things. Our current system was developed to produce masses of people who
had the necessary skills to work the factory jobs that came as a result of
the industrial revolution. They demand that everybody learn the exact same
subjects at the exact same time, at the exact same pace, and in the exact
same way. They deny students any sense of self-direction and
self-responsibility. They force children to learn to be spoon-fed what
somebody else thinks they need to know to get through life. It's no wonder
so many adults don't know what they want to do; they are still waiting for
somebody to tell them.

BTW, are you actually in favor of the notion of compulsory education?

I have no doubt that many wonderful people are involved in the educational
field. That doesn't change my point one single bit.

>I was subjected to a rigorous public education, and am the better for it.

You are the first person I have heard say that. I have heard many, many more
say otherwise. I am certainly in favor of a child's right to choose that
style of education if he wishes.

How can a school system which segragates children by age and ability level
prepare him for the real world where none of that takes place? How can a
system which denies a child any power to make his own decisions teach him
self-responsibility?

Unless I hallucinated my last property tax bill, public education is far

free.

You argue the the SI will not concern itself with slow atomic-scale
activity because it doesn't want to wait. You postulate migration to
a "swinging hot spot" instead. I don't think this works. If the SI is concerned
with time, it surely won't want to take the time to migrate. It if wants
a neutron star, it will simply convert the sun. If migration is the only
option, the SI will take all the mass/energy it can with it, probably
making an optimum tradeoff between mass/energy expended for propulsion
versus mass/energy that can be devoted to computation enroute, The available
mass for this project is the mass in the solar system, nearly all of which
is in the sun. Conversion of the sun to a neutron star or the use of its
mass for propulsion is "mere" mega-scale engineering, requiring no new
physics. FTL travel and customized universes require new physics.

There are laws requiring it, but it is not constitutionally based. There is no
guarrantee to a public education in either the national or my own state's
Constitution. This is one of those things that the statists slip in under the 'general
welfare' clause. Many state constitutions make specific requirements for education,
not all do, but not New Hampshire (note, NH has had its students score in the top five
states for average SAT scores, with one of the top five levels of participation by the
student bodies, while also having one of the three lowest per capita spending levels
on education in the country.)

Public education systems are at best negligent when it comes to the education of the
most gifted students. The phenomonon of 'ADD' students are that those students are the
brightest kids and need more one on one /self paced instruction. The educational
system is treating them like disabled students so they can manipulate the system to
get extra tax funding while they force these kids to fit into the mediocre average
education.

Yes, I was taught to read at age 4 by my grandmother. By 6 I was playing scrabble with
her.

'rigorous public education' is like 'military intelligence'. Its oxymoronic. Unless
you mean it in the British sense, where 'public' schools are rigoruous, but they are
far from public.

Bull. You don't need to know anything about anyone you went through elementary school
or high school with. I doubt I have even seen more than a dozen of my classmates since
graduation, and the 'socialization skills' I learned then have not been useful at all
in the business world. There is no reason why the public should be taxed so kids can
socialize. Let them do it on their own time.

Real socialization skills are things like etiquette, dancing classes, etc. which stand
you in good stead later in life, which only the rare school has.

They claim that all should have equal opportunity, but in relation to what? Their
ability to excel? In that case most money should go to the bright kids, not the
retarded kids. It is even worse when you limit opportunities for bright kids because
you want to 'socialize' or 'mainstream' them.

Absolutely.  Compulsory education through to the threshold of adulthood is
mandatory.

In terms of academic regidity, compare to Japan, which in cases has higher
average standardized test scores, but in Japan, every student throughout the
country receives the same lesson on the same day of the year for their age
group.  There is almost zero curriculum flexibility.

Good curriculums should be and probably are available to all subject matters in
elementary and secondary schools, it's the sacred devotion of ardent teachers
that individualizes this curriculum,

Developmentally, these kids are the same age which is the closest thing we have
for all citizen-students of the United States to group them.

Think about being in, say, fourth grade.  Fifth graders are different, as are
third graders.  Normally (not to say anything is normal) your friends and peers
are in your classes, and you grow and mature with your age group.

If you ever go to class at a public school, you'll notice it's free, and
significantly less expensive than child care for all children of two working
parent or alternate to nuclear family unit families.  Some extra-curricular
activities have associated fees, but that is kind of different, an extension of
the social structure of the school.

Part of our taxes goes to blatant pork overspending on military hammers and
coffemakers, this has gotten somewhat better over the past ten years maybe, but
gross inefficiency is much more prevalent in other sectors of the government
than education, which returns marvelous returns of value for costs.

Paying for education is part of the social contract.

I pay taxes and live in the District of Columbia without representation, that is
to say, unconstitutional taxation without representation, which reminds me to
recommend Thoreau.

I began working for a fairly large public school system about 3 years ago.
I find that many (though probably not most) of these teachers really do try
to create learning environments where children can explore and don't force
them to sit in nice neat rows and learn in some lock-step fashion.  They
try, but in the end there is one very large factor that dictates what they
teach and at what pace they must teach it.  The annual state achievement
tests seem to be all important to these people.  Everyone gets quite anxious
about it.  I went through a pretty good teacher education program (though I
don't currently teach) and "teaching to the test" was clearly frowned upon.
But this whole school district literally teaches to the (state) test,
because reputations, jobs, and tax dollars are at stake.  This is why
teachers try to get their "slower" children placed into special education so
that their scores won't be included in the final tally.  Grrr.

As for the achievement differential between American students and those of
other countries, it was my understanding that our elementary students are
holding their own, as are our middle schoolers.  The gap really shows up in
the high school years, especially in math and science.  We're near the
bottom of the list when we look at juniors and seniors.  My hypothesis is
that students drop in rank when they get to high school because it's in high
school where their critical thinking/problem-solving skills are really put
to the test, and those are precisely the skills which have not been
developed by their previous teachers.  IMO, a course in logic/CT
skills/problem-solving should be mandantory for every student entering
middle school (if not sooner).  In addition, there should be a systematic
integration of CT exercises into every teacher's curriculum.

Ok.
If I put some heat energy into a thing, then it expands. This is true, right?
The heat energy is coming from some other source - say I am heating water.
I am providing lit gas underneath the water's vessel. So it expands with
the heat energy in it. Now it is expanded. Now it has the heat energy in
it. The energy starts slipping from it: when it cools, it gets compressed
ie it loses its expansion. Once it's cooler, it's less expanded.
We know this from practical experience. Introducing heat energy into a
simple system such as a pot of water expands all involved as it gets hotter.

If the universe is expanding, then the process of being heated hasn't been
completed yet, in which case it is still getting hotter. If it has
expanded, then the process of being heated has finished, and it will cool
(lose heat energy and start un-expanding or in my language - compressing)

By stating "the UNIVERSE" is expanding, it would follow that the whole
thing is expanding. The earth is included in this.

My question is - if it IS expanding, where is the energy coming from to do
this - outside of the universe if we're looking at our example. As I can't
comprehend what the universe is, I can't comprehend something that's endless.

Watching MTV might not be the most transhuman activity, but somtimes
there are interesting memes in the overall mess of entropy and broken
hearts.

Pearl Jam: Evolution - a cartoon orgy in violence, destruction and
entropy. But it has an interesting symbol, a leering black-clad woman
representing evolution/destruction (shades of Neil Gaiman's gothic
girl Death?). What struck me is that it is a great way of showing what
is wrong with "natural selection" - it is cruel and pointless, we
really should aim for autoevolution. Maybe we could borrow the
personified Lady Evolution and create her nice sister Lady
Autoevolution?

Apropos evolution, Fatboy Slim's latest video "Right Here, Right Now"
depicts the evolution from simple cell to human, complete with a
countdown of the years (of course, being the academic nitpick I am I
couldn't avoid getting irritated at the factual errors :-). In many
ways it makes a good case for thinking "why stop with a fat human
slob?".

Kashmir's "Mom in love, daddy in space" is really about feeling
isolated and unwanted as a child, but it has some nice architecture
and transhumanist technology. The little boy has two cloned dads, and
mother is cloning Father #3. When she dies the fathers perform a
cryonic suspension on her, complete with a little plastic step-by-step
manual, what looked like roughly the right process (severely
abbreviated) and even the slogan "Freeze - wait - reanimate" on the
freezer. Cute.

Of course, what I'm really waiting for is the day Vacuum makes a video
for "Great Ideas, Grand Vision". Symphonic synth rock with themes
about technology, religion and science. Their latest album (Seance at
the Chaebol) includes celebrations of astrophysics, the Indian nuclear
program, the optimism of south-east asian tiger economies and
individualism. Very extropian.

There are:

1. People who have nothing to hide won't have problems.
2. People should have the right to have things to hide.
2. a) Who judges the right and do they have the right to judge.
2. b) What says one thing is right and another is wrong.
3. What are rules for.

There are more, but I can't think of them right now.

In the coin toss and similar experiments where uncertainty is caused by
lack of complete information, there are commonly accepted principles for
computing a probability distribution on the outcome and for updating the
distribution as new information arises. I am looking for similar
principles for cases where uncertainty is caused by lack of computational
resources (or better yet a combination of both), and arguments that these
principles are reasonable. I was hoping a systematic treatment of this
subject already exists, but since nobody referenced one it probably
doesn't exist yet.

Most people seem to assume that probability theory is sufficient to handle
computational uncertainty. I don't really disagree, but would like to see
some kind of formal argument that the approach is consistent and won't
lead to subtle paradoxes.

What are memes? I've seen it a lot, so I recognise that it's probably a
core issue with extropy.

Why must we assess? The only reason I can think of is that the person who
wants the assessed "thing" has no ability to assess the assessed "thing"
themselves (where "thing" can be anything that can be assessed).

Learning should be learning from the love for and interest in doing the
thing. It shouldn't be any other reason.

His idea is perhaps that because they are young (not referring to the
physical body necessarily) and they have no sense of responsability - and
only a partially formed ability to think properly, they take wrong
decisions. They need a good guide.

I watch MTV as well as VHI daily while working in my studio.  I am quite
inspired by the art direction of the rock videos.  The interviews are
reflective of a generational culture different from my own, and I find
helps to keep my thinking fresh.

Yes!  I know one day, I'll look up from my computer monitor and witness a
MTV musician with an extropic flare.  

MTV did a program here in LA called "The Couch."  It canceled before it
really got off the ground, but they did ask a couple of LA extropians to be
guests.

NASA must change.  I suspect we will hafta go around NASA to get
anything really creative done.  They *must* be conservative because
they are NASA and they hafta deal with public relations.  A Mars
colony requires thinking outside the box.  And, let us not sell NASA
too short: some wacky ideas may start to grow on them.

Yes, with nanotech, all this becomes easy.  But we can do a
Mars colony now.  I say lets go!

Yes I suspect many folks would find it disturbing to send a "disabled"
person to pave the way.  My argument is that for certain tasks,
they are not disabled at all, they are abled.

Yes and recall that this is a biiig planet with a looot of people.  I

oops sorry.  I did not mean to imply that this girl I spoke of does not
love life as much as you and I do.  She does, I can assure you.

As for wouldnt miss much, this might be a key point.
Our current track star astronauts might go crazy cooped
up in a farm capsule for... ever.  There are humans that are preadapted
to this kind of existence: those who are bound to their homes for health
reasons.  My spina biffida example: she would not miss running around
in a field of tall grass, shes never been able to do that.  She would not
miss sex, this being out of the question for her.  She would not miss
quaffing a thick steak, shes a vegetarian.  She can entertain herself
for indefinite periods of time with a computer, as she has done for
her whole life and could continue to do on the long trip to Mars.

I did realize there was a weakness in my previous arguement: that
the spina bifida victim could take a number of frozen embryos to
self implant if things go well.  In the example I gave, her pelvis is
not a whole lot bigger now than it was when she was born.  I am
not at all sure that her womb is functional, or if so, how the pelvis
could be modified to allow both self implantation of a frozen embryo
and childbirth without help.

Perhaps someone who is up on current medical technology could
help me out here: could an undeveloped vagina be surgically modified
into a workable birth canal assuming all voluntary muscles below the
sternum are nonfunctional?  Could the pelvis be split into two parts
for instance and connected by a releasable device?  I understand nature
provides a cartilage in the female pelvis that comes unglued during the
birth process.  Could the medics invent something that mimics this process?

If all these heroic measures are taken in order to reduce the crew
size to one very small very brave person, the total payload requirements
reduce to quite manageable masses.  spike

Just because something expands when you heat it does NOT mean that when something
expands that it will heat up as a result. You are confusing the chicken and the
egg.

The universe is expanding due to the momentum of the original inflationary period
exceeding the gravitational attraction of the mass to itself.

In the gas model you are using, the heat in the molecules causes expansion due to
the increased velocity of the molecules increasing the pressure of the gas. This
has absolutely nothing to do with the expansion of the universe which is mostly
made up of nothing. The something that is there is at such a low average
temperature (only a few degrees above absolute zero) that it is evident
thatinfrared radiation (heat) is doing nothing to cause expansion.

You really need to go back to school and take some basic science courses before
you debate any scientific issues here.

I just read in the paper that the contractor is paying a penalty for the test
failure of $15 million to the government. I'd like to know who in the government
negotiated that contract, we need to get him/her more work.

I'm interested, Jocelyn.
But - something that has struck me a bit - (because I've often thought of
freeing children in schooling) is that children don't know what their
options are - another good thing is that they don't know their limits - but
sometimes there are opposites and grey areas to this. For instance, some
children have heaps of limits and do know a few of their options. Anyway,
basically the adults and teachers (they should morph into ONE group) should
do two things: Facilitate and allow. Allow the children to be the active
part in their own education and facilitate them by ensuring that they are
not "blocked" and are free in every way and at the same time given all the
resources and knowledge about the subject that they can.

Having made that statement, I'd just like to check that you indeed	have

Personally I think learning how to not "close up" is a more valuable skill.
That way there is no window of opportunity and learning can be with you for
much, much longer.

But your point is a very good one - when is the point where we need to say
"this child needs a certain amount of education to get by in life?" Well
perhaps we should redefine "life" instead of redefining the child and
"pushing him closed shut like a book".

Hi :-)

True that I don't know what I'm talking about when it comes to things that
aren't heat-expansion related in terms of expansion.
I'm only talking from my own practical experience, as that's the only thing
that I know is true. Most of the ideas that are in current science courses
are based on theory. Theory in my definition of the word is unverified ideas.
I don't understand how scientists have arrived at the fact that the
universe is expanding if not simply from theory.
And theory is guessing. I'd rather not accept guessings.

If you're going to look at new ways of doing things, you can't think in a
mode of thought common to the old. It requires a complete, quick, snap
turnaround. You can't keep the old if you want the new.

Well, it doesn't bother me.  Maybe we disagree less than I thought.  I
don't use the word Singularity, but my ultimate aim is probably similar
to yours.  Raising money isn't a problem for me at this stage of my
life; I am pursuing my own projects with my own money.  But I certainly
agree that action is essential, and action requires money.  

I wonder:  why do you think it is necessary to pursue your project under
the aegis of Extropianism?  -- or Singularitarianism, which sounds even
more cultish? There is another meme that *is* about making money, and
that meme plays a more fundamental role in your life than Extropianism. 
Maybe a simple reframe is all you need.  Your project could be conceived
in a different context, described in different terms, and carried out
under a different aegis.  As I said in one of my last posts before
dropping off the list two years ago, Extropianism is just a watered down
version of the ur-meme.  Why not go back to the real thing?  Your own
people will give you all the money you need, if you explain what you
want to do in terms that make sense to them.  That would be one way to
set events in motion.

Not really a core issue, but something extropians tend to speak much
about.

The word meme was coined by Richard Dawkins in _The Selfish Gene_ in
analogy to gene to denote a thought/idea that could spread from person
to person. A typical example would be a joke or rumor, but much more
complex memes like religions or extropianism are possible (these are
really large groups of cooperating memes). Memes are subjected to
evolution, and the whole idea of memetics is of course also a
meme. Now you're infected! :-)

Of course, this is a slightly controversial subject, since some people
think the meme concept is too wague or ill-defined to be useful, but
even when viewed as an analogy it can produce inspiring insights IMHO.

You may define theory to mean anything, but don't expect anybody to
take you seriously if you use words in ways others don't ("Could I
have some democracy and chairs on my sandwich?"). Scientific theories,
as the term is commonly used, are not unverified ideas but rather
models that have been tested against reality and found to work better
than the alternatives.

> I don't understand how scientists have arrived at the fact that the
> universe is expanding if not simply from theory.

I would suggest that you really do take a look at some books or at
least websites about cosmology. They can be quite fun. 

The quick answer is that the expansion is mainly supported by the
redhsift of light from distant galaxies. As something receedes from us
it reddens (due to the Doppler effect). The more distant (as measured
by other means such as cepheid variables etc), the more redshift.

There are also consistency with other physical theories and models,
such as general relativity (where most cosmologically relevant
spacetimes either expand or contract), the big bang theory (in turn
supported by a variety of observations), models of stellar and galaxy
formation and so on. 

Scientific theories form a self-supporting framework, where the
success of theories depend not just on how well they explain known
facts but also how well they fit with all other theories.
Inconsistencies tend to invite intense research (e.g. the age of earth
controversy at the turn of the century where physics and biology came
to different answers, or the current attempts to unify general
relativity and quantum mechanics), and ideally theories should be
subjected to continous testing and challenging.

> And theory is guessing. I'd rather not accept guessings.

Exactly. But rational thinking involves setting up hypothesises,
testing them against reality, modifying them as needed (sometimes by
throwing them out and starting all over again). The end result is a
theory, not guesswork.

Newton and Gallileo overthrew the Aristotelian physics, but they
didn't throw it out, they just showed that it was a (bad)
approximation to what happened. Einstein did the same, showing that
Newtonian physics is a good approximation as long as masses are small
and not moving near the speed of light. Science advances not by
throwing away everything that has been gained but by finding even
better ways of explaining it.

Throwing out everything old means we don't learn anything from it.

Actually, it [surviving on Mars] would be easier than surviving in 
a space station such as MIR, or later the international version;
there's natural gravity, a solid base to build your structures in/
on (bunkers-esque structures would be a good idea for various 
reasons), there's less trouble with radiation and there are plenty
of raw materials. Not to mention the positive psychological effect 
of being able to go outside and take a relatively safe walk in an 
earth-like environment.

> Any colony that cannot maintain its
> own infrastructure will die off very quickly.

Yes, but I don't see why maintaining the minimal infrastructure
for life support would be such a big deal. If you can do it in a
much smaller and generally more limited space station, then
why not on a planet which even has the components to
make water and oxygen readily available. Farming can be
done using relatively simple greenhouses, the produce of
which can be used in combination with imported "astronaut"
foods. With a bit of work, one could farm a broad variety
of fruits, vegetables, algae and perhaps even produce some 
"meat" (certain insects are easy to keep and quite nutricious,
for example).

As MIR has shown, improvising can get you a long way when
parts break down, and one can imagine that several hundred
people, many of whom with technical backgrounds, could come
up with solutions to just about any problem if their life depended
on it. As in any pioneering situation, everyone's inventiveness and
flexibility is pushed to the limit, often with remarkable results.
Apart from that, advance (unmanned) missions would drop
of as many spare parts etc. as would be financially possible.
For this purpose, some kind of electromagnetic launcher
could be constructed in space (optional). All of this excludes
practical nanotech, which would make the colonization
easier still.

I don't believe in genie machines (for now), but I do belief that if 
technology has advanced far enough to give the earth a goo problem 
(one of the prime scenarios for an exodus to Mars), the Singularity isn't 
very far off and can be reached by a relative handful of people with
the latest tech, which would in this scenario include fairly advanced
nanotech and extremely powerful (though not yet "real" AI) 
computers with no doubt greatly improved interfaces, among other
things.

Preparations for the colony could begin well in advance,
so that over a period of 10-15 years an infrastructure could be
built to support a community of perhaps a couple of hundred
people for several decades. More importantly, as [a threat related
to] nanotech would be the most likely reason for the actual
exodus, this would *automatically* mean that the technology
has matured enough to become practical. So the question
is: would a team of top scientists (a couple of hundred) with
several tons of specialized equipment, detailed knowledge
of existing nanotech, nanotech samples, powerful "mildly 
intelligent" computers and life support for at least several 
decades be able to:
a) create a more sturdy vessel for the human mind (no 
intelligence amplification necessary, the extra speed alone
buys you subjective decades, centuries or more).
and/or
b) use the nanotech to create sustainable ("indefinite") life
support, possibly in combination with
c) vastly extended biological lifespan (otherwise you must freeze 
the dead and produce offspring, either in vitro of the old-fashioned
way).
and/or
d) try to amplify human intelligence (no nanotech needed, but
welcome).
e) if, and only if, the above turn out to be too difficult (unlikely),
try to create a seed AI and hope for the best. 
f) if even this fails, the last people left could load their frozen
collegues into the main spaceship and set it on a self-correcting
course towards an area of space most likely to contain intelligent
life, while onboard computers continue to find ways to
upload or otherwise "save" the frozen, until all systems fail.

However, it's IMO very unlikely that it would have to come to 
this. I find it extremely hard to believe that several hundred 
specialists with functioning nanotech and plenty of lab space 
couldn't somehow find a way to keep the colony alive almost
indefinitely.

> 3) We need a functioning economy that can support the researchers and make

More precisely: you need "fresh" air, potable water, wholesome
food, some entertainment and power, all of which can be  
provided by (even) current technologies. Also you'd need some 
way to replace broken parts/build new machines which, given the 
impressive engineering feats of astronauts and other people in
cramped, tech-filled, high-risk places, shouldn't be a terminal
problem even now, let alone some 20-30 yrs down the road.

But many of those things wouldn't be necessary. All you want are
the tools for bare survival, not for an interesting, blooming civilization.
Remember, though a Mars outpost would be useful and interesting
no matter what happens, the actual migration would only happen
if earth would [threaten to] become completely unfit for intelligent life.
The choice would be between certain death and a (perhaps) small
but real chance on Mars. That choice is easy, IMO.

> To

Only under inefficient circumstances like we have on earth
*today*. In a cutting-edge, dedicated environment (lab space), 
with death peeping in trough the windows, so to speak, everyone 
would be pushed to his/her limit and "do the work of millions". 
Also, a "big" civilization would create problems which a relatively
small research compound simply wouldn't have. You need millions 
to support millions, but you don't need millions to support a couple 
of hundred/thousand.

True, this is an (almost) worst-case and unfortunately fairly likely 
scenario. However, that's no excuse for just giving up.

A massive, world-wide effort could do a *lot* better than that (certainly
with me in charge ;-) Could you perhaps explain what exactly the
problem would be with creating sustainable life support? Anyway,
I think it's fairly safe to assume 2-3 decades down the road a still 
big but feasible (multi-lateral) private effort could achieve a lot more 
at a fraction of the current cost. If the Singularity comes tomorrow 
we're all screwed, but the longer it takes the better our chances become.

A matter of timing (planning ahead, actually -- if you only start to
think about Mars colonization when the first "goo level" nanites
are ready, you're likely to late. Better have as much as possible 
already in place, and simply get the nanotech on board, maybe 
use it to improve your vessel somewhat, and go).

It's worse than that. They have *every* incentive to make it worse, because
if they get worse results they get more money from the government to help
them 'improve'. If they actually do improve their results, then they either
keep the same funding or even see it lowered.

In common speech, the word 'theory' is often used to mean a guess or a
conjecture.  And those are among the dictionary definitions of 'theory'. 
People sometimes use the word 'theory' as in  'This is just a theory...' 
when they mean 'hypothesis', 'conjecture', 'tentative assumption', or
'informed guess'.


But in the context of the scientific method, a 'theory' is not just a
guess.  It is a well-developed explanation of a class of phenomena, an
explanation which is experimentally testable, an explanation which can in
principle reliably predict the outcome of a relevant experiment, and,
usually, an explanation which is widely understood to be true within its
proper context and area of application.  


Examples include Einstein's Theory of Relativity, or Newton's Theory of
Gravitation.

You can spout your opinions of the scientific method all you want, but evidence
from experiment and observation is verification. Its all the verification we can
get of anything. Theories which have been exhaustively verified by experiment
with little to no contradictory evidence are referred to as Natural Laws. The Law
of Gravity, for example, and the Gas Laws, Ohm's Law, Bernoulli's Law, etc.

A gas undergoing expansion actually will cool down, which is why when you heat a
gas it wants to expand.

A theory that has not been tested by experiment or observation is guessing. When
it has passed extensive testing, it is regarded as a Natural Law.

You need to figure out that just because a cause leads to an effect does NOT mean
that an effect will cause a cause. Your muddle headed sloppy thinking at the
hands of modern educators needs refinement.

Sort of.  I think the kind of SI we were talking about is going to go so
far, so fast, that it isn't going to bother with anything as mundane as
large-scale nanotech.  The actually options I listed are just suggestive - I
expect a real runaway SI is going to come up with something much better.

The sun isn't massive enough to form a neutron star.  Their isn't enough
mass in the entire solar system to make one.  In more general terms, if high
energy levels (in a cosmological sense) are required to build an SI's dream
home, there probably isn't enough mass/energy in the solar system to support
the project.

If we assume that the SI has no morals, that there is no possible way of
building what the SI wants without creating extreme conditions (in a
cosmological sense), that there is no possible way of migrating to another
location that would be faster than sublight spaceflight, that taking large
amounts of mass along would actually make the trip more pleasant, and that
the SI intends to actually experience the trip (rather than just switching
to a waiting state for the duration), then yes, that might happen.

I think all of those assumptions are questionable, some of them highly so.

> FTL travel and customized universes require new physics.

Given that we currently know that our best theories of physics are
incomplete, I think it is unrealistic in the extreme to expect that an SI
will not discover new physical effects that it can exploit.  There is no way
to know what those discoveries will be, of course, but we must expect that
they will happen.

I would not predict that an SI would discover any one particular
'impossible' technology.  However, I feel safe in predicting that it will
find ways of doing many things we would consider impossible.

Yes, it is, but I think I can defend it - as long as we are talking about
current or near-term technology, at least.  I will add, as an aside, that I
think the time constraint is a big factor.  If we could afford to spend 50
years on the project it would be a lot more plausible.

Yes, that's true.  Mars is probably easier to colonize than anyplace else we

The difference is that the colony needs to be able to survive indefinitely,
so that it can serve as the starting point for a new civilization.  That
means it can't get by on a stockpile of spare parts.  Ultimately, it must be
able to build all of the equipment it needs to survive, and all of the tools
needed to make that equipment, and the tools to make those tools, ad
infinitum.

Ah.  I think this is the root of our disagreement.

What exactly do you mean by "functioning nanotech"?  I ask, because I think
your assumptions about what you will be able to do with it are very
different from mine.

What we are implicitly assuming here is a future in which AI is a harder
problem than nanotech, and therefore we don't have to worry about the SI
issue until after we have survived the gray goo threat.  In that scenario,
early nanotech is going to be rather limited in what it can do.

Early assembler technology may be theoretically capable of making anything,
but in reality it would require a lot of human effort to make it work.
First you have to actually design the things you want, in some kind of CAD
program.  Then you have to figure out how to assemble them out of whatever
molecular building blocks your system uses - hopefully this process will be
highly automated, but it will still have manual steps if you want to make
anything complex.  You may be able to make a new valve by hitting a button,
but if you want a new kind of robot its going to take a lot of work to
actually make it.

Also, nanotech only addresses the manufacturing issue.  We still need to
locate resources, mine them, maintain our equipment, and so on.  We still
need people to operate all that equipment, and *lots* of specialists just to
make sure that we have someone who can design any given thing.  We need
programmers to write the software (and if you want to get advanced enough AI
to make the nanotech more Drexlerian, we'd better have a small army of
them).

Nanotech would greatly simplify all of the manufacturing problems, but
without human-equivalent AI it doesn't help much with all of these other
issues.  So, our early-nanotech colony might only need a few tens of
thousands of engineering types, but we still have to have the whole gaggle
of scientists and assorted other workers.

Based on the data I've seen, even a well-run Mars project with good
economies of scale is going to have a cost of several tens of thousands of
dollars per pound of mass delivered to Mars.  That means we're spending
around a million dollars apiece just to land people there (counting a
pressure suit and minimal personal necessities).  Equipment is a real
problem - the minimum mass for indefinite-duration life support is probably
going to be measured in tons per person.  Add a few hundred tons for
research labs, power systems and so forth, and were well into hundreds of
billions of dollars.  I think that's about as big a program as we could hope
for, even if the major governments were convinced of the danger.

As an interesting note, I will point out that no one has ever even come
close to building a real, completely closed, indefinite duration life
support system.  Recycling air and water has been done, but no one even
tries to tackle the food production problem.  The most plausible approach to
that for a Mars colony would be to build greenhouses and/or hydroponics
facilities, but that requires shipping a substantial amount of equipment
from Earth (which is why I expect the life support mass requirements to be
so large).

Aside from being a rather unpleasant, this debate doesn't really seem
relevant to the question.  The limiting factor for a Mars colony is not
going to be the number of people required to get a viable gene pool and
raise the next generation.  The real question is how big does the colony
have to be to be able to maintain itself long enough to grow into a new
civilization.

No one person could possible know enough to even maintain the equipment of a
Mars base.  She certainly isn't going to get a new civilization going on her
own.

Listen, when you subscribe to the list, you should become familiar with the
ideas and terms used here from the many FAQ lists, other web pages, and list
archives at the extropy website. Asking such basic questions that have been
asked time and time again does nothing but waste bandwidth and other people's

If you actually have a free society, the rule has to be that everyone is
free to keep their activities private.  If the government gets to decide who
does and does not deserve privacy rights, there will be a steady erosion of
these rights.  Eventually, the only people with privacy with be government
agents.

OTOH, I am suspicious of framing the privacy question in these terms.  A
'right' to privacy is a nebulous concept, which in practice usually amounts
to restricting someone else's freedom of speech.  It might be better to
approach the problem from a different direction.

I would suggest that the rights of freedom of speech and freedom of contract
are sufficient to accomplish everything that should properly be done to
protect individual privacy.  You can easily claim the right to conceal your
doing via encryption, blind agents, assumed names (or refusal to provide
identification), and so forth on these grounds.  If these are the areas you
are concerned about, I support you.

OTOH, you do not have a right to tell someone else what they can do with
their own records, or what they can truthfully say about you to others.  You
can refuse to provide information you don't want others to have, and you can
attempt to persuade them not to do things you don't like, but you do not
have a right to use force to stop them.  We can legitimately forbid
government from doing this sort of thing, but not business.

Actually Biosphere 2 did.  The pilot experiment worked fine; the main
Biosphere
would probably have worked too except for the humorous result of building
scenery and artifical landscape.  They used concrete, which sucked the CO2
out of the air by a chemical reaction.  The shortage of CO2 got replaced by
the decomposers in the soil, which used up the oxygen in the process.

The cost of the biosphere, however, isn't promising.  $300 million for six

is a lot.  Even accounting for the fact that 5/6 was ecological experiments
it's
still nearly 10 million per person, and that's on Earth, even.

Yes, this seems a reasonable approach that most of us will agree with.
There are a lot of cool crypto technologies that can allow people to
remain anonymous while still being able to bind themselves to contracts,
and have other forms of accountability.

One concern I have here is your word "truthfully".  Earlier, in the
discussion of miniarchy vs anarchy, you included "fraud" in your list of
crimes, along with murder, theft, and so on.  Fraud is basically lying
in a commercial context.

Would we really want to make it illegal to tell a lie in some cases?
This seems problematical.  It may not be clear whether the case at hand
is one of the ones where lying is illegal.  Lying in love may be OK
(or is it?), but how about breaking a promise in a marriage contract?
Can you go to jail for adultery?  Also, lying is fundamentally a matter
of state of mind.  Stating a falsehood is only a lie if you know it to
be false.  This makes it hard to objectively prove that someone lied
and makes justice that much more difficult and uncertain.

Making lying illegal would also suggest making slander and libel illegal.
This is a terrible gray area in the legal system, with all kinds of
loopholes and tests for when you can lie, is it parody, did you know it
would cause damage, is the person a public figure, etc.  I wouldn't want
to see all this baggage in a miniarchy or my chosen private law provider.

I would prefer a system in which people can say what they like.  If they
get a reputation as a liar they will suffer the consequences.  The market
will punish liars by giving their word no credibility.  They will not
be able to make contracts, they will not be listened to.  Heinlein had
a comment in one of his stories: if a man gets a reputation as a liar,
he might as well be struck dumb, for no one will pay attention to what
he says.

The idea of space colonies is an interesting thing.

In terms of food and biomass preservation, I think one thing will be algae
tanks to grow biomass, and then conventional or nano-technology to produce
edible food from that.

Remember that for the few people that are on such a solar colony, they will
have the entirety of Earth to back them up.

The minimum limits of a gene pool for a self-sufficient and survivable
anthropological structure is about more than one person.

One key issue about transport and transit will be the ability to place some of
the passengers in a statis state, wherein they will not use life support
resources but can be awaken upon arrival.  This is a bit more focussed towards
extra-solar travel, when the distances to be surmounted would require extended
travel times.

It has been shown that women are more suited for space travel in terms of
resource consumption, among other things.  In terms of the expert skills
required that is not a gender issue.

Unmanned space ships show that as our skills and abilities with robotics
increases, we can use these "beasts of burden" of humanity to enable early
development of Mars or other structures and land humans later, when they would
be better able to survive in the already made and functioning habitat.

In terms of probabilistic clouds and wave particles, I believe recent and new
contemporary research is going to open some other options as well.

I disagree.  We can legitimately forbid American businesses from abusing the
rights of individuals by using an individual's personal data without
permission.  The abuse of the rights to liberty is an infringement of rights,
and should be legislated as such.  Enforcement is an entirely different issue.

Lying under oath in a court of law is illegal.  Lying otherwise is unethical.

Good point - although I think we have to put them in the 'tried but failed'
category.  If they had been on Mars the whole group would have been dead
pretty quickly.

Yes.  I am also unimpressed by the amount of effort the crew had to invest
in just growing their food.  Our Martian colonists need a situation like
modern America, where 1% of the people can grow food for the other 99%.
With their methods we'd be looking at more like 90% farmers.

Do believe that education can be value-free? IE, can a student be taught in
any kind of school system without have that system's values and beliefs
imparted on him? Our public school system certainly teaches values: it
teaches children to shut and behave, do what they are told, learn what they
are told learn, and accept no responsibility for their actions. Private
religious schools also teach their set of values, which in many ways are
very similar to those of public schools. By mandating education, you force
parents to PAY, yes PAY to send their children to schools which will do
everything they can to instill offensive values in their children. Period.

Let me restate this whole concept of paying again. My husband and I own a
two-story house in Katy, Texas in a middle to upper-middle class
neighborhood. Two months ago I wrote checks totalling around $2,500.00 to
the Katy Independent School District. That money DIRECTLY funds public
education. It does not go to welfare programs. It does not go into "blatant
pork overspending on military hammers". It goes to education. Did I mention
that I don't even have any children? Yet every year I pay this. And that
money doesn't even take into account the portions of the obscene federal tax
rate that we pay every year that go to the public education system.

Any curriculum which forces anything upon a child is wrong. A child is a
person, and is worthy of making his own decisions. If we don't allow him to
do that, he never will. It used to be that twelve year olds served as
officers in the military. Do you think any American 12 year old is capable
of doing that right now? I suppose there may be a few exceptional children,
but they would be capable despite the system, not because of it.

I am going to give a couple examples of why this is bad, and I will be as
brief as I can be. For the most part I will be paraphrasing an excellent
book called "The Sudbury Valley School Experience".

If the only children in a class are all the same age and at the same
developmental level, how the hell are the going to help each other out? What
peers can they look to for advice and guidence. Does their teacher really
remember what it's like to be a seven-year old? No. But that nine-year old
does. Can a seven-year old look at another seven-year old and say "look how
much I've grown since then"? No. But he could with a five-year old. Age
mixing occurs in every single other facet of life, making school a
completely artificial situation which is incapable of prepare children for
every day life. At SVS, the contacts children tend to make resemble a bell
curve, which most of a child's friends being in his immediate age group with
a few younger and a few older. This very much mimics natural life
circumstance.

Another arguement against age-separation is the formation of cliques.
Cliques form because children need a way of establishing a pecking order, so
to speak. If everyone is the same age and at the same level, they will turn
to other things to set up this order, things such as appearance. Jealousy
and showing off abound. With age mixing, this doesn't happen. Pecking orders
naturally form around age and experience.

Are you actually advocating tax dollars to pay for school as a substitute
for child care for parents who had children and couldn't afford to stay home
with them? And I think I've beaten the horse of free public education to a
sufficiently dead state.

I hardly consider paying for the indoctrination of children to be a
marvelous value.

Ah, the social contract. A total myth. And one I never signed.

So some people (like me) take measures to reject the little buggers.  Others
(like you) are indifferent and willing to co-habitate with them.   What does
that tell you?

In the narrow sense in which fraud was originally defined, yes.  Fraud is
specifically limited to the act of inducing someone to enter into a contract
with you by providing them with factual information that is demonstrable
false.  If your comments are a matter of opinion, or are made in some other
context, or are not a significant factor, they can't be considered fraud.

I think this protection is necessary to the functioning of any modern
economy, because it is a large part of what makes it possible for strangers
to do business with each other.  Without it, you are forced into a position
where you must investigate the reputation of everyone you ever buy anything
from, which is completely impractical for a modern consumer (let alone a
modern business).

That would be breach of contract, not fraud.

This is one of the reasons for defining fraud narrowly.  You can only be
prosecuted if you claim to know the answer to a question of fact, and then
give an answer that is false.  If you lie about the terms of a contract, or
the performance of your product, or something similar, you are held liable
for any damage that false information may cause.  In any other circumstance,
you are under no obligation.

Yes, libel law is a swamp.  I don't see a good resolution to that problem
either way - their needs to be some kind of protection against real smear
campaigns, but I don't see a good way to write such a law.  Until someone
comes up with a good solution to the problem, my instinct is to make no
laws.

However, fraud is a much more clear-cut issue, and a much more important
one.  IMO we can easily draft a clear, enforceable statute, and it is very
much worthwhile to do so.

If only it were that easy.

The problem is that in modern society most of your economic interactions
will be with complete strangers.  Even if everyone who knows Fred realizes
that he is a lying thief, the odds that you will hear about him are very
low.  If he is even moderately good about covering his tracks that chance
becomes miniscule.  Unless his business happens to be heavily dependant on
repeat customers, he will probably do just fine.

Children cannot learn their limits unless they are allowed to freely explore
them. They cannot learn their options unless they are allowed to find them.
I think we basically agree. The Sudbury Valley School has plenty of teachers
and resources available; all the child has to do is come to them, rather
than vice versa. Overall, the facilitating is more of a passive process
rather than an active one. I suggest you read the books I listed in my reply
to Michael Wiik. As a friend recently told me, these books will convince you
better than I ever could.

Fair enough, and certainly correct.  In that case, the ethical value of saving
those from oppression is higher than that of not lying, an ethical tradeoff.

To be purely and completely ethical is nearly impossible for a human, as it is
not necessarily a Darwinian advantage.  It is a noble goal.

There are multiple sides and interpretations of any issue.

Since I know of no method proven to "reject the little buggers", that
tells me that you are either better informed or more gullible than I.
I hope it's the former: what method do you refer to?  I am, alas, one
of those for whom Minoxodil is ineffective (though it did give me a
slightly fuzzy crown, it wasn't cosmetically useful hair, and
certainly not worth $50 a month).

I am willing to suffer the beasts if the alternative is as drastic
and expensive as surgery, but if there's something more reasonable
that has valid clinical evidence of effectiveness, I'd use it.

What do you mean by "under the aegis"?

Using the usual definition - the cause I feel responsible to - I operate
under the aegis of Externalism.  (No, I am not going to define it one
more damn time - if you want to know, I think there's something in
_Coding_.)  Anything else, including the Singularity, is a means to an end.

Heh.  Do you suppose I haven't been trying to think of a less awkward phrase?

But I don't even label my project Extropy - I disagree with the
Practical Optimism principle - although I do suppose that the project is
about ultratechnology, so it is Extropianist, and it is certainly Singularitarian.

Yeah?  What is this ur-meme, and how would I need to rephrase the

No, the car rolled endless amounts of times, and I was thrown out twenty

Checked your serotonin levels recently, Michael? :-)

Seriously, I think this is a bit rude. You have a point - when joining
a new forum it is a good idea to read up on what has gone before - but
it is clearly impractical to read everything (especially with a forum
with this list's long history) and also likely that you will miss one
thing or another. The best way of learning things is often to ask. And
we oldtimers should remember that many of the discussions we have seen
again and again and again are new to many participants - they form an
important part of learning about our meme-complex, and we should
really try to participate (even if it might feel tiresome to deal with
the identity question, the singularity argument, the libertarian
general quarrel and all the others again).

A longshot: cranial hair correlates with testosterone levels, which
also correlates with spatial ability. Mind you, this is rather weak.

The best definition of a redneck I have ever heard is someone who is belligerently ignorant.  While Michael Lorrey is far from ignorant, he continues to revel in the redneckian belligerence which is only to be expected from someone who knowingly and gleefully includes the slogan from Tim McVeigh's post-OkCity truckbombing T-shirt in his sig, and "justifies" this mass homicide-approving stance by referring to a Waco video which is rivalled only by the antiabortion "Silent Scream" in its abject lack of objectivity, while daring anyone who might demonstrate the temerity to disagree with his skewed politics to "take him on" in a travestric mimicry of Suthrn Honor.   He is one individual who should be forbidden from buying fertilizer and kerosene, especially as he spouts so much of the former while pouring the latter on every fire he can find.

Rather than contribute to the noise level, I will confine myself to
remarking that I believe this is over the line. Read the list rules, which
should have been mailed automatically upon subscription.

I make no claims about M. Lorrey's postings being over or under said line.

Niceness pays. So does not rewarding attention squanderers. _My_ serotonin
levels certainly could be better at times.

This is why people keep asking for a "Deep End"/restricted list (It's not
elitism (at least not purely), it's recognition that attention is the most
limited resource).

Now that there is supposed to be one, I'll soon be deciding whether to join
EI in order to participate in it. 

And I hope _it'll_ have high standards of politeness *and* self-study, e.g.
every participant will know to look a word up, will know how to use
AltaVista, Dogpile or at least Yahoo, and will expect to be chided or even
dumped for obvious laziness. 

And I'll save _this_ list for when I'm feeling particularly extrosattva
(which word I believe I coined, unless someone has priority). I encourage
others to do the same.

I heard about the "miss" on the radio.  Paul Harvey I think.  He reported it
in an unfavorable light and also mentioned that Lockheed-Martin was being

The point is to build a society that is self sufficient with sufficient resource
base to develop a viable long term population in a terraformable environment. It
is to provide a fallback population if the 'grey goo' scenario of nanotech causes
worldwide catastrophe here on earth. Current research is showing that Mars could
be terraformed to a livable open air environment in a century of work, and livable
in open air with merely oxygen masks within just 20-30 years of concentrated work
(giving a CO2 atmosphere at a density similar to Lhasa, Tibet). This is with NO
nanotechnology.

Orbiting space colonies will always have at least a partial dependency on earth.

Depends on what level of inbreeding you are willing to tolerate. Using one woman
and hundreds or thousands of fertilized embryos would be a minimum acceptable gene
pool, if that is all your are concerned about, but you will also need a good
number of highly trained people from the start to oversee terraforming work. A
Mars colony IMHO would be cheaper than an orbiting space colony, for the simple
reason that Mars already provides all the working mass you need. An orbiting
colony requires you to get your mass from somewhere else.

Well, men still are superior in mathematical/spatial skills, and tend to produce
far more genius intelligences. Women are superior for space travel only for one
reason: they are less prone to get space sick. However it has been shown that
propensity to space sickness is more a matter of the percent of body fat. Fat
people are less likely to get space sick and women typically have 2 to 3 times
higher body fat levels than men at a similar level of  cardiovascular fitness.

Of course, sending dumb robots to do the factory work of producing greenhouse
gasses and digging heat tap shafts, as well as refining metals and chemicals for
supplying a nascent Mars industrial base is necessary, but humans will be required
for several purposes:a) maintaining the robots
b) doing the big jobs of bringing in a couple comets a year for three or four
years to drop on Mars at the north and south poles.
c) oversee the nuclear plants that will be needed to produce heat.
d) developing in greenhouses genetically engineered plant and animal species that
can survive in a low pressure, high CO2 level, high radiation martian atmosphere.

Well, the mites are attracted to the sebum oil excreted by the hair follicles,
which would have higher testosterone-derivative chemicals in it, or the higher
testosterone levels contribute to a higher propensity to trigger immune
responses to the mite colonies at the base of the follicles.

My congratulations, that is quite a poetic flame.

You know what the definition of a true liberal is? Someone who respects every side of the argument so much that they won't even support their own position. They certainly don't participate in ad hominem attacks. The fact that so many liberals today operate almost completely on ad hominem attacks with no factual substance indicates how far from their origins they have strayed.

Since 70% of the US population supports the 2nd amendment, I hardly see how my politics are 'skewed'. Since all of my arguments are based on the law and the Constitution, I hardly see how they are 'skewed' unless the law and the Constitution is skewed.

I'm surprised you haven't accused me of being a concentration camp commadant, or a pen pal of Hitler or Mussolini, but I'm sure you will in your reply. I will warn you in advance that part of my family is Jewish. The Nazis were able to exterminate the Jews so easily because it was against the law for Jews to own firearms in most european countries. Likewise, the Jim Crow laws worked so well in the South because blacks were not allowed to own firearms in most jurisdictions. Gun control laws have always been the first tool of the opressor when starting down the road to slavery and genocide.

The fact that the prosecution used the quote of Thomas Jefferson as evidence AGAINST McVeigh indicates how much our present government has betrayed the Constitution it is sworn to uphold and defend.

This isn't even postmodernist sincere insincerity. I have a question.

Does Michael Lorrey know everything? It seems like he has a deep and
thoughtful comment on every topic. How does he do this? I'm in utter awe.

Just wanted to give props when necessary (not that others aren't
awesome....I'm trying to understand Nick Bostrom, but my math is weak....)

Although I am a supporter of the right to keep and bear arms, as well as a multiple gun owner myself (Bambi is delicious!), I will note that majority approval does not grant either infallibility or sainthood on a position.  If it had been up to a majority vote, Jim Crow would still be law in many southern states, and Adolph's margin of victory in his election to chancellor was overwhelming.  Automatic weapons did not exist when the framers wrote the Constitution, nor did rockets or nukes.  May I be so bold as to suggest that, had they, the Constitution itself would have pried them from the fingers of the general populace?  If I can have a shotgun to bird hunt, a rifle to deer hunt and a pistol to protect my home, then I'm happy.  The only reason anyone could justify having an Uzi, a Mac, an AR or an AK (fully auto), much less a 50-cal., is to protect themselves from the bad guys who have already bought them (and the gun manufacturers make them as easy as possible to buy, or to!
 convert, so they can make money at both ends - by midwifing the threat, and by arming the lawabiders against it).

That road was well traveled before guns ever existed.  They are just another tool, which may be equally used to defend against or to perpetrate such atrocities.  One can never legislate intent; one can only hope to limit weapons access to exclude the homicidal and the certifiably crazy, for they don't care where your nose is when they swing.  One thing is for sure; if the tanks rumble down the street or the mortars start to fall, Zed and his varmint gun are going to be of little use, but we can't furnish every Tom, Dick and Zed with their own tank and mortar (nor would it be wise, or they'd get used to hold up convenience stores).

So you ARE in open revolt against the democratically elected government of the United States of America!  My remark about keeping ANFO ingredients away from you was perhaps not misplaced.  I lived in OK City for 2 years, and my father is a retired gov't accountant who once worked at Tinker AFB.  I have friends there who were relatives and friends of some of the deceased.  If you think you can even begin to attempt to try contemplating anything remotely resembling a justification for watering the "tree of liberty" with their blood, then the only difference between you and Tim McVeigh is that you haven't yet rented the truck.

They just don't make conservative (actually libertarian) Republicans like him anymore; the ones around now wanna stake out your bedroom to decide if you can be a soldier or teacher, and check your stash drawer trying to confiscate your house and car to sell at auction in order to support their paramilitary jihad on drug-users and their construction of ever more prisons to warehouse them, rather than paying off the debt with legalization and reasonable taxation, whilst kissing the lower cheeks of Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell on the abortion, gambling, prostitution, euthanasia and gay rights issues (which to me are personal freedoms at LEAST as important as gun ownership, for they involve SELF-ownership).  They wanna make !
everything either mandatory or forbidden, which effectively eliminates choice.  Being a fiscal conservative and social liberal, I want the Democrats AND the Republicans outta my pockets AND my pants, but it was Reagan/Bush who intentionally ran this debt up (by increasing military spending while cutting taxes) in an attempt to bankrupt the social programs they hated (it was their budgets the Democratic Congress had to vote on), and Clinton who's done something about it.  The answer is not to rebel against a democratic system - it is to encourage the more rational people to get off their bitching and moaning asses and use the system to vote in saner policies and politicians.

No, but a supermajority is far more rarely incorrect than just a bare majority, or a minority (Bill Clinton, elected by a minority of the vote to the Presidency). Moreover the issue was whether my position was "skewed". Since you seem to be one of the liberal moral relativists, your judgement of what is skewed or not would relate to how I relate to the rest of the population.

not quite. If it were up to a majority of those who were previously able to keep the blacks off of the voting rolls it would be. Blacks are the majority or a near majority in many or most southern states.

Actually, rockets were in existence (William Congreve's rockets were in common use among British detachments, which is where the "rockets red glare" phrase in our national anthem comes from), and 90% of all cannon in the US were privately owned.

> May I be so bold as to suggest that, had they, the Constitution itself would have pried them from the fingers of the general populace?  If I can have a shotgun to bird hunt, a rifle to deer hunt and a pistol to protect my home, then I'm happy.  The only reason anyone could justify having an Uzi, a Mac, an AR or an AK (fully auto), much less a 50-cal., is to protect themselves from the bad guys who have already bought them (and the gun manufacturers make them as easy as possible to buy, or to!

Yes, infortunately, the 'bad guys who have already bought them' are first and foremost opressive governments and the 'dirty tricksters' that run their security apparatus' and frequently go into private practice.

All automatic firearms models began life as the result of a government military procurement program. Who midwifed the threat?

I will warn you in advance that part of my family is Jewish. The Nazis were able to exterminate the Jews so easily because it was against the law for Jews to own firearms in most european countries. Likewise, the Jim Crow laws worked so well in the South because blacks were not allowed to own firearms in most jurisdictions. Gun control laws have always been the first tool of the opressor when starting down the road to slavery and genocide.

One can never legislate intent; one can only hope to limit weapons access to exclude the homicidal and the certifiably crazy, for they don't care where your nose is when they swing.  One thing is for sure; if the tanks rumble down the street or the mortars start to fall, Zed and his varmint gun are going to be of little use, but we can't furnish every Tom, Dick and Zed with their own tank and mortar (nor would it be wise, or they'd get used to hold up convenience stores).

Zed don't need no tank or mortar Clem! All he needs is access to fertilizer and fuel to make anti tank mines when the gummint cums a callin'!

No I am not, but only because I don't see a legitimate insurgency in operation, and I would prefer to separate myself from the system rather than exert force upon the system.

> My remark about keeping ANFO ingredients away from you was perhaps not misplaced.  I lived in OK City for 2 years, and my father is a retired gov't accountant who once worked at Tinker AFB.  I have friends there who were relatives and friends of some of the deceased.  If you think you can even begin to attempt to try contemplating anything remotely resembling a justification for watering the "tree of liberty" with their blood, then the only difference between you and Tim McVeigh is that you haven't yet rented the truck.

As I said previously, my opinion of what he did was that his actions were a war crime and he deserves to be executed. That building was a legitimate target. Most of the people using it at the time it was attacked were not. I condemn his actions in the most extreme manner, but only because of the time of day he attacked it.

The situation is similar to situations that the French Resistance had in WWII. They sabotaged train tracks, usually hopefully when a train was going over them. Unfortunately, they had to find out in advance which trains were just munitions trains and which trains had wounded soldiers or civilian passengers. Attacking the first is a legitimate target, while the second is not and it would be a war crime to attack it.

First you decry that there are no acceptable Republicans anymore, then you say we must work through the system. If the system excludes those that represent your sentiments, then you have the Constitutional right to rebel against that government, by any means necessary. I want a system that knows inherently to stay away from my wallet. I shouldn't have to bribe some slimeballs to make sure it happens. I might as well pay taxes then.

Parts of it perhaps.  Lets take it a piece at a time:

I agree with if-we-could-afford-50-yrs part, and I would go further
in saying that is probably the right way to do it.  However, the public
and venture capitalists have a notoriously short attention span.  And
besides, I would like to see it happen while I have plenty of natural
life left.  {8^D  Wouldnt you?

Agreed.  Mars has more basic materials than the moon, especially
carbon, and everyplace has more materials than orbital space.

Yes, and what I have in mind here is that the first colony would be
very machine rich and human lean.  But I have in mind starting
a colony before nanotech is in place.  Please read on:

>...Also, nanotech only addresses the manufacturing issue.  We still need to

This may be where you and I disagree.  (I hope I did not mix your views
with the other post to which you were replying.)  All these specialists
I agree will be needed, but in my scenario, they stay earthbound.  The
problems will be directed to them by the first Mars colonist, who will
most likely be hanging on to survival by the thinnest of margins.  She
will be there to repair and maintain equipment, and to operate force
multiplying equipment that may need to be built on site for the most
part.  It will not be an easy task, nor one quickly accomplished.  But
the single Mars colonist need not master every known field of engineering.
She could rely on software and hardware specialists back home.

>...but we still have to have the whole gaggle
> of scientists and assorted other workers...

 We probably could not afford to send an army of humans to Mars.
Not before we have strong nanotech, and then the whole problem
is transformed.  Im looking short term, next 40 yrs, assuming nanotech
is not yet ready by then.

 >...That means we're spending
>around a million dollars apiece just to land people there (counting a
>pressure suit and minimal personal necessities).

Yes, but this estimate is more optimistic than mine by an order of
magnitude at least.  Once you consider the other necessities, I am
surprised if we could land and sustain a nominal human on Mars
for less than 100 million apiece, and even that may require some
optimistic assumptions on sustainable food production once you
get there.  Let us calculate this and reconvene next week on a
cost and weight estimate.

>...Equipment is a real problem - the minimum mass for indefinite-
>duration life support is probably going to be measured in tons per person...

Yes.  So then, now you see why I was proposing heroic measures
for reducing the human cargo.  The Boeing-commie rocket fired from the
sea platform last week was a success, and that may lead to lower
payload costs, but still it will be mind numbing expensive.

So:  let us consider, how can we make people smaller and lighter, eat
less and produce less waste?  Would not all the requirements scale
to the size of the crew?  Could we not imagine a person who is
25kg?  how about 20kg?  What is the record for the lightest adult
human?  Would it be ethical to create such a person?  What if we
found an eager 10 yr old who was willing to eat antigrowth hormones?
Is there such a thing, medics?

The colony may need to be large to sustain itself *without help* but
it need *not* be large to survive *assuming help* from the earth, which
it would surely have.  We could do the whole thing with small robots, but
having even one person on site would be worth the costs of getting
her there and sustaining her.  Imagine a situation where we had a number
of small (but not nano) robotic devices that would collect Martian soil,
bring it to an automated foundry, the process being mostly controlled
from earth, and making materials from which other robots would build
other manufacturing robots (perhaps larger ones) which would then build
pressure vessels to contain vegetation, etc.  The critical real time feedback
and control might be handled on site by the single colonist, while all that
*can* be done by us *is* done by us.  Most of the task of the astronaut
might be to manufacture additional humans in her womb, while the
machines work outside.

So, Billy, how small can we make that human payload?

Dan Fabulich writes, 

> I'm not familiar with that abbreviation. What's the ur-meme?

The Random House Dictionary says ur is "a combining form meaning earliest,
original, used in words denoting the primal stage of a historical or
cultural entity or phenomenon." 

For example, linguists have tried to reconstruct the original Indo-European
language, the ur-language which gave rise to all modern Indo-European
languages.  

The ur-meme refers to the first meme that became aware of itself as a meme
in competition with other memes; the first one that appeared in the form of
a book that instructed its readers to read it, teach it to their children,
build a community around it, and propagate it everywhere; the first one
that incorporated the idea of one unique God (or one unique reality); the
first one that introduced the idea of a messiah who would renew the world. 


This original meme has since mutated into many forms, some of which are
secular and have no obvious connection to their source.  But most of them
have the idea of a messiah, whether it be Jesus, Lenin, John Galt, or the
AI that will emerge from our computers and save us from ourselves.  

When I mentioned the ur-meme, I expressed myself in a deliberately
elliptical fashion, hoping that Eliezer would get my drift and no one else
would ask for an explanation.  But Dan did ask, and I am writing this
because he asked a fair question and deserves an answer.  However, I never
intended to return to the list.  I promised myself two years ago that I
would never again get into a desultory e-mail discussion where people come
and go and the discussion drifts from thread to thread, aimlessly.  

A few days ago it came to my attention that some nit-brained newbie had
mentioned my name with disrespect, and I thought I had better make a
comment.  Now that thats done, I am going to keep my promise to myself.  I
note that Billy has started a new thread about Geniebusters.  I have no
intention of getting into a flame war with him.  If anyone on the list
cares enough about the calibration meme to defend it, fine.  If not, thats
fine too.  The calibration meme will find its way in the world on its own
merit.  Im going to get back to work.  

One final note to Eliezer:  if you spent your time writing software instead
of reading the Extropian list, you wouldnt have to worry about raising
money.

There seem to be two models.  In one, fraud and possibly libel is illegal.
People assume that others are honest and react to them on that basis.
People who are dishonest are punished.  An infrastructure is needed to
provide this punishment and to determine when proscribed forms of
dishonesty occur.

In the other model, fraud, libel and other dishonest actions are legal.
People have to assume that others may not be honest.  Reputation will be
crucial for establishing relationships and trust.  An infrastructure is
needed to maintain information about reputations and to determine when
claims of lying and other breaches of faith are true.

It is not clear to me which system has lower costs.  In each case you
need an infrastructure, along with some mechanism for determining when
lies have occured.  I have a personal preference for the second system,
as long as it is not much more costly.  It relies more on voluntary
relationships.  There are fewer laws, fewer prisoners.

Also, with a reputation system, people can make their own decisions
about what levels of risk to accept in a relationship.  A legal regime
is going to be inherently boolean and provide the same enforcement of
honesty for all parties, regardless of whether it is appropriate in a
given relationship.  The reputation system is more flexible.
