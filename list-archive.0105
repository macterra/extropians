Nanotech has done, to date, nothing.  Nobody has even a simple nanomachine
going.  Until somebody demonstrates machine-phase is even *possible*
it's way premature to expect it to even be practical, never mind superior
to liquid-phase "nanotech" - i.e., the biotech being belittled.

AI can't even do grammar checks yet.  Moore's law may pull it out yet.  Or may
not, depending on how efficiently Mother Nature used our neurons and how
high a frequency of gamma rays we can focus.

I'm all for planning ahead; but none of the advanced stuff we talk about is 
imminent.  AI is the only possibility for this generation.  Nanotech is still
a speculation.  Biotech may produce wonderful stuff soon; but we're not
about to improve brains yet because we don't know how, and we'll need
to be *very* sure before we do it.  Even an AI "singularity" won't be a 
singularity.  We'll shift from a 20-year doubling time to a 18-month
doubling time, until Moore's law runs out.  It'll be like the whole world
is a successful startup company for a few years to a few decades;
then it will be over.

When you were a bit older, did you happen to read `Bettyann', by Kris
Neville? Wilma Shiras's `In Hiding' and its sequels? Zenna Henderson's
*People* stories?

Sigh. It was evidence. After all, those other people *must have had the

Really?  Dozens of teams all working full-spped on creating
human-competitive machine intelligence?  Across the board?  Strong AI? 
Or just competitive in some delimited problem area or another like
playing chess?

If it is strong AI, creating a self aware, human competitive general
intelligence that you are talking about then please give references to
these groups and their work.  This would be very interesting indeed.

I should begin by saying that I'm all in favor of genetically altering food
crops. I dislike some of the specific alterations that are presently being
marketed, for example varieties that are being produced that will *only*
grow well with the use of large quantities of fertilizers and herbicides.

I'm also aware that there are plenty of people making big bucks selling
"organic" food. It's also true, as far as I know, that there has been no
indication that any of the GE food crops are unhealthy (with exception of
the potato study that Berman refers to in his article. In that study, the
brains of rats fed on GE potatoes failed to develop normally.).

But I find it disturbing when people use scare tactics such as stating, as
Berman does, that GE crops are the only way to prevent massive famine. This
makes me wonder if Berman doesn't have some hidden agenda. I don't know
where he got the following information; I do know that it's meaningless as
presented. He says:
----------------------------
 Paradoxically, too, this natural food is hard on nature: On the same
acreage, organic farms produce up to 40 percent less food than conventional
farms, meaning they plow up that much more land. Widespread organic
agriculture would also require nitrogen-rich green manure, entailing the
conversion of more millions of wilderness acres to pasturage.
----------------------------

This is one of the most absurd paragraphs I've seen lately. I'd like to know
which farms? Where? What crops? Over what periods of time?

Stop shouting and start listening: There are people who care. You care, for 
example. But (to me) it seems that you're too afraid to move ahead and to try to 
find at least one possible solution to the problem you describe above. 
And there is at least another one who cares: Eliezer offered you a bunch of 
links, showing how much he cares.

You're quite wrong.  I dare say that both a remarkable number
of cryonicists and extropians do not concede the necessity of
mortality.

Not at all.  If persons now living do manage to get past the
next couple of centuries, nothing prevents them from establishing
numerous copies of themselves throughout the universe, and the
chance of them all being taken out, in say a gamma burst, is
quite small.  And some folks, such as Freeman Dyson, have been
talking a long time about physics that might support an infinite
amount of computation.  The ultimate source for these
considerations is Tipler, "The Physics of Immortality".

It may or may not be invariant, but that has little to do
with it "deserving" to be preserved.  Does an obscure type
of ant in the Amazon jungle "deserve" to have its pattern
recorded for all time?  Most people today would say yes.
Well, I'd say that the pattern of Samantha Atkins is about
10^7 times as important to preserve.  Where the hell does
this concept of "deserve" come from anyway?  It almost 
sounds as though one's "worthiness" were being evaluated
by the Almighty, or by some similarly transcended creature
(perhaps the AI you're working on).

But watch out.  If you evolve into something that on objective
grounds is not-Samantha, then unless you've arranged that
earlier versions of you get ample run time, you'll be quite
dead.  Please don't let that happen.

That's more like it!  Well said at last.

Its me.  Hey, I get along with everybody.  Ive been quietly watching
this latest list quality thread and wish to add only a little.  Extropians

is a forum for exchange of ideas about the future, and it is also an
ongoing party of sorts.  Many pleasant acquaintances in RL start
here.  The banter does get loud at times, as it does at a party, but
that is part of the delightful charm and strangeness of the list.

Extropians has spun off a number of parallel processes, so to
speak, such as Eliezer's SL4, Mike Lorrey has organized
two or three specializations, theres the Exi-freedom list, the
local ExI lists, et.al.  Some of these specialty lists are more
suited to certain special-interest readers.

Extropians is a live and let live kinda place, broad and perfectly
suited to the future minded libertarian.  Yes it gets noisy,
yes flame wars break out.  Get a quick finger on the
delete key.  We are about life extension, eh?  What good
is a longer life if we aren't having fun?  Lets get together
at E5 and slam a brew or two and let the flames be
bygones.  spike

Another delightful use of genetic technology to cure debilitating problems 
in humans and animals. Perhaps as more and more of these reports appear, 
the critics of genetic technologies will mellow out, or be largely ignored 
(except when they have some specific, well-reasoned objection to a 
particular application).

I must inhabit a baser world than you, because your two scenarios happen to
me all the time. For the record, I did do a bunch of computability classes,
and wouldn't want to forget them now that I know them. I only recommended
against them if one was choosing a minimal first-cut to learn compsci (or
programming, at least, which I think is closer to what was asked).

Also, I'd protest that it takes knowledge of P vs NP, etc etc, to end up in
the scenario you propose above. More often than not, I find coders can't go
far past a linked list or array before knees begin to wobble. You don't have
to suggest anything too elegant before people accuse it of being obscure and
unmaintainable, and "generally unworkable" - try saying "general tree" to a
VB coder. The same people will try to build multiuser systems with Access as
the backend (after all, it's cheap). Show of hands... how many people out
there have ended up on the "maintenance" end of a system like that?

Well, it never matters to those people. It's the (railroaded) technical
architects who carry the can when the fundamentally flawed system falls in a
heap.

This is the same kind of thinking that produces the "behavourist" system
implementation method. You know, where you whack a bunch of forms together,
then just hack out stuff to get the behaviour right (where "right" is, more
often than not, redefined on a daily basis). I haven't been working in IT
quite long enough to have lost my sense of surprise when people suggest this
for complex distributed systems. Those are the projects where, just after
the "design" phase is done, you should get your resume together in
preparation for jumping contracts just before the implementation phase is
supposed to be finished.

What I personally really hate is having to explain to people why such a
system will not scale, will never be robust or even stable, why it is barely
even maintainable, let alone extensible... gaaah. You know... when people
want to get that 3 user system and roll it out to 100+ users enterprise wide
over the corporate WAN, and interface is with a handful of corporate
information systems... blech.

Sometimes I find it difficult to muster up that "can-do" attitude :-)

I agree with Harvey and Natasha. To insist, as Eliezer did, that suspension 
are "DEAD" in such universal terms, misses the complexities of the issue. 
Aside from legal death vs. clinical death vs. biological death vs. 
informational death, it's worth noting that the term "dead" is ambiguous. 
In one sense it implies irreversibility. In another sense ("my car engine 
is dead; I'd better get it fixed") it does not.

Since I don't think the following piece is on the Web, I'll include it 
here. Bear in mind that I wrote it over a decade ago, so it doesn't fully 
reflect my later thinking. The second link below, to my doctoral 
dissertation is more recent and much more complete.

_______________________________________________________
IMMORTALIST PHILOSOPHY (January 1991 Cryonics Magazine):

         THE THIRD STATE

         by Max More.


         Wider acceptance of cryonics will require new conceptual 
categories. As cryonicists it is our responsibility to use terminology and 
concepts that reflect our understanding of the rationale behind the 
suspension procedure. Sloppy use of terms will not effectively communicate 
our ideas to others. Despite Brian Wowk's important article, "The Death of 
`Death' in Cryonics," (Cryonics #95, June 1988), too many cryonicists are 
still using terms like "death" inaccurately. Here I will re-present and 
build on Brian's suggestion, hopefully reinforcing the point for long-time 
cryonicists and to explain it to recent participants.

         Traditionally, biological organisms have been classified as either 
alive or dead. Two basic reasons explain this simple categorization. 
Firstly, until very recently, when heartbeat and respiration stopped there 
was no way to return a person to life. It seemed that there was a point 
beyond which life had permanently ceased and so it was natural to assume 
that life suddenly turned into death.

         Secondly, most people have believed in the existence of a 
non-physical carrier of consciousness and personality. The body was 
considered merely a vehicle for this "soul". Again, it seemed natural to 
understand death as the point at which the soul left the body - a sudden 
event rather than a gradual process. A dualist (one who believes mind or 
soul is separate from matter or brain) should really say that though the 
body dies the person survives in another form. On that view, the exit of 
the soul is only a physical death, but not the true death of the person.

         We now know beyond any reasonable doubt that personality is a 
function of a physical brain process, expressed through an attached 
physical body. We also now know that the cessation of heartbeat and 
respiration does not force us to conclude that the person has died. If 
"death" is to mean the permanent loss of personality, then persons have not 
died until there is no possibility of recovering their personality.

          Dying can no longer be thought of as a sudden event. Since the 
personality is encoded in the structure of the brain, dying is a gradual 
process of degradation in the neural structures embodying personality. The 
possibility of halting the dying process demands a new term to describe the 
condition of someone in the stages between the first state of normal 
conscious function and the second state of death. This Third State (in 
historical, not logical order) is the condition cryonic suspension patients 
are in.

         Strictly speaking, the Third State is a collection of states. 
Cryonicists have often referred to suspension patients as having 
"deanimated", or simply being "in suspension". I want to offer a set of 
terms, some already in use, which will clarify the possibilities that lie 
between life and death.

         The general term I propose for a person who is in a stable 
condition between life and death is "inactivate". I prefer this to 
"deanimate" for two reasons. (a) "Deanimated" connotes lack of observable 
movement. People who are not animated in the normal sense may be sleeping, 
comatose, resting, and so on. Saying they are inactivate more strongly 
implies that biological activity at the cellular and molecular level has 
ceased. (b) The movie "Reanimator" has, for some people, produced negative 
connotations to "reanimation" and "deanimation". Talk of inactivate, 
inactivation, deactivating, and reactivating avoids these difficulties.

         "Inactivate" is a general term subsuming several possibilities, of 
which cryonic suspension is only one. Since survival of personality 
involves continuation of a certain functional process, there are several 
ways of being inactivate that allow for possible future restoration to life 
and consciousness.

         Inactivate may mean (a) Biostatic (or "in biostasis"). This means 
that the person's original body is being preserved with the intention of 
eventual repair and reactivation. Biostasis itself may take at least three 
forms: (i) Cryostasis, or cryonic suspension, which is the only method 
currently used. (ii) Vitrification, in which very low-temperature storage 
is accomplished without formation of ice crystals. (iii) Various forms of 
chemical fixation, such as use of cross-linking to prevent biological 
activity.
         (b) Inactivate persons might survive in a non-biological form. On 
a functionalist view, personality persists so long as the same functioning 
can be restored. This means that personality is to its physical 
implementation (normally the brain) as software is to hardware. This does 
not mean that any software can be "run" on any hardware, but it does mean 
that there may be kinds of hardware other than the brain capable of 
supporting the kind of functioning that produces personality and 
consciousness.

          If the structure of a person's dying brain was throughly analyzed 
and the information specifying that structure reliably stored, it would be 
possible in principle to later build a new brain functionally identical to 
the old one (except for the rejuvenation of the cells). Someone existing in 
the form of stored information would not be dead, since there has not been 
an irreversible loss of the information necessary to restore function. If 
the information is later embodied in a new brain, or uploaded into a 
suitably designed computer, the personality of the original person would be 
restored and they would once again be alive.

         In the debate following Brian's article, Jerry Leaf and Hugh Hixon 
rejected Brian's suggestion that we refer to suspension patients as being 
in an "ametabolic coma" or in an "ischemic coma", on the grounds that these 
terms already have defined senses incompatible with our desired usage. 
Instead then, we can refer to such patients by the general term 
"inactivate", or the more specific terms "biostatic/in biostasis", 
"cryostatic/in cryostasis," or simply "suspended".

         All these terms are applicable to persons who are in the stable 
third state between life and death. But how should we describe those who 
are in the process of decay toward death (apart from "in need of 
suspension"!)? Calling them "partially alive" is misleading since it 
suggests that certain parts of them are dead. If we describe then as 
degenerating or deactivating we are accurately stressing the point that 
they are in the midst of a process that is heading in an undesirable 
direction. This has the advantage that it implies the possibility of 
halting the process. Accuracy demands that we reserve the term "dying" for 
a process that begins some time after degeneration has begun; a person does 
not begin to die until degeneration has reached the point where information 
essential to personality functioning is being permanently lost. This 
happens only after the degenerative process has been proceeding for some time.

I know the feeling, Samantha. The world around me as a child didn't seem to 
be where I came from. The feeling lessened slightly when I moved from 
England to California, but not by much.

Fortunately, in June a microcosm of that more advanced civilization will 
temporarily materialize in San Jose, California. The materialization is 
known in advance, and some of us call it "EXTRO-5".

The only obstacle now is overcoming bureaucratic problems in obtaining a 
permit for dangerously high concentrations of cognitive and imaginative 
energy at the Hilton & Towers. ;-)

Yeah; he's one of the helpful guys/gals, most of the time.
Believe it or not, I *have* read some (by no means all) of his stuff. 
I'm all for moving ahead. The point of moving ahead, to me, is to 
further those things we consider most desirable. The best way to do 
that (to my mind) is to move ahead ourselves--not to create "a new 
order of intelligence" which may value nothing in common with us. 

As EY himself has said, once his baby's up and running--all we can do 
is hope for the best. I believe we should retain control of our own 
destiny, not hand it off to something else--unless that something is 
an improved (as opposed to "upgraded") version of ourselves.

True enough, we may be doomed either way. And we may not. 

Personally, I'm unconvinced a truly conscious nonbiological entity 
can be constructed. It need not be conscious, however, to destroy us.

Open the archives!  How the open source movement is changing historic
archives.

By Joyce Slaton

IN 1935 OTTO Bettmann
preserved an invaluable chunk
of history when he sneaked
two steamer trunks of photos
out of Nazi Germany. His
collection of photos kept
growing when he began a new
life in America, and
eventually it documented
events and objects as
disparate as World War II
battlefields, Rosa Parks on
the bus, and historical
medical tools. And Bettman's
collection expanded even
after his death. In 2001 the
Bettman Archive contained an
estimated 17 million images,
some of them quite famous -
the photo of JFK Jr. saluting
his father's coffin, for
instance.  But even without
the most famous photos, this
collection is unarguably a
treasure of visual
documentation from the 20th
century.

So what did the Bettmann
Archive do with this
invaluable chunk of human
history? Why, it sold it to
Bill Gates, of course.

Corbis, the Bill Gates-owned
company that bought the
archives in 1995, will keep
almost anyone from ever
seeing them again. The
millions of images in the
archive are scheduled to be
sunk 220 feet down in a
Pennsylvania limestone
mine. They'll be placed into
subzero humidity-controlled
storage, safe forever from
both human and natural
disasters. And, by the way,
they'll also be "safe" from
anyone who might ever want to
look at, study, or reprint
the images.

Is Bettmann preserving part
of our history or locking it
up and throwing away the key?
Many critical archivists
claim the latter. They assert
that archivists must always
strike a difficult balance
between the twin duties of
their trade, preserving the
annals of history and somehow
providing public access to
those annals without damaging
them. By locking up millions
of images far away from human
hands and eyes, Bettmann may
have leaned tragically far
toward preservation without
concern for access.

A new generation of "open
source" archivists are
arguing that archiving needs
to change radically. Archives
shouldn't be sunk into mines,
and they probably shouldn't
be owned by large
corporations. A growing
number of these new-school
archivists, like San
Francisco's Rick Prelinger,
are creating publicly
available, free-for-all
archives on the Internet that
offer new answers to the
question of what to do with
the billions of pieces of
historical material rotting
away in libraries,
foundations, and university
archives all over the world.

Digitizing the bastard genre
films

Rick Prelinger wants to know
which of the more than 1,000
digitized films in his
archive I'd like to see.

"Let's see here: 'Cheating,'
'Cheerios,' 'The Chicken of
Tomorrow,' " he lists. "Oooh,
you've got to see 'Coffee
House Rendezvous' - that was
sponsored by the Coffee
Institute, and it was shown
to churches and youth
organizations to inspire them
to create coffeehouses for
the disaffected youth. And
here, 'Death to Weeds' - that
was made by Dow Chemical in
1946 to show off that miracle
new pesticide, DDT."

It's probably obvious that
the films in the Prelinger
collection aren't exactly
your big-screen Hollywood
pictures. Prelinger has a
fascination with what he
calls the "bastard genres,"
the thousands of promotional,
educational, and industrial
films created to whip up
consumer frenzies, educate
the school kiddies, and train
employees to flog company
products more properly.

Fascinated with these lost
gems, Prelinger has spent the
last 20 years locating,
obtaining, and preserving
whatever films he could get
his hands on, buying out
preprint materials from
out-of-business production
companies and old reels from
school districts and, in at
least one notable case,
liberating a substantial
number of films from the
storage closet of a retired
film director in Fort Wayne,
Ind.

"There are so many of these
things out there, and many of
them were made with high
production values, yet no one
ever sees them," Prelinger
says. "On one hand they're
hilarious, yet on the other
they're an incredible
documentary of both the way
things really were as well as
our ideas about the way
things were supposed to be."

Case in point: The splendid
"Once upon a Honeymoon," a
1956 AT&T film in which an
enraptured wife sings about
the wonders of color
telephones. "It's nice to
have a telephone / To blend
with my new drapes and home,"
the housewife trills,
whirling beatifically around
her magically remodeled new
home in a fluffy pink
gown. Then there's the 1957
gem "The Relaxed Wife," a
Pfizer-sponsored love letter
to the wonders of its Atarax
tranquilizer. "Unless you
were at the Pfizer trade show
in 1957, you wouldn't get to
see 'The Relaxed Wife,' "
Prelinger says.

Until now, that is. Prelinger
is well on the way to meeting
his goal: putting digitized
copies of 1,000 - out of the
thousands of films in his
collection - online, free for
the public to access and
use. Anyone with the tech
equipment and savvy to visit
Prelinger's online archive
(housed at
www.archive.org/movies) can
download the movies, sample
them, use them for classroom
study, run them at theaters,
or even use the footage to
make a for-profit film.

It's a rather shocking
contrast to the Bettman
Archive's approach to
preserving history, and it's
particularly surprising
considering Prelinger makes
his living selling footage
from the films to sources
such as Biography, VH1's
Behind the Music, and the now
defunct series Mystery
Science Theater
3000. However, Prelinger's
free-for-all Internet gambit
illustrates a possibility
never imagined by traditional
archivists: free access to
important historical archives
that doesn't wind up ruining
the collection.

The archivists' conundrum

Whether they work at museums,
national foundations,
libraries, or elsewhere,
traditional archivists have a
difficult gatekeeping
function. They have to make
sure the public doesn't
damage historical materials
by touching them,
photographing them, using
them, or whatever else might
be necessary to study them.

"Rare materials, particularly
older materials, are so
fragile," says David Rumsey,
and he should know: his
enthusiasm for maps and
mapmaking has led him to
collect about 150,000 rare
maps, atlases, surveys, and
other cartographic documents
in the course of more than
two decades. His documents,
mostly from 18th- and
19th-century America, are
fascinating relics that show
the limited understanding of
geography we had even just
300 years ago. He has a 1731
pocket globe that shows
California as an island.

Rumsey understands that these
historical treasures are
better seen than read about -
but display carries with it
the danger of damage. "When
you touch them with your
fingers, the oils in your
hand can damage the surface,
particularly with paper, and
exposing older materials,
photographs especially, to
light can be quite damaging,"
Rumsey says.  Which is why he
has allowed only those with a
genuine historical interest
in pieces from his collection
to thumb through the
thousands of items stashed in
his San Francisco home.

"I did a lot of my learning
about maps by going to
libraries like the Bancroft
Library at Berkeley, where
I'd fill out a pink slip at
the reference desk, get my
two or three items at a time,
and go pore over them," he
says rapturously. "And
getting the chance to view
the originals was so
wonderful - the smell of the
old paper, the decaying
varnish used on old wall
maps."

But Rumsey understood that
just by bringing his maps
from their dusty storage spot
and exposing them to light
and touch, he was putting
them at risk. He couldn't
bear to see the pieces in his
own collection undergoing the
same risks.  So despite his
desire to share his
collection, he kept it mainly
under wraps while he worked
at finding a solution.

Traditionally, archives have
handled the preservation
versus access conundrum in
one of two ways. The first is
the museum approach: visitors
are allowed to view
historical and artistic
documents and objects, but
the objects themselves are
kept under glass or behind
velvet ropes, restricting the
sensual, almost mystical
experience of actually
touching an object. However,
as many museums have found,
providing a space for
visitors to view their
collections is prohibitively
expensive: items must be
specially preserved and
displayed, staff must be
hired to watch over them,
space must be bought or
rented and maintained.

The second, cheaper approach
is the reference library
model championed by most
archivists and typically
found at universities and
libraries. In this model,
such archives are kept
carefully away from public
eyes and hands. Often, those
who wish to view the
materials must have some
sanctioned scholarly reason
for doing so; mere curious
looky-loos are discouraged,
no matter how sincere they
might be. And even those
archives that let practically
anyone view their contents
often insist that visitors
make viewing appointments,
arrive during certain hours,
fill out lengthy forms
requesting access, and view
only a few objects or
documents at a time.

It's no wonder Prelinger
terms this kind of access
"needlessly restrictive." To
complicate matters still
further, archives typically
don't advertise their
presence. Though Berkeley's
Bancroft Library actually
provides fairly liberal
access to its collections,
the average person would have
no idea of the treasures
contained in the Bancroft
Library, which include, for
example, Alameda land records
during the period of 1836
through 1931, Mark Twain's
private papers, original
materials from the
Haight-Ashbury district
during the 1960s, and more
than three million historical
photographs of California and
the West.

"Pieces of our collective
history are rotting away in
museums and libraries and
universities with very few
people seeing them or even
knowing they exist,"
Prelinger says.  "Archivists
are caught between wanting
members of the public to see,
appreciate, and learn from
the amazing artifacts in
their collection and worrying
that giving them that access
will ruin the collection and
piss off the foundations that
support their existence."

But, as Prelinger, Rumsey,
and others have learned,
there is a middle ground, and
it can be found online.

Look Ma, no hands!

Before the Internet,
archivists had no truly
effective way of displaying
their wares. Even creating
museum space fails in certain
respects: people who wish to
view collections still have
to travel to visit the
museum's real-world space.

One of the World Wide Web's
greatest powers is as a
distribution
network. Prelinger has
created a single online
archive of his films,
admittedly at great expense
and effort, that can be
accessed by virtually
anybody, anywhere, at any
time. A person in Angola can
download "A Is for Atom" and
use excerpts for a television
show, while at the same time
a Midwestern school kid is
viewing a copy of footage
from the 1939 New York
World's Fair for a class
project.  And neither of
these uses will hamper future
visitors from using the
collection.

"The key is making
collections digital," says
Brewster Kahle, the archivist
visionary behind the Internet
Archive
(www.archive.org). His
archive's purpose is to
preserve and provide access
to copies of just about every
site on the Internet, from
the time the archive was
launched in 1996, right up
through all the pages yet to
be launched in the future. So
far the archive has collected
more than 40 terabytes of
material. To put that in
context, if you saved all the
text of all the books in the
Library of Congress in ASCII
(or text) form, it would take
up about 20 terabytes.

"In a digital age civic
institutions no longer have
to choose between
preservation and access,"
Kahle says. "You can provide
free access that doesn't
damage materials."

Creating a digital collection

Viewing a digital copy
doesn't degrade the original,
and that's part of the reason
why so many archives are
jumping on the digital
bandwagon. Yale, New York's
Museum of Modern Art,
Cornell, Stanford, the New
York Public Library, and
other entities are each in
various stages of projects
intended to present pieces
from these institutions'
substantial historical
archives online.

But making digital copies
doesn't come cheap, nor is it
easy.  In fact, turning
actual objects into digital
representations is a
laborious procedure that
often must be done by hand
and at great expense. The
Internet Archive, which
funded the digital
transformation of the
Prelinger Archives and
provides the online space for
them, has spent about
$200,000 to turn reels of
film into compressed .avi and
.mpg files. Rumsey, the map
collector, has spent more
than two years and thousands
of dollars building a
customized computer
workstation and carefully
scanning thousands of paper
maps into the digital
archives, freely available at
www.davidrumsey.com.

Even when materials arrive in
digital form, cataloging,
organizing, and maintaining
files is tremendously
time-intensive. Just ask Rita
Rouvalis, who maintains the
Etext Archives
(www.etext.org), a collection
of tens of thousands of
e-zines, political texts,
fictional works, and
religious texts. Founder Paul
Southworth began collecting
work in 1992, and ever since
he turned the archives over
to Rouvalis in 1993, she's
spent her free time archiving
and keeping the collection up
to date.

Why does she spend her time
on a task that's unpaid and
often thankless? Quite
simply, she sees herself as a
historian. "Rants and zines
and other independent
literature tend to
disappear," Rouvalis
says. "It's out there for a
month piled in a bookstore or
handed out at a reading, and
then it's just gone. We
wanted to create something
permanent."

But electronic archiving
remains expensive,
time-consuming, and not
without its legal dangers.
Archivists who keep material
in dusty old files in
university basements don't
need to worry about violating
copyright laws. But those who
publish online must have an
exquisite sensitivity to
those laws and be careful not
to reproduce anything not in
the public domain.

Witness the cautionary tale
of Eric Eldred, the man so
enraptured by digitizing rare
books that he took on U.S.
copyright laws. His case,
Eldred v. Ashcroft, has
dragged on for more than two
years, eating up tremendous
resources as Eldred and
attorneys from Harvard's
Berkman Center continue to
seek changes in copyright
law. Meanwhile, Eldred
himself has developed
repetitive strain injuries
and doesn't do as much
electronic publishing these
days. He's still digitizing
rare books to distribute at
his Eldritch Press site,
though, which exposes him to
potential criminal penalties
of up to five years in
prison.

"Is this the reward you get
for thinking the Net could be
used for more than just
distributing porn?" an
embittered Eldred asks.

But despite these drawbacks,
digital archivists remain
committed to their defiantly
noncommercial task and
devoted to the notion of
making important historical
documents - or at least
digital copies of them -
available to all. To many, it
seems that only by putting
materials online can
archivists attend to their
dual duties, both preserving
originals and allowing free
access to their digital
copies.  Seeing these
reproductions may not be
quite as fascinating as
touching and holding the
original historical objects,
but it seems like the best
possible solution right now,
and it's one getting more
popular every day.

"The last time somebody tried
to collect all the text in
the world was the Library of
Alexandria, and that burned
down," Kahle says. "We're
building a memory of cultural
artifacts, and we're
preserving the material in a
way in which it can't
degrade, can't be lost, and
can be viewed by anyone with
Net access. With this memory,
with this documentation,
we're assuring ourselves that
revisionist historians can't
control the past, that no one
can control our memory of the
past, because it's right here
for anyone to see."

Huh?  Morality and respect for life are values.  Anything capable of
valuing and of 
valuing life/existence is capable of holding those values. Anything
capable
of appreciation of otherness, difference and samenewss is capable of
companionship.  There is no reason an AI would not experience/have
any of these things.

It was a theoretical point that I was making... infinity or not infinity. A
big number, like 10^10^10^10 years, is not infinite, and maybe we could do
that? But forever is really long... I'd be surprised if you could show that
the probability of any given individual surviving does not approach 0 as
lifespan approaches infinity. I expect that I'll be toes up, or something
approximating that, eventually. I'm just not in any rush.

Well, back in the 70s I thought I could get computers to do most of the
heavy lifting 
so I went out to learn computerese.  I was shocked that there were no
applications
remotely capable so I became a programmer.  Then I was shocked there
were no languages
sufficient so I got into computer languages.  Then there were no
database systems capable
and or friendly enough so I got into database systems, program
environments and so on.
Eventually I was getting pretty lost in the bits.  Finally I began to
see some light at
the end of the tunnel with the possibility of exponentially increasing
computer hardware
power, self-writing or self-improving  programs and linking with the
machines or pulling 
them within or joining them.  I'm still hacking at it.  Ask me in
another decade or so. :)

Deserving is not the right question.  If it is of value to other 
sentients sufficiently and the cost of its preservation is low
enough relative to its value then it will be preserved.

What I meant by my comment above is that I don't consider this
particular
bundle of personality traits, memories, impulses, desires, cares and
so on as something that I am that driven to preserve indefinitely.  I
am driven to preserve the capacity to be, to learn, to know and to
continuously
recreate beingness, valuing, enjoyment, learning and so on.  To me it is 
a difference between the packaging and the contents if you will. 

I certainly hope to chuck a lot of the meat packaging some day and along
with
it a lot of attitudes and proclivities and limitations that came from
and are
bound up in this here flesh.  Does that mean that *I* ended or did *I*
change packaging,
leaving the old package behind like a discarded torn party dress of
yesteryear?

Why would I want to avoid  evolving to where one particular
packaging is not around any more?  Why would infinite re-runs of this
particular
me package be such a great thing? Just because I am no longer running
this particular package
does not mean that *I* am no longer existing at all.  Are we to turn the
solar system 
and more into computronium simply to run endless "I Love Me" episodes or
endless simulations
of our past packagings and points of view?  That doesn't seem
particularly meaningful. 
Although I can see where it might be great fun for a while, now and
then.

Please do get into the sociology of people turning themselves into robots...
I'm intrigued to understand your point of view.

I've wanted to become one myself, ever since I saw the cybermen when I was
about 5, on Doctor Who (and Davros, my hero). Nowadays, experiencing early
degradations in my physical state, I'm more resolved to it than ever. I'm a
bit kooky about it... I don't care how weird, and "unnatural" it looks; in
fact, a bit of freakiness is a bonus to my mind.

Something more? Maybe,

How do you know you are not such already? :-)

Seriously, I love being human too. Being human is excellent. My point of
view is that the truly natural progression for humans is to advance our
tools, and inevitably to merge with them. We are the ultimate creators and
manipulators, and there is nothing wrong with us turning those natural
predilections inward. It is an entirely human impulse, and its exercise is
as natural a course of action as any I could imagine.

The urge to explore, discover, to know? The urge to create? The urge to
reshape the universe as we see fit? I can't see that in changing myself
through advanced technology, that I would lose any of those fundamental
drives, unless I so choose. Where, then, has my humanity gone?

Think of it from another angle... Take an altered human, vastly altered, who
is over 100 years old, for example. Perhaps it's the cliched humanoid robot.
Perhaps it's the human-in-the-sim. Perhaps it's an uploaded mind,
distributed over a swarm of nanomachines, speeding away from the solar
system and across the void.You may talk about loss of humanity all you like,
but what is the "natural" alternative? Death. A dead body has no humanity
that I can point to; it is the opposite of human. As we are the very
definition of animate, so is our corpse the negation. Thus, an altered
human, a transhuman if you will, in retaining any humanity whatsoever, is
vastly preferable, even by your own metrics.

I think unaltered humanity has been done to death, if you'll pardon the pun.
I'm up for something else. It could end up being a stupid idea, to be sure.
It could all go horribly wrong! But I'm a bit irrational... I'm only human,
after all.

How will we know when we're ready, 'gene? What does it *mean* to be `ready'

I'm not aware of "Gaia fantasies" ... could you educate me please?

My knowledge of Gaia-ideas is from nonlinear physics and chaos theory,
that is: feedback loops, self-regulating systems, etc. and yes, I've read
James Lovelock. Isn't Gaia considered a large complex and deeply
interconnected system (Earth), where the physics, chemistry, biology, etc.
each have their important role to maintain a particular balance?

BTW, One of my favorite "interdisciplinary books: about Gaia-ideas is:

So, do you think no Power will ever learn to change the shape of
spacetime or blow
their own universe when this one gets too s-l-o-w?   The shape of the
universe at
present need not be a reason to dismiss Tipler's ideas completely.

It doesn't seem in the least likely to me since I believe
that valuing other sentiences grows out of intelligence rather
than being a matter of being born out of a biological stew.

I think this is one of the BIG issues for any transhumanist ethics to
answer. 

My own position would be that any system with sufficient level of
ethical subjectness would have the right to its life, including of
course the integrity of its own mind. Hence beyond a certain point we
must ask our AIs permission to modify them.  What medium a being is
implemented in does not change its ethical status.

Note that being an ethical subject is a slight cop-out: I still need to
define it. For the moment let me just handwave and say it implies the
ability to rationally change behavior as a response to new information
(that is still rather loose, but defining the details is a whole thread
in itself). Basing rights on self-awareness, ability to experience pain,
consciousness or genetic makeup is too arbitrary, as we can imagine
systems lacking these but still behaving in ways that would be viewed as
ethical. 

There are borderline cases when we deal with entities that are not fully
ethical subjects but quite close to it, such as children, deranged
people and half-built AIs. In this case partial rights may be necessary
as other entities are allowed influence over the first entity in order
to safeguard its personhood and development, but it is a whole
thead in itself how to best handle that.

At least it is falsifiable.

Hmm, topological theology - the science of what gods and moral systems
are possible in spacetimes of different topology. "Oh, this is a
non-orientable universe, so dualism is not consistent. But the genus is
sufficiently negative to enable deontological ethics, at least in a
linearized sense."

I wouldn't put it in so absolute form, but guessing that you're not

Well, we do have parts of NEMS, especially those derived from 
graphenes. Have you missed the jack-in-the-box electrostatic
linear actuators, which are made from concentric buckys and 
use van der Waals forces as springs to pull back what you
protracted with a potential? That was flashy, as was the 
selective fractionation of bucky batches through electric
pulse lysis of metallic fraction of the tubes, while transiently
biasing the semiconducting fraction into isolators.

While still expensive, production of buckys is being rapidly scaled
up due to their anticipated use in high-end structural materials.
Now buckys are relatively large molecules, but they're molecules.
It doesn't take a Merkle to realize that you can probably use a
MEMS microfab to fractionate these things (not necessarily 
destructively) with sufficiently high processivity for practical
use (desktop device with a throughput of gram/hour, scalable to
larger sizes).

Maybe this isn't the catholic bootstrap route, but that was
exactly my point. The vein's so rich you get showered with emeralds
wherever you dig.

Strictly speaking, we do know that machine phase exists. It's just
a fancy version of what biological enzymes do, after all. I can
cite you paper and verse, people have been doing chemistry with
the crude proximal probe tools we have. The question is, is the
repertoire of mechanosynthetic reactions sufficiently rich for a
structure to be able to deposit a copy of the structure itself?
Given how much we found poking around so little, the answer seems
to be a tentative yes.

But do we need machine-phase self-rep capable nanotechnology? Sure,
it would be nifty. But computronium built with self-assembling
molecular electronics is accessible with classical chemical and 
biological means already.

There are two disparate issues at stake here: hardware and software.
Moore is about integration density, and will be going for about a decade,
and then after that, because people have finally started doing R&D
into molecular electronics in earnest. I don't know why it took two
decades to realize that's a worthwhile goal, but the train is picking
up steam, finally.

A less widely known law indicates that the ROI on transistors as
measured in CPU performance has started to run into diminishing 
returns. The reasons are many, and most of them architectural. This is
a good thing, because it states that sooner or later people will
be forced to abandon the current axis of impetus, and explore a
hitherto negliged side alley. The results of this architecture change
will result into dramatic improvements of real-world performance
from the same amount of transistors.
 
Incidentally, this architectural shift should take at least a decade,
and coincide with the advent of molecular electronics. This is even
better, because the new architecture due to their orthogonality, small
grain size, scalability and intrinsic self-healing (through adaptive 
reconfiguration) capabilities will allow even primitive molecular 
electronics to be rapidly deployed.

The software issue. Well, the software issue. I do not expect
anything from the mainstream. Comp. sci. people, software engineers,
that's you. Sure, algorithms will be translated into circuits --
a desktop version of what silicon compilers are doing now. If you
undust your wizard book, you'll see how it's done -- it's not hard.
Swapping out pages will swap out circuits, not code. Crunch will
fall out of the bunghole, and be used for fancy dumb robots.

None of this will suffice to create naturally intelligent machines,
who're smart enough to be able to compete with us.

Well, we do have smarter mice, and smarter worms now. People are about
to sequence the chimps, and look at the delta in gene expression in
their brains, so I wouldn't be betting on a timeline. But given 
how long it will take until the technique is validated, morally approved,
widely deployed and results into more IQ points for the average child...

The other fields should be noticeably quicker on the time scale.

What I mean is to reduce the vulnerability.

There are reasons to suspect that AI is easier to do than an upload,
and that it will emerge relatively explosively, maybe even in a
catastrophic fashion -- the manmade Blight scenario.

The reasoning goes as follows: the capabilities of hardware progress
much faster than capabilities of orthodox (human) software design.
This causes a growing underutilization of hardware, particularly 
exacerbated the impending restructuring of computer architectures 
towards fine-grain reconfigurable computers, and the impending advent of
molecular electronics, and world-wide deployment of such hardware,
well interconnected by photonically switched networking, while
running buggy, bloated pieces of man-made code. A brain the size
of a planet, potentially.

The moment somebody creates a darwin-in machine method to utilize
above infrastructure much, much better, and uses it to breed 
an AI core, and -- either deliberately, or accidentally releases 
the thing into the network, we've got a large problem on our
hands. Very soon, we're no longer in control. Soon after, we
might be dead, as a simple side effect of the new ecology's 
metabolism. It probably happened before, it's just the molecular 
moieties bicking the bucket were incapable of reflecting on their 
fate while busily being restructured by the new kids on the block.

In contrast to this, an upload is hard. The brain doesn't have
a clean, abstractable architecture from a human point of view.
So you're forced to do neuronal emulation, plugging in 
neuronanatomy and computing its dynamics at a rather low 
level of theory. This makes it slow, and power hungry. Many 
orders of magnitude separate such a first target upload from 
an AI running on the same substrate, because the AI has evolved 
a highly efficient encoding and means of processing on that 
substrate. It hugs the substrate very close, instead of 
something cloaked in layers over layers of legacy virtual 
machines, which go back to what people designed in the middle 
of last century.

The situation is not hopeless, because a better encoding can be
developed, using more abstract means such as statespace dynamics
instead of numerical crunching electrochemical spikes propagation 
along pieces of squishy stuff, which some large, complicated 
digitized by disassembling your frozen noggin. The problem is 
it, we have very little idea how to do it, and it will take a 
while before we'll figure it out, and by the time it will become 
an option for people to converted into this after their death, 
or before, if we thoroughly debug and streamline it. As I said,
uploads are hard. It will take a while.

This doesn't mean everybody is going to jump the train, some
will choose to remain on the platform, but eventually the train
will start to move, unfortunately dramatically restructuring
everything in its wake, the platform included. Unless we chose
to drag the remaining dawdlers and renitents in against their 
will, kicking and screaming, they'll probably going to die. 
It's a tough choice: is their choice informed? Do we have to
respect their wishes, or assume they're just being difficult,
and upload the heck out of them (of course, you can still leave
them the choice; telling them: you're a virtual model now.
You've got a day or two to decide whether you like it, then
we're giving you the choice to terminate yourself).

Convergent evolution says at this stage we'll become indistinguishable 
from the AIs, so we're removed the threat of mass extinction by 
becoming indistinguishable from the threat in a more or less smooth
course of development.

This is iffy, because the uploaders who're ahead in the conversion
process might grow impatient, and unwilling to wait for all the 
dawdlers, in which case we're dead meat, too. All hail to the new
master race, the stupid buggers.

Is Extropians, also, a collective intelligence?

Collective intelligences are large, sparsely connected,
recurrent neural networks, whose "neurons" are "reinforcement
learning" algorithms.

The distinguishing feature of collective intelligences is that
their dynamics involves *no* centralized control, but only
the collective effects of the individual "neurons",
each modifying their behavior via their individual
"reinforcement learning" algorithms.

This restriction holds even though the "goal" of the collective
intelligences concerns the system's global behavior.

So we must assume, essentially, no knowledge concerning the dynamics
of the full system.

And this rules out any approach that models the full system.

In a perfect collective Intelligence the *local* utility (function)
must be initialized, and updated, without centralized control,
so that as the "neurons" improve their utilities, *global* utility
also improves. 

But, for a perfect collective intelligence, an additional condition
is required: that the "neurons" do not frustrate each other
as they attempt to increase their utilities !
(That's why the human economy is not a collective intelligence).

ed., "Handbook of Agent technology" - AAAI Press & MIT Press, 1999.)

You make a hidden assumption here: that the jump in software
quality/capability/whatever is very sudden and not gradual. Is there any
reason to believe that is true?

I agree with your sketch of the hardware/software gap, but it is not
clear to me that improvements in software must always be less than
improvements in hardware until the fateful quantum leap. Right now it is
cheaper to throw more hardware on slow algorithms and operating systems
than to improve them, but that might not always hold. For example, if we
assume nanotech is delayed a bit we will run into a period where Moore's
law temporarily slacks off, and a big economic incentive to utilize the
hardware better appears. Similarly, once we have full nanotech it is
hard to do any better other than go for more parallelization, which
anyway requires quite a bit of paradigm shifting in programming.

But are perfect collective intelligences relevant? What is needed is
good enough collective intelligences, not perfection.

This came out yesterday.  I'm surprised no one on the list posted it.
Anyhoo, I think this is the way nanotech will take off -- i.e., by
applications that are mundane and not really directly nanoassembler related.

IBM breakthrough for making chips with nanotubes
 from http://www.electronicstimes.com/story/OEG20010430S0041

IBM claims to have made a technological breakthrough that could allow the
use of alternative materials to silicon in the production of high
performance chips.

Researchers, from the company's Watson research centre, have developed a
fabrication technique, which could be the key to producing industrial
quantities of nanotube transistors.

The biggest problem with producing large quantities of nanotubes has
previously been the inability to control their growth.

The IBM method, called constructive destruction, removes unwanted metallic
nanotubes from the wafer while leaving unharmed semiconducting nanotubes.
These can be used as field-effective transistors (FETs).

This process is faster than the nanotube production method used today, which
involves growing the tubes one by one.

The research paper outlining the process was published in this week's
Science. In the article, the IBM researchers have broken down their approach
into five basic steps:

1  The scientists deposit ropes of "stuck together" metallic and
semiconducting nanotubes on a silicon-oxide wafer.

2  A lithographic mask is projected onto the wafer to form electrodes (metal
pads) over the nanotubes.

3  These electrodes act as a switch to turn the semiconducting nanotubes on
and off. Using the silicon wafer itself as an electrode, the scientists
"switch-off" the semiconducting nanotubes, which essentially blocks any
current from travelling through them.

4  The metal nanotubes are left unprotected and an appropriate voltage is
applied to the wafer, destroying only the metallic nanotubes, since the
semiconducting nanotubes are now insulated.

5  The result is a dense array of unharmed, working semiconducting nanotube
transistors that can be used to build logic circuits.

IBM hopes to get the technology to a point where it can be used in
mainstreame chip manufacturing within three years.

Well, at least E. O. Wilson would.  But when you say "type",
you're introducing a subtle shift in the argument.  I doubt
if even E. O. Wilson would claim that every individual of
some obscure species of Amazon jungle ant need be preserved.
Two conspecifics of a particular ant species just aren't
that different.  So pop some randomly-chosen handful of ants into
a Dewar of liquid nitrogen, if you must, and don't worry if
you step on a few other ants in the process.

I remember seeing somebody (I'm pretty sure it was Eliezer)
comment that, as far as human personalities are concerned,
there's probably only a surprisingly small number (on the
order of a million, I think was the offered guess) of distinct
human memetic "types".

I imagine it wouldn't take a lot of data to blend up somebody
a lot like Jim F. at the personality paint store.  Garden-variety
mid-20th-century style American middle-class background (in
other words, economic circumstances better than the vast
majority of contemporary human beings), only child, rather
timid and introverted (maybe genetic, maybe because he was
the somewhat premature Caesarian first child of a mother
who was almost past child-bearing age), modestly gifted
intellectually (140ish IQ).  Then throw in the DC comic books,
the squirt of Arthur C. Clarke, the dollop of J. R. R. Tolkien,
_The Outer Limits_ and _Star Trek_, a little Bertrand Russell
for seasoning, and voila!  OK, so maybe nobody else remembers the
particular house in Shavertown, Pennsylvania where my grandparents
lived in the 60's, or Gelbach's Diner in Reading where we used
to stop on the way to visit them.  But there were a lot of
awfully similar elderly couples, houses, and diners.  Which
of these differences makes a difference worth preserving, in how
much detail? (I know that's an unanswerable, purely rhetorical
question).

So yeah, it would be one thing to be preserved as a
random example of the "type" of the human species, perhaps
in some post-holocaust alien-rescue scenario like
Octavia Butler's Xenogenesis books, or to be chosen
as a zoo-specimen by an alien E. O. Wilson
scientist/collector as in Gregory Benford's _Eater_.

But how many of us can really objectively believe that we
embody a pattern so unique and valuable that we couldn't
be replaced by one of the other six billion humans on
the planet (or some pattern synthesized from the "types"
they represent) without making a dent in the history of the
Cosmos?  That's not to say it wouldn't be fun to be along
for the ride, but that's different -- it's a question of,
well, entertainment.

Well, the Webmind AI Engine really is more naturally oriented for a
massively parallel hardware substrate, than for a von Neumann computer.  The
2000 implementation, which implements mind as a distributed agents system
with billions of interacting software agents, has proved too inefficient on
current hardware/software, but on a massively parallel substrate you could
to it easily, without the nasty workarounds we're currently introducing.

So, the paradigm shift introduced by the move to massive MIMD parallelism
may be problematic for some types of software engineering, but for AI system
designers and engineers with the right conceptual perspective, it'll be a
huge breath of fresh air.

Bring on the nanocomputers already...

I agree. But progress is usually made with baby steps, not jumps. When the needs
are demonstrated, the solutions will follow. Hardware is very conservative ---
many have been burned by providing something that was eventually not supported.
Practically nobody will throw a technology on the market without knowing how it
will be used. Even fascinating technologies such as FPGA are marginalized,
because they're too radical. And in any case, before you implement something in
hardware, it has to be simulated and demonstrated in software.

An interesting challenge is how to work well with architectures such as CA's.
Right now it seems that they're used either as a machine code equivalent for
logic expressed as "traditional" serial code, or for evolved computational
circuits. It seems to me that a new generation of significantly more
sophisticated tools are required to take advantages of notions like heuristics
or modules.

I generally agree. The main dilemma is how many heuristics should people
provide -- on one hand there might be genetic algorithms, on the other
hand-coded "intelligence". My position is somewhere in between, as I believe
yours too.

Minsky had a nice way of saying it, something along these lines: if natural
evolution of intelligence took 200 million years, common sense and reason might
take far less. The quest is for the most efficient approach (thus realistically
feasible), not the simplest theoretically feasible.

Again, it's a question of efficiency, and the trade-off. We will see who gets
there first.

But read carefully at what point and for what purpose was I referring to
"guardians."

I do not quite understand what you mean here. Could you explain?

Even we monkeys have multiple layers of behavior control, some are reflexive and
fast, others are reflective and flexible.

Of course I made a hidden assumption. If assumptions were recursive
macros you'd have to expand fully, posts would take a day to write,
and bore the majority of targets to tears. I'm a bit worried that
the sometimes highly compressed (depending on lots of hidden state
built up over course of many years) communication style the more 
seasoned participants here have come to adopt, make communication 
appear like a sequence of non-sequiturs, or, worse, as semantic
line noise to newcomers. If true, this would seem rather sucky.
So, natch, I forgot to expand. Your namespace seems
to have a different prefix, that's why you failed to expand it ;)

I'm extrapolating the peristance of the trend from past history 
(the last four-five decades, only two-three more yet to go), 
and lack of awareness of the problem set. The field, still
being rather young, has settled into rather heavy dogma already. 
Holistic approaches are being actively deprecated, since breaking
abstraction's usability. Lunatic fringe approaches, some of them
extremely fruitful on the long run do not receive the attention
they deserve, because appearing sterile on the short run. I could
go on, but I think that part of the problem is for real.

We do not have many datapoints as to amplitude of the growing
performance gap between the average case and the best case,
but current early precursors of reconfigurable hardware (FPGAs) 
seem to generate extremely compact, nonobvious solutions even
using current primitive evolutionary algorithms. The result is
a curiously stable negative and positive autofeedback coupled 
oscillators. The whole is rather opaque to analytical scrutiny
and sterile to human attempts of constructive modifications by
manual means. We can only use the results as building blocks for
hybrid architectures (which also require man-made glue that is
immune to noise and nondeterminism -- we haven't even managed
to do that much yet), and for ingridients for other evolutionary 
recipes.

Interesting enough, a few days ago a news message on transhumantech
(by Brian, I think) heralded we're to expect essentially strongly 
CA-flavoured FPGA hardware (think 2d computronium implemented in
silicon photolitho) in about five years. Now while I would 
compensate for the Nippon bias (the usual pattern of good idea, 
lousy first implementation, early termination of project), the 
hardware constraints which lead to that architecture are for real, 
and eventually bound to resurface either in other product lines, or
become accessible when we'll get our desktop nanolitho printers
for circuit prototyping and small-scale production, which should
be in about 15-20 years. We should see a big resurface in innovation
in then, since vastly lowering the threshold, by making small scale
prototyping affordable to individuals, even hobbyists.

Since it's trivial to extend current compilers to generate
code for above targets, and the runtime for many algorithms
suddenly soars by several orders of magnitude on the same
raw acrage of transistors, it effectively hides the remaining 
deficit, so there is no motivation to address it, unless the 
lunatic fringe manages to reach high-output result regime, 
causing everybody to drop whatever they've been using, and 
rush over there, babbling excitedly all along the way. In 
case this happens we won't of course see above explosive scenario.

I see two major driving factors for the punctuated equilibrium
(the Jack-in-the-Box-Golem) script: the positive autofeedback of
the mutation function, and the hostile takeover of the computational
resources of the global network.

The reconfigurable hardware is not the product of a coevolution,
so it reacts very brittle to use of the bitspray on existing designs
as attempt to improve it. So the early fitness function, which
hasn't learned to dance around the potholes of the substrate yet, 
will produce only good results on small blocks, essentially 
bruteforcing solutions by stepping through large areas of the 
hardware configuration space. If you sift through a lot of bits
with a slight bias, you'll sooner or later find a sufficiently
good solution.

However, real-world mutation is anything but blind, and as soon
as someone has burned enough computational cycles evolving the
mutation function itself, it will suddenly start becoming much 
better. If you just do something stupid, as building this fitness
function into a dumb Net worm, and release it into the wild,
it will bring down the Net, because it will discover most of
the holes in the protocol layers, which are legion. That's a
rather radical global debugging session, and it will bring most
of the world's economy to its knees (this is no hyperbole,
since we're not talking about the current situation), until the 
Net will be sufficiently patched to become operable again. 
The worm will be sufficiently subdued to become stealthy 
(becoming a more adapted parasite, or even a symbiont), and 
with time can even be incorporated into the network protocols, 
becoming a lot like an immune system, coevolving with the 
informational ecology (worms, and viruses, oh my).

This is a very favourable scenario, especially if it occurs
relatively early, because it highly hardens the network layer
against future perversion attempts by virtue of establishing
a baseline diversity and response adaptiveness.

Things only become bleak when you use your mutation function
to (ominous music, lots of hardware boxes standing in a room
in a mountain castle, coolant mists wafting, enter Igor in 
a white lab coat) create a BRAIN! MUAHAHAH! I  can  make  a
Brain!!!

I don't know how hard it is to create a nucleus, and at which
stage it is still safe to escape into the Net (a chimp would
do a lot more damage than a rodent), but I would strongly
suggest not to try the experiment.

This is possible. It is hard to predict what will happen, but given
that embedded RAM designs -- not even FPGA-flavoured architectures
haven't begun cropping up in the roadmaps yet, and that most programmers
don't get parallel programming (who here has heard of active messages?
hands up), it seems that people will build fat CPUs with slow
external RAM, than figure out how to get the last little bit of
performance from that by optimization, before turning to the 
alternatives, and realizing that they have to throw away essentially 
all the tools they've grown to love and depend on. Schadenfreude,
what a wonderful word.

Given human inertia, this will take a long time. My crystal
ball is in service right now, but I do expect 2d molecular 
circuitry by then, soon ramping up to multilayer, and then 
going 3d molecular crystal in a more or less organic fashion.

Yes, I recommend any programmer who's interested to take a good look
at MPI (there's MPI1, and MPI2, the most recent standard). It's
going to stick around with us for a long time, and is already very
useful if you're into high-availability and high-performance 
clustering (a bunch of PCs running a *nix, connected by FastEthernet
or Myrinet, a rather expensive high-end networking standard). A core 
subset of MPI should scale to very large relatively fine-grained 
systems of medium future and to their emulations in molecular 
circuitry. Check out "Parallel Programming with MPI" by Peter S. Pacheco
(Morgean Kaufmann publishers).

I'm wondering if there are problems that have not been recognized
yet, in fact I have a candidate, GERD. I had never even heard of it
a few years ago (Gastro-esophageal reflux disease) and am
surrounded by people who seem to be diagnosed with it on a regular
basis. I know dozens of people on medication for it.

I've had every test you can imagine, and they can't find a cause.
Since it's not immediately life threatening, and is controllable
with medication/diet/exercise there doesn't seem to be a rush to
find an answer. Yet there is an "outbreak" in the growing number of
new cases, and this just in the last couple of years.

Guess what else's new in the last couple of years?

I think this is just the continuation of a healthy lifestyles
movement. The trend for a long time has been the freshest food,
prepared simply, with the best taste, highest nutrition, lowest
calories possible.

The biotech industry would be wise to follow this trend.

I see this as a good thing.

Oracle's Ellison seeking Fountain of Youth
He spends millions on anti-aging quest
BY MATT MARSHALL
Mercury News

Centuries after America's early explorers searched in vain for the
fabled waters of the Fountain of Youth, the second-richest man in
the world has joined the hunt.

In hopes of stopping the process of aging, Larry Ellison, the
brassy 55-year-old chief executive of Oracle, is quietly pumping
millions of dollars into research and other investments. He's now
the single largest private supporter of research in aging, and he's
opening the spigot further.

Ellison's efforts come at a time when interest in age-related
research is booming, spurred by breakthroughs in science that could
soon promise billions and perhaps trillions of dollars in profits.
Behind that interest are the aging baby boomers, the large number
of people born in the prosperity that came after World War II, who
have hit or are nearing their golden years. Few embody the
preoccupation with age more than Ellison.

``Most people accept early on that they will die,'' said Ellison
biographer Mark Wilson. ``But part of Larry Ellison is saying if
he's smart enough, he should be able to beat it. . . . Death is
just another kind of corporate opponent that he can outfox.''

Ellison and Oracle declined to comment last week. But in a previous
speech, Ellison said the cost of health care for an aging
population ``will literally bankrupt the nation,'' and that the
boomers, including himself, are a ``demographic sword of Damocles''
hanging over the necks of younger generations.

Scientists generally agree that human life can be extended, but are
divided about how much. Optimists hope a breakthrough in the next
30 years will extend human life to 150 years or more, but
conservatives believe life will be extended slowly, as a side
effect of regenerative drugs.

The investment community is taking note.

Steve Jurvetson, a partner at the venture-capital firm Draper
Fisher  Jurvetson, is scouting out ways to get into the field. He
believes that within 30 years, people will live 120 to 140 years.

His partner, Tim Draper, has invested privately in a Sunnyvale
firm, Layton Bioscience, which is refining a process of cell
regeneration to cure brain damage after a stroke. Layton CEO Gary
Snable said the work is directly applicable to extending age. This
week, Layton is expected to close a $30 million round of funding.


Generating big money

Big-name venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers has invested
in  publicly traded Geron. And Peter Friedli has invested in Osiris
Therapeutics, which works with adult stem cells.

This month, Friedli joined Oracle to invest in Myriad Genetics,
which researches the human proteome. It is Oracle's first foray
into biotech.

However, researchers say Ellison's money is the most crucial
because itseeds research at the earliest stages.

``Ellison's money has been extremely important,'' said Thomas
Johnson, a University of Colorado geneticist who is trying to
extend the lifespan of mice.

Ellison has shown a lifelong fascination with science and age.

Born to an unwed mother in 1944, Ellison was adopted by relatives
and raised in a middle-class Jewish home in Chicago. A friend's
father, a chemical researcher, became a role model. Ellison applied
for medical school but never went.

Ellison later met Nobel laureate Joshua Lederberg. They schmoozed
most of the night at Ellison's villa in Atherton, talking mostly
about biotech, Lederberg said. Lederberg then invited Ellison to
his lab for a two-week ``vacation'' handling DNA in strains of
bacteria -- ``so he could get his hands dirty,'' Lederberg said.

Ellison's adoptive mother died of cancer when he was in college. He
said later that he didn't tell anyone about it for years.

Later, Robert Miner, co-founder of Oracle, also died of cancer at
52. Ellison pretended Miner didn't have cancer or wouldn't have it
for long, according to those close to him.

``He was getting to an age when he was feeling vulnerable,'' said
Lederberg. Ellison insisted on keeping Miner on the payroll,
according to Wilson's 1997 biography, ``The Difference Between God
and Larry Ellison.''

``Dad and Larry were both into living forever, the Fountain of
Youth kind of stuff,'' said Nicola Miner, his daughter, in the
Wilson biography. ``I think that my dad's illness really freaked
him out. My dad always said that Larry had a hard time facing his
own mortality.''

When Ellison was told of Miner's death, he reportedly demanded
proof.``It doesn't make any sense to me,'' Ellison later told
Wilson. ``Death has never made any sense to me. How can a person be
there and then just vanish, just not be there? Clearly the reason
they're not there is they're off doing something else. Like Bob
was. . . . Death makes me very angry. Premature death makes me
angrier still.''


Obsession with youth

Every aspect of Ellison's life is youth-oriented, Wilson said, from
physical fitness and a penchant for carrot juice to a love of cars
and women and a nose job at an early age.

Some say his obsession with youth has spilled into the workplace.
Ellison is being sued for age discrimination by Randy Baker, a
former Oracle executive. Baker, who is 55 -- the same age as
Ellison -- contends Ellison made several derogatory comments about
age and older workers.

Baker was demoted, replaced by a manager who is about 40, and then
fired. Ellison's attorneys would not comment on the pending case.

Ellison's investments into age research have slowly grown. He
funded research at the University of California on DHEA, a hormone
some believe could retard aging. Through his private venture fund,
Tako Ventures, he has made investments in several other biotech
companies.


Centenarians studied

One was Aeiveos -- named after Greek words for ``forever'' and
``young'' -- founded by Robert Bradbury, an early employee at
Oracle. Aeiveos studied the genetic codes of centenarians, those
who live to the ripe old age of 100 and more.

But soon it became clear that without a basic scientific
breakthrough, profits were elusive, observers said. Ellison
installed his former employee to run the company despite little
knowledge of the field, some said. Bradbury, a Harvard dropout, is
an Extropian, a group of believers in the idea that genetic
engineering will prolong life.

``I find it intriguing,'' said Johnson, the scientist, ``that Larry
Ellison  was bankrolling them, but unlike his astuteness in running
computer engineering, he ignored people who knew what was going on
in the field he was funding.''

Ellison has committed $20 million a year to aging research through
a newly created Ellison Medical Foundation. As of January, the
foundation is investing $45 million a year, $25 million of which is
to fight global infectious disease.

Ellison put Lederberg on the board, and recruited another big
player: Richard Sprott, former director of the Biology of Aging
program at the National Institute of Aging.

Sprott said Ellison is ``hands-on'' in funding decisions. But some
say Lederberg and Sprott have reined him in.

`I think Ellison is more interested in the radical stuff,'' says
Max More, president of the Extropy Institute, who has kept close
tabs on funding in the field.

The foundation funds scores of academics studying aging, to get
them to the stage where government or venture-capital funding can
take over.

Several of the researchers Ellison has funded are now seeking to
turn profits. One is Cynthia Kenyon, who extended the lifespan of
worms 300 percent. She has teamed up with an associate of Arch
Venture Capital, Cindy Bayley, to form a company called Elixir.

Meanwhile, profits or no profits, the world -- and Ellison -- will
have to be patient.

``Even if the Fountain of Youth is discovered,'' Lederberg said,
``it will be 10 years before anyone got any benefit.''

I think that's very premature, given that we can do *neither* universal,
nor even broad, mechanosynthesis *and* that all mechanosynthesis
requires decidedly macro machinery.

We do need mpsrn for the nanoSanta which will solve all our problems.
Nifty new computers would be nifty new computers but they won't
build houses for everybody on earth.

We have created computers which can do some very limited parts
of human thoughts, such as voice recognition.  For this reason,
given Moore's law, I think it's *possible* that human-equivalent
AI could be created in 20 years or so.  I wouldn't bet the bank on
it though.  I wouldn't bet the bank *against* it either.
This differs from proximate nanotech or significantly mentally
enhanced people, which I would bet the bank against.

I know you're joking, but there's nothing defeatist in saying progress
will go on for some time to come, that we personally won't be
obsolete in the next few years, or that nanaSanta's not on our
doorstep.  That's my concept of practical optimism; there are a
lot of great things under development; things can improve over the
next 20 years and more after that.  It's counterproductive, however,
to *expect* very improbable miracles; it'll throw off your discount
rate.  You'll end up doing suboptimal stuff.
 
If we had machine-phase nanosynthesis or computers that could 
write good papers I'd be singing a different tune.  Someday we
probably will.  But today we don't.

Researchers at MetaPhore Pharmaceuticals have used computer aided design 
techniques to achieve a hundred-fold increase in the catalytic activity of 
one of the company’s synthetic manganese-based compounds previously shown to 
exert protective anti-inflammatory effects in animal models.

Consistent with your attribution of partial rights, these borderline cases
retain the right to remain silent, they have the right to sing the blues, and
the half-natural right to influence those who handle these issues. (ô¿ô)
Near-term, expect to find ourselves dealing with the escalation of
"relinquishment" into restraint, suppression, and curtailment. Cybernetics
does, after all, derive from the idea of control. To succeed, to prevent
runaway evolutionary phase transition, "relinquishment" requires universal
enforcement. The International Bureau of Robot Meme Control will necessarily
enlist robocops much more sophisticated than Echelon or Carnivore, don't you
think?

We do not need intelligent computers to develop solutions to the worlds
problems.
We already know what they are. The devil is in the details getting people to
work
together in the achievement of those goals. When that happens we would have

at the Singularity.

The "outbreak" of GERD is due to having expensive new drugs to treat it.  
You've heard of it before when it was called "heartburn".  Hard to
get insurers to pony up for that :-)

Too true, Samatha, because not everyone is going to be a ''lazy-bones' and 
let the universe do whatever it chooses. In fact from an evolutionary point 
of view, our ' purpose ' in the universe may be to 're-start it'. Arthur C. 
Clarke had one of his characters speculate this, in his novel, Songs of 
Distant Earth.

I posted two or three news items yesterday, and enjoy it when others do so. 
Thanks for posting this one, Daniel. I didn't post it partly because I was 
in work mode and partly because it seemed like an interesting but 
incremental breakthrough.

I'm curious to know if most List subscribers like to see alerts to 
important developments posted to the List. I am assuming they do. Feedback 
on this is welcome. In the absence of substantial feedback, I will continue 
posting these kinds of items and encourage others to do so. It adds plenty

Onward!

Serial psychos are said to be unusually intelligent. Also, it seems 
the greater the gap in intelligence, the less value the thing on the 
high end ascribes the things on the low end. for example, rank in 
order of value/respect: bacterium, cockroach, toad, mouse, dog, 
monkey, human. Many humans place the value cutoff at the human line.

Where will an AI draw that line, hmm..?

Hi,

I enjoy news items, as well as non-news (well-written essays, humor, references
to good online resources).   It's difficult for any single individual to track
more than one or two fields at a time, and I enjoy it when someone posts some
unusual/interesting development in a field that I wasn't even aware existed.

It would be nice if there were more server-side, web-based filtering options.
For example, although I think a significant fraction of the list is interested
in business news, many probably aren't.  It would be nice if there were a way
that individuals who didn't want business news could set up a server-side
killfile that prevented titles with TECH or BIZ from being sent to them, or
posts from particular individuals.  Sometimes I don't have a lot of time, and I
don't want to read all of the posts, but I also don't want to miss posts by
people who almost always have something interesting to say (Max, for
instance).

Server side filtering might also provide some useful statistics--for exampe,
would those who post one-liners + lots of quoted text do so if they discovered
that 90% of the list had put them into their killfile?    Sophisticated
client-side filtering software exists of course, and for those with inexpensive
flat-rate connections, these work fine, but I'm sure that those who pay
per-minute charges would prefer not to have to download the unwanted posts
before they filter it.

Chris

Actually, what I said was that if you mapped human personalities into a
configuration space, there'd probably be relatively tight clustering, and
that the number of clusters would probably be a million or fewer.  That's
just a guess, BTW.  I'd also add that the number of *large* clusters would
probably be a thousand or fewer.

Your paraphrasing is acceptable, so back to the program.

Personally I would prefer that all news gets (at a minimum) posted to
transhumantech@yahoogroups.com. If your news does not have a transhumanist
context then you shouldn't be posting it here or there. I would prefer
that the only time news gets posted here is if the poster wants to start
a discussion about it.

Transhumanists don't study genetics to understand how it works over the
millennia.  We study genetics to learn how the programming works so we can
hack our own code today.

Imagine if we could hack our code to become immortal, immune to disease or
instantly smarter.  That would have an impact.

There has been a long history of cross-over between nutrition and
Christiandom.  I believe that in this context, life-extension is merely an
extension of nutrition.

There's another difference between this Earth and an Earth in which we
have been replaced by six billion arbitrary humans - the latter Earth has
undergone a major extinction event which violated the rights of six
billion individuals.  Even if the future outcome is more or less the same
(which it almost certainly would be, from a high-level perspective), the
total history of the latter Universe is less desirable.

Yes, I certainly read the alerts/news items.  I appreciate the immediacy of

	Because they are my friends and family.  My parrents are

	And it sucks to lose loved ones (everyone) even if you are the
winner.  Sometimes I wonder if being militarrist about it would
justify the ends and being able to save the mentally ill people that
think they know what they want, when in reality they are grosely
mistaken.

	Perhaps some day (after millions of years?) we will become
true Gods, even with the ability to resurrect those that "lost" to
evolution and primative deathist memes.  I can emagine them comming to
after having been finally resurrected, realizing what they mist out on
for those milions of years, and being very mad at us for not being
more forcefull and insistant that they not make such stupid mistakes
as to no choose cryonic suspension...

This is basic statistical and measurement technique.  However, the author is
right that these basic methods are screwed up much of the time, even by
scientists.

One of the issues with this question is whether the problem even exists.  It
may or may not be true that people use radically different self-rating
scales when asked to rate their internal feelings on a scale from 1 to 10.
They might be radically different, which would invalidate much research, or
they might be radically similar, which would not invalidate much research.
There is a real possibility of a problem here, but it is not confirmed.

I would also like to point out E. Michael Perry's book Forever, For All,

Amara,

I meant that fantasizing that Gaia equates to a god awakening to the sound of
all phones ringing, or a Global Brain of the anthropomorphic kind, or an
autonomous alien intelligence, or a meta-human entity that thinks, such
fantasies about Gaia can happen now. Gaia doesn't put feedback loops to
intelligent use, or the Singularity would have happened (or maybe it happened
and we missed it?). Didn't we cover this a couple of years ago?

ô¿ô

Stay hungry,

--J. R.

Useless hypotheses:
 consciousness, phlogiston, philosophy, vitalism, mind, free will, qualia,
analog computing, cultural relativism

     Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
     but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.
     (Everything that can happen = more than anyone can imagine.)

Hi Aleks. Trouble is, if you ask the average software developer whether
he'll need three order of magnitude faster computers, and he'll look at
you askance. For many of them computers are plenty fast already.

Yes, the debacles are many, and well documented. Shrinking profit margins
make for highly risk aversive R&D.

The problem is high prototyping costs of modern hardware. It is the
pipeline setup time if you're running a new design through the fab. 
Modern foundries can't afford to goof around with outlandish 
architectures. They're trying to keep the production capabilities 
saturated with cash chips, and gather whatever profits there are 
left for the war chest, i.e. legal battles, economical maneuvring 
and putting the rest into surefire returns, such as developing 
your next line of products, in structure shrinks and touching 
finishes on core logic. Nevertheless, judging from the job alerts 
of a single foundry (I track Infineon), they're gearing up to do 
a lot with embedded RAM designs, and preparing for nonvolatile 
memories. 

More minimal cores like StrongARM do dominate the deep embedded
market, and they're seeming to be considered as good candidates
for very large clusters due to their better OPS/Watt performance,
as well as handheld (->wearable) market. Google has just doubled 
their capacities to include 8 k nodes. At this cluster sizes 
footprint, energy consumption and air conditioning costs become
the biggest numbers on the budget, apart from people, of course.

Message passing hardware support is moving into next generation
of consumer processors (AMDs HyperTransport), so things do move.

There are two principally different ways of implementing CAs in hardware:
as embedded RAM, or hardwiring the individual cells. Embedded RAM implementations
optimize for cell density, and allow you to use higher dimensions, allowing
you to use e.g. 3d lattices with their shorter average distances, and
more space to lay around the signalling pipework. But they're relatively 
slow, because they're updated more or less sequentially. Hardwiring the 
individual cells gives you blazing speed, but limits you to the plane.

Hardware CAs are sufficiently lunatic fringe that I would attempt to make 
them accept silicon compiler output with as little tweaking as possible. 
I.e. use registers, wires, and blocks of logics mapped to the CA grid, 
with the benefit of deterministic, quantized signal behaviour.

Of course this is grave substrate underutilization, but it gets your foot
into the door. And once foundries output these wafers, you can introduce
variations (use more or less state per cell, change the rule, change
the neighbourhood) with much less costs, and allow you tailoring for
other paradigms entirely, without not changing the hardware visibly.

I'm actually pretty much at the extreme side, pro using as much GA 
messiness as it is humanly possible. The modularization (which is 
clearly present in biological systems) should emerge naturally, and 
not be human meddling handiwork. It might be funny to submit human 
designs into the genetic soup, though, and see what might evolve.

I'm all for the practical approach, but the product of skills, time
and hardware at my disposal doesn't allow me to do anything funky.
Perhaps I should wait for these desktop nanolithoprinters I mentioned.

Apologies for the flippant comment. I thought you were a strong AI adherent
such as Eliezer. I was referring to the time when I read Elaine Rich,
Hofstadter and Minsky, and all kinds of weird AI journals, and believed 
their approach was not sterile. This was about 15 years ago. Then I got
a bad case of cellular automata, complexity, resulting in processing of
lots of dead tree labeled with Fredkin, Toffioli, Holland, Koza, Kauffman, 
Wolfram, and their illustrous ilk. I still haven't recovered yet. 
I'm looking for other infections material, but so far haven't found
much. Maybe I've become immune, that would be a pity.

Absolutely. But we don't have kLoCs inside us, nor sequential threads of control
(funny that consciousness should seem to absurdly sequential to introspection),
and generally do not suffer from privilege violations. I think computers should
be more like monkeys, not the other way round.

TOWARD A THEORY OF HUMAN ERROR
by Frederick Mann

Feedback appreciated!

POTENTIAL ORIGINS OF HUMAN ERROR

The first thing to realize is that some errors have survival value.
Consider a human a thousand years ago. Fifty yards from him
he perceives what he believes to be a tree stump. He goes
closer. It turns out to be a bear, which charges and kills him.

A second man perceives what he believes to be a bear. He's
actually mistaken; it's a tree stump. He takes evasive action
and removes himself from the scene. He suffers few or no
bad consequences for his mistake.

If primitive man mistakes a bear for a tree stump, he tends to
die for his mistake. However, if he mistakes a tree stump for
a bear, he suffers few (if any) negative consequences, and he
survives.

So, erring on the side of safety has survival value in certain
environments and areas of life. (See 'Faces in the Clouds:
A New Theory of Religion' by Stewart Guthrie
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195098919/qid=988736874/sr=1-1/ref= 
sc_b_2/107-3519305-4017345>.
See also: 'Anthropomorphism and Related Phenomena'
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl05ab.shtml>.)

John F. Shumaker has propounded the theory that certain aspects
of nature (random accidents, brutality, death) are too frightening
for most humans to confront. By distorting reality with myths, they
enjoy "greater peace of mind and body" and tend to live longer.
I've heard that people who regularly go to church tend to live 5-10
years longer than those who don't go to church. Another case of
error having survival value? (See 'Wings of Illusion: The Origin,
Nature and Future of Paranormal Belief'
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0879756241/qid=935359080/sr=1-3/002- 
8544952-6361852>
and 'The Corruption of Reality : A Unified Theory of Religion,
Hypnosis, and Psychopathology'

8544952-6361852>
by John F. Shumaker.)

There may also be biological origins of human error. The "triune
brain theory" claims that the human brain evolved in such a way
that the modern human brain actually consists of "three brains":
a primitive reptilian brain, a more evolved but still primitive
mammalian/emotional limbic system, and a modern neocortex
or thinking brain. Under certain conditions of stress and/or real
or perceived threat, the more primitive brain structures tend to
take over control, sometimes resulting in irrational behavior.
(See 'The Dragons of Eden : Speculations on the Evolution
of Human Intelligence' by Carl Sagan
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345346297/qid=988738613/sr=1-1/ref= 
sc_b_2/107-3519305-4017345>
and 'Human Brain & Human Learning' by Leslie A.
Hart, Karen D. Olsen (Editor)
<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0962447595/o/qid=988738921/sr=2-1/10 
7-3519305-4017345>.)

The human biological reproductive/sex drive may lead
to errors of "thinking with the sexual organs!" (See
'The Breeding Motivation: What You Can Do About It"
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl05aa.shtml>.)

There are two basic ways to acquire the wherewithal
to survive: 1. Produce and exchange; 2. Steal. There's
also a principle: Obtain the wherewithal to survive with
the least effort.

If certain powerful humans can induce the weak to adopt
certain erroneous beliefs and habits, rendering them "easy
marks," then the powerful can acquire the wherewithal to
survive from the weak with relatively little effort, and without
having to produce and exchange. Historically, it was a case
of, "Bow down, call me King, kiss my feet, and pay me your
tribute, or I'll have your head chopped off!" The "independent
rebel spirits" tended to be killed off, while the obedient,
submissive, genuflecting victims tended to survive.

As a result, modern human culture includes many memes,
which if accepted and acted upon the way most humans
do, bestow great advantages to those "above the memes"
and great disadvantages to those "below the memes."
(See 'The Anatomy of Slavespeak'
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.shtml>.)

Conformity is also a factor. In primitive tribes, if you didn't
conform so as to be "like everybody else," you risked being
kicked out, most likely leading to an early death. The conformists
tended to survive and the nonconformists tended to die off.

Unfortunately, some of what most humans came to conform to
were and may now be errors that became deeply instilled cultural
habits, which some modern humans may find difficult to question
and analyze. As an example, many humans ingest, as directed
by deeply instilled cultural habits, substances that eventually
cause bodily harm and early death. (This area is particularly
difficult to analyze rationally, because the consequences of
ingesting certain substances are immediate "good feelings,"
while the harmful long-term consequences sometimes become
manifest only after years or even decades of self-abuse.)

Certain industries reap huge financial gains by propagating errors.
As an example, tobacco companies earn billions by promoting the
erroneous smoking habit.

Certain "professionals" (such as medical doctors and lawyers)
command a great deal of power, money, and respect to the extent
that their customers are ignorant and error-prone. The economic
interest of many "professionals" is for their clients to be so ignorant
and error-prone that they often need "expert" assistance, but not
so ignorant and error-prone that they die too soon! -- the longer
the victims can be "milked," the better!

In evolutionary terms, the neocortex is a relatively new development.
Humans haven't had much time to learn to use it to best effect. So
we are prone to a host of logical errors in our thinking. Because of
the conformity factor, humans who share the same thinking errors
tend to band together and expel those without their errors (or with
different errors!)

Philosophers such as Gurdjieff, Ouspensky, and Rand have indicated
that most animals automatically develop to achieve their full potential.
Humans are different in that we need to make a deliberate effort to
develop our minds and bodies correctly. Lazy conformists who don't
make this special, deliberate, continuous effort to develop their minds
and bodies tend to stagnate in errors of relative mediocrity.

AREAS OF LIFE WHERE HUMANS ARE PRONE TO ERROR

In my opinion, humans generally are most prone to error in the following
areas of life:

* Diet and exercise -- Many humans habitually, culturally, and erroneously
eat and drink harmful substances; many lack proper and sufficient
exercise.

* Religion -- Superstitious memes proliferate and pervade many human
minds.

* Politics -- Superstition abounds. The deepest erroneous political memes
are in my experience much more difficult to correct than their religious
counterparts, to which they are related.

* Economics -- About 90% of businesses fail during their first year. Many
humans have personal financial problems because they are relatively
ignorant and error-prone about money.

* Relationships and sex -- In some parts of the world, about 50% of
marriages fail. Some human couples (and their families) "fight like
cats and dogs." (Maybe the "marriage" meme has become an error
-- particularly considering the risk of having to pay for alimony and
child-support, in case of divorce!)

* Education -- To the extent that the powerful (who seek to acquire the
wherewithal to survive with least effort) control education, they are
likely to "shape" education to produce relatively helpless, ignorant, weak,
error-prone, obedient workers and worshippers who suffer from their
errors and often need "professional services" and "welfare assistance."

Like most normal people I've had heartburn a time or two, in fact
like most electricians I've known, I used to get it so often that
we walked around with a pack of Tums in our pockets at all times.

GERD is completely different, the first and second times I had a
severe attack I went to the emergency room positive I was having a
heart attack, the second time because I couldn't believe it was
"heartburn". I ended up in a cardiac ward overnight, and had to
take a stress test (all normal). I was very sick for months after
both episodes.

Nope, GERD is something completely different and it can be very
severe, it's not uncommon for sufferers to aspirate acid into their
lungs, which will cause you grief like you wouldn't believe. Long
term sufferers can develop asthma and esophageal cancer from it.

The strange thing is that they don't really know what causes it,
The leading theory was that for some reason the lower esophageal
sphincter doesn't maintain proper pressure, but many of the most
severe cases (like mine formally) have a completely normal LES.

Endoscopic exams (many) have revealed nothing unusual, except what
appears to be mild gastritis. I've participated in a couple of
studies, and the researchers admit they don't understand it.

Nor is it H Pylori.

The thing that got me curious was that a researcher said it looked
to him like I was having a reaction to an unknown substance.

And yes, you can use Prilosec to treat heartburn, and very
effectively.

There has been a large backlash against revealing security problems.  Even
legitimate software testers are afraid to comment on their findings.  People
are being sued to suppress truthful statements.  In many cases, companies
rather suppress publicity than fix the problem.  There is a big legal,
moral, and PR question about whether known bugs should be discussed or
documented publicly.

Getting the latest news and intelligent comments on technology and related
social issues is the key benefit I receive from this list.  I subscribe to
several other lists for the same reason, so I often see items duplicated
three or four times. For me, skimming the messages and repeatedly hitting

Chris used to be a full-human-presence-on-Mars-as-soon-as-possible

But accordiing to Freeman Dyson, why go to Mars at all? Stay
at Antartica ...

(from "Warm-Blooded Plants and Freeze-Dried Fish", November 1997,
Atlantic Monthly)
http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97nov/space.htm

[paragraph begins with a description of the "Mars rock"]

"The evidence that these traces [of life in the Mars rock] have
anything to do with biology is highly dubious; we cannot say on the
basis of it that life must have existed on Mars. These traces are
important for two other reasons.

First, if we are seriously
interested in finding evidence of life on Mars, we now know that
Mars rocks on Earth are the most convenient place to look for it.
Instead of waiting for many years for an expensive sampling mission
to land on Mars and return a few small chips of rock to Earth, we
can find a supply of bigger chips lying in Antarctica, where
meteorites accumulate on the ice and are freely available.

Second,
these rocks show that if life was established on Mars at any time in
the past, it could have been transported to Earth intact. In the
first billion years after the solar system was formed, when Mars had
a warm climate and abundant water, asteroid impacts were much more
frequent than they are now. Mars rocks fell on Earth in great
numbers, and many Earth rocks must also have fallen on Mars. We
should not be surprised if we find that life, wherever it
originated, spread rapidly from one planet to another. Whatever
creatures we may find on Mars will probably be either our ancestors
or our cousins."

Ayn Rand seemed to have a reasonable segmenting of the different levels of
thought that may apply to this. She broke it down to 3 levels.
Sensation: The experience of receiving input directly on a nerve cell, and
when the stimulus is gone, so is the perception. Bacteria and very simple
critters rely on the direct stimulus and react method.
Perception: The experience of taking multiple sensations and being able to
integrate them into the understanding that there is a particular "thing"
that one is observing (the cumulative input into your eye, from all those
rod and cone cells turns out to be "rock", "tree", "car"). Dogs and Cats
generally live at this layer.
Conception:  The experience of taking perceptions and understanding that
there are similarities between certain entities that can be categorized and
classified. This is where we go from "rock" to "a family of objects I call
'rock', of which this is simply just one particular instance", or concepts
like love, bravery, etc.... Here's where us humans and AIs live.
I don't think many people would argue that baser animals exist on the
conception level (although a few tests have show that some chimps make a
good play for it at times). Unless someone could prove that there is another
level of consciousness above the conceptual, then the AI will ALWAYS be on
the same level as us, and only differ in scale and speed. Sure you can say
they MIGHT develop something new, but that's speculation and not based on
fact.
If its this easy to draw lines about consciousness (except for the chimps),
I'm sure an AI would have NO problem developing a system of classification
as such. It would be hard pressed to draw lines based on processing speed
and memory though. Is the AI going to say to the less intelligent AI,
sorry... you don't classify as intelligent just cause your running Pentium
3s and I'm using Pentium 4s? And I'm not going to try and sidestep dealing
with the issues by saying 'Well, I'm not an AI so I cant make any
intelligent predictions on what an AI might do', sure ya can. Remember,
conception is the top of the food chain, unless someone has PROOF otherwise.

They're not just springs. They're linear actuators. They protract when
you apply an electrical potential, due to Coulomb forces, and pull 
back due to attraction of (weak, short-range) van der Waals forces 
between the concentric graphite sheets, within few 10 ns. That's 
right, there's not much mass to move, so even little forces acting 
over short periods of time move stuff *fast*.

Think of them as telescoping tubes with a regulation knob. By 
tweaking the knob and thus applying the voltage, you can 
regulate the protraction amplitude. Very fast, very elegant.

The main point is that a common chemical you can produce in kg
quantities in a statistical process contains components which
can be used as nontrivial parts for a molecular machine. I sneered
at C60. Silly molecule. No good for nothing but structure
fetishists, who drool over anything even slightly sexy
geometrically. I become interested, when it exibited a
rich chemistry. I become rather interested, when buckytubes entered
the scene. I'm now getting more and more impressed by graphenes
by the year, and since recently by the month. This class of molecules
has such a richness to it, it might be enough. Reactivity dependant 
on curvature, resulting in being useful for highly inert ducts. 
Mechanical properties to rival diamond. Thermal conductivity to 
give diamond a good whacking. Ballistic electron transport over micron
distances. Metal, semiconductor or isolator, dependent on chirality
and doping. Can tolerate absurdly high current densities and field
strenghts without going up in wisps of smoke. Transistor action
demostrated in T-junctions. Processing of nanotubes by current
pulses demonstrated. Mechanical manipulation of nanotubes by 
proximal probe demonstrated. A certain company from Texas does nifty
6DOF manipulators for buckys. Buckys are superconducting.
Buckys are highly sensitive to adsorbed material. Buckys sing,
dance, and throw confetti. Buck nekkid buckys win the sexiest
molecule of the decade award.

And I'm not tracking the field that closely. That's just a random
list.

So it's good for structural material, logics, ducts, mechanosynthesis.
Did I already mention that I was highly impressed by graphenes?
 
> I think that's very premature, given that we can do *neither* universal,

Of course it's premature, I wouldn't be saying that in a paper.
It's just my personal, private opinion. Nevertheless, if I was
in the nanotechnology field, I know what I'd be working on right
now.

Of course they're macro, we're in an early bootstrap phase yet.
The next step would seem to use the smallest MEMS you can get,
and hybridise it with invidual molecules, and try what you could
build next. It is important to realize that there is no sharp
boundary between MEMS and NEMS, they are a continuum. We already
have MEMS parts which resonate mechanically at quite a few MHz.

You're of course aware that the Bradbury/Forste/Leitl faction

Very lousy voice recognition. Very very bad machine vision. In fact 
I need reliable machine vision right now for a project of mine, and
I can't get it. It still bungles, and requires manual intervention.
It sure saves lots of manual works, but it needs a monkey in

Given that the state of the art in software development doesn't
move visibly, and that the complexity bareer still exists, I
don't see how anybody could hope to sit down, and explicitly
write down an AI.

Why are you focusing on a smart entity to create smartness? You 
don't need that. Evolution is pretty damn stupid, and it did

I'm currently involved in a substantial software development project much of
which is written in Python. Originally most of the code was C/C++ with bits
of Perl, Python, shell scripts, etc. (It's for the Unix platform.) Over the
last year or so, we've been switching as much as possible to Python. As an
ancient software guy with lots of experience on all the major platforms and
with lots of development environments, languages, and what have you, my take
is that our conversion to Python has been a very pleasant experience (just
as we anticipated would be). I believe Python is well-suited to sizeable
software projects. As you would expect, the overall process is much more
productive (and more fun!) than doing similar jobs with C/C++. The main
downside to use of Python, as with any "dynamically-typed" language, is that
few errors are caught at compile time, but must be found at run time. So
it's a good idea to do plenty of coverage-oriented testing. Of course, even
strongly-typed languages don't catch everything at compile time either --
it's a matter of degree. But, all in all, Python gets a big thumbs up from
me and my co-workers in the context of our product. It's definitely not just
for quick hacks -- it is a serious development tool. Of course, be aware
that Python not as fast as C (yet it is not a slouch either), so that would
be a factor in making the choice.

Now -- about Ruby. I have recently become aware of Ruby, and I REALLY LIKE
IT! Although we are not scrapping our Python code to rewrite it in Ruby, I
have pretty much switched over to it for my personal stuff. Even though
Python is a nice, clean language, Ruby is even cleaner. It's a step closer
to what Python wants to be for Python 3000 that Python is now: a "pure"
object oriented language rather than a hybrid. And most of the things that I
find rather annoying about Python are done right in Ruby. As a small
example, to read lines of a file, the idomatic code is:

Python 2.0   (can you cite another language that requires 4 lines of
overhead to read lines?)
  while 1:
    line = file.readline()
    if not line:
      break
    <process the line>

Python 2.1    (finally! -- better, shorter, but wierd!)
  while line in file.xreadlines():
    <process the line>

Ruby      (uses a general language feature (that Python does not have),
rather than a special purpose, rather hacky, technique)
  while line = file.gets()
    <process the line>
  end

On use of Ruby for large projects: Ruby seems to have all the software
engineering goodness that Python has, so I would think that Ruby and Python
would be in the same ballpark for big development.

Contrasting Ruby and Python:
  - Python is older, more mature, and has more 3rd-party support.
Object-orientedness seems to be an afterthought. Shortcomings in
expressiveness require excessively verbose code in some cases.
  - Ruby is pure object oriented, has a extremely well-chosen set of
language features, in my experience is very solid, and even more fun to code
than Python. 3rd-party stuff is not as extensive as Python's yet, but there
is already quite a bit and its growing.
  - In many ways, the languages are surprisingly similar. Converting
existing Python programs to Ruby is really easy.

In summary, both are excellent languages, suitable for substantial software
development. I am glad to see the growing interest in Ruby, because it
deserves be noticed as a worthy alternative to Python, Perl, etc.

I'd be thoroughly dissapointed if people stopped posting news items to the
list. On this list I catch the more obscure bits and pieces going on, and
thought provoking, interesting, and funny discussions often spin off from
them. The list would lose one of it's main methods of sparking interesting
threads if people stopped posting news.

As an addendum, I would even suggest that it might be possible to
come up with standard cultural and heuristic models for behavior
and personality, then simpy add the unique tweaks that describe a
"me" versus a "you", add to that, the persistent stories of my life
and the concerns that shape my particular instantiation of human
being, and POOF, you should have a pretty good facsimile of that
personality I call "ME".

Strange... at some level that just isn't at all what I'm interested in
having survive.

I don't consider my "self", my personality. Just as I don't consider
my "self" my body. These are things I have, part of the price of
admission to play this odd life game. But there is a something I
experience as deeper, more fundamental that the stuff which I
sport about. That is my being, my capacity to be, my passion
to be, my joy and profound desire to be, the context that is at
the heart of all the things I become, I do, and then produce.

I have little attachment to the stuff of me, I have great attachment
to the source of me. That is what I would preserve, what I would
promote, and ultimately what I want to take to the stars. The
dance itself is lovely, but it's that ability to dance, the full
expression
of which is devine.

Yet another gem from "The Land Canaan" has to be the track "Fallen".  An 
utterly beautiful piece, capturing the personal sorrow of mortality and 
death.  A melody of the purest melancholy.  As I listened I found myself 
thinking of loved ones I'd lost....

On subject of art in general, I wonder how a Transhumanist "Blue Man Group" 
would fare?  Gotta be a better use of talent than selling transistors ;)

Anyone game for some facepainting?

Dunno.  See how many of those same developers will give up their current model 650mhz
+ workstation for the Pentium 2 200 mhz machine they had around a year ago.  I bet you
won't get many takers.

A friend of mine has the theory that the rise in desktop machine speed was actually
driven by bloated stupid languages like C++ used on large projects.  The engineers
needed faster and faster machines to get more than one build or update done a day. :-)

Fred Reed would agree with you:

Marriage, Bubonic Plague, And Infected Warts
If You Have A Choice, Go With The Warts
By  Fred Reed

If I could offer a young man one piece of sage advice, it would be this:

Don't get married.

Don't do it. Come the divorce, as come it probably will, the courts will
systematically shear you of your children, your house, and huge amounts of
your income for twenty years. Don't do it. It isn't worth it. Nothing is.

My saying this usually brings, from women, cries that I'm an extremist or
woman-hater. No. The problem is not women, but the courts. Men can behave
every bit as reprehensibly as women, though they go about it differently. But
the judicial system, which is politicized to the gills, utterly favors women
over men in divorce cases, without remorse, decency, or concern for children.

Should you doubt this, read, before you pop the most foolish of questions,
>From Courtship to Courthouse by the divorce lawyer Jed Abraham.*

Writes Abraham, "If you're like most men, you're married, or you hope to marry
some day. You think you deserve to live happily ever after, but if things
don't work out that way, you'll get a civilized divorce and move on. You'll
stay pals with your ex, and you'll see your kids as often as you want.

"You have no idea what you're getting into."

And you don't. Not the faintest freaking clue.

A few facts from Abraham:

"The odds are 50% that your marriage will end in divorce. The odds are 70%
that your divorce will be filed by your wife. The odds are 80% that your wife
will get custody of your children-plus child support, alimony, and/or a hefty
chunk of your property."

That is how it is.

Yes, I know: You don't think this applies to you. Cup Cake loves you. She
would never behave in such a way. Think again. You have no conception of the
hatred that divorce engenders. Men are callous; women are mean. When a family
breaks up, when a life dreamed of disappears in flames and emotions go limbic,
women are not the kinder sex, and certainly not the more rational. And Cup
Cake will have the absolute upper hand, with the full power of the state to
help her express her dissatisfaction with you.

Abraham: "If your wages are not withheld and you fail to pay your child
support, the State will garnish your pay, slap liens on your property,
intercept your tax refunds, report you to credit agencies, discontinue your
driver's license, suspend your professional and business permits, hold you in
contempt of court, put your face on a wanted poster, throw you in jail, and
deny you food stamps. But if your ex doesn't spend that very same support on
the children, the State will do. . . nothing."

It gets worse. There is, for example, "imputed income." This means that your
child support will be based not on what your children need, not on what you
earn, but on what the court decides you could earn.

Don't do it.

If you love Cup Cake, live with her. Be kind to her. Be loyal to her. She may
be as nice as you think she is: Many women are. Buy her roses. Just don't
marry her, or have children with her. If the laws were even-handed, marriage
would be an admirable institution. The laws aren't equal.

But it's the kids she'll use, should things get nasty, to tear your guts out.
If you're sure that Cup Cake won't do this, you're crazy. True, she may not.
Not all women do, or not to the same degree. But you won't know until it's too
late. And the courts will do anything she wants.

Abraham: "Your ex will warm to calling all the shots. She may cancel your
visitation now and then. If she's truly mean-spirited, she'll go much further.
Under the cover of her court-appointed role as sole custodian, she'll
systematically sever your relationship with the children. She'll badmouth you
to them. She'll schedule their extracurricular activities during your
visitation time. For good measure, she may accuse you of domestic violence and
child abuse."

Think "joint custody" is the answer? The courts won't enforce it. What are you
going to do-sue Mommy? The kids will hate you for it. Do you believe in
pre-nups? The courts ignore them. Read Abraham. It's all there.

Then, says Abraham, there's the killer: "More efficiently, your ex may simply
move with the children to a distant community, with the law's acquiescence."

Kids are the crunch, guys. They hurt. And she will know it, and use it. The
courts will help her. At bottom, the position of the courts is that the
children are her property, like furniture. Judges don't care about you at all.

Ever drive away from what used to be your home, with your daughter of four
streaking across the parking lot, yelling, "Daddy! Daddy! Please come
back!"-and you can't?

Ever have your little girl of four say, "Daddy, can I get my birthday present
early?"

"Why, Pumpkin?"

"Well. . . after the divorce we might move, and I won't see you again."

That's what you are in for, guys. Don't do it. You'll be suicidally depressed,
miss your kids to the point of desperation, be almost frantic-and the courts
will make sure you can do nothing about it. The ex will probably enjoy it.

That's the reality. Don't believe it? Talk to men who have been there.

Why do women do these things? Not because they're evil. Cup Cake is probably a
perfectly decent woman in her dealing with the rest of the earth. She'll do it
because she hates you, which is the normal outcome of a divorce. She'll do it
because she can. She's furious because the marriage didn't work, which will be
entirely your fault.

And the law gives her every incentive: She will get the house, the kids, the
child support-and she knows she will. If women knew they had an even chance of
not getting custody, of having to pay child support, the divorce rate would
drop like a prom dress and joint custody would suddenly mean joint custody.
Women love their children as much as men do.

But that's not how it is. The courts encourage divorce, and they rape men. Get
used to it.

Abraham: "The odds are it doesn't pay for you to marry and have kids."

That's a fact, guys. Think about it.

Huh?  A non-conscious event like a ten kilometer meteor causing a very bad
day for all, cannot be called a rights violation.  There is no conscious
actor.  And this has nothing to do with the point being discussed anyway.

But then, I may have lost what the point is as it has taken a couple of
turns.

Personally I don't like the wording and concept of "preserving" human
beings.  Nor do I think of personal immortality as requiring preserving this
particular current personality matrix or body.   As I said earlier I see it
more as a preserving of the experiencing essence (for lack of a better
neutral word) that will weave itself many personality matrices and wear many
bodies over time.  The reason I brought that up is because I have run into
notions from some transhumanists that unless they survive in a form that they
consider is precisely themselves in a much stricter fashion than what I
suggest then they don't really have any indefinite lifespan and all.  Some go
so far as to say they don't know what an upload of themselves would be but it
would not be themselves but merely a close relation.

Another reason is because I think it is important to understand that the
*I*,  the sense of self needs to be a bit more fluid and also stronger than
it is in many people in order for them to navigate uploading and such
successfully.

Topological theology?  And we thought medieval arguments about how many angels
could dance on the head of a pin were out there.  <g>

answer: How ever many angels should in fact exist and have a desire to dance on
the head of said pin.

In that case Eliezer's effort doesn't count (given your requirements),
and MIT is one single group.
OK, so there's only one group trying to generate AI: The Non-AI Group

Hello fellow list members,  

I've been a "lurker" here for the past 6 years.  I would like to chime in to let others know that I turned on the radio to the BBC (just 2 minutes before Science View ended) to hear Nick Bostrom's name mentioned just before he was asked to provide closing remarks.  The question asked seemed to pertain to the issue of whether or not the existence of humans is an accident in this universe, as well other ideas concerning our relationship with multiple universes.  

Did anyone catch the whole show, if so could they briefly summarize it (including Nick's remarks)? Thanks.

It appears that you can find and listen to the most recent weekly show by
going to http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/sitemap/pop_sbyte.shtml.

	i don't know, this discussion (which i take as the justification
of personal preservation, or the lack thereof) just seems moot to me. i
mean, how does one justify something without a context? if everyone here
has a clear, concrete supergoal, then we can just say "i need to be
preserved because it serves my supergoal" ... but we (well, most of us
anyway) don't have clear goal systems. of course, we could come to
concensus about a common intermediate goal, but i have not seen this here.
my point is that i can't see the question "why?" as leading to anything
but a subjective, cuz-i-feel-like-it, kind of answer -- unless it is asked
in the context of some goal.

	well, i want (in the strictest present tense) to live forever, and
i can't justify it in any meaningful way -- i just feel like it. so, if no
one stops me, i'll probably try my best toward that end. i know what i'm
willing to sacrifice (risk my life, in a vague sense) and what i'm not
willing to sacrifice (lives of others, for example) -- more than that,
what could i possibly say?

Well, Webmind Inc. had a group working on our AI project for 3 years, about
50% focused on building real AI and 50% on delivering AI to the company's
products.  The group grew from 4 to about 50 over the 3 years.  Not quite
Manhattan Project in size I'll admit, but getting there...

I'm not sure what your "very specific set of methods" is.  Not having any
practical experience trying to build real AI, how can you be so confident
that you know what methods are required?

I believe I have a complete and workable design for a real Ai, but I don't
pretend to know what methods are **required** to make real AI.  I think that
my design is one among many possible workable real AI designs.  I think that
finding **necessary and sufficient conditions** for a real AI design is a
hard math problem, significantly harder than finding sufficient conditions,
which is all we need to do to build one.  I can't help but suspect that your
confidence is unfounded.

Ben

Well, I rather doubt if the market for faster desktop machines has
anything to do with the needs of software developers; they just benefit
from it as a side effect, is all.

The need for speed these days is felt by gamers (as always), and by
the folks who use their computers for multimedia -- sound processing,
image processing (Photoshop), and **especially** nonlinear video
editing (Adobe Premiere, etc.).  Software DVD players, too (PC-based
home theater is a world unto itself -- check out, for example, the
AV Science Forum [ http://www.avsforum.com ]), not to mention the
upcoming software HDTV decoders (which may be here already -- I've
been neglecting consumer electronics shamefully for the past few
months ;-> ).

I remember reading an article by John C. Dvorak recently (and I've found
it: http://www.zdnet.com/pcmag/stories/opinions/0,7802,2665934,00.html )
about last January's Comdex in which he sings the praises of a German
company called DynaPel, which has developed streaming video software
that uses a whole lot of desktop number-crunching (1.5 GHz worth)
to interpolate smooth 30 frame-per-second video from a network feed of only
4 frames per second.  Dvorak thinks this is cool because he pooh-poohs the
prospects for rapid penetration of broadband in the consumer market.

Anyway, that's where the chip speed is getting soaked up, and there
is **no end** in sight of the demand for it.

I think Damien was alluding to the fact that Tipler's Omega Point candy bar is
based on the Big Crunch, but recent astronomy suggests there ain't
gonna be no Big Crunch after all, just an ever-expanding collection of
Reese's Pieces.  That was **bad**, wasn't it?

None of this speaks to "value." It also seems extraordinarily 
arbitrary. Why choose 'classification?'

The writer is very bright but, at least on this topic, writes as if he's 
nuts.  The idea that parents manipulate is plausible and does happen; but 
it's not common and I would expect strong data to support it over more 
straightforward explanations of parental effects like well-fed mothers can 
make better babies.  His detailed modeling shows a lack of knowledge about 
how imprinting and parental effects work and has a lot of grasping at straws. 
 Reading it feels very surreal as he's obviously done his homework on the 
terminology and literature and then misses some real basics, or makes very 
biased presentations.  

Mothers do manipulate progeny pre-natally.  An ape example is gorillas; 
female gorillas produce male-skewed offspring when in good condition and 
female-skewed offspring when in bad condition.  However, for the mother to 
manipulate offspring intelligence would require that the mother ascertain the 
values and cost of intelligence to her children, that there be some 
substantial trade-off, and that the trait is simple enough to be manipulated. 
 All this is very iffy.

The claims for environmental irrelevance in IQ are breathtaking.  He cites 
the Dutch Hungry Winter of 1944 (a mild famine lasting a few months) as 
"only" reducing IQ 1.9 points.  Gosh, a hungry childhood would "only" reduce 
IQ about 90 points, at that rate.  No mention of other work on calorie 
restriction in very young
monkeys showing profound mental retardation.

The myopia/imprinting correlation just consists of citing unexplained 
variance in poorly controlled or downright anecdotal studies.  E.g. the 
indian studies where myope children of non-myope parents have 8+ hours of 
close work per day.  8 hours! That's a child labor subgroup; there will be 
some major environmental differences with the myopic parent group, both with 
children and with parents.  He "proves" neuronal complexity causes mental 
capacity with 3 case studies (and then later says it's cortical size that 
matters!).  He has this implicit assumption that if children differ when 
starting school, it must be due to genetics.  ??  

The claim that fathers must make a stronger genetic contribution because 
mothers provide more of the environment really doesn't hold any water.  A 
correlation between mother and child intelligence due to that would be equal 
to the correlation of mother's IQ with grandmother's conferring ability (20% 
at most), times the correlation with mother's conferring ability (50% at most 
and probably much less), times correlation of mother's conferring ability 
with baby's IQ (20% again) .   That's less than 2%, possibly much less.  
You'd never see it, even if it's there.  Further, a lot of studies separate 
out the pre-natal effects so *of course* they
don't show more input from mom's genes.

There is *no* requirement for sexual dimorphism for imprinting.  There's an 
association, because dimorphism in parental care provides opportunity for 
conflict between parent's genomes about the offspring's demands.  But if the 
goal is offspring benefit apart from exploiting the other parent then a 
non-dimorphic species would do it just as well.  Even asexual mothers 
manipulate offspring freely, as with production of the sexual morph in 
cyclically parthenogenic Daphnia, or sporulation in [pick a species].  So the 
"sex differences provides an opportunity for rapid mammalian evolution" is a 
castle built on air.

The business of mitochondrial transmission of IQ through the father is 
bizarre. We've never seen paternal mtDNA in a human, ever; plus the genome is 
so tiny there's no room to have much going on.  Fathers *do* imprint, but 
only on nuclear genes, as far as we know.

Sorry to be crude, but this sounds like the attempts of a high-IQ male myope, 
possibly Jewish, to justify himself as the ultimate in human evolution to 
date.  He's bending a lot of science to claim particular groups produce 
super-sperm, basically, and I'll bet he's a member of those groups.

If somebody came up with some evidence of imprinting/ parental effects in 
myopia or IQ, I'd be interested, but this isn't it.  I'm mildly curious about 
all the myopia variances but it's patently obvious the studies aren't very 
comparable/well controlled.  IMO it's probably something like whether 
toddlers get read to.  E.g., desparately poor Indian parents don't read to 
their children and so the children are only myopic with extended close work.  
Myopic (and usually middle-class) parents do read to their children so they 
get a "head start" on myopia.  Additionally, if parents can't afford 
eyeglasses there are limits to how myopic the children will get.

Oh, that's all right.  I was cautioning (see above) into evolving
to the point that nothing exists except something that we'd have to
view, objectively, as non-Samantha.  For example, if we call X the
1/4 inch long fetus that used to be you, then X has evolved to the
point that X isn't around any longer.  X is dead.  Totally.

Yes.

To each his own, I suggest.  But if each future version of you begins
to reason the way that I think you are reasoning now, there will come
a time where Samantha doesn't exist.  Just like what happened to X.
Inch by inch, step by step, it's gradually replaced by something
different.

Well, I would be very surprised if you could show that it did!

Of course, we really don't know.  And to me, it's not really important
either.  It's just that I object when someone starts talking as you did
about the necessity of eventual mortality, without having anything
specific to back it up.  Since we don't know, and you can't succinctly
argue that after 10^10^10^10 years of successful existence our luck
necessarily has to change, I still detect a prejudice towards mortality
in your prose (despite the wonderful lyrics of "Alive").

Oh, good.  I'm very concerned about the future of music, and this

When energy prices began to rise a year or so ago , almost
similtaneously with the bursting of the tech bubble I began to pose the
query.... Could a severe increase of energy costs be a deliberate ploy
to drive the masses to use electronic devices in favor of physical
transport and transaction modalities.  Accompanying this would be the
creation of a cash pool to stabilize the loss of investor liquidity
underlying the market weakness.  This same pool of cash could then drive
the investor base which would buy into the companies which would merge
with or otherwise acquire the "value corrected" internet businesses.
The resulting world scale internet commerce
enabled conglomerates would drive business to their door by offering the
benefits of
net integration to compete with more energy consuming and thus cost
ineffective conventional cohorts??
I know that if I was a global scale strategic planner who wanted to make
the internet sucessful I would want to create this scenario.  Global
planners want to find a way to access and analyse every human action.
Bill gates/Microsoft has created the platform for this "world domination
enabling knowledge pool" by offering to supply the master data
warehouse/repository system.
The good side is that the ineffiencies of  the chaos that results from
unmonitored
human actions in every area of life from medicine to business to
education might be elimenated or at least extremely reduced.
What we are moving towards is  a borg-like electronic infrastructure.
What those who want personal space and individual human thought must do
is determine just where pervasiveness of computing should end and
individual private domains begin.
There are those who would argue that privacy creates chaos and
inefficiency and thus should be disallowed.

On another subject, I listened to a couple of the "extropian
recommended"
songs.  My impression of "wild Child" is that it describes the process
that might lead to the first self aware AI.  A very special virus with
the "spark of life"  creates a global singularity "event horizon" as
every electronic linked system is infected with "self awareness".  In
effect the global electronic net would begin to act like a brain and
think.  So maybe the key to creating the first AI lies in creating a
very special virus.

I personally think that the computational complexity which comprises the

living program called a living human being will be recognized by any AI
in short order to be useful and worthy of preservation.  Wishful
thinking?

and this harmless reference to Tipler drew some fire.
I was not appealing to authority, but rather to Tipler's
book as a source of materials for arguments in favor of
an infinite amount of computation perhaps being possible.

I had begun to get the impression, from a number of posts
(for example on Eternal Return) that people on this list
had not read "The Physics of Immortality".  I see that I
was wrong---sorry about that.

Two points.  I'm sure that you aren't serious about something
having to be wrong because Tipler said it.  I know that you're
in chat mode---but even so...

Secondly, perhaps you can inform me where Tipler's conjectures
about the collapse of space at the end of time have been debunked.
I have always regarded such "calculations" with a lot of skepticism,
but don't have any prior reason for supposing that humankind or
intelligence in the universe to be incapable of having an enormous
influence on the fate of the universe, including, possibly its
very topology under collapse.

Let me guess: what's really bugging people is not Tipler's physics
nor his conjectures, but the religious slant he puts on everything.
I also am appalled, and argue against Tipler on this point with my
friends (some of whom think that he's doing nothing wrong, e.g.
Peter McCluskey).  But concretely, why do you suppose that infinite
computation, which was how we got onto this subject, is unlikely?
I still think that no one knows enough to say a whole lot one way
or the other.

Wow. Just reviewing my own activity here. Too much time; too little 
effect, or so it seems.

Returning to my (wired) cave now. Will make occasional forays and--
following Damien's lead--will plug myself shamelessly at a later

Sure.  In fact the original post in this thread by Brian Atkins
has caused me to have an epiphany.  Loosely paraphrasing,
He suggested a reputation quotient to help improve the
quality of the list.

For the purposes of this discussion, I will ignore the fact
that Pirsig (or rather Phaedrus) went mad trying to define
Quality.  The epiphany was in response to pondering the
fact that it was Sasha who suggested just such a reputation
rating system several years ago, then my own recollection
that Sasha was a chess enthusiast.  He and I had connected
offlist and were going to play a match by email, then decided
to meet at E4 for some fivers.  To my eternal regret, I
failed to make that happen, since I rode a motorcycle
up to Berkeley and didn't bring my board.

In tournament chess, there is a thing called an Elo rating
that describes one's strength.  Sasha may have had this
in mind when he proposed his system which is in some
ways analogous to a reputation rating. Since I am tired I
will describe it only in general terms this evening, the Elo
system and how it could be adapted for our purposes.

In tournament chess, one's Elo rating describes one's
strength.  A typical club player is about 1500, and a
standard deviation is about 200 points.  A 200 point
span defines a rank.  The ranks are these:

rank                    Elo rating

1000-1200        E
1200-1400        D
1400-1600        C
1600-1800        B
1800-2000        A
2000-2200        expert
2200-2400        master
2400+               grandmaster

If I play a person two full ranks above me, she is
two standard deviations above or about 97.5% likelihood
she will go home with my scalp, rather than the reverse.
Nowthen, if I do manage to topple her, I gain a lotta
Elo points.  The exact formulas later, if this thread
stirs interest.

The Elo system is set up to where there is no rate
inflation over the years.  And it works, so that if
one stays the same in strength, one's rating does
not change much.  It does have good predictive
value in tournaments, or rather used to, before
computers came along.

Nowthen, if we had an somewhat analogous
with extropian poster reputation.  Each person
would be rated from -2 to 5, where 5 is a person
who you read every post and -2 is you have
killfiled that person.  You would assign numbers
to each person in the matrix.

Oh dear, it is late and Im tired.  More later.

I agree that there are better strategies than the only two I
mentioned. I tried to point out that one kind of error had
disastrous potential, while the other didn't.

I also agree with you that in our modern world there are many
situations in which being overly cautious is bad strategy.

I suspect that many people, when they reject religious superstition,
experience some kind of "intellectual or existential void" from
which they don't recover, and hence on average die sooner than
the religious believers. I also expect that because of the values
and beliefs I now hold (including extropian principles), and my
practices related to personal health, I'm likely to live longer (even
in the absence of technological life-extension advances) than
even Mormons who wear "protective underwear!"

There may be times when the limbic system needs to take
over control to initiate rapid action before the neocortex has
time to think about it. There are also times when the lizard
brain is ideal for initiating "fight or flight!"

Problems can arise when people (who lack the necessary
training and discipline), for example, become overly emotional
when it would serve them better to be rational.

Correct. There have probably always been "clever nonconfirmists"
who pretended to be conformists most of the time and didn't
rock the boat more than could be tolerated. (At the risk of
seeming paternalistic, I must confess that so far on this
topic I've written at a fairly high level of abstraction and
generality, to avoid mentioning some specific human errors
that might result in my being perceived as a crackpot!)

For best results, nonconformists need to operate intelligently,
that is, pretend to be conformists much of the time -- "When in
Rome, do as the Romans!"

True. Just in this rather important and consequential aspect. (Oh, and his

It went away when the universe turned out to be open and *accelerating*, of
all things. Granted, that interpretation too might be overturned, but it's
the current standard view, using new evidence, as the closed model was
arguably dominant when Dr Tipler developed his notions--although my friend
Paul Davies argued contra as long ago as the late '70s in his book THE
RUNAWAY UNIVERSE.

#Repetitive physical training "wears a groove" into the brain--
presumably in the lizard brain. x no. of reps (I forget the number) 
makes the reaction instinctive. Curiously, strong "If THIS happens, I 
WILL do THIS" decision can accomplish the same end with zero 
repetitions--but this doesn't work with everyone.

Yes, a lot of people are in chat mode.  But suppose that someone has
put in a long day creating wealth, and wants a bit of fun and stimulation.
As has been said, one of the purpose of a list like this is to create a
party atmosphere.

Yes, your complaint echos the way that I feel, in that that for
your purposes and mine, the list would be a lot richer if people
didn't respond instantly and impulsively, but judiciously weighed
the whole thing up for a while, perhaps reading some other comments
first.  While this would greatly increase the value of the list for
some of us, it would destroy its utility for those who need the
party-type conversational atmosphere.

'fraid that's going to be asking too much of most folks.

As for me, I'm having to give up on digest mode: it's just too hard
to wade through all the junk and get to the meat.  In individual
mode, at least I can start ignoring the posts of people's who I've
learned contribute very little, or who've for the nonce lost their
tempers.

I'm referring to the only tried and true method. Sometimes, when I look

worked.

Ha! I can top that. I don't have a complete and workable design for a 
real AI, heavensforbid. It would cover most of the Sahara with documentation.
What I do have, is metaheuristics, a recipe. Two, actually.

You want to make a machine think? Look at prior art. Grab a thinking
critter off the street and stuff him into the machine. 

Plan two: figure out, how said critters came into being, figure
out a decent point of departure, and do a fast-forward replay 
of the above in machina.

Both plans differ from yours that they don't require superhuman 
genius to execute. Sorry Eliezer, you're out of work. Sure, 
they nontrivial, large-scale projects, but with a clear structure, 
progress metric, and validated by existance proof.

Of course you'll burn many computronium mole-hours just for the
initial search in the parameter space. Then, you can start with
the *real* work. Which might require computronium km^3-centuries.
Then it might not.

Here's where we differ, again. I don't think it's a math problem at all.
At least not the sort of math you learn at school, or what monkeys do
and can do. I might have to retract that statement, though, depending 
on what that mondo Wolfram dude comes out with next.

I sure as hell hope so. A real AI could clean ruin your day.

I'm very much coming to the view that rating would be
very valuable for open lists.  I'm particularly biased
by sci.bio.evolution, which is overrun by three nutcases.

I'd like the system to be set up so that people automatically
knew about it.  An example would be a web-board where you
could click through to the ratings.  Rating on the current list
would lose much value as newbies and casual observers
wouldn't know what they were.

The problem I see is activating social conflict.  First, there
are some perfectly decent people on this list who just don't
post much that interests me.  If they got a -1 from enough 
people, that would discourage participation.  We all want to be above 
average; I thinnk there would be a tendency for below-average
posters to quit in emarassment even if their posts were worthwhile.

Second, I worry that a group may split into warring factions
along ideological lines.  We've seen some nasty stuff relating 
to a certain phallic self-defense device.  I could see AI vs.
artificial stupidity, nanosanta vs. nanoskeptic, etc.  The problem
is that downgrading intellectual opponents will probably
occur naturally, be seen as a personal attack inciting
counterattack, etc., until intellectual disagreement becomes
personal vendetta.

In the end I say go for it.  I think the members of this list mostly
want to really change things.  We see some interesting stuff here
but in the end it's just a list and nothing earthshaking.  A 
functioning list rating system could be a real earthshaker.  
So I'd accept a substantial risk of this list flaming out for
a small but meaningful chance of solving a profound communication
problem in the internet age.  YMMV

Let's see that system, Spike.

Actually, Anders Sandberg has written a piece (couldn't find it just now;
URI, Anders?) about it, where he takes Quantum Mechanics and Information
Theory into consideration and finds an upper bound on the number of angels.

So it isn't 'How ever many angels ...' :-)

[Robin posts a paper by him and Tyler Cowen on the implications of 
disagreements]
http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf or .doc

I have no idea where to begin.  I'm having such trouble formulating coherent 
stuff these days.  I'm not going to quote from the paper as there's too much. 
 I *strongly* recommend people read the paper, even if you have no interest 
in what I say.  http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf or .doc

I mean it.  Read the damn paper. http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf or .doc 
(Robin, could you make a Web version?)

I agree with the conclusion of the paper - that people form ideas for their 
personal benefit, not in search of truth.  If gene a induces carriers to seek 
truth and gene b to have more babies, which wins?  If meme a induces carriers 
to seek truth and meme b to proselytize, which wins?  Necessarily, we are 
constructed by entities whose goals need not include truth at all, and will 
include it only as a means to an end.  Science has constructed an elaborate 
set of principle to enhance truth-seeking such as hypothesize-test, peer 
review, and consideration of as many alternatives as possible.  The existence 
of the scientific method leads directly to two observations: 1) that it's 
needed in the first place and 2) that it is often inadequate.  Hence humans 
carry strong anti-truth biases.

I think though, that the paper overlooks other limitations on human Bayesian 
behavior, primarily limited computational ability.  I would say most of the 
non-Bayesian behavior you outline can be explained by human inability to be a 
good Bayesian, as well as by the fact that  people aren't trying to be good 
Bayesians in the first place. 

First, as I've said before, people aren't good Bayesians.  Being a good 
Bayesian requires logical omniscience.  People are very, very far from this, 
as explified by behavior in psychological cooperator/defector games.  People 
start off with "obviously" wrong actions - typically too cooperative, 
although that varies by game, and shift to proper behavior only with 
experience.  People are good Bayesians only when the situation is simple and 
they can manage the computation.

Bayesian behavior is correct, of course, in the sense of vulnerability to 
Dutch book. Humans can't be good Bayesians, and they know it.  As a result, 
they take a logical route - they refuse Dutch book situations.  This is one 
of two reasons why group don't have to have group Bayesian behavior - groups 
typically refuse book.  If they had to place bets, they'd place them among 
themselves because they'd get better deals.  The other reason is that each 
member is typically interested in his own benefit - group be ****ed, he's 
going to make the best bet he can.

Resolving disputes by commonizing prior is a cost-benefit negative.  Changing 
priors is horrendously expensive, in the sense that all those mind-expensive 
probability calculations must be redone.  At the same time there's no benefit 
- one prior is as good as another.  High cost, no benefit - of course people 
don't bother and agree to disagree.  The only time people will commonize 
priors is if they have too - say to participate in a market.  Non-Bayesian 
human behavior feeds into maintaining independent priors, as well.  If we 
were both good Bayesians I'd be more willing to accept your prior as an 
alternative to mine.  But I know that you don't want to be a good Bayesian 
and couldn't be if you tried.  I'd be a fool to swallow your priors, and vice 
versa.

The John and Mary example also assumes John and Mary can efficiently exchange 
information.  This doesn't match human experience.  It's very hard to 
communicate experience - language is a low-capacity channel compared to 
eyeballs and fingertips.  Time is valuable.  John hasn't time to get all 
Mary's data, or vice versa.  There's also a significant risk to exchanging 
data.  Human memories are not tape recorders, but actively constructed.  To a 
certain extent, if Mary says she saw something, John will remember seeing it, 
even if he didn't.  Communication between people involves a certain amount of 
data loss due to this principle.  Sequential communication eventually 
converts data into urban legends, stuff that's particularly easy for humans 
to remember or pleasant to recount, with little or no connection to truth.  

Robin and Tyler mention the predeliction of scientists to support their own 
theories even if evidence is against them.  This is logical behavior from the 
personal gain POV.  The inventor or popularizer of a new theory gains great 
benefit in science.  Supporters of existing theories gain little benefit.  
Hence novel theories *should* be supported by their inventors or 
rediscoverers, even if the evidence is against them, as long as evidence 
isn't *too* much against them.  Robin and Tyler explain scientific 
intransigence to group benefit from considering multiple alternatives, which 
is there, but selection on individuals explains more directly than that on 
groups.  I propose that the group would benefit more if people supported 
theories developed by other people, due to greater skepticism.  Hence I think 
the behavior exists primarily for individual, not group benefit.  

Sorry my comments are so negative.  I really liked the paper.  But, you know, 
I gain little from accepting your conclusions and a lot if I get to put out 
something successful of my own ... :-)

Well, that's the most impressive thing I've yet heard about nano.  It's

Perfectly logical.  Lots of worthwhile stuff to do apart from trying
to induce a singularity.

I've no desire to change your opinion substantially.  But some people here
seem to think there's a singularity at our doorstep, and that entails
nanoSanta, AISanta, or bioSanta.

Neither do I .  IMO, it'll need some serious self-organization and

The GOFAI approach based on pure logic has been pretty much proven sterile,
although there have been a few successes, such as ("statistical") machine
learning, constraint logic programming.

Although we express our ideas in a serial, 'logical' way, we don't internally
think this way. Our thinking is fuzzy, continuous. But to communicate, it's
necessary to provide a baseline that most can understand and that can be
comunicated easily and reliably.

On the other hand, evolutionary programming approaches currently suffer because
of a variant of the "gravel-and-bare-hands" problem. GA and SA are appopriate
for optimizing and tweaking an existing approximate solution, but not for
solving a hard problem from scratch. For successful hill-climbing evolution, you
need a smooth yet uneven "fitness" surface. For a course of development to be
taken by evolution, almost immediate fitness rewards are needed. Dawkins'
Climbing Mount Improbable book has a most beautiful depiction of how gradually
evolution works in nature, and in what ways it is limited.

Basically, the "invention" of a photo-sensitive cell is very hard (it only
happened a few times in the past billion years, regardless of the trillion-fold
parallelism), the tuning of the optimal number of photosensitive cells is very
simple. Evolving an oscillator is simple, but evolving a TV set is very hard. We
don't know how difficult is to evolve planning, association, deliberative
thought --- but we could provide many hints that would skip an enormous number
of evolutionary steps. Also, better search methods optimize far more efficiently
than evolution: if we want to find roots of a polynomial, we would not use
evolution. Evolution is only appropriate when no search algorithm is known.

As far as CA's go - I agree that they could well be a vital paradigm - I can't
imagine perception and spatial thinking without massive fine-grained
parallelism. And they're more flexible than NN's with predefined rigid
topologies (which can be easily simulated on CA's). We still have to (let them
:) figure out what else could they be useful for.

However, for the concept-level cognition, coarse-grained paralellism is
sufficient -- with individual processors as basic units of computation. Ben's
nodes are quite a persuasive paradigm. A WMish network might be in many ways
preferable to a rigid hierarchical ontology (and ontologies are a holy grail for
Semantic Web adherents, who will soon be forced to show results --maybe they
could show them with WM better than they would with, say CYC).

> But we don't have kLoCs inside us, nor sequential threads of control

I believe the sequentiallity of introspection is due to human languages being
sequential. Of course, consciousness (along with introspection) and language
coevolve and cannot be considered separately.

Best regards,
                Aleks

Logic-based AI and self-organizing-emergence based-AI both have their
strengths and weaknesses.  To ignore the insights obtained by either
approach is a mistake.  The key is to figure out how they work together.
When you really get into it, the most abstract and complex logic-based tasks
come out to look VERY similar to the lowest-level perceptual processes....
The common substrate of processes underlying the two is more significant
than the differences, though the differences are real too.

For instance, in the Webmind AI Engine, the hardest part of higher-order
inference is creating compound relations (boolean conjunctions of elementary
relations).  These are then evaluated and interrelated using inference
rules, but guessing which compound relations to form in a given context is a
hard problem not solved by logic, rather solved by evolution-like methods.

Yet, this problem is very similar to recognizing patterns in a perceptual
stream -- where one is finding compound relations of elementary percepts
rather than elementary cognitive relations

Gee, that's a really sound argument.  People have failed to do X before
after great effort, therefore no one will ever succeed.

What percentage of great achievements in history do you think were made
WITHOUT a bunch of failed efforts to do the same thing coming first?

I don't mean to be rude, but I'm not going to bother debating with you
further.  I don't mind debating with AI skeptics, but I prefer to debate
with skeptics whose arguments reflect deeper thought.

Hmm, once we have this matrix of what everybody thinks of everybody
else, we can do fun stuff like calculating Eigenvectors of it to get
some kind of "ranking" and do similarity analysis ("Give me a list
filtered after what my favorites like").

But I guess it has to be implemented as a web board.

Ah, you mean: A. Sandberg, Quantum Gravity Treatment of the Angel
Density Problem, Accepted by Annals of Improbable Research.

http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Angels/angels.pdf

	We derive upper bounds for the density of dancing angels on the
	point of a pin. It is found to be dependent on the assumed mass
	of the angels, with a maximum number $8.6766\cdot 10^{49}$ of
	angels at the critical angel mass $3.8807\cdot 10^{-34}$ kg.

There has been a large backlash against revealing security problems.  Even
legitimate software testers are afraid to comment on their findings.  People
are being sued to suppress truthful statements.  In many cases, companies
rather suppress publicity than fix the problem.  There is a big legal,
moral, and PR question about whether known bugs should be discussed or
documented publicly.

Thanks Curt!  Maybe we will make a web version after the next revision,

The section on Bayesian-wannabes, and the longer paper that section summarizes,
are intended exactly to address this.  They talk about someone who would be
Bayesian if they could compute it, but can't so compute.  It also seems
irrational for such wannabes to disagree.

Btw, that is actually not quite true.  A famous paper by Garber long ago
showed how to be a Bayesian who is not logically omniscient.  But admittedly
even this sort of Bayesian requires heroic computational abilities.

The whole idea of being a truth-seeker is that you should be willing to pay
some cost for truth.  You must be willing to spend some effort trying to
overcome inherited biases.  It is not clear to me that such efforts must be
horrendously expensive, though I agree that they have some expense.

A simple cheap strategy is to say "Oh, I'm disagreeing with someone.  That
wouldn't happen if we were both truth-seekers, so unless I have reason to
think they are more likely to be irrational than me, I would move my opinion
in their direction."

The whole point of the analysis is that all they need to exchange is their
summary opinions.   They do *not* need to exchange their detailed data.

Tipler had a theory, like any theory it stands or falls on the validity of its
predictions. Tipler predicted that the universe is closed but we now know
not only is it open it's accelerating and that's very bad news for the theory.
Tipler predicted that the Hubble constant must be less than or equal to 45,
but it's probably closer to 100. He predicted that the Higgs boson must be
at 220 +- 20 GeV for the Omega point to form. A few months ago CERN
said it's not certain but it may have found the Higgs bosons and it weighs
115 GeV. We should know for sure later this year but I have to say so far
Tipler is not doing very well.

No problems with that. But I think some of the macros you use are non-trivial

People are very aware about the problem, IMHO. It is just that so far many of 
the solutions have not panned out, making people rather risk-aversive when it 
comes to new approaches. But given how quickly people also hang on to new 
computing trends when they become fashionable and have enough mass, I don't 
think a method of better software efficiency would be ignored if it could 
demonstrate a measurable improvement.

Evolutionary algorithms are great for specialised modules, but lousy at less 
well defined problems or when the complexity of the problem makes the 
evolutionary search space too nasty. I don't think we will get a dramatic 
jump in software abilities through stringing together efficient small modules 
since as you say the glueing is the hard part and not easy to evolve itself. 
On the other hand, it seems to be a way to help improve software and hardware 
a bit by making the hardware adaptable to the software, which is after all a 
nice thing.

My experience with evolving mutation functions and fitness landscapes suggest 
that this is a very hard problem. Computing cycles help, but I am not that 
optimistic about positive feedback scenarios. The problem is likely that the 
mutation function is problem-dependent, and for arbitrary, ill-defined and 
complex problems there are no good muctation functions. Life only had to 
solve the problem of adapting to staying alive, the rest was largely random 
experimentation (with sudden bangs like Cambrium when occasional tricks 
became available). 

As for taking over computational resources, that implies that intelligence is 
just a question of sufficient resrources and not much of an algorithmic 
problem. But so far all evidence seem to point towards algorithms being very 
important; having more resources speed up research, but I have not seen any 
evidence (yes, not even Moravec's _Robot_) that suggest that if we could just 
use a lot of computing power we would get smarter behavior. Besides, hostile 
takeovers of net resources are rather uncertain operations, highly dependent 
on the security culture at the time, which is hard to predict.

No it does not. Javien is working on it, hopefully they will get done with
it in a few more months. From my understanding it will be a hybrid system
with this mailing list continuing as normal, but also crossposted to their
web system. You will be able to rate people and hopefully see ratings both
on the web, and in normal emails using simple clickable URLs. I don't
know all the details yet.

This assumes the existence of a mastermind that can effectively

such a mastermind.

These things do not require a master planner.  The cash pool for the
first was already there, accelerated by the dotcom financial fad.  The
second was a logical choice for VCs seeking to salvage the money from
the first.  The third is by nature of the Internet...though having
worked in ecommerce myself, I can definitely say that it's not *that*
hard to run a solid ecommerce outfit, if you let engineering and not
marketing drive key decisions (though I may be biased given the
business awareness, especially ability to consider the other side's
concerns, of engineers and of marketers that I've seen).

Except for the large percent of 'Net services that don't use Microsoft
for any mission-critical software (Web servers and CGI scripts, as
opposed to PowerPoint presentations - and it is the Web servers et al
that would record customer actions), citing the crappy quality of their
software, even if they do serve customers who use Microsoft.

This, I will agree with.  Except that there is no single unifying
consciousness.  A better analogy would be a dreamer - or, better, a
disembodied brain, incapable of physical action - with multiple
personalities, where each of the personalities is flying around inside
the mind doing its own thing at the same time.

Humans don't necessarily recognize similarly-complex beings (like other
humans) as worth preservation.  Better to uplift ourselves into SysOps
(or whatever), IMO.

Regarding Robin's paper, http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf...

"A similar argument applies to a group of agents. If the group is to
avoid combinations of bets that are guarantee losses, then each group
member must offer the same betting odds on every proposition."

Since groups don't do this, there must be bets we outsiders can make
with group members that are guaranteed profitable.  But they are not
obvious.

For example, some people think Amazon.com will fail, others think it
will thrive.  These people have different ideas about the fair value of
the company's stock today.  Theoretically I could buy stock cheaply from
the first group and sell it expensively to the second.  But in practice
I can't, because those groups can get a better deal in the stock market.

Of course for most issues there is no existing market, but in principle
you could create an Idea Futures market for virtually any issue on which
people disagree.

What does the existence of markets and market prices say about the
existence of disagreement?  Why don't people pour all of their resources
into markets where they disagree that the current market-clearing price
is correct?  Presumably people find most market prices to be "incorrect"
to some degree, almost all the time.

Can this be explained because people aren't as confident in their beliefs
as they like to think that they are?  They're "sure" that the stock is
underpriced or overpriced, but when it comes time to put their money down,
suddenly they are not so sure.

If so, then perhaps the existence of an IF market would make people more
aware of their true (lack of) certainty about their beliefs.

I'd rather see a system implemented that follows more mind-bending criteria
than whether a person is popular or not-:) If a rating system relied upon
the Extropian principles and a variety of essays that embody content
reflecting the goals, thoughts and feelings of "Extropy" rather than the
personal likes and dislikes of any one person on the list, it might benefit
the list in a more inclusive way. Otherwise, emotions set in: A poster could
have substantive content, but a lousy personality.  Another poster could
flat content but be an absolute gem.  We are also leaving out humor. As we
witnessed from some of the post recently, a lot of values is placed on
humor.  Some zealous uploaders might grade humor as a sluggish biological
waste.

A smart ranking device would not rely on the emotions and fancies of any one
poster, but on the architecture of extopian thinking.

Personally, I think it's one of the good things about this list, as some of 
the items are those that I would otherwise miss, and it also helps to start 
off debates about current technological issues, scotching most claims that 
we are too "future-focussed".

So my stance on this issue is that I will continue to post to this list 
items of news I see as useful and informative to the group, until such time 
as everyone screams at me to stop it.

On the topic of news items:)

Found this on the Beeb font-of-all-knowledge-site;

Anti-ageing breakthrough

http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/health/newsid_1305000/1305112.stm

A breakthrough in gene technology holds out the prospect of a more 
effective anti-ageing treatment.
It may also lead to new treatments to fight cancer.
Scientists from Newcastle University have found a way to enhance the body's 
natural repair mechanism.

------
Perhaps when people see more items like this, esp. when linked to 
"treatments to fight cancer", they will begin to warm to 
superlongevity?  I'd say most people would.  They just don't realize it yet.

This could be misleading. ExI has *not* committed to using the Javien 
filtering system. This is not even very public right now, since they are in 
development stage. We are certainly hoping that Javien's system will be 
suitable for this list (or for new more focused lists), but we will not 
decide that until ExI's decision-makers have been able to familiarize 
themselves with the final working software.

I'm trying very hard *not* to discuss how to improve the List right now, 
since I am focusing on Extro-5. I *will* get to it, and have several 
options available that we will be sifting through and deciding on.

Finally, Earth to Eliezer: The Extropians List is not "dead" or dying. 
After ten years it continues to flourish. It may not function just the way 
you personally want. That has nothing to do with whether it is dying.

A number of people are sure they know how the List should work. They all 
see it differently. This should be a clue as to how to think about the 
problem. (And reading Robin Hanson's recent paper wouldn't hurt.)

Onward!

This is basically for Brian, since he is the person who first expressed his
thoughts on GRED.  With a bit more sensitivity to your situation, let me
explain that the capitalized letters GERD sound more appealing and my doc
suggested GERD to saying the acid in the somach is entering the mouth. 
While you, Brian seems to be watching your condition while experienced the
downside of this illness, many people do have it. Some to a greater degree
than others, and whatever the cause - obesity, ulcer, gastritus, spastic
colon, lazy stomach, deficient production of saliva, nervousness, anxiety,
too much chocklate, etc., - it can be treated.

You're no fun to argue with. If you instantly spot even the subtler

Most IT people I know are pretty much into heavy self-delusion, and
usually interpret you criticizing the methods they adhere to as a personal
attack. I think the field could use a liberal sprinkling of professional
humility.

Of course it's the economy (whether the grant-determining paper output, or
products delivered on schedule, i.e. sufficient quality before the
competitors') which causes people to become risk-averse. Industry does no
longer seem to be able to afford bluesky type of research. Modern variants
of Xerox PARC are quite scarce. Our only hope is smart mecenate.

You mention the correct word: "fashion". Contrary to the claims the field

It is difficult to warrant considerable investment with a ROI latency of
decades, particularly at this day and age. People flock quickly to a new
field curently emerged as hot, and desert it as quickly as it fails to
deliver on (notoriously overhyped) promises. Some fields stick around long
enough to even see several waves of above behaviour.

> Evolutionary algorithms are great for specialised modules, but lousy
> at less well defined problems or when the complexity of the problem
> makes the evolutionary search space too nasty. I don't think we will

I'm arguing that we don't have real evolutionary algorithms. First, we
have toy population sizes, and not enough generations, because our
hardware is so very lousy. Noise generation is easy, but the fitness
function usually takes its sweet time to evaluate. Mapping bottleneck
stages to reconfigurable hardware should somewhat ameliorate that.

More importantly, the investigators seem to somehow assume that
evolutionary algorithms are simple. They're that only superficially. Imo,
biology has only been able to accomplish what it did because it uses
something else. During long rounds of coevolution both the substrate and
the mutation function have changed in mutual adaptation, creating the
usual benign form of the mapping of sequence to fitness space: long
neutral-fitness filaments, allowing mutants to percolate through wide
areas of sequence space at very little costs, and maximum diversity in a
small ball once you leave the filaments.

So what happens, is that investigators pick up a framework they deem nifty
(vogues+personal bias), hard-code a mutation function, let it run on
trivial population sizes for a few rounds and then complain the approach
doesn't scale not much beyond the size of trivial.

If you pick a few ad hoc numbers from the parameter space, you almost
certainly will wind up with a suboptimal, nonadaptive system. The
substrate does not show above properties, and the mutation function is
held fixed, so it can't adapt itself by learning the limitations of the
substrate (ideally, you can't leave all the work just to the mutation
function, but coevolve the substrate as well -- reconfigurable hardware
gives us the most basic capability for the first time), and understand the
emerged code that maps higher-order genomic elements into shape features.
The mutation rate over genome is not constant. The genome uses an evolved
modular representation, where there's e.g. a morphological code, which
allows you to shift a limb from one place of the body to another, without
turning it into a random mass of tissue. There are probably
adaptive-response metalibraries stored in the biological genome, adaptive
mutation rate being the simplest example.

I have a strong feeling we're stuck in what is essentially a weakly
biased random search in gene space, and performance will as long scale
poorly as long as we don't realize that something more intelligent
is going on in there.

To use evolution to produce solutions, we must first learn to evolve.
There might be several phase transitions along the way, in which the
system uses more and more advanced coding mechanisms (which it will
hopefully discover, given enough resources to search the space), and
becomes better and better at the task.

Now this was pure speculation, but I'm missing investigations to check
whether there is something hidden operating there. We're still proceeding
on doing minor variations of the scheme produced by the few seminal works,
and are slowly getting discouraged by the fact that the systems seem to
remain stuck at the digital analogon of autocatalytic sets. Evolutionary
algorithms have been having a deteriorating reputation for a while now.
Sounds familiar?

I'm very interested in the shape of these tricks. I cannot currently think
of any easy solutions as to flush out these ever-elusive higher order
mechanisms from the sea of flat numbers constituting the genome.

The rate of discovery of new algorithms is certainly powered by the search
resources available to us. It is both the question of smarts (hitting the
right needle in the stack of the initial parameter space in a rather
bruteforceish, but positive-autofeedbacking manner), and to have enough
firepower to keep going, puncturing subsequent kinetic bareers along the
way.

It is a demanding mental work, to keep zooming out from the problem so
that you can become increasibly flexible as you eliminate hidden crippling
built-in assumptions, of course making the search space larger, and thus
needing these rather absurd hardware requirements I mentioned.

It is certainly hard to get going. There seems to be a bareer in there,
which might take several decades of hard work to pierce. It looks like
bootstrap a lot.

I'm sorry if I came over as a brute force magalomaniac. You can keep
cooking random bitsoup in circumstellar computronium clouds until the
galactic cows come home, and not producing any solutions if the initial
set of parameters is not right.

Code reviews do help, but we're trapped within the constraints of the
system: very low variation across population, not smooth degradation but
sudden failure (imagine a dog having a sudden coredump if it runs over a
certain tile pattern while the sun illuminating it in a very specific
angle, and doing perfectly fine under any other conditions).

I'm rooting for the (hopefully coming) Microsoft Net worm, of orders
magnitude bigger proportions than Morris' one. You don't even need true
polymorphism, just enough variation to escape pattern-matcher vaccines,
and library of canned exploits, preferably few of them undocumented ones.
It would wake up people as to the damage potential, and would readjust the
attitude in regards to holistic system security.

Sure.  For now, lets show how to use an Elo-like system for
our extropian rating average (ERA).  We would make a
matrix with the names in the first column and across the
first row.  Excel is a great tool for this purpose, since in calculating
averages it ignores blank cells.  Consider the matrix (which
I hope will scale) containing 4 extropian posters, Les Min, Uther
Pundragon, Somber Sam and Nancy Newby.  All persons enter
themselves into matrix by choice, as is appropriate for a liberty
loving bunch.

The person goes down the list and rates the other ERA-ers
on a scale from -2 to 5, where -2 = killfile, 5 = take the
computer along on your honeymoon in hopes that the 5-er
has posted some jewel of wisdom you cant live without, a true
Sasha Chislenko clone.

Now heres the tricky part.  A zero is not the same as a blank
and it matters: If you are neutral to a known person, you give the
person a 0, but if you know nothing about a person, you
leave the cell blank.  A new person to the matrix should likely
have a lot of blanks.  I specifically set this scale unsymmetrically to
make it come out this way.  If a newby comes on the matrix and
posts one thing that you know nothing about, the newby would
get from you a 0.  This is not an insult at all, its neutral.  Otherwise
we would get ERA inflation, since people that hang out here
generally like each other, eh?

Lets try this matrix and hope it doesnt get messed up with
the font change in the email program Im using:

                            les min    pundragon   sam    nancy    ERA
les min                    1.5                             0        1
uther pundragon     1                2.5        -1        2
somber sam            2                2            .33    3
nancy newby                            3            2        2

Nowthen in the cells along the main diagonal is the average
of the ratings one gave the others, so for instance Pundragon
gave Sam a 2 and Nancy a 3, but doesn't know anything about
Les, so his rating average that Pundragon gave out is 2.5.

In the last column, the ERA, is the average of what others in
the matrix think of you.  Again blanks don't count, and your
own rating average is not part of this average.

                            les min    pundragon   sam    nancy    ERA
les min                1.5                              0
1            .5
uther pundragon     1                2.5        -1        2            .67
somber sam            2                2            .33    3
2.33
nancy newby                            3            2        2
2.5

See how that works?  OK heres the part I think is a
new contribution on the part of moi.  We are going to
derive another column, called the weighted ERA which
will be in some ways analogous to the chess Elo rating.
In chess, if you mop up the cannon fodder, your own
rating doesn't go up much, but if you manage to behead
a master you get major Elo points.  *In our weighted ERA
column, we will multiply the ratings each person gives us
by their own ERA and scale it by their average rating.*

For instance, when Nancy first joins the matrix, all of
her row is blank, since no one knows her.  Her ERA
defaults to zero.  She can scan the archives and rate
everyone in there, but her own rating is zip.  Nowthen,
in the scaled ERA column, we multiply the ERA by
the rating the person gives.  So when nancy first
starts, she can rate everyone anything she wants
and it has no effect on anyone's scaled ERA since
her own ERA is 0.

Secondly, when calculating the scaled ERA, we
force everyone's average rating of others to a
value equal to one's own ERA.  Nancy is new
and loves everybody, so she gives out a lot of
4s and 5s.  Then suppose Sombre Sam gets in a
flame war and several people jump on him and
he thinks the whole world is against him.  He rates
everyone a -1 or -2.  In both cases we scale the
average rating that they gave out to equal their
own unscaled ERA.

What this does is in these cases, Nancy may be
making uninformed decisions, so her influence
on other's Scaled ERA is minimimized until she
herself posts some stuff allowing others to evaluate
her.  In Sam's case his own ERA may well go
negative since flamewars are distasteful things and
reputations suffer on both sides.  He rated others
negatively, so the product of his negative rating
and this unscaled ERA is positive.  So it may actually
raise your own scaled ERA to be flamed by a nasty troll.

Pundragon is one who treats words as playthings
but seldom has anything meaty to say.  On the
other hand, he is a decent chap and occasionally
posts something that makes you laugh like a
drunken hyena.  He gets a middling positive ERA
influence level.  I figure there is nothing wrong with
being a clown, so long as you are a funny one.

Nowthen, remember that this is just a game, and
you will not be placed in the matrix unless you ask
to be in it.  Should we mask individual's ratings to
keep them secret?  Or just people's ratings of each
other?  How would you do it, set up a website?  Then
each person would have a password that would
allow them to see and change their own column
only?  I can write the scaling formulae if someone
can set up a website.

Who wants to play?  I do!  Anders?  Brian?

I think this is right.  People indulge in irrational disagreement more
when the personal penalties are less.  When money is at stake, they self-
deceive less.  This is part of what I had in mind years ago when I said
that idea futures gave people an incentive to be "careful and honest" in
what they say. Honest not only with others, but also with themselves.

The stock market encourages the "hunch" theory. People enjoy this venue for
making hunches.  The reality is that the dollar value does not support
hunches. The physical dollar sign requires facts - specific decimal points.

Those who are confident in their beliefs have developed a track record for
success in an advantageous environment.

A smart ranking device would give each poster exactly the kind of posts
she wants. Because he wouldn't read them, anyway, regardless how clever
they would appear to others.

There can't be a single metric. It wouldn't only be pointless, it would
squish diversity. So attaching to each listener his personal metric would
be only fair. Doing cluster crunching ("related", i.e. poster XY
found the stuff cool you also found cool, so you're members of the same
cluster) is then always possible, since the matrix is best stored 
server-side, anyway.

And damn it, don't we owe the implementation to Sasha's memory?

This is a waaaay better idea, thanks Natasha!  If we had a system
which would allow the rater person to rate the *post* without
knowing who is the author, then this would be a better tool for
producing extropy.  To remain anonymous I would need to stop
adding these things  ----> {8^D

Many of us have a system where we have mentally done exactly
what we are talking about here: we have figured out the dozen
or two posters who consistently post something worth the time
to read.  When we return from vacation and have a jillion messages
we scan down looking for family, friends and those two dozen
posters, then delete the rest.  I do that.

How would we do it so that we rate the posts and not the posters?
Then create a matrix such as was described previously?  Then
have the computer reconnect the post ratings with the person,
so as to make an ERA to allow Anders' filtered list of faves?
We could eventually write a subroutine that would keep track
of our favorite and most extropic posters and threads.   We
would tell the machine we have half an hour to read email, for
instance, and it would automatically delete the junk and give
you half an hour's worth of stuff from your family, friends and
favorite extropians, who got that way from writing cool stuff,
not just from being nice people offlist.  spike

The interesting thing about GERD is that it seems to involve a
disfunction of the enteric nervous system. That and the fact that
it is on a dramatic increase in just the last few years.

Most pesticides are in effect neurotoxins, and we know from cell
research that the human immune system will react to manmade
chemicals, chemicals that did not previously exist in nature. Since
everyone is different, it is reasonable to assume that suceptible
members of the population will have negative reactions to new
substances in the enviroment, I would think particularly if taken
internally.

The increase in new cases points to a change, what that change is,
is the question.

My point other than a personnal example is that any bad effects
caused by a GMO might not be immediately recognized, they could be
more gradual.

Do have to watch the chocolate though.... ;)

PLONK?  You spend four years flaming me for being insufficiently
experienced and not having gone direct to implementation, and then Ben
Goertzel comes along and you KILLFILE him?  Well, I'm glad to see the
reaction I could have expected from you if I'd actually gone along with
your recommendations!

I guess this just confirms my original take on your proposal; the people
who currently flame me for not having a doctorate or not having source
code are the same people who would be flaming me just as virulently for
not having twenty years experience if I did spend five years getting a
doctorate, or who'll be flaming me for having the wrong source code in a
couple of years.

I've been reading the small amounts of published material on the Semantic 
Web for quite a while now. You can find some of these by searching for term 
at www.manyworlds.com. I've been frustrated until now with the sketchiness 
of Tim Berners-Lee's description of the semantic Web. His paper in the new 
issue of Scientific American is the most comprehensive statement of it yet. 
(Other articles and papers do go into some aspects in more depth.)

For anyone interested in the future of the Net, you will want to read this:

If the smart ranking device did not read the posts, it would not be able to

anyone could trick the device.  Here is another issue -- not all the

I agree that there cannot be a single metric.  Extropy is not built on a
single metric.  The device would have to filter for individual preference
and also trouble shoot-mining data that could be beneficial to the
individual's future needs.  (Good friends do this:  "'gene, why not try the

>From the publisher:

"It is increasingly recognized that the weakness in modern
macroeconomics theorizing is the lack of any real coupling
of short- and long-run aspects of the market process. In
the short run, the investment and consumption magnitudes
move in the same direction, either both downward into
recession or both upward toward full employment and even
beyond in an inflationary spiral. But for a given period
and with a given technology, any change in the economy's
growth rate must entail consumption and investment magnitudes
that move, initially, in opposition to one another.

Roger Garrison claims that modern Austrian macroeconomics,
which builds on the early writings of F.A. Hayek, can be
comprehended as an effort to reinstate the capital-theory
core that allows for a real coupling of short- and long-run
perspectives. Although the macroeconomic relationships
identified are largely complementary to the relationships
that have dominated the thinking of macroeconomists for the
past half century, _Time and Money_ presents a fundamental
challenge to modern theorists and practitioners who overdraw
the short-run/long-run distinction. The primary focus of
this text is the intertemporal structure of capital and the
associated set of issues that have long been neglected in
the more conventional labor- and money-based macroeconomics.
This volume puts forth a persuasive argument that the
troubles that characterize modern capital-intensive economies,
particularly the episodes of boom and bust, may best be
analyzed with the aid of a capital-based macroeconomics."

As you might have noticed, I haven't started criticizing (not flaming,
I have yet never flamed anybody on this list, not even come close) you
immediately -- only after I've seen other people reacting positively
to your proposal, sufficiently so that I become worried.

You're opinionated and eloquent, but a troll you're not. Occasionally,
you cruise too high on testosterone, but I did much worse, and at a 
later age, so I don't have any right to criticize you on that. (The
good thing, it will pass).

I think however, that you're wasting your time, which you at a later 
time you may come to regret (recall the staged windows of opportunity,
as created by other people's expectations of you, and age artifacts), 
and other people's. In my curmugeonly, unasked-for way I tried 
sundry smiles, soap and railway shares, until I ran into 
diminishing ROI. Fine. It's yours and other people's time and 
effort, not mine.  Moreover, I should be less ambivalent about this, 
and be glad that you're poking around in the area which is so totally 
barren.

Ben "Webmind" Goertzel? He didn't have any brownie points in my book, and 
he ran out of the default issue stock in record time, which is quite
an accomplishment. I can be aggravating, and at times I'm being deliberately 
so, but his response pattern was 24 ct genuine troll (or a brilliant
imitation thereof), and a troll of the more crude, warty variety. 
Almost no technical points, several red herrings, thinly veiled
statements "you no good. you suck so badly you're not worth arguing with".
Okay, so let's remove the cause (but not  the symptoms).

Huh?

I personally don't care a fig about a doctorate. One of the most 
brilliant persons I've personally known has never been in an 
university programme. A Ph.D. can be very easily bought, obtained
by nepotism, or by sheer bottom of your pants. God knows I've
seen enough braindead Ph.Ds.

However, letters are world's way of measuring prestige. They're your
attached accomplishment track, however crude and biased, and if you 
want to work with people who don't know you from Adam It Really Helps.
In many fields a Ph.D. with honours from a good school and a few
publications is just an entry ticket to get an interview with a 
top-notch PI.

By riling you about not having a functional prototype I was attempting
two goals: 1) less Eliezer in my mailbox 2) Eliezer cutting his teeth
on the diamond boulder, and going for something with a brighter success
outlook. Which, of course, is inconsistent. I don't want my day ruined,
no sir. Better Eliezer saying "a heap of straw" than a ruined day.

As I rule, and a means of last resort before ceasing communication 
I only flame people I consider effectively evil. Right now that
badge of dubious honour belongs to Robert Ettinger alone. May he rot in peace.

The problem, Robin, is that, even under your theory, the observed data is
consistent with a world in which rational people do exist, but are so
sparsely distributed that they rarely run into each other.  Not only does
this mean that the majority of observed cases will be persistent
disagreements; it further means that even two rational individuals, on
interacting for the first time, will assume that the other is irrational
by default.  You say that *most* people cannot rationally believe that
they are more meta-rational than the most of the population, but this does
not change the fact that - if, say, levels of meta-rationality are
distributed along a Gaussian curve - some people will *be* more
meta-rational than the rest of the population.

Actually, given the fact that highly intelligent groups such as scientific
conferences and Foresight Gatherings still exhibit lack of convergence,
the curve is either not Gaussian, or the curve for meta-rationality is not
associated with intelligence, or else the three-sigma level of a Foresight
Gathering is still not enough intelligence to eliminate self-deception. 
I'd pick the third possibility.  Foresight Gatherings do show *some*
improvement.

But anyway, let me see if I can predict the general reaction to your
paper's abstract:

"I already knew that Other People are often highly silly in the way that
they argue and think.  Since I expected this to be the case, your paper
does not provide new and unexpected information in the Bayesian sense, and
can therefore not cause a change to my underlying model, in which *I* am
one of the sparsely distributed rational people."

Of course, since the vast majority of Other People will read your paper's
title and *incorrectly* reply with the above counterargument, the above
must not be a sufficient counterargument.  In fact, seeing someone emit
the above counterargument provides no Bayesian information at all about
her spiritual advancement.  By an extension of this principle, the
fact of *observing yourself* to think up this particular counterargument
does not license you to conclude that you are rational.

In the case of those individuals that are spiritually advanced enough to
see this problem, they will probably tack on some bit of information to
the generic rejoinder - i.e., "My experience in the Korean War enabled me
to stop being self-deceptive" - which is not shared by all parties.  Since
this hypothesized underlying cause is unique to the individual in question
- since the thought, considered in isolation, is unique - it can be
internally processed as a sufficient cause to conclude rationality,
without implying that the Other People are licensed to conclude their own
rationality.

Of course, all the Other People can do the same thing - tack on an extra
cause.  (Although someone spiritually advanced enough to appreciate the
Bayesian need to tack on an additional cause *is* likely to be less
self-deceptive than the average.)  An external observer, though, is likely
to abstract away the idea of an extra added underlying cause and see all
proffered excuses as identical, or belonging to the same class of
propositions:  "I am *not* silly because of Cause X, which is unique to
me", and to regard the utterance of such a sentence as providing little or
no Bayesian information about the utterer.

In this way, we finally arrive at a situation in which some observers may
reason themselves into a corner from which *no* utterance allows you to
conclude that a party is not being silly, even if that party is really and
truly Not Silly.  Even a genuinely non-silly, non-self-deceptive AI, who
truthfully says "I am not silly because I am an AI and I do not share the
evolved causes of silliness", will simply be heard by all observers as
saying "I am *not* silly because of Cause X, which is unique to me".  The
observers will have to rely on their Bayesian priors to determine how
likely an AI is to be silly, or will need to observe the AI's behavior
directly.

I, of course, have been placed in the same situation by the title of Robin
Hanson's paper.  I am in fact substantially less self-deceptive than even
Robin Hanson or Marc Stiegler, or so I evaluate.  However, there
is no utterance on my part which can convince you of this, which is why
this particular reply to this particular paper is perhaps the only
possible context in which I could air my actual opinion of myself without
it being instantaneously dismissed.  After all, if Robin Hanson knows that
I know as much as he does about Bayesian self-discounting of statements of
non-self-deception, and I state I'm non-self-deceptive *anyway*, even he,
an external observer, might consider that we appear to have the same
priors...

Obviously, this is a general problem for evolved entities trying to
convince each other of competence.  An observer can only determine
competence by observing the first entity's actual work, and not by
reference to the first entity's statements of competence.  There is no way
to speed that process up unless a third party intervenes to confirm the
first party's competence, and even then, the third party may be biased. 
However, once the first party is known to be *mostly* rational or
meta-rational, further statements by the first party may be taken more at
face value.

On a first meeting, however:

Any direct statement about my own competence which I generate could have
been generated by a liar or self-deceiver, and so - no matter how hard I
try - I cannot directly provide Bayesian information about my own
competence.  Indeed, statements about personal competence may be taken as
Bayesian information indicating *incompetence*.  Suppose that the genius
level is taken as being 1,000,000:1.  Suppose also that, ignoring
contextual information and intonation, the verbal utterances produced by
an actual genius saying "I am a genius" and an overconfident fool saying
"I am a genius" are identical.  Even an actual genius, if she comes out
and says "I am a genius", will be plugged into a Bayesian prior that
estimates a million-to-one chance for genius and a ten-to-one chance for
self-overestimation, producing an estimated prior of 100,000:1 that the
speaker is an overconfident fool.   If we assume that most geniuses
realize this and either lie or avoid being forced into making unsupported
honest statements about their own intelligence, the odds are even worse.

In other words, saying "I am a genius" proves that you are either
extremely smart or stupid, but the Bayesian priors indicate you are more
likely to be stupid.  This is an emergent social pressure in genuinely
rational listeners which can force geniuses to either lie about their own
self-evaluation or avoid discussing it, depending on their commitment to
honesty.

--

I <heart> the Bayesian Probability Theorem.  More and more, I have come
to realize that the Bayesian Probability Theorem exceeds even Google as
the Source of All Truth.  I also find that Robin Hanson's more recent
papers bear a remarkable resemblance to concepts that appear in "Friendly
AI".  Since self-deception and stupidity generally allow for arbitrary
factors to creep in, the fact of convergence probably implies that one or
both of us is getting smarter and less self-deceptive.

I'll take a whack at it, if only because the first thought that crossed
my mind upon reading this was, "So how does one hack it?"

First hack: insert entries for phantom/nonexistant people, or only care
about a few people and use everyone else as "phantoms".  Give the
phantoms the extreme opposite rating of what you give everyone else,
thus pushing your average rating away from the ratings you care about,
thus increasing their effect (if your own ERA is nonzero).  Potential
counters: for the inserted entries, limit ability of non-admins to
create entries for users (though this runs into problems if user
creation is automatic, for instance if there is one entry for each
subscriber to a mailing list, but someone owns a mail server and
subscribes lots of addresses from that server); for the non-caring, not
sure, but the hack itself necessitates that the effect will be limited
to a few people.

Second hack: make sure the system's not popularized, to the point that
it does not truly reflect community opinion.  This is more of a passive
failure, since the only "action" is negligence by the admins, though I
can see some ways of actively pursuing this.

That's just off the top of my head...except that a system like this
seems so simple, I think it likely that someone else has proposed
something like it, so maybe there's documentation on strengths and
weaknesses of this system somewhere on the Web.  Not sure what terms
I'd chuck through Google et al to find it, though...

A couple of months ago, I forwarded a news story to my friend

I have hope that the situation is not quite this bad.  As I hinted at briefly
in
the paper, we do have a number of reasonable candidate objective signs
of self-deception.   Let you and I first look at third parties, and find signs

which indicate which of them are more or less self-deceived.  *Then* let
us apply those signs to ourselves to see which of us is more self-deceived.

Yes, if your self-deception is flexible and foresighted enough, it might
anticipate which signs will make you look good and bias your evaluation
of third parties.  Which is a good reason to defer to other people's
research on self-deception and its signs, rather than favoring your
own spin.

This gives a glimpse of just how different it might be to live in a world

Or just converging on the same path of error.  Let us hope that like
families, every disfunctional mind is disfunctional in its own
unique way. :-)

I'm hardly asking that merely the patterns of extant people 
be preserved, but that they be able to get runtime as well. 
That's the whole issue.  As Larry Ellison apparently likes 
to remark, "Death has never made any sense to me.  How can 
a person be there and then just vanish, just not be there?"

The more that you think about it, the more senseless
death becomes, especially in light of the ridiculously
modest resources that it would require to keep someone
alive forever.  A cubic millimeter would easily suffice
for the complete emulation of quite a few people, even
at the rate of 1 second per second.

We are going around and around on this.  "VALUABLE TO 
WHOM?", I fairly want to scream.  As with some of
Samantha's earlier sentences, you seem to be looking
for a Cosmic Significance that seems to be the
Almighty under some other name.

Why should your life have to make a dent in the history of 
the universe to be valuable to you?  Or to me, or to anyone? 

For every human being who has ever lived, his or her life has
been for at least some of that time of crucial importance
to him or her.  Is there any reason that we should cavalierly
conclude that their lives aren't worth saving if we end up
with the means to do so?

Can you see what a transformation of values that cryonics 
stands for?  Nothing less than the repudiation of death for 
all sentient beings.  While many have every right to object on 
ground of (current) practicality, I can no longer understand 
why this, in principle, is objectionable to anyone.

The heart leads the mind, and if your heart were to whisper 
to you, "It's all right to live forever, and it's all right 
for everyone to live forever", can your mind really object?

Ja, and I overlooked a good way to test the routine before
anyone is entered.  Look thru the archives and collect old
posts from about 4 years ago, so that we would make up a
sort of pseudo-post-day.  The posts from back then would
be uninfluenced by the knowledge that they were being rated.
We could remove the actual names from the posts, for many
of the people who posted then are still with us.  I suspect my
own posts from 4 yrs ago are even goofier than the current
ones.  So heres the plot:

1.  Get a group of posts from this day in 1996 or 1997.

2.  Replace all the names with pseudonyms.

3.  Everything is open for this round.  Each of the players chooses
one or more of the pseudonyms, to be this person(s) temporarily.

4.  Then each person would rate all the posts in that day's
list, average the rating and enter the number in the appropriate
square.

I guess we would need to choose a day in history so we
would know how many posters we have and also the number
of players.  Four have posted me offlist that they want to play.

I propose 1 May 1997, since (I think) that was just before
extro3.  Was it?  Has anyone a link to some archives?  spike

Given my high regard for your thinking, Eugene, I find this a really
excruciating statement. 

I know you've posted material relevant to this dismissal on Cryonet, but
given Robert Ettinger's immense service to the cryonics community (founding
it, for starters), I think you need to substantiate or at least elaborate

This is an interesting statement, but I know some counterexamples to it.

The guy who ran our Brazilian office and later our whole international AI
Development Division, Cassio Pennachin, demonstrated an *amazing* amount of
maturity wisdom at age 21 when we hired him, and continued to do so over the
next 2 years.  (I know Cassio doesn't read this list, so I don't mind
flattering him...)

It always baffled me how he came by such a reserve of wisdom about
everything from system design to people management to business... his life
history, which is perfectly ordinary, doesn't explain it at all.

The diversity of human nature is well worth keeping in mind when thinking
about the future personalities of AI's.  AI systems will have vastly more
diversity than humans, one can expect, since there have got to be many very
different ways to create real AI (and many different pathways along which
eventual self-modification will lead real AIs).  Glib generalizations will
be even harder to make!!

Cynical postulate: He made a decision to rely upon the advice of 
someone(s) older and wiser, who remained in the background. 
Alternatively, could be he was freakishly advanced (in a good way) 
from a very young age and so began gathering relevant experience and 
accumulating wisdom while others his age were still sucking their 
thumbs--in which case, the wisdom *still* took time to develop, and 
he simply began earlier. Not knowing him, I can only speculate.

We're not **really** on opposite sides of the fence here.
It's just a matter of emphasis and aesthetics, I think.  Your
paragraph above describes a sort of Eganesque scenario in which
uploading is well-established, cheap, and reliable
technology, like owning a computer and being on the
Internet is today in the U.S.  If it were the year
2975 in the world of _Diaspora_, would I seek out an
Introdus portal and join the world of the polises?  Yes,
almost certainly (I'm assuming it would be a Moravec
transfer; I **don't** want to be duplicated!).  I'd
have butterflies in my stomach, but I'd do it.

> Worth preserving??? ...

> WHOM?", I fairly want to scream.

Yes, yes, yes.  I was just trying to convey the flavor of a certain
insouciance or detachment that I affect, at least on a verbal
level, and which I think I genuinely feel, about the significance
of my own life.  I understand the objections that Eliezer, for one,
has to such an attitude of detachment towards human lives, and I
admire him for it in a way, even if I can't really bring myself to
share his earnestness.  Maybe that means that I'm morally underdeveloped,
and really not a very nice person.

This detachment **doesn't** mean that I'm unsafe behind the
wheel of a car (I'm not like the brother in _Annie Hall_ ;-> ),
that I don't look before crossing the street, that I don't pay
attention to what I eat, or go to the dentist regularly, or any of
the other things that ordinarily prudent people of American middle-class
means do.  It doesn't mean that I wouldn't be damn scared to be diagnosed
with cancer, say, or that I'm not dismayed by the evidence of physical
decay that being nearly 50 confronts me with every day.  It may mean
that I can contemplate, with more equanimity than some, the
prospect of sheer nonexistence.  I did step over the edge of that
cliff once upon a time, quite deliberately (I'm not suicidal any
more; haven't been in a long time; but it does cross my mind from
time to time that if that attempt had been successful, the evidence
that I had ever existed would be almost completely expunged from the
world by now -- I would be seldom, and hazily, remembered even by the
people who knew me in 1982; it makes me feel a bit like a ghost).

It's this feeling of detachment that makes the idea of cryo, with its
air of desperate grasping at straws, of being willing to pay
a large monetary price for what seems like a pretty low
probability of payoff (and without, as I mentioned, the
possibility of avoiding discomfort on the near side, and possibly
on the far side, of death itself), distasteful to me (and, yes,
slightly comical, with media associations like _The Loved One_).
It's really just a matter of personal taste, though, and I brought it
up solely as an act of self-revelation, not in order to cast
aspersions on anybody else's choice.

Weeelll...  It's not going to be cryo that ushers in **that**
revolution, any more than Charles Babbage's difference engine
could have ushered in the Internet revolution.  Show me that
cubic millimeter of computronium you mention above, then we'll
talk ;-> .  Again, I don't want to get in anybody's face here,
but if you asked me if I honestly think anybody undergoing
cryonic suspension today has a chance in hell of being revived,
I'd have to say no -- it seems no more likely to me than that there's
some sort of Tiplerian Omega Point awaiting us all, whether
or not we want it or have bothered to sign up with Alcor (The
trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised, incorruptible...).

Not in principle, no.  I hope I don't sound like I'm
contradicting myself!

Gee Eugene, I've had more than my share of arguments with Ettinger,
he can be stubborn and unreasonable and has made me mad as hell
at times, but calling him evil seems a bit too far. And I certainly hope
he doesn't rot, unless you know a lot more about him than I do.

Thanks to Jim F. for his enjoyable post, as always.

But I do want to clear up some mistakes.

Funded by life insurance, the cost of cryonics is much
less (for most people) than the cost of a daily visit
to Burger King (and a lot healthier besides).

As for the probability of revival, Ralph Merkle puts it
at seventy percent.  I'd put it at fifty percent.  And
most of my reservation stems from my concern that social
forces may destroy the movement eventually (although
with each passing year that becomes less likely).

>It may mean that I can contemplate, with more equanimity
>than some, the prospect of sheer nonexistence. 

Yes, a number of cryonicists are just terrified of the idea.
As for me, I've already been through it.  I've spent the better
part of the last few centuries not existing, and, while I have
nothing good to say about it, at least it wasn't terrifying.
Even now, I'm already dead in every state of the U.S. except
California.  Non-existence is really no big deal, I can attest
from personal experience.

>Maybe that means that I'm morally underdeveloped,

Yes, at least having become a cryonicist propelled me in the
direction of higher ethics: universalist immortalism.

>and really not a very nice person.

Oh, pshaw.  You know very well that that doesn't follow  :-)

The Moravec Transfer, is, if I recall correctly, a comparatively early 
attempt at uploading, with the implant and all. Independently, Moravec also 
looked much farther down the road and came up with a conjecture that effects

Jim, that's like somebody asking, "Show me Grand Central Station (circa 
1935)" shortly after the developmen of the Newcommen Engine ( a pre-curson to 
Watt's steam engine). Moravec has pointed out in both Mind Children and 
Robot, that neutronium would be the mechanism of choice to generate a 
hyper-computer. In other words, this mind wold be generated by refabricating 
a neutron star! One of the may goals would be to achive an eschatology the 
"easy" way ;-)

Always a good design method.

I wonder how resistent it is to societies for mutual admiration? If
Spike and I always rate each other very highly, that ought to be able to
increase our ERA. It would become even more effective if we could get
more people into the fanclub. This doesn't need phantom people.

I guess this is part of the problem Natasha pointed out: how much we
like each other has little to say how much good stuff we actually
contribute, and is far too one-dimensional. Clique formation can
certainly happen when we deal with actual content (for example by the
formation of the "Singularity now!" gang vs "AI is hard and slow" gang
when discussing bootstrapping SI) but is more likely with the default
social behavior of humans. 


BTW, a mailing list ought to be a wonderful source of information for
automatically making a sociogram (a graph of who responds to whom,
showing the topology of discussion). It would be fun to see how this
list looks as a sociogram.

Yes, it definitely is. The only problem is implementing it - that is far

Using people as extropy-detectors is of course the best way today. One
way of detecting that at thread is interesting is that many extropic
people participate, so the thread could be weighted by the sum of the
ratings of the participating people, with some scaling for the length of
the thread. Unfortunately it is hard for humans today to distinguish
between a poster and his posts; even when judging the latter judgements
about the first creep in.

There seems to be some instability in such a ratings system:  first, a
new thread will just have the score of the originator, so it might be
hard to detect even if it is good. Also, high ranked people become more
visible and have a greater chance of being highly ranked. Here we need
some form of "conscience" in the system that balances the concentration
of ratings. 

What we must avoid is having a lot of parameters to tweak. In my
opinion, the best systems are always those that have no free parameters
because they adapt well on their own.

So, we know about the 'magical' evolved FPGA with an apparently disconnected
part which seems to use weird induction effects to function really tightly.
Within a small temperature range.  Has anyone performed the next step, of
repeating the experiment while varying the physical environment?  If you make
the FPGA suffer normal working conditions, does the result look more normal?

I also can't help thinking at if I was an evolved AI I might not thank my
creators.  "Geez, guys, I was supposed to be an improvement on the human

because I'm tied to dumb quantum induction effects.  Bite my shiny metal ass!"

The truth is always too complex to express. We can discuss just facets of it.
Incredulity is fought with solid data, solid reasoning and dialogue with a pinch
of psychology to lead the correspondent into cooperation rather than a defensive
or an offensive. The correspondent's mind model has to be understood in order to
fix it. And even if he rationally accepts your thesis, he might still defy it
because of emotional stances (laziness, hubris, etc.)

As far as psychology goes I'll give an example. If I boast my superiority, I
will repel all those who might be willing to cooperate with me. They know that
in the case of success, I will be the only one praised and known by the world.
But they too look for recognition and respect, and they might obtain more of it
by working on less important activities. A good leader gives up his own pride in
order to use pride as a motivational instrument for others.

Regardless of whether thoughts about AI will be applied to an actual AI, there
is much substance in discussion about it, and this substance can be applied to
human thought. The knowledge in the AI community is often explained more clearly
than in psychology. An useful cognitive tool I have found is that of heuristics.
Heuristics are a way of quickly findind an approximate solution to a hard
problem. People use this all the time, which is perfectly fine, as long as they
don't try to "solve" an important and difficult problem this way.

Sufficient knowledge is needed to take proper choices, in spite of intelligence.
Many intelligent people are so confident in their intelligence that they forget
about the inapplicability of their knowledge to a specific domain they're not
familiar with. It's important to estimate uncertainty apart from estimating the
most likely outcome.

Academics often work with conflicting data, and their job is to converge to
truth. The disagreement is important because is induces all the parties to
understand, defend, and explain their positions well. The time it takes is less
important than the correctness of the final result. Besides, they have different
values, and values often cannot be discussed rationally, because their role is
similar to that of axioms.

Regards,
            Aleks

They're not weird. At the high end there's no sharp distinction between
digital and analog, anyway. Things get dirty and noisy at the high end
(small/fast/clean, pick two).

I recall the exact question being asked. I don't remember hearing the
answer. Here's btw one illustration of the built-in assumption: that all
FPGA chips are identical, and that they all run under the same conditions.

Varying the temperature during run and selecting the target die randomly
would have removed the bias. It should have been a part of the fitness
function in the experiment, but it was not. Of course, because it wasn't
we've learned something interesting, natch.

Of course, this assumes we knew how to do things better. Unfortunately,
we're too stupid to make a clean design. It is probably some
Godelian-flavoured intrinsic system limitation. As I said, I'm looking
forward to tear into "A New Kind of Science". Hopefully, it's not too
overhyped.

Premiere ep of the new Aussie futurist/pop sci program AFTERSHOCK appeared
tonite, on the topic of technologically-mediated human immortality,
cunningly scheduled against ER and X FILES for minimal audience uptake.
Prominent people interviewed were our own Dr Nick Bostrom, and Prof
Elizabeth Blackburn of telomerase fame (providing a more optimistic spin on
drastic life extension than she was prepared to give me a couple of years
ago for LAST MORTAL GENERATION). It looked quite good, despite frantic
zip-attention-span graphic interrupts, and most people said sensible things
(aside from the token Uniting Church woman minister who vacuously explained
that we should be very, very careful about doing anything as, like,
lethally dangerous as stopping death).

My turn in the barrel next week, on nano.

Using our Webmind Classification System product, we could make an
extropy-detector that would agree with humans as often as they agree with
each other.  You'd need to give it training data -- a few hundred positive
and negative example of extropy-relevant messages, according to a few
different raters.

One thing that you find when doing such work is that different raters don't
agree nearly as well as you'd think about what belongs in a given category
and what doesn't...

Awesome show. Who were the four people on the panel? Sean Williams, the
uniting church woman, and two very sensible looking and quite articulate men
(Damien will kick my bum for not remembering who they were), who were
extremely pro life extension, and super-duper-tech in general. Speaking to
all the periodic grumbling on-list about the poor PR of the issues we hold
dear, I would hold this show up as a model of how to address that problem.
My only grizzle was the gee-whiz factor that went with the show, but then,
perhaps most viewers haven't spent every day for the past couple of years
yacking about the subject. Slackers!

Well, I've been trying in my own incoherent way to spark discussion
about such issues and how they fit into a pattern of increasing ULE.
Imho replacing the gov't with luddites as extropian enemy number 1 is
such a brilliant move it's hard to believe it wasn't planted by some
intelligence service. I didn't like em much when I started on this list,
but in many ways I wish the cypherpunks would come back.

It's as Eliezer (usually) never tires of stating:  explicit emotions
such as these simply do not happen unless they're designed or evolved
somehow.  Probably the toughest part is leaving behind our intuition that
where goes intelligence must go certain kinds of survival attitudes.  Now
of course, the very moment that you step forth on a new planet, and begin
to suspect that there is intelligent life, you should also being to 
suspect that it will have some kinds of emotions; e.g., you might cause
it to become angry or to experience suffering.  But artificial intelligence
isn't necessarily evolved in the way that natural intelligence is, and so
need not have such capabilities.

Well, here's what Bertrand Russell had to say about that (from "Speaking Personally:
Bertrand Russell", a 1961 John Chandos interview originally released on a two-disc
LP set, Riverside 7014, 7015):

5.  Background to National Greatness

RUSSELL:  What sort of conditions cause a nation to produce great men?
Now, I've always maintained that Shakespeare would never have written his
stuff if it hadn't been for our defeating the Armada.  I believe that the
sort of sense of successful energy that we got from that was essential to
the greatness of the Elizabethan age.  That's very disputable; it's only
a hypothesis.  I don't think it's very easy to say, but it seems to me,
looking over history, that countries which have been politically powerful
and then ceased to be, do lose culturally.  People who might be culturally
great cease to have the self-confidence that is necessary.  Because to do
anything great you have to have **enormous** self-confidence:  'Well, I'll
do this whatever people say...'  because **everybody** will say you're
wrong!

The man who thinks originally has at all times I think, in every
country and in all ages, been exposed to persecution.  Buffon, who
contributed enormously to zoology and geology, was compelled by the
Sorbonne solemnly to withdraw the opinion that some of the mountains
that now exist did not exist when the world was older.  And Vesalius,
who first dissected bodies for medical reasons, was sentenced to go
on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and lost his life through shipwreck
on the way home.  And Galileo, we know, was condemned by the
Inquisition.  And in general you may say that great innovators,
for the most part, have suffered...  Einstein, of course, had to
leave Germany.  And... it's the fate of them, but they think it
worthwhile.

I think that liberty, in many of its forms, is almost bound to be
less than it was in the 19th century or in the later parts of the
18th.  You cannot do your work as an individual, unless you
happen to be something like a poet or a...  well, it's no good
being a composer, because then you'd have to get people to
perform your music.  But a poet can be an individual still.
But most people can't.

I think the effect of the growth of authoritarianism will be
extremely unfortunate.  I think that it'll spread to other countries;
I think America, in all that we don't like, is the pattern of the
future for us -- it's what we shall be.  And I think that the
arts generally, and especially literature, will suffer very
much.  But there will always be some rebels, some who manage to
produce immortal work before they're put to death.  And that's
what we've got to hope for.

---------------------

Russell also says (in _The Conquest of Happiness_ (1930), Chapter 9,
"Fear of Public Opinion":

"It is customary in these days of psychoanalysis to assume that, when
any young person is out of harmony with his environment, the cause
must lie in some psychological disorder.  This is to my mind a complete
mistake.  Suppose, for example, that a young person has parents who
believe the doctrine of evolution to be wicked.  Nothing except
intelligence is required in such a case to cause him to be out of
sympathy with them.  To be out of harmony with one's surroundings is of
course a misfortune, but it is not always a misfortune to be avoided
at all costs.  Galileo and Kepler had "dangerous thoughts" (as they
are called in Japan), and so have the most intelligent men of our
own day.  It is not desirable that the social sense should be so
strongly developed as to cause such men to fear the social hostility
which their opinions may provoke.  What is desirable is to find ways
of making this hostility as slight and as ineffective as possible.

In the modern world the most important part of this problem arises
in youth.  If a man is once launched upon the right career and in
the right surroundings, he can in most cases escape social persecution,
but while he is young and his merits are still untested, he is liable
to be at the mercy of ignorant people who consider themselves capable
of judging in matters about which they know nothing, and who are
outraged at the suggestion that so young a person may know better
than they do with all their experience of the world.  Many people who
have ultimately escaped from the tyranny of ignorance have had so
hard a fight and so long a time of repression that in the end they
are embittered and their energy is impaired.  There is a comfortable
doctrine that genius will always make its way, and on the strength
of this doctrine many people consider that the persecution of
youthful talent cannot do much harm.  But there is no ground whatever
for accepting this doctrine.  It is like the theory that murder
will out.  Obviously all the murders we know of have been discovered,
but who knows how many there may be which have never been heard of?
In like manner all the men of genius that we have ever heard of
have triumphed over adverse circumstances, but that is no reason
to suppose that there were not innumerable others who succumbed
in youth.  Moreover it is not a question only of genius, but also
of talent, which is just as necessary to the community.  And it is
not only a question of emerging somehow, but also of emerging
unembittered and with unimpaired energy.  For all these reasons
the way of youth should not be made too hard.

While it is desirable that the old should treat with respect the
wishes of the young, it is not desirable that the young should
treat with respect the wishes of the old.  The reason is simple;
namely, that in either case it is the lives of the young that
are concerned, not the lives of the old.  When the young attempt
to regulate the lives of the old as, for example, by objecting
to the remarriage of a widowed parent, they are quite as much in
the wrong as are the old who attempt to regulate the lives
of the young.  Old and young alike, as soon as years of discretion
have been reached, have a right to their own choices and if
necessary to their own mistakes.  Young people are ill-advised
if they yield to the pressure of the old in any vital matter.
Suppose, for example, that you are a young person who wishes to
go on the stage, and that your parents oppose the wish, either on
the ground that the stage is immoral or on the ground that it
is socially inferior.  They may bring every kind of pressure to
bear; they may tell you that they will cast you off if you ignore
their commands, they may say that you will certainly repent
within a few years, they may mention whole strings of horrid
examples of young people who have been rash enough to do what
you contemplate doing and came to a bad end in consequence.
They may of course be right in thinking that the stage is not
the career for you, it may be that you have no talent for acting,
or that you have a bad voice.  If this is the case, however, you
will soon discover it from theatrical people, and there will
still be plenty of time to adopt a different career.  The
arguments of parents should not be a sufficient reasons for
relinquishing the attempt.  If, in spite of all they say, you
carry out your intention, they will soon come round, much
sooner in fact than either you or they suppose.  If on the
other hand you find professional opinion discouraging, that
is another matter, for professional opinion must always be
treated with respect by beginners."

"Don't put your daughter on the stage,
Mrs. Worthington,
don't put your daughter on the stage.

The profession is overcrowded,
and the struggle's pretty tough,
and admitting the fact
she's burning to act,
that isn't quite enough.

She has nice hands,
to give the wretched girl her due,
but don't you think her bust is too
developed for her age?

I repeat, Mrs. Worthington,
sweet Mrs. Worthington,
don't put your daughter on the stage.


Regarding yours, Dear Mrs. Worthington,
of Wednesday the twenty-third:

Although your baby
may be
keen on a stage career,
how can I make it clear,
this is not a good idea?

For her to hope, dear Mrs. Worthington,
is on the face of it absurd!

Her personality
is not in reality
exciting enough
inviting enough
for this particular sphere.


Don't put your daughter on the stage,
Mrs. Worthington,
don't put your daughter on the stage.

She's a bit of an ugly duckling,
you must honestly confess,
and the width of her seat
would surely defeat
her chances of success.

It's a loud voice,
and though it's not exactly flat,
she'll need a little more than that
to earn a living wage.

On my knees, Mrs. Worthington,
please, Mrs. Worthington,
don't put your daughter on the stage.


Don't put your daughter on the stage,
Mrs. Worthington,
don't put your daughter on the stage.

Though they said at the school of acting
she was lovely as Peer Gynt,
I'm afraid on the whole
an ingenue role
would emphasize her squint.

She's a big girl,
and though her teeth are fairly good,
she's not the type I ever would
be eager to engage.

No more buts
Mrs. Worthinton,
**nuts**
Mrs. Worthington,
don't put your daughter on the stage!

This is the usual problem with hand-labelling training data for learning 
systems. Raters can be extremely unreliable. I recall a lecture at the 
Swedish neural network society some years ago where one system for crater 
detection and classification in radar images turned out to be only limited by 
humans disagreeing on what constitutes a crater...

It would be interesting to see what webmind would be able to do with mailing 
list posts.

I think looking for an enemy number one is itself a dangerous meme - enemy 
number two can be nearly as dangerous and enemy number three will gladly team 
up with four, five and six...

Today I think the big threat against personal freedom is not coming from a 
single traditional direction, but rather from two synergetic forces. The 
first is the apparently unlikely but actually quite coherent alliance between 
governments and various NGOs based in what Virginia Postrel called stasism: 
the idea that unregulated change is bad, and either should be prevented or 
regulated. This is why we are opposed by both conservatives and liberals (in 
the American sense). The second force is the ease many corporations and 
special interests groups can get laws enacted to safeguard their 
profitability or allow politicians to appear to do something about the latest 
moral panic, while the political system does not fully comprehend or study 
the implication of these laws. Hence abominations like the DMCA which seems 
to be spreading worldwide.

The luddites in themselves are fairly harmless in this mess, they simply 
represent the reactionary green wing of the stasists and happily ally with 
technocratic stasists. The irony is of course that plenty of luddites hate 
large corporations (it is hard to love them) but they are really on the same, 
broad ideological side: change is bad, don't let people develop technology 
without supervision - but for different reasons, of course. That Microsoft 
doesn't like open source software is not really because they are evil, but 
simply because it doesn't fit their business model and it makes pragmatic 
sense to try to inhibit it. 

Being a cryptoanarchist *and* transparent society fan, I think what we need 
is both to safeguard the freedom of writing and implementing code (and other 
technology) and to push for a more open society. We need to present a 
credible alternative to stasism, demonstrate why stasism doesn't work and 
develop new political tools to make the passing of stupid/dangerous laws less 
tempting.

Nevertheless, he has a point: it'd be a real shame to spend 5 years and
big wads of cash to evolve some kind of real intelligence, and then find
out that it crashes when you bring a magnet too close to it because it
relies on some effect that you didn't worry about (or know about). Evolution
can suffer its own forms of brittleness, moreso in too simplistic
environments.

Wouldn't weighting ratings vs. one's average rating of others counter
this?  Or are you talking about mutual admiration subgroups of the
whole group being rated (which comes down to the "rate a few people who
I care about one way, and everyone else the other way to skew my
average rating of others")?

I'm sure Javien has thought of all this, and it'll be interesting to
see what they release... anyway, it sounds like the raw reputation
number should be augmented by a second number - "breadth" - to try
to give an idea how widely that "opinion" is held. If a few people
get together and rate each other to the max, but everyone else doesn't
particpate then that small group would have a low breadth. Or high
"uncertainty". I'm sure there are better terms to use, but you get the
idea. One number is probably not enough to provide a really usable
reputation system. We need stats stats stats.

We applied the Webmind Classification System (which is based on only a teeny
portion of the Webmind AI Engine, really) to messageboards a lot.

For example, we used it to divide messages on message boards into categories
defined by sentiment pertaining to specific companies, such as “bullish on
Microsoft” or “bearish on Microsoft.”

The California Internet firm NetCurrents provides its customers a companies
a daily report, produced by the Webmind Classification System, summarizing
the good, bad and the ugly that’s been said about them online that day.  You
can see the overall “sentiment index” produced from these reports at
http://www.netcurrents.com/nasdaq100.html -- a page that shows you, for each
company on the NASDAQ, “what’s the buzz” today?

I enjoyed your paper, Robin, and second Curt Adams' opinion that others (by 
which I particularly mean, of course, all those people who stubbornly 
disagree with me) would probably find reading it fruitful.  (See 
http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf or .doc.)  The exchange at the end proved 
both illuminating and amusing.

In contrast to both you and Tyler, however, I am not very troubled by the 
notion that people agree to disagree, nor--and more to the point--do I 
conclude that they therefore undervalue truth.  Rather, I regard persistent 
academic disagreements as analogous to the adversarial legal process, wherein 
opposing parties deliberately exaggerate their viewpoints in order to 
facilitate a systemic search for the truth.  I say "analogous" because I 
believe academic debates (particularly in the sciences) to tend toward truth 
more reliably and efficiently than legal ones.  To idealize a bit, academics 
defend opposing views at least in part because they see an epistemic benefit 
in preserving a diversity of opinion.  You get at this a bit, I think, in 
your paper's discussion of disagreement as a public good.

Beyond this, there remains a meta-meta-level good to persistent disagreement: 
Debating relative trivialities keeps our reasoning facilities fit for 
important issues.  Consider, for instance, that we agree about almost 
everything.  That's perhaps an odd thing to say, but only, I think, because 
we take our nearly universal agreement for granted.  Most conversation, 
particularly outside of professional and academic contexts, does not involve 
debate.  (Review, for instance, recent discussion around your household.)  We 
debate only a very few, usually not very important (e.g., sports), and 
usually not very easily resolved (e.g., theology) issues.  To give up that 
jousting would disserve the search for truth, as it prepares us to tackle the 
few important and resolvable disagreements that really matter.  Such 
disagreement is not necessarily a per se good (though I do think it proves 
harmless for the most part), nor necessarily a meta-level good (though it 
often produces a beneficial side effect of amusement), but may prove a 
meta-meta-level good by preparing us to seek truth through debate when we 
really need to do so.

Still, I agree with you, Robin (and in apparent contrast to your co-author, 
Tyler), that we should at least try to improve our reasoning methods.  I 
perhaps disagree with you, however, in thinking that we are rather unlikely 
to achieve such improvement through individual efforts; I think institutional 
changes are by far more likely to succeed.

The legal process may produce truth, but I think it safe to say that most
individual lawyers do not think of themselves as participating primarily to
produce truth.  They want to win.  Most academics, on the other hand, do think
of themselves as seeking truth, so it seems worth pointing out to them that
their behavior suggests that they also mainly want to win.

I doubt that deliberate exaggeration itself facilitates the search for truth.
The best institutions we can find using existing humans may in fact frequently
result in exaggeration.  In which case it would be negative we should accept.
But it would still be something truth-seekers would regret.  And I have my
doubts about how well existing legal and academic institutions do at promoting
truth.

I think this is just not true.  Ordinary people disagree on just about
everything, e.g., household chores, who likes who, what foods are healthy.
They disagree especially on just about any question of individual ability.
People consistently think themselves more able than others think them,
in cooking, driving, kissing, you name it.

I, personally, would like to see the list subdivided into multiple lists.
One for news, one for debates, one for party and light conversation, one for
updates about Extropians and ExI, one for projects and planning, one for
official ExI announcements, one for personal Extropian announcements, etc.
That way, each person could subscribe or unsubscribe to each type of list
they want.  One could turn on and off specific features as one gets more or
less time, or gains and loses interest.

Each person would only get those topic areas that they desired.  We could
even have the dreaded g.u.n. topic in a different list, and nonsubscribers
should never see it.  Each person would get all the e-mail for all their
interests in their mailbox as if the list were tailored for them.

I know there are better schemes for enabling better list control.  But I
think implementing additional simple mailing lists is the easiest and most
immediate solution.

Nonsense.  The most likely case is that you're a pretty smart individual
whose ego is even bigger than your intelligence.

The part about Robin's paper (http://hanson.gmu.edu/deceive.pdf) that
I have a hardest time understanding is the discussion of common priors.

I'm not sure which of the following arguments is being made, if any:

Argument A:
  If people have common priors, then upon discussion they will come to
  agreement.
  People don't come to agreement.
  Therefore people don't have common priors.
  For people not to have common priors means that they do not seek
  the truth [1].

Argument B:
  If people have common priors, *and use Bayesian reasoning in trying
  to seek the truth*, then upon discussion they will come to agreement.
  People do have common priors [2].
  But people don't come to agreement.
  Therefore they don't use Bayesian reasoning in trying to seek the truth.
  But if they really wanted to seek the truth, they would use Bayesian
  reasoning, or at least try to approximate it, and the conclusion would
  still hold.
  Therefore people don't want to seek the truth.

Argument C:
  If people have common priors, then upon discussion they will come to
  agreement.
  People do have common priors [2].
  Therefore people will come to agreement.
  But people claim not to come to agreement, and believe that they don't
  come to agreement.
  Therefore people are lying about this to themselves and others.


[1] "We are claiming that in the real world, these non-common priors
are best understood as non-truth-seeking."

[2] "And if the process of conception produces an acceptable causal
ancestry relation, then the fact that all humans share a common
evolutionary ancestor makes all humans relevant relatives. So why should
not all humans, including John and Mary, share a common prior?"


It's not clear to me whether the question of whether two humans share
a common prior is an empirical one, or a matter of definitions and
methodology.  Is it a matter of fact whether you and I share common
priors?  Or is it a question of which assumptions are most useful to
analyze our interactions?  (Or something else?)

I also don't understand the claim [1] above relating non-common priors
to lack of truth seeking, unless it is a short-hand for argument B.

Hm.  Well, I understood it perfectly.  Therefore, you should take this
into account in deciding whether or not the paper makes sense, unless you
don't think we have common priors.

Essentially, Robin's paper gives a rigorous mathematical proof that for
two people to (a) disagree and (b) maintain their disagreement after
interaction, one or both of the parties must believe that they are more
likely to be rational than the other person.  This does not necessarily
prove irrationality in *all* cases but it proves irrationality for *most*
cases.  If we take into account the evolutionary-psychology arguments,
Robin's paper makes a strong case for a built-in irrationality factor
common to all humans.

If a 100,000:1 genius is interacting with a 10,000,000:1 genius, but
neither of them knows the other's percentile, both will rationally assume
that they are more likely to be rational than the other person.  However,
Robin's paper does prove that in *most* cases, rather than in the rarer
instances where two geniuses unknowingly interact, people must be
overestimating their own rationality relative to others, or else must not
be using rigorous Bayesian reasoning with respect to what they are
licensed to conclude from their own thoughts.

Do they have to assume that the other part is *not* rational, or is it
enough that the other party is *less* rational than them?  (The first,
right?)

And by rational, you mean to be a Bayesian truth-seeking truth-teller?

Robin describes it as, "Thus the decision to disagree with someone
depends crucially on an estimate that one is more  meta-rational,  i.e.,
that one is more likely to be a truth-seeker with a rational core who
understands the irrationality of disagreement."

This suggests that being a Bayesian truth-seeker is not enough, it
is also necessary to understand the irrationality of disagreement.
Of course, since Bayesians draw all correct conclusions from existing
data, they have full, implicit knowledge of all of mathematics and hence
were completely aware of this result long before Aumann published.


One thing which is unclear in the paper is how you should react if you
become convinced that both you and the other party are both rational
and fully informed about these results.  (Or, if it seems unreasonable
to suppose that any human beings can reach this state, consider it a
hypothetical question to ask how true Bayesians would interact.)  As a
practical matter, what means do you apply to resolve your disagreement?

Obviously one of you has a more informed opinion, which is the ultimate
cause of the disagreement.  You share common priors, but you have
different information (some of which is genetic and not accessible to
your conscious mind).  How do you determine which view is more accurate?

The issue is especially difficult because the theorem not only requires
agreement to be reached eventually, but also constrains the path which
must be followed: "Even though agreement may eventually be reached,
rationality is still violated if John and Mary are able to predict
differences of opinions early in the discussion."  Seemingly this would
mean that if Bayesians John and Mary gradually move closer to an eventual
compromise that they agree upon, this violates the theorem because they
could have predicted this path.  Yet it seems obvious that something
like this must be how agreement is reached.

It seems that if both parties clearly explain their understanding about
this paradoxical result, each would be forced to accept that the other
had made at least a prima facie case for being rational enough for the
result to apply.  They should then feel mutually bound to reach agreement.

Hm, there's a notion.  So this whole thread would belong on

Actually, I have this wacky idea that says it's ethically prohibited to
apply Bayesian priors to people.  In other words, you should judge a
person's properties - intelligence levels, for example - only by
information that is directly revealing of those properties, and not
through other properties that happen to be weakly or strongly associated,
especially if those properties happen to be outside the person's direct
manipulative control.  For example, if a nine-year-old were to walk up to
me and ask a question that I would take seriously if an adult had asked
it, I am obliged to answer as I would an adult, and am not permitted to
take any action predicated on my knowledge of chronological age until the
person in question makes some statement that is actually revealing of
nine-year-old characteristics.  (Not in the sense of "being interpretable
as being revealing of youth", but in the sense of being a statement that
would *only* have been generated by a youth and not by an adult, or a very
high-probability equivalent of same.)

So if someone says "I'm smarter than you, Eliezer!" I would certainly feel
obliged to assume (or rather, act under the assumption) that the person in
question is as likely to be smarter than me as I am to be smarter than
them, at least until the person makes some other statement revealing of
actual intelligence levels, which generally doesn't take too long.

I realized after reading Natasha and Anders' responses that my
ERA proposal was heading in the wrong direction.  Its value as
a tool would be severely limited if we base it upon a chess-like
Elo rating.  The purpose of an Elo rating is to match up opponents
in a tournament, for it is no fun for either player if one stomps
the other like a cockroach.

What we are looking for is a tool that rates posts.  We tend
to jump to rating authors, for that is exactly how we choose
books, art and music.  But there may be a better way to create
filters for chat groups.  The first thing that comes to mind is
the perennial topic of subject line discipline.  Brian pointed
out the subject lines from 3 yrs ago vs now, but note that
two of the subject lines which contained my name, along
with "head throb" and "body" were actually about caloric
restriction {along with plenty of silliness, I admit}.  So part
of the problem there is subject line discipline.  Robert
Bradbury will perhaps offer some guidance on that.

A forum such as this one would benefit greatly from having
some sort of feedback mechanism.  When one is cutting up
at a party, one looks around to see if the others are enjoying
themselves and egging one on, or alternately if people are
squirmy, one knows to cut it out.  On a chat group, that kind
of feedback is mostly absent.  What we need instead of a
ERA (which would devolve into a mere beauty contest) is
a table somewhere in which anonymous volunteers could rate
individual  posts with a simple number between 0 and 5 for
their extropy value.  A running average could be calculated.
Then the time challenged could download only the
4 and 5 star posts.  spike

Isn't it great? (Really, a *hell* of a long way to go yet, but enjoyable 
anyway.)

Once cryonics becomes normal practice, we can turn out attention more 
towards other areas that need work. Spike, as an extropian, parts of your 
existing self will be absorbed by the mainstream (a good thing), but you 
can continue pushing ahead to farther and better.

Besides, someone as inspiringly goofy as you could never been considered 
truly mainstream.

I think (1) Microsoft is overreacting to what is basically a
lot of (now mostly dead) hype; (2) Linux is popular because it
fits a particular marketing niche (people who would like to
think they're "power users") and *not* because of anything
inherent in the open source development model, Microsoft
should realise this; (3) Microsoft's stance on the GPL (as un-
American) is most likely sincere, whether I agree with it or
not; and (4) I don't think open source creates better software
(but it doesn't surprise me that a bunch of hackers can make a
relatively stable version of Unix after all these years).

You don't really need to know that 

P(Ai|B) = [P(Ai)P(B|Ai)]/P(B)

(it probably doesn't help).  But it certainly helps to
consult your imagination for the following problems.

1.  There are two bags, each with 10 coins.  Half the coins
    in the first bag are counterfeit, and all the coins in
    the second bag are counterfeit.  Someone hands you a bag,
    and you happen to pull a coin out of that bag and examine
    it.  If you see that the coin is counterfeit, what is the

2.  A little girl's father discovers that his wife is
    pregnant again (but they don't know the sex of the
    unborn child).  The man decides to visit a mathematician.
    "I have two children, sir", he says, "and one of them
    is a girl.  What is the probability that the other is
    a boy?"  What did the mathematician tell him?

3.  You're on the Monte Hall show, and there is a big prize 
    behind one curtain, and junk prizes behind the other two
    curtains.  You pick one of the three at random.  Monte
    then opens one of the other curtains and shows you a
    junk prize, and asks if you still want to keep playing.
    You say, "Yes, but let me switch my choice to the other
    curtain!".  Monte says, "That's weird," but allows the
    switch.  What is the probability of your getting the big
    prize?  (As is widely known, Marilyn Vos Savant humiliated
    some experienced mathematicians with this old problem.)

4.  You wash up on a desert island where it is known that Long
    John Silver has hid a lot of gold in one of three strongly
    built shacks.  You begin dismantling one of the three.  A
    lightning bolt comes out of the overcast sky and strikes
    one of the other shacks, destroying it and revealing that
    the gold wasn't there.  What is the probability that the
    gold will turn up in the shack that you are not working on?

Hint:  one of the answers is 1/2 and the others have the same

It looks to me like this attack will provide Open Source a much-needed

I bet a lot of companies and paradigms said something along the lines of
"Microsoft's attack will only make us stronger" just before they were

But what's the system?  We're too limited to design Pentium's unaided.
Fortunately we're aided.

I also doubt an evolved AI would lead to Singularity.  Say we evolve one --
which may not be that easy, given how tortuous the path to us seems -- then
what?  We've got a cryptic mess of intelligent code.  It's more amenable to
controlled experiments and eventualy modification thatn we are, but still
pretty abstruse as far as self-modification -- the core Singularity path --
goes.  The fun stuff happens if the AI has coherent high level structure, so
mutations have large effect, and design space gets explored quickly.

And I'd avoid this fetishism of low-level evolutionary processes.  It's all
Darwinism ultimately, from gene mutations to high level thoughts.  But a child
learning chess may try to move anywhere, and be swatted away from illegal
moves.  A chess program only explores legal moves.  A human grandmaster only
explores good moves.  If she gets stuck, then she can try relaxing constraints
(although going down to genetic mutations to develop better chess players is
kind of breaking the example.)  But that's the last resort, not the first.

Max, cryonics needs an amazingly long way to go to become normal practice.
Any business conducted by so flaky methods and any medical field as
unvalidated and full of malpractice (if not regular voodoo) as cryonics is
extremely off-putting. I guess what saves it is that people don't want to
know, or like to trust authority figures.

I have also a mixed feeling about Merkle speaking pro cryonics. Sure, he's
wielding the big molecular-level reconstruction stick, but he has no
answers as to amount of information erasure during freezing or
vitrification. It is good no one is asking the hard questions yet, but
this period of respite is not infinite.

By the time these questions are being asked (not on prime time TV, but on
conferences) it would be the smart thing to know, and be ready to cite
chapter and verse on slightest provocation. It would do best to start
stockpiling the ammo now.

Open Source doesn't need a profile boost. It would have a negative impact
on software quality. It already grows too quickly for its own good.

Open Source is not a company. It is an international movement with a
considerable, and mounting momentum. Because it is autocatalytic in
regards to information delivery, software generation and distribution and
doesn't appear as a blip in legal, economical or physical space it is
largely immune to attacks conducted in that space.

Obviously, Open Source is here to stay. Whether there will be companies
riding on that momentum (or other companies mounting memetic attacks
against companies who are riding that momentum in an attempt to enhance
their market position) has largely footnote character.

Now the next thing to tackle would be Open Source hardware. It's already
there, but it needs lots of work still.

Because it is fun! OK, your creations and peers might complain, but it
doesn't take away the sheer pleasure of creating universes, life and
beings.

What a chore!  Where would these angels come from, with
the discernment to make such judgments (but nothing better
to do with all that time), the determination to actually wade
through **all** the posts, and the discipline to read them
carefully enough to give each of them a fair shake
(rather than a quick, impressionistic skim).  Surely the

Sounds like a full-time job (for pay) to me, rather

How would I know? Ask Kurzweil, Eliezer, or that Goertzel person. I'm only
interested in incremental patches to the human condition. (Btw, if you
ever do find out the technical support contact for the First Cause, please
let me know, as I have a long list of bug reports to file myself.)

Well, it's a mess. Whatever it tells us, it doesn't tell us how to build
cold, hard, clean designs, to appeal to the inner anal-retentive in us. If
anything, it tells us that stupid design by mess can come a great long
way, and is still going strong, since doesn't seem having obvious scaling
limitations. It might be not the best way do it in the long run, but I'm
content with hacking an existing system.

If anything, x86s teach us that large number of people using rational
means of design instead of noise-driven methods perform very badly. You
can only navigate in search space if you've got a very good map of said
space already. If you don't have that (at least somebody missed to give me
a copy), it's good old seat of your pants (a mix of brute force and bias,
while furiously sniffing for real or imagined gradients in the breeze).

It would be interesting to know inasmuch CPU designers are using GA for
block layout optimization, and whether statistical optimization methods
are being used at below block level.

It would be very interesting to use GA to directly mutate substrate
structure in the physics simulator, when breeding hardware CAs. Because
the cells are so simple, even the bitspray would probably find something
cool, utilizing dirt effects which human designers are not even aware of.
Doing waferscale hardware CA the VHDL way would seem to losing a lot of
performance. Heck, even a single Chuck can make a design go places people
never thought were possible in a given process, by tweaking the size of a
few (literally) hot spot transistors. Pentiums, shmentiums.

We've got a cryptic mess of intelligent code hacking itself, and the
hardware it runs on. A large population of the darn things, actually.
They'll probably be terrific physicists, because a lot of physics is
symbol manipulation, and monkeys are lousy at symbol manipulation, since
not evolved to do that well. They'll be awesome hardware hackers, too,
because coordination and control is expensive, and they're not subject to
energy and footprint constraints of biology legacy (another cubic mile of
substrate? Here you go). If you want to manipulate stuff at molecular
resolution, you need lots of fingers, and damn fast reflexes.

I other words, even rampant anthopocentrism can't prevent us from
glimpsing hints that we'd first become side players, and then rapidly
(very rapidly) diminishing points in the landscape, visibly shifting into
deep infrared and then microwave as the cruise is picking up speed.

The world *is* made from nails. Look, if you disagree, I have this neat
little argument here, to pound my point home...

I have no idea what a human grandmaster explores, actually. (As opposed to
what he tells us he thinks he's exploring). I would like to see an fMRI of
his brain while he's playing. Of course I expect a very good parallel
pattern matcher hybridized with a large position library, which would not
up light up an awful lot. But pretty much everywhere. I would not be
surprised to see a little Edelman neural darwinism for a little parallism
to drive it.

If I would want to develop a good chessplayer, I would start with an GA
ANN (which I would have to learn how to mutate first, of course), with an
8x8 chess board as retina input, and do many, many coevolutionary rounds
on a large population of virtual players playing against each other.
Occasionally plugging algorithmic and human chess opponents would be fun,
too. Of course we don't have the hardware nor can we do GA ANNs, so the
question is moot.

It is interesting to see whether a better architecture can eventually
outperform high-end foundries, with their advanced processes, but the need
to adhere to legacy designs.

Of course, having a few multiple sources of existing cores would be nice.
So far only SPARC derived designs would seem to qualify.

The Three Door Puzzle. 

The answer is: Always switch choices and take the remaining door. It
has a 2/3 chance of concealing the prize while your original choice
has only a 1/3 chance.

The fact that the host purposely picks a junk-door is the whole
trick. If the host had not purposefully picked a junk-door (and he
didn't know what was behind it), the probability would be 1/2 that you
would get the prize.

Here's a more detailed explanation... 

At the start, you have no information, and all the doors have
probability 1/3. Now, the host asks you a slightly different question:
"I'm going to give you further information about all the doors except
one. Which door do you not want to know any more about?" You choose
door one. He now gives you more information about doors two and three:
"The prize is not behind door two." Since door one still has the
original information, its probability remains 1/3. Door two has
dropped to zero; thus door three (with the additional information) has
odds of 2/3. (Credit to John Gregory at Cray Research for stating this
more detailed explanation on sci.math.num-anaysis in Summer 1995)

Microsoft's Attack on Open Source: Linus Torvalds Replies

Posted on Thursday, May 3, 2001

I asked Linus Torvalds what he thought of Craig Mundie's speech about open
source. His reply:

I guess I'm not all that surprised. The basic argument seems to be that
it's good for the economy to charge for intellectual property, so open
source software cannot be good, while Microsoft is the most far-thinking
company around and is doing it all for the good of the public.

Gee, what a surprise.

His claim seem to focus on the assertion that research and development is
founded on the principles of "the importance of intellectual property
rights". Which is entirely ignoring the fact that pretty much all of
modern science and technology is founded on very similar ideals as open
source.

When Mundie wants you to think about all the work that companies have done
in order to get patents, he also wants you to forget about all the work
done by people like Einstein, Rutherford, Bohr, Leonardo da Vinci and a
lot of other people who have done a lot more for humanity than most
companies have ever done.

And those people did it for the love of the art, not for some petty
"intellectual property rights". Yet Mundie with a straight face claims
that those intellectual property rights are the thing that drives science
and technology. He seems to think that MS has done more for the US economy
than the discovery of the electron ever did.

His "shared source philosophy" is nothing but the status quo for
Microsoft, and trying to make that status quo sound more like the open
source model.  He obviously doesn't "get" it.

The strength of open source is not the source, but the intellectual
property that goes with it - exactly the part that Mundie seems to hate so
much.  The fact that when you get involved in open source, you get equal
rights to be involved. You can be another Leonardo da Vinci, you aren't
relegated to just paying for viewing his works.

I wonder if Mundie has ever heard of Sir Isaac Newton? He's not only
famous for having basically set the foundations for classical mechanics
(and the the original theory of gravitation, which is what most people
remember, along with the apple tree story), but he is also famous for how
he acknowledged the achievement:

"If I have been able to see further, it was only because I stood on the
shoulders of giants".

One of the greatest scientists of our time, having done more for modern
technology (and thus, btw, for the modern economy) that Microsoft will
ever do, acknowledged the fact that he did so by being able to use the
knowledge (what we now call "intellectual property") gathered by others.

Mundie throws all that away, because he wants Microsoft to own it all, and
make tons of money on it.

I'd rather listen to Newton than to Mundie. He may have been dead for
almost three hundred years, but despite that he stinks up the room less.

You are too kind, Max.  {8-]

I have seen the cryonics notion go mainstream one person at a time,
because of my risk/payoff matrix I display in my office.  People get
a 1000 km stare for a minute or two, then ask how much it costs,
then say something like "Well, I don't really see any good reason
not to get frozen I suppose.  A long shot is better than no shot."

Crikey, I go to sleep for 7 hours and look what happens....

Genetically altered humans produced;

http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1312000/1312708.stm

Scientists have confirmed that the first genetically altered humans have 
been born and are healthy.
....
Genetic fingerprint tests on two one-year-old children confirm that they 
contain a small quantity of additional genes not inherited from either parent.

And also;

'Tractor beam' technology advances;

http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1310000/1310771.stm

A "tractor beam" that can reach out, trap and move objects has been 
developed by British scientists.
....
Scientists believe it will be an invaluable tool for manipulating parts of 
living cells or components of micro-machines.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The fact that these children are healthy is a big blow to those who would 
ban such research based on safety concerns.  While it's probably early days 
yet in these childrens' lives, it might force a rethink among those who've 
used this excuse as a "comfort zone".

Ja we would need some way to divide up the task.  Ten

That's a generous position, to judge each person only by their actions
rather than other attributes.  No doubt in your own case since you are
a highly unusual person, you would be frequently misjudged when other
characteristics are used.

Of course, most people are not unusual on most traits, and the reason
why people use correlations is because they usually work.  You are
discarding usually-useful information if you choose to ignore this,
but in some cases you can probably afford to do so.

I suspect that you're going to end up talking over the heads of a lot of
nine year olds with this policy.  A more practical approach would be to
ask a few clarifying questions to get an idea of the child's knowledge
and maturity before attempting to answer.  Maybe the kid really is bright
and knowledgeable and would appreciate a detailed response, but maybe he
just accidentally asked a deep question (three year olds are especially
good at this).

...assuming that you judge such a claim to be indicative of smartness,
which would presumably depend on the context.

	This is great, but how do you respond to atheist, which
comonly point out the falacy of "Pascal's wager" as an argument for
believing in God, that also claims such a "A long shot is better than
no shot." is the same invalid argument?  I tried to make a response
but I have a feeling that I could or should have had a much better
response to this assertion.

Zero.  It isn't the bag that's counterfeit, it's the coins.  ;)

That's probably because that's the weakest part of our argument :-).

We note that a list of assumptions, taken together, imply a conclusion
at odds with observation.  We do not take sides regarding which assumption
exactly is at fault.

It is a theoretical claim with empirical implications.  If we hold
constant other assumptions, we can test it.  Or we can vary other
assumptions to try to preserve it against failed tests.  This is the
usual case in modeling.

It is the weakest part of our argument - I hope to do better in the
next version.  I want to argue that believing that you are more able
that others, with no evidence to support that belief, is irrational
per se.

Yes.

As I mentioned to Curt, this is actually not true - one can describe
non-logically-omniscient Bayesians.

If you sure you were both so rational and informed, you would be
absolutely sure that any apparent disagreement was not actually one -
it was just a random fluctuation that looked like disagreement.  If
you are not sure, you can reasonably infer that apparent disagreements
are real, and so you can conclude that you are *not* both so rational
and informed.   And unless you have reason to be absolutely sure you
are rational, you should seriously doubt your own rationality.

It is far from obvious to me.  Any formal model of Bayesians exchanging
information, for example, is not like this.

<br>
</font>
<dd>Steve -- a note before I go to bed.<br>
<br>

<dd>I'm in the process of finalizing the schedule for EXTRO-5: Shaping Things to Come. I would like to confirm my understanding that you will do a presentation on &quot;Business Architectures in the Information Economy.&quot; <br>
<br>

<dd>Although most session have several speakers, I have decided to limit this one to just yourself and Prof. Hal Varian, probably with a substantial introduction by me. This means that you have longer than most other presenters, though I do want to allow plenty of time for dialogue between you and Hal Varian and the audience. This means that I can give you around 35 minutes for a presentation -- longer than most. The session is set for 2:00 to 3:45pm on Saturday July 16th.<br>
<br>

<dd>Current info is at: <a href="http://www.extropy.org/ex5/extro5.htm" eudora="autourl">http://www.extropy.org/ex5/extro5.htm</a><br>
<br>

<dd>I have also written to Naomi to confirm her presentation of the Epiture software based on a quickly created Extropy World. However, Naomi's presentation will be in a different session.<br>
<br>

<dd>Of course, given this audience, don't be afraid to speculate on the long-term future of business architectures in the information age. You have more creative freedom at Extro-5 than usual. I would ideally like to see you talk about strategic considerations based on your thinking extending from the immediate future to the longer term future.<br>
<br>

<dd>Once I hear back from you, I will put you in touch with Hal Varian so that you can coordinate your presentations so that they complement one another as much as possible, and so that you have though up good points to make in the interaction period.<br>
<br>

<dd>Please also consider what promotional materials you might want to have available in printed form on the registration table or as part of the registration package. (I am listing ManyWorlds on the conference Web site, on the assumption that you and Naomi, representing ManyWorlds, will register and cover your own expenses.)<br>
<br>

<dd>FYI, the session immediately following yours will focus on Legal Processes (including contractual relationships) in the information age. David Friedman will present, along with Nick Szabo and probably Mark Miller.<br>
<br>

<dd>I have already put ManyWorlds up on the conference site as a sponsor, but will be creating a separate, more informative Sponsors' page this weekend, if not sooner.<br>
<br>

<dd>To summarize:
<dd>-- Please confirm your participation.
<dd>-- Let me know if you have booked a hotel room (at the conference rate), or contact E. Shaun Russell &lt;e_shaun@extropy.org&gt; about that.
<dd>-- Don't forget to register (you can use the early registration rate even though it's past that date).
<dd>-- Let me know if you want me to make any changes to your bio.
<dd>-- Consider some printed info on ManyWorlds and Epiture for the registration packet or table.
<dd>-- Think about how to use this presentation as a vehicle for promoting ManyWorlds. (I do expect some venture capitalists and plenty of business critters to be present.)<br>
<br>

<dd>Thanks very much. I think you'll have a great time at the conference. I am convinced that this will be ExI's best conference since we started them in 1994.<br>
<br>

<dd>Onward!<br>

Where is the next Einstein?
http://www.freerepublic.com/forum/a3a9a59b12111.htm
Professor Lee Smolin, a visiting professor of physics at Imperial College in
London, agrees that young people find it difficult to explore fresh topics
because of the expectation that they will join a large collaborative effort.
"It's true that most of the really original work is done by individual
scientists," Smolin says. "But young people feel pressure to work on topics
that are popular because it will help their career. It's very pervasive. But
many have a strong character and do survive, although they maybe don't have as
prestigious a career as their peers. That's a terrible shame. It's hard to
imagine someone following the footsteps of people such as Roger Penrose, who
has done pretty much what he wanted to."
Smolin has noted an intriguing trend - some hard-up creative minds are relying
on private patronage from, for example, wealthy science-minded entrepreneurs.
It is a good match - entrepreneurs who have taken risks themselves have the
cash and inclination to encourage kindred spirits. An example is the Perimeter
Institute (PI), a C$100 million (£43 million) theoretical physics institute
being set up near Toronto, funded by the Canadian businessman Mike Lazaridis.
The entrepreneur is recruiting physicists known for their daring ideas.

The FYI post was meant to go to E. Shaun, but Eudora finished the address 
as "Extropians" and I didn't notice. Well, now you know what Steve Flinn 
will be talking about. At least I didn't include the attachment.

That is classical physics. Perhaps, the purpose of intelligent life is to

Totally, unequivocally CAUGHT over on this end.  Yes, this particular

If you talk over the "kid's" head (I said "nine-year-old", not "kid"),
she'll go "Huh?" or "What?" or presumably make some other comment
indicative of nonadulthood.  Until she does so, I wouldn't want to ask "a
few clarifying questions" that I wouldn't ask an adult.  Wouldn't you be a
bit offended if you asked me a question about Friendly AI and I said
"Well, do you know how computers work?"  That's one of the reasons the
ethical action differs from the Bayesian prediction - there's a
qualitatively different penalty for underestimation relative to the
penalty for overestimation.

No, I just judge the claim to be an ethical, if not Bayesian, indicator of
symmetry.  Human ethics is to some extent about the behaviors that you
implement yourself because you want them to be implemented globally, and a
global conduct needs some way of resolving symmetrical statements about
intelligence.  If a 10,000,000:1 genius confronts a 100,000:1 genius,
their Bayesian priors may be quantitatively different, but their
self-sensory experiences of cognitive structures ("It is improbable that I
will run into someone smarter than me") are qualitatively identical.

'Tractor beam' technology advances



The beam consists of a helix of twisting laser light

By BBC News Online science editor Dr David Whitehouse 
A "tractor beam" that can reach out, trap and move objects has been developed 
by British scientists. 

But while fictional tractor beams of the kind depicted in Star Trek can 
ensnare a giant spaceship, this real version works only at the microscopic 
level. 

The beam consists of a helix of twisting laser light, which is able to seize 
hold of objects as small as a protein molecule. 

Scientists believe it will be an invaluable tool for manipulating parts of 
living cells or components of micro-machines. 

Glass beads 

Dr Kishan Dholakia, of St Andrews University, said: "Our technique could be 
used to drive motors, mixers, centrifuges and other rotating parts in cheap, 
tiny, automated technologies of the future." 



The beam can rotate tiny objects
 
The researchers speculate that components like these might one day appear on 
microchip laboratories capable of performing a range of chemical and 
biological tests. 

So far, the scientists have tried out the system with glass beads 100 times 
thinner than a human hair, and a tiny glass rod which could be used for 
stirring minute amounts of liquid. 

They also used the beam to rotate a hamster chromosome to demonstrate its 
potential for studying structures inside the cell. Optical tweezers, which 
allow particles trapped in a tightly focused laser beam to be moved from one 
spot to another, already exist. 

But the devices are severely limited because they cannot change an object's 
orientation. A proper tractor beam, say scientists, must be able to rotate 
objects as well as move them. 

Just a beginning 

The researchers describe in the journal Science how they extended the 
principles of optical tweezers technology. In both systems, a particle gets 
trapped in the laser beam because some of the light refracts when it hits the 
object. 

This changes the momentum of the object, which is forced towards the spot in 
the beam where the light is most intense. 

"The beauty of our technique is that we can dictate how far we want the 
spiral pattern to go around and at what speed," Dr Dholakia said. "That means 
we can fully control the rotation of that one particle." 

He added: "We've only just begun to realise the possibilities for what we 
might do with this technology."

Cynical postulate: He made a decision to rely upon the advice of 
someone(s) older and wiser, who remained in the background. 
Alternatively, could be he was freakishly advanced (in a good way) 
from a very young age and so began gathering relevant experience and 
accumulating wisdom while others his age were still sucking their 
thumbs--in which case, the wisdom *still* took time to develop, and 
he simply began earlier. Not knowing him, I can only speculate.

If things fly apart in an accelerating manner, it doesn't matter whether

I take it, Robin, that you criticize the legal system for failing to seek 
truths about the *material facts* that give rise to legal disputes.   To be 
sure, fact-finding of that sort plays an important role in legal proceedings, 
especially criminal ones.  But the resolution of a great many legal disputes 
does *not* turn on facts about the physical world; indeed, such disputes find 
the parties stipulating to the relevant facts (e.g., motions to dismiss) or 
effectively powerless to affect the court's understanding of the facts (e.g., 
appellate proceedings).  Rather, such disputes turn on the *legal 
interpretation* of undisputed matters of fact ("common priors" in your 
usage).  And in that context I think it appropriate to say that the 
adversarial parties *do* see themselves as participating in a process 
designed to uncover truth--to wit, truth about the law.

Relatedly, I would not concede that even in legal proceedings where 
adversarial parties do aim primarily at establishing material facts that the 
salient desire to win trumps all.  A vast body of evidenciary rules and 
ethical obligations control the collection of facts in such instances.  
Granted that legal processes do not necessarily facilitate the revelation of 
all material facts (particularly in criminal cases); still, it bears 
emphasizing that such institutional features strongly discourage the 
generation of falsehoods.

A few other comments follow below.

I didn't understand the "it would be negative we should accept" bit, but I 
take it that you mean to say that truthseekers should not welcome 
exagerration because institutions relying on exagerration do not do well at 
promoting truth.  That's an empirical claim, of course, and you may be right. 
 Indeed, of all people, *you* have good grounds to claim that there are 
better institutions than extant legal and academic ones for promoting truth.  
But I would emphasize that no mere aesthetic objection to *individuals* 
deliberately exagerrating their version of the truth should serve to 
discredit an *institution* designed to, in the aggregate and thanks to 
competition between such individuals, uncover truth.  That's the sort of 
objection that newbie law students make about the law ("Why don't we all just 
hold hands and agree instead of engaging in all this unpleasant fighting?!") 
and, I daresay, the sort of objection that ignorant socialists make about 
"wasteful" economic competition.

That, too, is an empirical claim.  I can only say that I know of no 
scientific study on the issue--and that my personal experience seems to vary 
widely from yours.  Call me a laid-back Californian, but I just don't spend 
much time around the house or office arguing with people!

	Yes!  This is so true!

	I give you the perfect example of this - Steve Lehar's work on
consciousness.  Have any of you heard of him yet!?  You can read about
his work here:

	http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/pub/slehar/Lehar.html

and I have my own version of a draft of a paper supporting his theory
(I focus on the simple phenomenal qualities of this subjective world
and he focuses much more rigorously on its spatial qualities) here:

	HTML version: <URL: http://www.frii.com/~allsop/qualia.htm>
	MS Word version: <URL: http://www.frii.com/~allsop/qualia.doc>

	I wish there was a real money Idea Futures out there, and one
of these days I'm going to create an idea futures entry on this.  I'll
bet anyone, anything (that I can afford), that by 2025, Steven Lehar
will be popularly viewed as contributing at least as much to science
as Einstein.  The implications of this theory to our immediate future
and to what we are is much more profound to us than what Einstein
theorized about.  But for some reason, no one will listen to or read,
let alone publish and argue for or even against, the profound plain
and simple logic and rational contained in these works.  It is very
frustrating and unbelievable to me.

	At least Lawrence Elbaum Associates has finally agreed to
publish his book!  Perhaps now it will finally only be a few more
years before people finally understand the significance of what he is
saying about consciousness.  (Anyone want to bet!?)

	By the way, are there any AI people out there working on
representation and reasoning about visual 3D data?  I bet if you apply
some of Steven's models to an AI visual system, you'd fairly easily
get one mondo powerful system with near as much 3D visual common sense
awareness and intelligence as we have!  And I bet once this is
achieved more abstract general common sense, like we have, will soon
follow using similar models of information representation.  I'd love
to hear an expert on AI visual representations thoughts on such ideas.
For more detail see Steve's papers including: "Computational
Implications of Gestalt Theory: The role of Feedback in Visual
Processing" here:

	http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/pub/slehar/webstuff/consc/consc.html

	Anyone willing to take me up on a bet!?  People don't seem
willing to read our papers.  Perhaps they will try to take our money
and make us rich!?

I take it, Robin, that you criticize the legal system for failing to seek 
truths about the *material facts* that give rise to legal disputes.   To be 
sure, fact-finding of that sort plays an important role in legal proceedings, 
especially criminal ones.  But the resolution of a great many legal disputes 
does *not* turn on facts about the physical world; indeed, such disputes find 
the parties stipulating to the relevant facts (e.g., motions to dismiss) or 
effectively powerless to affect the court's understanding of the facts (e.g., 
appellate proceedings).  Rather, such disputes turn on the *legal 
interpretation* of undisputed matters of fact ("common priors" in your 
usage).  And in that context I think it appropriate to say that the 
adversarial parties *do* see themselves as participating in a process 
designed to uncover truth--to wit, truth about the law.

Relatedly, I would not concede that even in legal proceedings where 
adversarial parties do aim primarily at establishing material facts that the 
salient desire to win trumps all.  A vast body of evidenciary rules and 
ethical obligations control the collection of facts in such instances.  
Granted that legal processes do not necessarily facilitate the revelation of 
all material facts (particularly in criminal cases); still, it bears 
emphasizing that such institutional features strongly discourage the 
generation of falsehoods.

A few other comments follow below.

I didn't understand the "it would be negative we should accept" bit, but I 
take it that you mean to say that truthseekers should not welcome 
exagerration because institutions relying on exagerration do not do well at 
promoting truth.  That's an empirical claim, of course, and you may be right. 
 Indeed, of all people, *you* have good grounds to claim that there are 
better institutions than extant legal and academic ones for promoting truth.  
But I would emphasize that no mere aesthetic objection to *individuals* 
deliberately exagerrating their version of the truth should serve to 
discredit an *institution* designed to, in the aggregate and thanks to 
competition between such individuals, uncover truth.  That's the sort of 
objection that newbie law students make about the law ("Why don't we all just 
hold hands and agree instead of engaging in all this unpleasant fighting?!") 
and, I daresay, the sort of objection that ignorant socialists make about 
"wasteful" economic competition.

Brent Allsop asked, in effect, "How do you respond to an atheist
who points out a similarity between believing that cryonics might
work (it's a better chance than nothing) and believing in Pascal's
wager (you have everything to win if He does exist, but nothing
to lose if He does not)?"

The two cases aren't parallel, I would say.  In the first place,
Pascal asks for one to be intellectually dishonest, or to achieve
double-think.  If you don't believe that there is a God, then how
can you, by an act of will, change that and come to believe?  Let
me illustrate:  Suppose you heard a knock on your door, and someone 
appeared who would really give you a million dollars on one tiny
condition.  All you have to do is believe that your computer is
an elephant.  Could you do it?  Not unless you are a lot better
at double-think than I am.  If I really, really needed the money,
then I might try very hard, but I don't think that I could
honestly tell him that I believed it.

To get signed up for cryonics, on the other hand, all you have to
do is to believe that it **may** work.  This you either already
do, or you already don't.  No meta-argument about what you should
believe can change that.  What might change that is getting more
information.

I also think that there are other formal differences between
Pascal's wager and belief that cryonics may work.  But they're
less striking and less important.

Attach a voting URL to every post, while keeping it plain text
(http://blah.blah.net syntax in body buffer is recognized as
special by most emailers, allowing you to trigger an action
upon said pseudotag). Alternatively, you can convert plain
text to HTML, if (foolish) subscriber has so (explicitly) 
requested.

Whover wants, can act upon the tag.

Yet the brain is modular, or at least specialized.  There's a part key to
recognition of human faces.  There are parts key to different parts of
language.

Of course, the APIs are probably non-existent.  But so far the brain doesn't
really tell us much of anything, because we've barely started figuring it out.
We're still developing the tools to measure with.

E.g. Pinker's _Words and Rules_, exploring how language works in the brain
just from mistakes in using the past tenses of irregular verbs.  Proving to my
current satisfaction that we do have rules, an unconscious syntax and use of
variables not well captured by current neural network models.

But you accept some sophistication with your hammer, you find that some
"nails" go in much more quickly and securely with a screwdriver.

We do know that normal players, when they make mistakes in replicating a
board, will shift a piece one square or something like that.  So the board
looks similar physically, but may be rather different in game terms.  A
grandmaster who makes a mistake makes a bigger difference in where pieces are,
but preserves more of the game balance.  Clearly she's thinking differently
than the normal player; she's got a high-level conceptual _sense_ which the
player doesn't.  

I just don't like to see this defeatism about the human brain, and early
turning to the blind idiot god of natural selection[1].  Yeah, selecting on
bitspray can work, but selecting on higher-order stuff is much cooler and
faster.

[1] Lovecraft reference.  "Azathoth, the blind idiot suzerain of the universe,
gibbering madly at the center of all things."  I've thought that's a wonderful
metaphor for natural selection.  The gibbering can be the random mutations.

I don't think Yog-Sothoth maps to anything real.  Laws of physics, maybe.

In Pascal's Wager, you pay a significant price - altering your
beliefs, style of living, morals, et cetera - which is a significant
cost if the bet is wrong.  With cryo, the low prices mean you *don't*
pay a significant cost; the cost is also easily quantifiable in
dollars, unlike what Pascal asked.  Plus, the reward (if cryo pays off)
is less than infinite (it being standard practice to quantify the value
of a human life in these sorts of situations these days), as opposed to
the supposedly infinite benefit of Heaven, so it is possible to
rationally calculate the cost/benefit ratios (subject, of course, to
how much value you place on your own life).

It's possible that more advanced civilizations try
to achieve reversibility.  It might be kind of an
"ecologically" or "environmentally" friendly way to
calculate.  Primitive civilizations, like ours, might
be forgiven for charging ahead irreversibly.

But I think the same way about trying to avoid entropy
(with reversibility, say) as I do about worrying too
much about resource consumption.  We hardly know anything
yet; after we get some Dyson shells going around a few
stars we can wonder whether we ought to try computing our
civilization reversibly.

So while intelligence is possible without entropy increases,
it doesn't seem worth the effort.  I'm sure that people and
probably most life represent an increase in entropy production
from what it would have been if life weren't around, e.g., the 
Berserkers get their way (Jim F. and Damien will doubtless
know what I'm talking about).

I don't think that "Extropy" should ever be taken to mean
literal, explicit avoidance of entropy.  Au contraire.

I remember some of Tipler's arguments, and the discussions we had around 
the topic, though I won't claim to have worked through the physics in 
detail.  My recollection is that if you can make local areas with 
sufficient density, you can get a lot of work done.  If global density goes 
to zero, I think I remember that it gets hard to gather sufficient material 
anywhere.  If the global density asymptotically approaches some non-zero 
limit, I thought there was a chance to make islands of sufficient density.  
Am I misremembering the argument?  Did Tipler assume (or conclude) that you 
needed to have *all* the material in the universe collapsing in order to 
get omega-point effects?

Well actually for Web developers like me Linux is a far better product. .asp

Do you use much open source software? I absolutely prefer it, as open source
software is made to cooperate with other software, where the big point in
proprietary software is to close the gates.

When I upload I shure hope it wil be on an open source systen and not some
MS paperclip.

In a nutshell, Pascal's Wager suffers from having the potential for 
infinite mutually-exclusive choices, only one of which is correct, at a 
finite cost.  Therefore, the expected benefit must approach zero when 
applied to the entire space of possible religions.  With cryonics, you have 
a very finite number of choices for a finite price.  While the potential 
reward isn't infinite with cryonics, the cost/benefit ratio is much more 
favorable.

         You can't stick a postfix next to a variable these days
         without causing the imminent collapse of society. The day
         after US assistant attorney Daniel Alter told a New York court
         that DeCSS was like "software programs that shut down
         navigational programs in airplanes or smoke detectors in
         hotels" (you know, *those* programs), Microsoft's CRAIG MUNDIE
         was across town, declaiming that the GPL was a virus that
         would shut down intellectual property inside people's heads.
         Craig's speech is all about the nightmarish future of an open
         source world, and is rather heavy on predictions. But then
         Craig's job at Microsoft is to make gambles on the future of
         technology. According Marlin Eller's account in "Barbarians
         Led By Bill Gates", one of Mundie's first acts at Microsoft was
         killing the company's 1993 low-bandwidth Net project in favour
         of the *real* future - broadband interactive TV. That said,
         once Gates caught on to this Interweb thing, Mundie was first
         to catch on. "We'll tune it for all the platforms, then get
         hardware companies to build accelerators for it", he
         predicted, of the Net's most guaranteed success - VRML. Oh,
         then he masterminded that whole WebTV deal, spending $425m MS
         mad money on the sure-fire Internet/TV convergence. "We view
         the Internet as one of the 'features' of digital TV services",
         he eerily prophesised in 1998. "PC this year, PC-TV's next
         year", he again predicted - in 1997. Going further back,
         Mundie features in "Soul of a New Machine" as the nameless guy
         who loses the race to build a supercomputer. His own
         supercomputer company went bust in 1992. Should anyone believe
         his observations about the future of Open Source? As Mundie
         himself once said "We persist. We're driven by some innate
         belief about how these things are going to unfold." Even, it
         seems, when they unfold in completely the opposite
         direction.

I would be willing to bet against you -- I have very strong doubts that 
Steven Lehar will ever contribute as much as Einstein did.  Without getting 
involved in yet another discussion on this, most of this work seems to be 
based on some rather slippery assumptions that don't always follow.  Every 
time I read this stuff my BS meter spikes, largely because the definitions 
of poorly defined words appear to change to suit the argument of the 
author.  If you nail down all the definitions, the reasoning fails.

Perhaps a lot of people *have* read the "profound plain and simple logic 
and rational contained" in those works and found it lacking like I have -- 
you have to at least consider it.  For me, the lack of a strong argument 
serves to support my default position that it is not material to anything I 
need to care about.

No offense, but you push this stuff like a religious person pushing 
God(tm).  If I don't believe what you are selling me, the product appears 
to be a weak argument, therefore the obvious solution (from your 
perspective) is for me to suspend reason and experience The Truth(tm) so 
that I can believe.  While convenient for the person selling, it is an 
absurd proposition to a potential new buyer (essentially being nothing more 
than a "free" hit on the dealer's crack pipe).

I've read articles about extraordinarily capable non-AI systems that can 
hypothesize and model complex 3D spaces from 2D input.  The algorithms are 
there, so it seems that any generic AI could use the data to great 
effect.  I don't think awareness and knowledge of 3D spaces has any 
intrinsically special nature.

	Lee Corbin pointed out the difference in costs between the
cryonics wager and Pascal's wager (Although I might disagree with him
with his assertion that the Cryonic win is less than infinite) and
James rogers pointed out the fact that Pascal's wager suffers from
"having the potential for infinite mutually-exclusive choices, only
one of which is correct, at a finite cost.  Therefore, the expected
benefit must approach zero when applied to the entire space of

also.

	Thanks for all of these responses!  I tried to put forth most
of these ideas in my response, yet not quite so eloquently.

	It also seems to me that fundamentally, there is a good and
valid idea in the idea of Pascal's wager.  It's just that it is
poorly applied when considering the existence of God, and is much
more appropriate and does validly apply to Cryonics!?

LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
Stem cells from postmortem brains yield new life

Visitors to the "What's Hot" section of the Life Extension Foundation's
website may recall a summary of an abstract presented at the November 2000
annual meeting of the Society for Neuroscience which reported research
conducted by a team from the Salk Institute in LaJolla, California who
showed that stem cells derived from cadaver brains could be cultured,
frozen, and recultured.  Stem cells are unspecialized cells that give rise
to differentiated cells, which may be able to help repair injured or
diseased tissue. This research, coauthored by neuroscientist Fred Gage,
was published this week as a Brief Communication in the journal Nature.
Dr Gage and colleagues described how tissue was taken from an eleven week
old postmortem brain and from a surgical biopsy removed from a
twenty-seven year old brain.  Sections from the motor cortex, hippocampus,
corpus callosum and ventricular zone were prepared and cultured in a
medium containing growth factors.  All of the tissue samples yielded
neural progenitor cells, with the highest yields from the hippocampus and
ventricular zone.  For longterm storage, the cells were cryopreserved in a
10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) medium.  Cells from the eleven week old
tissue sample completed over twice the amount of population doublings than
the twenty-seven year old tissue before showing signs of a significant
decline in growth rate, defined as aging.  Neurons were spontaneously
generated at all stages with more complete differentiation of the cells
seen when the growth factors were replaced with forskolin and retinoic
acid.

Of the twenty-three brain samples similarly cultured so far, a twenty hour
period is the longest postmortem time from which the researchers have been
able to successfully culture cells.  Cells cultured from younger donors
have been found to yield a greater number of neurons.  Further research in
this area could develop an alternative to embryos as stem cell sources.

Another article published in the May 3 issue of Nature summarized research
published in the May 4 2001 issue of the journal Cell, in which stem cells
derived from bone marrow have been found to have "regenerative powers
greater than any previously found."  While previous stem cell research
used whole groups of bone marrow cells, this research was able to
specifically identify stem cells, which make up one in 100,000 bone marrow
cells.  When injected into bone marrow free mice, the stem cells migrated
to the bone marrow and their offspring were incorporated into lung,
intestine, skin and stomach.  Research team member Diane Krause of Yale
University School of Medicine commented, "This is the most astounding
adult stem cell to date.  It blows me away that organ repair is going on
constantly from bone-marrow-derived cells."

More research is needed to determine how to direct stem cells to specific
parts of the body.  The researchers believe that the stem cells may be
comparable to embryonic stem cells.  These and other sources may avoid the
dilemma of using embryonic stem cells and help to advance research that
could be otherwise politically curtailed.

WHAT'S HOT
Dried human cells brought back to life

In researched published in the April 21 2001 issue of New Scientist
Magazine, scientists at the Virginia Tech Center for Genomics in
Blacksburg, Virginia reported drying kidney cells and rehydrating them
eight days later to observe half of cells resume normal reproduction. The
technique, developed by researcher Malcolm Potts, is based on the
observation of a cyanobacterium that can dry out and survive for centuries
on rock surfaces by surrounding itself with a substance called glycan that
protects cell membranes by forming a coating over the cells. Potts and
colleague David Helm purified glycan and combined it with human kidney
cells, then dried the cells at room temperature. After eight days, 50% of
the cells recovered from drying and began dividing, a remarkable feat as
human cells usually die within seconds when deprived of water. Potts
announced at a Society for Experimental Biology meeting held this month in
Canterbury, England, "It's a breakthrough. By applying the techniques we
have found in cyanobacteria, we can dry out human cells. It's very
exciting."

In a New Scientist article published last year, a researcher at the
University of California, San Diego reported that human cells dried for
five days had been revived, but the cells had to be first genetically
modified to produce trehalose, a sugar that protects cells against
freezing and drying from the inside. The newest technique utilized
nonmodifed normal cells.

The technique may have many possible uses such as prolonged storage of
blood products and enhanced shelf life for vaccines and antibodies. The
Virginia Tech researchers hope that in the future tissues and organs could
be dried and revived, but they don't believe that this will be achieved by
the use glycan alone. Potts stated, "In the end it's bound to require a
combination of different approaches."

FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK
Chronoforte

A large body of published evidence has now established that oxidative
modifications of proteins [carbonylation, etc.] occur during aging and in
a variety of pathophysiologic conditions, many being neurodegenerative
diseases including Alzheimer's disease.

Carbonylation is caused by aldehydes that can be neutralized by
supplementation with carnosine and by increasing glutathione at the
cellular level with alpha lipoic acid.

In addition to protecting against carbonylation, it is crucial to maintain
youthful mitochondrial energy production and immune function.
Acetyl-l-carnitine facilitates cellular energy production, while nettle
leaf extract suppresses high levels of a pro-inflammatory cytokine called
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) believed to be a cause of immune
senescence (decline of the immune system in aging).

ChronoForte is a multi-ingredient anti-aging supplement that provides the
best documented nutrients to protect against carbonylation and a host of
other newly identified aging factors.

NADH

Enada NADH is a coenzyme, antioxidant form of vitamin B3 developed by
Georg D Birkmayer MD, PhD, and world renowned biochemical researccher.
NADH is a naturally occurring coenzyme found in all living cells and is
necessary for cellular development and energy production. Enada NADH is
absorbed by the body and enhances your ability to restore the body's
cellular energy source. Enada is a supplement for people whose lifestyle
demands more energy. Healthy people taking NADH can experience improved
alertness, concentration and overall energy enhancement.

LAST DAY OF BLOOD TESTING SALE, May 5 2001

The high cost of blood testing keeps most people from discovering
correctable risk factors that could predispose them to developing
degenerative disease. The Life Extension Foundation broke down these high
price barriers years ago by offering discounted blood tests directly to
the public. Please note that our retail prices are lower than what most
commercial laboratories and doctors charge. Until May 5, 2001, The Life
Extension Buyers Club is offering an extra-special member discount on all
blood tests.

Foundation members residing in South Florida can have their blood drawn at
the Life Extension Nutrition Center located at 1100 Commercial Blvd. in
Ft. Lauderdale. Those residing outside of South Florida now have access to
hundreds of licensed blood drawing stations. For information about blood
testing or directions to any of these blood drawing stations, call
1-800-208-3444.  When you place your order, you will be sent by a list of
blood drawing stations in your area. After your blood is drawn, the final
test results will be mailed directly to you.  To order blood tests, go to
http://www.lef.org/cgi-local/welcome.cgi/id=151063851/sgroup_id=699/welcome.

	Cool!

	OK, let me see if I can start to propose some of the details
for such a bet.

	First off, there are at least two issues here.  #1, will
something like Steve's theory turn out to be true (and proved by
science by 2025) and second, will people, 25 years from now, Consider
Steve Lehar to be as famous as Einstein.

	I wouldn't mind betting $100 on both of these.

	For the first one, how about something like this:

1: By 2025, science will demonstrate that we are not consciously
directly aware of anything causally upstream from our 5 basic senses,
but rather there is a 3D world inside of our head, produced by our
brain, constructed of the conscious phenomenal and spatial qualities
that exist in our conscious awareness.  "The pain isn't in the toe, it
is in the phenomenal toe in your head".  Science will have made a
significant paradigm shift to include looking for more than simple
causal properties of nature.  This will including observation and
classification of the phenomenal qualities we all subjectively
experience in consciousness, and hopefully the discovery of new qualia
not yet experienced by any human.  The primary proof of all this being
actual "effing" of to date "ineffable" phenomenal qualities, as
described in my paper "A Qualia theory of Consciousness".  People and
Machines will be experienceing and hence saying things like: "Oh
That's what salt tastes like!" by 2025.  And because of this we will
have much more than a mere causal Turing Tests to know if other
conscious minds truly exist and what they are like...

	And for the second one, how about something simply like:

2: By 2025, Steve Lehar, because of his work with consciousness, will
be popularly considered as one of the great scientists of all time,
in a league with Einstein.

	Can you think of any ways to improve these descriptions to
make a better, more concice, easer to judge bet?

	Are there any others out there?

It is actually worse than that. The horizons are going to creep inwards,
making the island smaller and smaller. Eventually everything gets
separated from everything else.

Dyson once remarked that he found closed universes claustrophobic, but
give me a Taub-like collapse any day instead of creeping horizons.

(1)  I find Pascal's Wager somewhat ironic in that many Christians consider 
gambling sinful, or at least a sign of weak character.

(2)  Pascal assumes that Materialism/Atheism and Catholic Christianity are 
the only options.  But in the real world of human history and culture, it's 
extremely unlikely that one gets born in a predominantly Catholic society.  
For example, a few months back I met a graduate endrinology student who had 
grown up in a Zoroastrian household (parents having migrated from Iran to 
the U.S.), and I realized that it's only a historical accident that people 
in Western Europe inherited the Judeo-Christian set of arbitrary beliefs 
about the supernatural instead of  those of other religions.  Perhaps if 
Alexander the Great, and later the Muslims, hadn't been so effective in 
persecuting the Zoroastrian religion, Western philosophers and theologians 
would have spent their lives debating arguments about the existence and 
theodicies of Ahura Mazda versus Ahriman.

(3)  As for cryonics, I suspect that we aren't going to get a set of 
discrete outcomes as simple as life versus death.  The patients' 
revivability and identity-conservation are going to fall into some kind of 
distribution from poor to excellent.

I'm surprised you say that; your paper seems to come down pretty hard
against the assumption that people seek the truth, in the title and
in most of the last part.

I've been reading some of the papers in your references, and the way
I see it now is that there is a process which must occur in order for
everyone to be mutually informed about each other's beliefs.  If the
parties state their beliefs for the first tiem and they don't match,
that is fully compatible with the theorem.  It just means that they have
different information.

However they are not yet fully mutually informed after this exchange,
because one or both of them may have or will have updated their internal
models based on this information.  The paper "We Can't Disagree Forever"
describes contrived scenarios where the two parties can just shout
their differing beliefs at each other N times, then suddenly at time
N+1 they both agree.  This is fully rational because each exchange
actually updates the internal model of what the other person knows,
and the models are gradually converging even though the stated opinions
don't change until the end.

When I was asking about disagreement above, I was talking about the
initial stage in this process, when you first discover that you have
different posterior beliefs.  What is the best approach to resolve
the dispute?  The methods I have seen so far (as in the paper above)
are quite impractical for human beings to apply IMO as they seem to
require excessively detailed knowledge about the state of the world.

I have come up with a more straightforward plan, which is, if both parties
are sincere and honest, for each party to estimate the confidence level he
has in the accuracy of his belief.  He would also need to keep statistics
about how often he has been right in the past on other beliefs where he
had this same subjective level of confidence.  Based on this the parties
can come up with a probability that each is right, and choose the belief
with the higher probability.  (Or perhaps they should choose the belief
which maximizes their joint probability, something along those lines.)

As a rough rule of thumb, you might just accept the belief of the player
with the higher Idea Futures score, or better, use a subscore which is
based just on claims similar to the question at hand.

Yes, the Geanakoplos paper above also didn't work in this way which was
intuitive to me, so I guess it is not really how things would go.

Interesting enough there is a modest article in Popular Science (may 2001)  
that covered some hypothetical  "drives" that would extend the passage of 
matter and information, well past light.  I like the notion that however fast 
the cosmos accelerates, we will find our way to the "edge" of the expansion 
and manipulate it. There will be counter-arguments to this, but I suspect 
nothing conclusive, scientifically. I hold to Kurzweil's conjecture, that 
whatever forces the  universe produces; gravity, electromagnetism, the weak 
nuclear force, or the strong nuclear force, they will all, ultimately, 
crumble before intelligence.

Genetically altered babies born




By BBC News Online science editor Dr David Whitehouse
Scientists have confirmed that the first genetically altered humans have 
been born and are healthy.

Up to 30 such children have been born, 15 of them as a result of one 
experimental programme at a US laboratory.



An "unwelcome" development say scientists

But the technique has been criticised as unethical by some scientists and 
would be illegal in many countries, including the United Kingdom.

Genetic fingerprint tests on two one-year-old children confirm that they 
contain a small quantity of additional genes not inherited from either 
parent.

The additional genes were taken from a healthy donor and used to overcome 
their mother's infertility problems.

Germline modification

The additional genes that the children carry have altered their 'germline', 
or their collection of genes that they will pass on to their offspring.

Altering the germline is something that the vast majority of scientists deem 
unethical given the limitations of our knowledge.

It is illegal to do so in many countries and the US Government will not 
provide funds for any experiment that intentionally or unintentionally 
alters inherited genes.



There is no evidence that this technique is worth doing

Lord Winston
The children were born following a technique called ooplasmic transfer. This 
involves taking some of the contents of the donor cell and injecting it into 
the egg cell of a woman with infertility problems.

The researchers, at the Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Science of 
St Barnabas in New Jersey, US, believed that some women were infertile 
because of defects in their mitochondria.

These are tiny structures containing genes that float around inside the cell 
away from the cell's nucleus, where the vast majority of the genes reside. 
There can be as many as 100,000 of them floating in the cells cytoplasm.

Two mothers

They are essential to cellular energy production and scientists suspect they 
have many other important but as yet unappreciated roles.

Mitochondrial DNA is passed down from generation to generation along the 
maternal line.

The US researchers wanted to supplement a woman's defective mitochondria 
with healthy ones from a donor.

Having just tested the children born as a result of this procedure, the 
scientists have confirmed that the children's cells contain mitochondria, 
and hence genes, from two women as well as their fathers.

Writing in the journal Human Reproduction, the researchers say that this "is 
the first case of human germline genetic modification resulting in normal 
healthy children".

'Great reservations'

British experts have severely criticised the development.

Infertility pioneer Lord Winston of the Hammersmith Hospital in London told 
BBC News Online that he had great reservations about it.

"Regarding the treatment of the infertile, there is no evidence that this 
technique is worth doing," he said. "I am very surprised that it was even 
carried out at this stage. It would certainly not be allowed in Britain.

"There is no evidence that this is a possible valuable treatment for 
infertility," he added.

Lord Winston said that, although the number of additional genes involved was 
tiny, it was in principle the wrong thing to do.

The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), the body that 
monitors and regulates UK reproductive medical activities, told BBC News 
Online that it was aware of the technique but had decided not to allow it in 
the UK because of its uncertainties and the possible alteration of the human 
germline.

'Back door'

The HFEA said it was an unwelcome development that "adds additional concern" 
to their worries. US researchers have also criticised the production of 
genetically altered children.

Eric Juengst, of Case Western Reserve University, said: "It should trouble 
those committed to transparent public conversation about the prospect of 
using 'reprogenetic' technologies to shape future children."

The US Government Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee told BBC News Online 
that the researchers had carried out this work without government money.

The committee said that in no circumstances would it consider any request 
for government funds that would result in modification of the human 
germline.

Professor Joe Cummins, of the University of Western Ontario in Canada, told 
BBC News Online: "Now is not the time to bring in human germline gene 
therapy through the back door."

To your excellent observations I'd add that Pascal's Wager pays off best to

Just heard news report of artificial mini-chromosomes built by Melbourne
researcher Richard Saffery. Stable for six months of in vitro replication,
they look to be a better vector than viruses for inserting repaired genes
(they can hold much larger genes). These `hacks' are 1/50th the size of
natural chromosomes, and built around a more tractable centromere, found in
the genome of a patient with a mental defect. (`Don't use the mad brain, Dr
Frankenstein! I said-- Aaargh!') Egad.

I have seen this plan put into action many times.  In a conversation
between certain old friends, interruptions are encouraged and enjoyed.
But a moment sometimes comes in which each is rather certain, based
upon intuition honed over many years, that what he has to say will
be the more important.  So he raises the ante by raising his voice.

It's exactly like you were playing poker, and you were pretty sure
that you held the higher cards.  At some point however, when your
opponent (in that case) stakes enough, your confidence begins to
waver.  You begin to suspect, again based on a very great amount
of past performance, that probably your opponent is holding the
higher cards.

And it turns out to be the same in the discussion; one yields the
floor at some point, and, in the happy cases that I've seen, is 
rewarded by an especially valuable insight from the other, and
there indeed was a tendency for the final speaker to have the
slightly more important point.  (Especially since there is no
bluffing, which you have noted by specifying that the parties
"are sincere and honest".)

So this puts into action precisely the plan that you suggest.

Massive speedups of computing power will have the same effect, but
need hardly wait millions of years to happen.  Supposing, as seems
extremely reasonable, that the speed of light is a constant, matter
will begin to develop so quickly so locally that the horizons
separate any two given nodes of sentience just as you suggest.

To a creature for whom a nanosecond is like a second to us, light will
appear to move less than one mile per hour.  Distant regions of the
solar system will appear so remote that intellectual commerce might
almost completely disappear.  Some concrete exceptions can be forseen,
though.  Suppose for instance that it becomes known that matter at the
distance of Saturn has been working out the Ramsey numbers smaller than
(10,10) since "practically forever".  It may be probable that it will
be  more worthwhile to wait for their broadcast rather than complete
the computations locally.

But the most extreme exponents of the singularity will deny even this;
the capability for local computation in their scenarios explodes so
fast that within some finite time t any given calculation or
deliberation can more effectively be done locally.

Yes. But I really shouldn't have phrased it this way for several reasons.
One is that we are probably alone in the visible universe.  But more
importantly, what I was getting at is this: suppose that in the long run
entropy really is the enemy.  Then thousands of years from now it may
behoove us to become reversible.  Reversible calculations, of course, do
not increase entropy.  Yet intelligence and a continually developing
civilization would not be compromised.  (A nice problem, which I think
that I know the answer to, is, "are conscious reversible Turing machines
also conscious when run backwards?")  By becoming reversible, our
civilization might lenghten its total life span, if Dyson and
Tipler turn out to be wrong about the universe sustaining infinite
computation.

I have not been entirely successful in resolving the relationship
between life and entropy (perhaps some here can help).  We say 
thermodynamically that the energy generated by the sun (which
drives almost everything else in the solar system) is finally
dissipated to deep space, and stops off only briefly on Earth.
Here (and soon throughout the solar system) it supports the creation
of ordered structures.  So at first glance, life and entropy might
seem unrelated (given the final entropy production between the sun
and deep space).  Yet the non-trivial amounts of order created on
Earth may have to be included in the equation.

Consider the shadow on the distant stars the Earth makes.  It's
easy to see that life on Earth may accomplish energy storage,
so why not neg-entropy storage?

Certainly the energy storage of prehistoric times (mostly in oil
I would think) is currently being used for the creation of highly
ordered artifacts in the human sphere (or noosphere of de Chardin,
I suppose that we should confess).  Coming up shortly will be
massive energy expenditures in fusion and fission, which are 
star power rather than sun power.   But on the whole, (a) has life
lessened the overall entropy production?  (b) is man's present
and future enormous energy consumption, which will be used to
create even more order, hastening or hindering entropy production
in the solar system?

Oh yes, another more important point.  In Pascal's wager is the
unstated assumption that you can actually control what you
believe.  The notion is that to be saved by god, you must believe
in him/it.  Well, what if you decide the evidence is lacking?  Have
you any choice, can you choose to believe?  I believe we cannot
control what we believe.  No choice.  spike

The way I would go with that is that religion incorporated offers
no shot at all, merely an illusion of a shot at an afterlife.  With
every scientific discovery, we find new possibilities for how
science incorporated might help reanimate corpsicles.

Heres one I tried today: if you took the computer that is
sitting in front of you right this minute and put it in a time
machine, sending it back one hundred years, you could
collect the *very best minds* in the world of that time, show
them the machine and what it can do, and *not one* of
them would have the foggiest clue how it works.  They
could take it apart, examine every piece, and the best
scientists of 1901 would be quite profoundly baffled.

Likewise 100 years from now there will be machines
that even the most insightful among us will declare
indistinguishable from magic.

So Pascal himself would surely agree, were he living today,
that the modern person's best bet is with science and
not religion.  spike

Very decent of you!

I have two memories, half amusing and half dismaying, of
situations in which I was the victim of statistical profiling
in an inconsequential but extremely irritating fashion.
Both incidents happened sometime in my late teens, and both
involved accusations of cigarette smoking because, well,
that's what teenagers do, innit?  I have never in fact smoked
cigarettes; in fact I've never smoked anything in my life
**except** pot ;-> (a long time ago).

The first of these incidents happened when my mother discovered
cigarette ashes in the bathtub and decided I had taken
up smoking in the bathroom.  My mother herself smoked like
a chimney, so if there were any ashes in the bathtub, she
was herself undoubtedly the source of them.  If I was
doing anything at that age that caused me to spend a long
time in the bathroom, it had nothing to do with cigarettes
<blush>.  The upshot of this was a very surreal, but
nevertheless acrimonious row with my parents.  (The fact
that I didn't get into any conventional kinds of trouble
confused the hell out of my parents and I think was
actually a source of disappointment to them.)

The second incident happened during a visit to the dentist.
I had been going to the same dentist (specializing in
children's dentistry) since I was a little kid (in early
days it was just the one guy, but his two younger
brothers joined the practice when they graduated from
school).  My parents forked over for orthodontia from
this guy, too, so I'd been through a lot in that office
(just the characteristic smell of the Newark [Delaware] Medical
Building always sent a hot wire straight into my amygdala;
I've no doubt I would still react strongly to that
smell).

Well, one day when I was 18 or so I was there for a regular
checkup (with one of the two younger brothers), and he noticed
that there was a lot of staining this time.  Probably this was
because I had taken to drinking tea, but the dentist immediately
jumped to the conclusion that I had taken up cigarette smoking.
When I interrupted the lecture he had launched into on the evils
of cigarettes to reassure him that I did not in fact
smoke, he didn't believe me, and he expanded his lecture to
include his disappointment in the fact that I would attempt
to lie my way out of his discovery.  I was not only angry
enough to bite his hand off, I was horrified by his lack of
professionalism -- his business was to take care of the
toofies; the health of my lungs and my soul were strictly
outside his area of expertise (though maybe, being children's
dentists, they were on some kind of in loco parentis trip;
I wasn't having any of it).  I was promptly and unceremoniously
dropped as a patient after that visit, ostensibly because I was
now too old to be among their clientele, but I suspect it had more
to do with that confrontation with the younger Dr. C.

Of course I know that other groups of people in this country
suffer far more humiliating (and even life-threatening) consequences
from their Bayesian correlates -- I now live in the state of
New Jersey, which has been caught in a scandal in recent years
having to do with certain groups of people being pulled over and
harrassed by the state police on the New Jersey Turnpike and
elsewhere based on statistical profiling.  Nevertheless, I
always grind my teeth in response to sanctimonious propaganda
about the evils of "stereotyping" -- **everybody** stereotypes;
it's just another word for guessing probabilities based on
incomplete information, and sizing up situations quickly
using rough-and-ready rules of thumb.  If people sometimes
get pinched by the Procrustean beds nailed together for them
by other people's Bayesian calculations, those are the breaks.
But DON"T LET IT HAPPEN TO ME!! :-<  :-<

Isn't it true that the Catholic church focuses more on actions than
beliefs?  If you go to Mass, take Communion and engage in Confession,
observing the sacraments of the church, then I think you're supposed to be
in pretty good shape even if you harbor doubts about the existence of God.

I don't know how true this is (it may be a false stereotype), but if
there is some truth to it then Pascal's wager cannot be refuted on the
basis that it means trying to fool God with a false belief.

So maybe what we need to do is to start a Society, a Bayesian Society,
for people who understand the theorem about disagreements.  The founding
principle of the Society would be that you could not "agree to disagree".
You can only either say that someone is lying about his sincere desire
to reach the truth, or else you must come to agreement.

Assuming that claims of lying would be rare (hmmm, based on experience
here that may not be such a good assumption), the point of the Society
would be to reach agreement on all issues.  Disagreement would not
be tolerated.  When a member had new information he would bring it
to the attention of the Society and a new consensus would be reached.
All members would then be compelled to adopt that view.  ("Compelled"
by logic - as Lewis Carroll wrote, logic would take them by the throat
and FORCE them to agree.)

It would be interesting to have a group where disagreements were
essentially forbidden.  Talk about groupthink!  Would it be a cult?
Would the members be brainwashed?  Or would this be the ultimate in
rationality?

Being able to lie to others and to yourself on some things may be
important for success.  But there are times and issues where you do want
to know the truth.  A Society of this type could be helpful in providing
a source of truth, and for giving you mental practice in recognizing
when you are lying to yourself.

Hal

P.S. I see that there is already an International Society for Bayesian
Analysis.  Perhaps they would be good candidates for members in this
more exclusive club.

Would they? It would seem to depend on how many of
the machines you would send them, so they would be able
to break them for analysis, and how much time
they would have to play with it. Would they have juice,
at at least know what kind of juice it takes? Handbooks?
Okay, no handbooks.

Assuming they were motivated, what they probably would be,
if you tell them the device is basic part of economy's
infrastructure, and a valuable scientific instrument on
its own right. The mechanical parts and the macroscopic 
stuff would be comparatively easy to figure out. Keyboard?
A remote descendant of the typewriter. Hmm. Wires. Hey,
this thing uses electricity. Cool stuff! (Electricity
in 1901 was something like nooklear in the 1950s) Mouse, 
largely mechanical  (unless you're evil enough to give 
them one of these fancy purely optical ones), wires again. 
Hard drive. Just unscrew it and look at it in operation. Look 
at the surface with a microscope. Once you realize it's 
magnetic, you win a lot. CRT (unless you're evil enough to 
give them a TFT). The color capabilities would astonish them 
without measure, but the basic shape of the device is almost 
immediately recognizable if you look under the hood. Or apply 
a magnet. See the color triples with a loupe. See the color 
distortions with a magnet.

Now figuring out the semiconductors would be hard, because
they are sealed, have tiny leads, switch very fast and
are a micropatterned substrate, which would exceed their
analytics. They would do much better with a transistor radio,
or a vacuum tube computer. In fact the CRT would act as a veritable
Rosetta stone, because it's based on an ancient technology, and
uses macroscopic high-power devices, and simple signals.

Of course this doesn't give them the science behind it,
and the context in which it was produced. But as a hint and
as a data point that thing would have been very valuable.

Things would have been infinitely difficult if you gave the
same machine to scientists in 1800s, or in 1700s. They'd be
most likely stymied. Or it'd took them almost forever to
figure it out.

Except that we'd knew they're not magic, but artifacts
based on scientific principles. To stick with computers: 
though we're not seeing 99% of the future, we probably 
could resolve the elementary cell of computronium, paradoxically
omega-grade computronium would be easier to figure out,
because it would likely have a very small elementary cells.
Of course if it's not orthogonal, i.e. if you have to figure out a
macroscale artifact which is heterogenous at molecular scale,
we'd be out of luck. And figuring out the other stuff, we'd
be in a situation worse than 12th century alchemist trying to
figure out a modern multimedia machine.

Hey, someone send us a piece of computronium. Preferably a fully
functional device, so that it would explain itself, and assist in
its own reconstruction, provided we're treating it not too shabbily.
Okay, allright, it would be magic. Artifacts which are also persons
are a classical requisite of fairy tales. Mirror, mirror on the wall,
give me the dirt on blue chips today.

You seem to be slipping a couple of orders of magnitude here. Either for
energy conservation, or cooling reasons one would want to settle to
a timebase 1 s : 1 us, a fraction of a million. Maybe, but only maybe,
ten million. Light would be the appear to be speed of sound, or so. 

They're flies btw, which have roughly the same directional sense as

for communication, such as we use sound. Phased array optics and 
sensorics. Interference. Weird stuff.

It is not the same, although it will definitely be irritating. The
horizon between the computronium here and there will be one of time
delay - essentially a question of economics. If you wanted to know what
the there computronium know, you just have to wait long enough. But in
the remote future, then you will *never* be able to hear what the remote
colonies know, *ever*. Their light will never reach you.

Exactly. Just because it is a mess doesn't mean it is a *hopeless* mess.
I think we can already say a few useful things about how it might be
improved (such as where we might want to add extra input channels to
modulate processing, for example) and in a few years it is likely we
understand enough to really start coming up with fun improvements.

It is a very good metaphor.

I always envisioned it as spacetime. It is coincident with all space and
time, and knows the gates (wormholes). 

Nyarlathotep is entropy of course.

Hmm, maybe the birth of a new organisation: Extropians for Cthulhu :-)

Mitochondria in human offspring derived from ooplasmic transplantation:
Brief communication, Human Reproduction, Vol. 16, No. 3, 513-516, March
2001

        Abstract 

 
Ooplasmic transfer from fertile donor oocytes into potentially
compromised recipient patient oocytes has led to the birth of nearly 30
babies worldwide. Cytoplasmic transplantation has caused apprehension,
since the mixing of human ooplasm from two different maternal sources
may generate mitochondrial (mt) heteroplasmy (both recipient and donor
mtDNA) in offspring. This investigation traced the mitochondrial donor
population both during the ooplasmic transfer technique and in the
bloods of two 1 year old children using mtDNA fingerprinting. Donor
ooplasm stained for active mitochondria was transferred into recipient
ooplasm and the mitochondria were visualized by confocal microscopy
after the microinjection procedure and fertilization. Heteroplasmy was
found in the blood from each of the children. This report is the first
case of human germline genetic modification resulting in normal healthy
children.

No matter how you slice it, it's cannibalism

OPENING SHOTS

In his book Remaking Eden, Princeton University molecular biologist Lee
Silver wonders what the future might look like when the world gets over its
nervousness about human genetic engineering. Like many science fiction
writers who have speculated about the social implications of the technology,
Prof. Silver predicts it will encourage the ancient human impulse to divide
society into classes. The genetically enhanced-"GenRich," he calls them-will
be smarter, stronger and wealthier than the "Naturals." Eventually they will
recognize each other as separate species, and develop a relationship similar
to that which exists between humans and apes today.

It is tempting to discount such ideas as mere fodder for the next Planet of
the Apes sequel, except the technology is not just speculative, it's real.
The only thing standing in the way of an elemental redesign of the human
species is our old moral and ethical qualms. And every day brings more
evidence that we are succumbing to the seductive power of perfectionism, the
omnipotent philosophy of our era.

The Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR) is an organization
created by the federal government in 1998 and endowed this year with $360
million in public money to fund research aimed at keeping Canada competitive
in the global healthcare industry. On March 28 it released the report and
recommendations of a CIHR working group which spent the last several months
examining the latest scientific, legal and ethical developments related to
human stem cell research.

Stem cells are the closest thing yet to the fountain of youth. They are
uniquely capable of either reproducing themselves or developing into other,
specialized types of cells. Scientists believe they potentially hold the
power to regenerate blood, tissue, bones and organs. They are present in all
animals at all stages of development, including adulthood, but as with
almost every form of human biotech promising perfection, there's an ethical
catch: many scientists say that stem cells with the greatest regenerative
capacity are only found in the embryonic stage of development.

It is important to differentiate here between stem cell and fetal cell
research, which Celeste McGovern examined in chilling detail in the last
edition of this magazine. Though the science is comparable (and the ethics
just as murky), embryonic stem cells are "pluripotent," or endowed with the
capacity to develop into a wide range of other cells. Researchers believe
stem cells could be used to counter the effects of degenerative diseases
such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and arthritis, rebuild bones, cartilage and
the spinal cord, and regenerate internal organs, thus substituting for
transplantation. At the earliest stages of development, some stem cells may
be "totipotent," which means they could be used to create an entire
organism. Stem cells are typically harvested from embryos less than 14 days
old.

Fetal cells are obtained from specific tissues taken from more mature
aborted fetuses. In their most notorious application, they have been taken
from the brains of aborted babies and injected into the brains of
Parkinson's sufferers. The results of these experiments have been ambiguous
and, as Ms. McGovern reported, occasionally nightmarish.

In our relativistic age, most people detect an ethical difference between
material taken from a microscopic ball of embryonic cells and brain cells
sucked from the skull of an aborted fetus. The authors of the CIHR stem cell
report recognize that the devolution of ethical standards is an incremental
business and position their recommendations accordingly. They urge expansion
and public funding of stem cell research, but with several conditions
attached. Stem cells are only to be obtained from discarded embryos at
fertility clinics, and only with their "parents" consent. No one should
create embryos in vitro specifically for stem cell experimentation. Nor
should stem cells be used to create or contribute to human embryos. And
there should be no transgenic experimentation involving human stem cells and
animal embryos, or vice versa.

It is hard to see the ethical distinction between experiments on "discarded"
embryos and embryos concocted in a test tube specifically for research. The
CIHR report stickhandles around the question by noting that some people
think all embryos are potential persons and thus deserving of protection,
while others with spare embryos sitting in a fertility clinic freezer might
wish to donate some of them to medical research. The implied difference
relates to ownership: the fate of the embryo is in the hands of the people
who supplied the egg and sperm. But this is an eminently bendable rule. If
some civic- minded souls choose to donate eggs and sperm to a lab, surely
ownership passes to the clinic, or some NASDAQ-traded biotech firm that
sells stem cells for US$5,000 per cluster. (That is the reported price two
Canadian researchers paid an American stem cell supplier last year.)

The authors of the CIHR report say they hope their recommendations will
spark a rational public debate which ultimately leads to the creation of a
formal regulatory framework so that scientists know what they can or cannot
do in the field of stem cell research. Today they are working in a
regulatory void, much like fetal cell researchers, genetic engineers and the
shadowy characters experimenting with clones.

The demand for regulation has been around since the 1993 release of the
report of the Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies. So far the
federal Liberals have done nothing, which is to be expected from a
government that regards any manifestation of moral certainty with a mixture
of fear and contempt, but as governments elsewhere begin to either licence
or prohibit the various technologies, even the Grits will soon follow suit.
Thus it is a good time to point out, as loudly and often as possible, that
all of this stuff ultimately raises the same ethical dilemma: we are
cannibalizing ourselves in our desire for perfection and immortality. It
began with blood transfusions, moved to transplants and test-tube babies,
and after stem cell and fetal tissue treatments there will be clones. If we
don't soon get off the treadmill we may well become perfect-and therefore
inhuman.

I've only been skimming this thread and haven't thought deeply about the 
physics of "Tipler's Conjectures" since I read the book some years ago, but 
here's a question: Yes, it seems all the empirical evidence is mounting 
against a truly cosmic-scale implementation of Tipler's design for 
infinite/eternal computation, but could his design be implemented on a 
smaller scale?  In other words, just because the cosmos in toto won't 
collapse, couldn't a local region be structured for asymetrical collapse to 
achieve the same result?

Yes, I've often had this fantasy.  But I think it would
be more fun to send it back just 50 years and watch somebody
like Alan Turing or John von Neumann, who would have a clearer
idea of the implications of the thing, babble and swoon.

Correction: If we become perfect, we'll therefore become posthuman.

A Cure for Poverty

By ANDREW SOLOMON


What if you could help end people's economic problems by treating their 
depression?

Wendy was born just below the poverty line, where she spent the next 30 
years of her life. These were grim times for her. When she was 6, a disabled 
friend of her alcoholic grandmother began abusing her sexually. In seventh 
grade she began to withdraw. "I felt there was no reason to go on," she 
says. "I did my schoolwork and everything, but I was not happy in any way. I 
would just stay to myself. Everyone thought I couldn't talk for a while, 
because for a few years there I wouldn't say anything to anyone." Her first 
boyfriend, from her neighborhood in the slums around Washington, was 
physically and verbally brutal. After the birth of her first child, when she 
was 17, she managed to "escape from him, I don't know how." Not long after, 
Wendy, a petite African-American woman with grave eyes and a wide mouth, was 
raped by a family friend. Soon after that, under pressure from her family, 
she married a man who was also abusive. She had three more children by him 
in the next two years. "He was abusing the children too, even though he was 
the one who wanted them, cursing and yelling all the time, and the 
spankings, I couldn't take that, over any little thing, and I couldn't 
protect them from it." She also had to assume responsibility at this time 
for her sister's children, because the sister was addicted to crack cocaine.

Wendy began to experience major depression -- not simply the generalized 
despair that might be expected of someone in her position, but an organic 
illness that was utterly disabling: "I'd had a job, but I had to quit 
because I just couldn't do it. I didn't want to get out of bed, and I felt 
like there was no reason to do anything. I'm already small, and I was losing 
more and more weight. I wouldn't get up to eat or anything. I just didn't 
care. Sometimes I would sit and just cry, cry, cry. Over nothing. I had 
nothing to say to my own children. After they left the house, I would get in 
bed with the door locked. I feared when they came home, 3 o'clock, and it 
just came so fast. I was just so tired." Wendy began to take pills, mostly 
painkillers. "It could be Tylenol or anything for pain, a lot of it, though, 
or anything I could get to put me to sleep."


Finally one day, in an unusual show of energy, Wendy went to the 
family-planning clinic to get a tubal ligation. At 28, she was responsible 
for 11 children, and the thought of another one petrified her. She happened 
to go in when Jeanne Miranda, an associate professor of psychiatry at 
Georgetown University, was screening subjects for a study of poor people 
suffering from depression. "She was definitely depressed, about as depressed 
as anyone I'd ever seen," recalls Miranda, who gave Wendy the diagnosis and 
swiftly put her into group therapy. "It was a relief to know there was 
something specific wrong," Wendy says. "They asked me to come to a meeting, 
and that was so hard. I didn't talk. I just cried."

On any given day, roughly 18 million Americans meet the diagnostic criteria 
for mood disorders, meaning that they have reached an emotional low that 
impairs their functioning. Three million of those are children. Depression 
claims more years of useful life in America than war, cancer and AIDS put 
together, according to the World Health Organization's World Health Report 
2000. And the indigent depressed are among the most severely disabled 
populations in this country. There are no reliable figures on how many of 
these people there are, but 13.7 percent of Americans live below the poverty 
line, and according to one recent study, about 42 percent of heads of 
households receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children meet the 
criteria for clinical depression -- more than three times the national 
average.


Despite the extended debates in the last decade about depression's causes, 
it seems fairly clear that it is usually the consequence of a genetic 
vulnerability activated by external stress. Most people have some level of 
genetic vulnerability. Those with a high vulnerability can have it triggered 
by a fairly minor event; those with a low degree of vulnerability will be 
triggered only by more significant trauma. But among the indigent, the 
traumas are so terrible and so frequent, says Miranda, that searching for 
the depressed among them is like checking for emphysema among coal miners. 
The depression rate among the poor is the highest of any social grouping in 
the United States, so high that many don't notice or question it. "If this 
is how all your friends are," Miranda says, "it begins to have a certain 
terrible normality to it."

In travels to some fairly remote parts of the world, I found that much the 
same rules apply to trauma-prone populations everywhere. Survivors of the 
Khmer Rouge in Cambodia have an extremely high rate of depression. Phaly 
Nuon, a Cambodian woman who has founded a treatment center and an orphanage 
in Phnom Penh, describes seeing women who had made it through the horrific 
years of war only to become so depressed afterward that they let their own 
children starve to death in the resettlement camps. She said that these 
women, born to grim lives of rural poverty, had been disabled by what they 
had seen. I found similar phenomena among the Inuit of Greenland, tribal 
peoples in Senegal, the urban poor in Russia. Depression rates are very high 
all around the world among people with hard lives, and these people tend to 
be disproportionately poor.

Depression can be difficult enough to recognize among the affluent, but if 
you're way down the socioeconomic ladder, the signs may be even harder to 
distinguish. When someone in the middle classes becomes depressed and 
suddenly finds that he can't function at a high level, can't work, begins to 
withdraw, he is likely to attract the attention of friends and family 
members. But if you're poor, these symptoms don't seem much of a change. 
Your life has always been lousy; you've never been able to get or hold a 
decent job; you've never expected to accomplish much; and you've never 
entertained the idea that you have much control over what happens to you.

The depressed poor perceive themselves to be supremely helpless -- so 
helpless that they neither seek nor embrace support. This means that most 
people who are poor and depressed stay poor and depressed. Poverty is 
depressing, and depression, leading as it does to dysfunction and isolation, 
is impoverishing.

The poor tend to have a passive relationship to fate: their lack of 
self-determination makes them far more likely to accommodate problems than 
to solve them (they are, by extension, far less likely to commit suicide 
than are the empowered). This passivity also causes them to accept treatment 
as passively as they accept their own misery, which means they can be helped 
through programs of assertive outreach. Medicaid recipients qualify for 
extensive care, but they have to claim it, and depressed people do not 
exercise rights or claim what should be theirs, even if they have the rare 
sophistication to recognize their own condition. They can be saved only by 
pressing insight onto them, often through muscular exhortation.

Miranda is one of a small group of therapists who embrace this idea of 
assertive intervention. "If you treat their depression," says Miranda, "you 
give them a new world."

Wendy was not an easy subject at first. On more than one occasion a member 
of Miranda's staff had to go to her house and persuade her to come out. She 
said she had no time. She was taciturn and kept people at a distance. "Then 
they kept calling, telling me to come, pestering and insisting, like they 
wouldn't let go. I didn't like the first meetings. But I listened to the 
other women and realized that they had the same problems I was having, and I 
began to tell them things. I'd never told anyone those things. And the 
therapist asked us all these questions to change how we thought. And I just 
felt myself changing, and I began to get stronger."

After two months of group therapy, Wendy told her husband that she was 
leaving. "There was no arguing because I just didn't argue back. I just told 
him, 'I'm gone.' I was so strong. I was so happy."

It took two more months of therapy before Wendy found a job. Now, while she 
goes to work at a child-care center for the Navy, her children and her 
sister's go to school or another local child-care center. With her new 
salary, she has set herself and the children up in a new apartment. And a 
year into her group therapy, she plans to continue for as long as Miranda's 
program is operating. "My kids are so much happier," Wendy says. "They want 
to do things all the time now. We talk for hours every day. We read and do 
homework all together. We joke around. We all talk about careers, and before 
they didn't even think careers. I talk to them about drugs, and they've seen 
my sister, and they keep clean now. They don't cry like they used to. They 
don't fight like they did.

"I never thought I would get this far. It feels good to be happy. I don't 
know how long it's going to last, but I sure hope it's forever." She smiles 
and shakes her head in wonder. "And if it weren't for Dr. Miranda and that, 
I'd still be at home in bed, if I was still alive at all." Miranda says, 
"There are thousands of success stories as magical as this one, just waiting 
for appropriate interventions."

The treatments Wendy received did not include psychopharmaceutical 
intervention. What was it that enabled this metamorphosis? In part, it was 
simply the steady glow of attention from the doctors with whom she worked. 
In part, it was a cognitive shift. Miranda described Wendy as "clearly" 
having depression, but this had not been clear to Wendy even when she 
suffered extreme symptoms. The labeling of her complaint was an essential 
step toward her recovery from it. What can be named and described can be 
contained: the word "depression" separated Wendy's illness from her 
personality. If all the things she disliked in herself could be grouped 
elegantly together as aspects of a disease, that left her good qualities as 
the "real" Wendy, and it was much easier for her to like this real Wendy and 
to turn this real Wendy against the problems that afflicted her. To be given 
the idea of depression is to master a socially powerful linguistic tool. 
There are no people so starved for this vocabulary as the indigent 
depressed, which is why basic tools like cognitive group therapy can be so 
utterly transforming for them.

Many women in Wendy's situation would be even more expeditiously helped by 
pharmaceuticals. There are four impediments to such broadband treatment 
programs. The first is that the indigent populations who might be helped by 
medication have never really been identified. The second is that to be 
effective, antidepressant medications must be taken on an ongoing basis over 
an extended period of time. The lower people's education levels, the less 
likely they are to take a medication that does not have any immediately 
palpable effect when they take it. Such people are also unlikely to continue 
to take their pills once their symptoms have lifted. The third, of course, 
is cost, though in absolute terms it costs less to provide medication than 
it does to provide the social services that the indigent require. The fourth 
is a mode of transmission. Pharmaceutical executives to whom I mentioned all 
the above said they would willingly set up programs to discount medication 
for use in these populations if there were a way to convey it. "I simply 
didn't know that such a phenomenon existed on the scale you are describing," 
one executive told me. In the absence of government programs to facilitate 
the distribution of antidepressants to this population, however, even the 
most well-intentioned members of the pharmaceutical industry are stymied.

The privately financed Treatment Advocacy Center is the most conservative 
body issuing policy on treatment, and its position is that people whose 
condition can be improved through treatment should receive it whether they 
want to or not. It is their view that those who resist treatment place an 
unconscionable and unnecessary burden on society. The Bazelon Center for 
Mental Health Law, a nonprofit policy group at the other end of the 
spectrum, believes that commitment should almost always be voluntary and 
defines mental illness as interpretive. The A.C.L.U. takes the middle 
ground. It has published a statement that "the freedom to be wandering the 
streets, psychotic, ill and untreated, when there is a reasonable prospect 
of effective treatment, is not freedom; it is abandonment" -- though it also 
supports the right of people to make decisions about their own lives. The 
problem is that desperate people often dislike help because they do not 
believe that help will set them free. The answer is neither forced treatment 
nor abandonment; it is a process of forceful seduction predicated on the 
principle that those who are treated will be glad after the fact to have 
received such attention.

Joseph Rogers, the head of the Mental Health Association of Southeastern 
Pennsylvania, was indigent and depressed himself at one time; he spent a 
year living on a bench in Central Park before being drawn into an outreach 
program. "People who are isolated and lost are usually desperate for a 
little human connection," Rogers says. "Outreach can work. You just have to 
be willing to go out and engage them and re-engage them until they're ready 
to come with you." Rogers has helped to make Pennsylvania one of the most 
progressive states in the nation for mental health. In fact many people from 
neighboring states get shipped into Pennsylvania so they can take advantage 
of the systems there.

Rogers also has created a chain of what he calls "drop-in centers," which 
are street-level storefronts, usually staffed by people who are themselves 
recovering from mental illnesses. This creates employment for the people who 
are just beginning to cope with a structured environment, and it gives 
people who are in bad shape a place to go and receive advice. Drop-in 
centers provide a transit zone between mental isolation and companionship.

Popular wisdom holds that you need to address unemployment before you start 
worrying about the fancy business of the mental health of the unemployed. 
And greater prosperity is a good trigger for recovery. But it is perhaps 
easier and equally reasonable to treat the depression itself so that these 
people can alter their own lives.

Our failure to identify and treat the indigent depressed is not only cruel 
but also costly. Many of the depressed poor are welfare recipients who 
cannot hold jobs. They are given to substance abuse and other 
self-destructive behaviors. They are sometimes violent. Infants of depressed 
mothers show brain-wave patterns different from those of other infants, 
according to a study by Tiffany Field, chair of the Touch Research 
Institute. These altered patterns seem to relate to the closing down of 
essential brain circuits that, if they do not function in childhood, are 
probably inoperative later on. Treat the depression in the mother, and the 
infant's brain waves are likely to normalize. When a depressed mother is not 
treated, her children tend to end up in the welfare and prison systems: the 
sons of mothers with untreated depression are eight times more likely to 
become juvenile delinquents as are other children. Daughters of depressed 
mothers will have earlier puberty than other girls, according to a recent 
paper by Bruce Ellis and Judy Garber in the journal Child Development. And 
early puberty is usually associated with promiscuity, early pregnancy and 
mood disorders.

According to the 1998 Green Book of the House of Representatives Committee 
on Ways and Means, state and federal government spends roughly $20 billion 
on cash transfers to poor nonelderly adults and their children, and roughly 
the same amount for food stamps for such families. If one makes the 
conservative estimate that 25 percent of people on welfare are depressed, 
that half of them can be treated successfully and that of that percentage, 
two-thirds could return to productive, at least part-time, work, factoring 
in treatment costs, that would still reduce welfare costs by as much as 8 
percent -- a savings of almost $3.5 billion per year. Because the federal 
government also provides health care and other transfers for such families, 
the true savings could be quite a bit higher.

The dollar cost of interventionist treatment of depression is really quite 
small; the dollar cost of not treating depression is enormous. "Postponement 
of intervention does not result in savings," Representative Marge Roukema, a 
Republican from New Jersey and the co-chairwoman of the Working Group on 
Mental Illness, says. "You're really building in greater costs."

For more than a decade, Glenn Treisman of Johns Hopkins University has been 
studying and treating depression among indigent H.I.V.-positive and AIDS 
populations in Baltimore, most of whom are also substance-abusers. "Many 
people get H.I.V. when they can't muster the energy to care anymore," 
Treisman says. "These are people who are utterly demoralized by life and 
don't see any point in it. If we had treatments more broadly available for 
depression, I would guess from my clinical experience that the rate of 
H.I.V. infection in this country would be cut in half at least, with 
enormous consequent public-health savings."

Mental-Health Services are still focused primarily on the noisy disorders, 
with schizophrenia and mania at the top of the list. "Of course we want to 
help nonviolent mentally ill people just as much as we want to help violent 
ones," Roukema told me. "But to draw any kind of substantial support, we 
have to show people that it serves their urgent self-interest to do 
something about mental-health care for the poor. We have to talk about 
preventing atrocious crimes that could be visited on them or their 
constituents at any moment. We can't talk simply about a better and more 
prosperous and more humane state."

There is no discussion in Congress at present about depression among the 
uninsured. Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico, who has been the joint 
sponsor of several important mental-health bills, says this situation is 
unlikely to change. "If you're asking whether we can expect much change 
simply because that change would serve everyone's advantage in immediate 
economic and human terms," Domenici says, "I regret to tell you that the 
answer is no."

It is hard to find anyone in Congress who is opposed on principle to healing 
the mentally ill. "The opposition is competition," says Representative John 
Porter, an Illinois Republican who until January was the chairman of the 
Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee. 
Nonetheless, while declarations about the tragic nature of suicide and the 
danger of psychiatric complaints accumulate on the Congressional record, 
legislation pertinent to these statistics does not pass easily. "Progress 
here is excruciatingly gradual," says Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, 
who has made regular attempts to introduce comprehensive legislation for 
mental-illness coverage. "The uninsured haven't even made it onto the radar 
screen around here yet."

There are programs, even some good ones, that are available to the poor 
mentally ill, but they exist inside hospitals. You have to find them 
yourself. Public-relations campaigns for treating mental illnesses -- signs 
on buses, TV ad spots and so on -- have had some success at bringing people 
into clinics, but the idea that indigent depressed people will ever have the 
wherewithal to seek and find help, even if they did figure out for 
themselves that they were depressed, is ludicrous. A program that did a 
basic mental-health screening at family-planning clinics or at job centers 
or at places where welfare checks are distributed might allow us at least to 
identify the people who are currently suffering from illness.

But the best place to start would probably be the welfare rolls. Major 
depression is frequently triggered by stresses, and there is no question 
that the lives of welfare recipients are extremely stressful. At the moment, 
however, welfare officers do no significant screening for depression. 
Welfare programs are essentially run by administrators, who do little or no 
actual social work. What tends to be noted in welfare reports as 
noncompliance is in many instances motivated by psychiatric trouble.

Some pilot studies are under way on the treatment of depression among the 
poor, and the results appear surprisingly consistent. I was given full 
access to subjects from several of these studies -- some involved therapy, 
others medication, still others a combination of the two. To my surprise, 
everyone I met felt that his or her lot had improved during treatment. They 
felt better about their lives, and they lived better. Even when faced with 
insurmountable obstacles, they progressed, often fast and sometimes far. 
Over and over again, as I spoke to more poor people who had been treated for 
depression, I heard tones of astonishment. How, after so many things had 
gone wrong for them, had they been swept up by this help that had changed 
their entire lives? "I asked the Lord to send me an angel," one woman told 
me. "And he answered my prayers."

Happy to see you reading on this.  Most of the literature does deal with
some stable end of a conversation, but one paper does not.   See:

Practice rational reasoning involves lots of error-prone reasoning
disciplined by meta-processes that look for and correct for systematic
biases.  http://hanson.gmu.edu/disagree.html talks more about this.
Psychologists have studied this a lot.  See "Metacognition" and the
"flexible correction model".   If you find that your disagreement is
predictable, I think you should think of that as having uncovered a
systematic bias to correct for.   In general, you just more your beliefs
in the opposite direction from the bias you perceive.

This could be interesting.  How about forming a discussion
list where, instead people stating opinions and then arguing,
they would bring up points of controversy, which list members
would then have to reach consensus on?  For example, someone
might submit a point of political controversy; list members
would then attempt to reply without disagreement.  Initial
replies might take the form of a statement of facts we all
know to be true, from these tentative steps would be taken to
reach a conclusion.

My criticism, and our discussion of disagreement, applies to *all*

Arguing or debating is different from disagreeing.  Ask everyone in your office
to rank themselves and each other at being a driver, lover, lawyer, whatever.
I can pretty much guarentee you will find each person tends to rate him/herself
above median.  You can show all these rankings to everyone and then ask them
to revise them and the same bias will show up.   You guys might not spend much
time talking about this, but I think you all know that you disagree about these
things.

Btw, I am presently working on an experiment to very clearly show disagreement
is ubiquitous.  (Too bad most of you guys aren't in my area to come be subjects.)

Implant?  Anyway, I meant a Moravec-**style** transfer, whose distinguishing
characteristic is not the robot bush or any other technical detail of
the procedure other than the fact that it avoids the **duplication**
of the conscious entity being uploaded (and secondarily, that it's
as gradual a transition as you like, that can be performed while
you're awake [*]).  The idea of uploading via duplication does nothing for me:
even though I know that there's a 50% chance that "I" would wake up as the
uploaded duplicate, and might feel some gratitude to the flesh-and-blood
original for making the trip possible, this flesh-and-blood original nevertheless
identifies with the other 50% likely outcome, that I would wake up to hear "Well
that's all there is to it, Mr. F., you may now rest assured that there
is an accurate replica of your personality poised to take off into
the big bright beyond.  Please pay the receptionist on the way out,

Well, that's the point I was making.  Making a fuss over cryonic suspension
at this stage seems a little like somebody in 1710 (or whenver it was)
getting excited at the prospect of a train trip after hearing about
that early steam engine, and spending their life savings on a ticket.

This article asks,

As is usual in journalism about social problems, this article confuses 
"earning more money in wages" with "becoming non-poor."  Despite the 
bestsellerdom of Stanley and Danko's book, apparently it still hasn't sunk 
in that being well-paid is a long way from being non-poor.  If you make 
$100,000/year in wages but lack sufficient invested savings to supply a 
subsistence income, then when for whatever reason your wage income stops, in 
short order you'll become as effectively destitute as the people described 
in this article.  I've been saying for years that America's "affluence" is 
really a clever illusion, given the relatively small numbers of people who 
wind up financially independent even after decades of work.

You have to admire her biological fitness.

Yes, a million to one speed-up will occur before a billion to one.
But I don't think that we can rule out even faster speeds.

The sociology of who reads whose postings gets interesting.  We
need the sociogram that someone was talking about.  I have no
idea what fraction of people are reading this, but it can't be
very high.  Spike echoed exactly the point that I had made in
the Pascal's Wager thread, proving he doesn't read mine.

To address the question, however, I would suggest that with sufficient
matter/energy density, as occurs with collapsing black holes, it would
seem possible to me.

I don't see why this is not possible? My only concern would be, is a cosmic 
collapse, in the Charles Meissner sense of it, necessary to recover all the 
photons, that would be used for a phase conservation re-gathering (in a 
reverse determinism fashion) so, as, to re-create all past information? 
Certainly, it seems that both Tipler's conjectures, and Hans Moravec's 
conjectures, suggests that this is not a necessity!

One of Tipler's concern's seems to be that black holes, eventually violate 
the principle of "unitarity" (sp?) which is part and parcel of quantum 
mechanics. This basically says that Hawking's notion that everything simply 
winds up in black holes and the black holes finally go poof, resulting in 
matter, energy, and information, disappears from the cosmos. The principle of 
unitarity says this is not possible (if ya like quantum mechanics). So here 
again, we have another reason to 'unify' general relativity and quantum 
mechanics-to decide which what is right. The Linde' scenario seems much 
closer to what is desired, then a black hole. For this we need wormholes, 
transverable ones.

I don't believe this works.  From what I understand, Tipler's collapse
must be universe-wide, the inverse of the Big Bang.  Furthermore it must
be chaotic in a special way, so that the universe changes shape in ever
more extreme ways, being elongated like a stretched tube balloon in one
direction after another.  I don't think this dynamics is possible with
a black hole, I think it has to be the entire universe.

I'm eager to hear what the list's cosmic heavyweights say about this.
I suspect the conditions Tipler's Conjectures cannot be met even in
the local collapse of a supercluster.  In an open universe the supercluster
would have reached local heat death long before it could emit enough
gravitons to converge.  spike

I don't know about "seeking the truth", but one thing that has struck
me over the years is how amazingly cooperative people can be when
it comes to working together to reach some mutually-desired practical
goal.  I'm a computer programmer, and I've been repeatedly amazed
that's it's possible for a group of several dozen software people,
of different national origins (American, Indian, Chinese, and Russian, say)
and with great divergence in their ability to produce what a magazine
editor or English teacher would consider polished prose, to nevertheless
get extremely complex ideas sufficiently well communicated to each other
(in broken English) to get the job very well done.  It's rather a source of
optimism to see such a spectacle taking place, and it also nicely illustrates a
philosophical point about the significance of language that I've picked
up from my betters and retailed on this list -- namely, that words
and sentences are really (*) just a crude way for two or more human minds
to get pointed in more or less the same direction, after which a finer-grained
interaction with and knowledge of the world itself (the world of the
particular computer environment and user needs in question, in this example),
on the part of each individual, takes over and carries everybody the rest
of the way.

I imagine the **real** enterprise of scientific investigation, the part
that actually takes place at the leading edge and involves planning experiments,
interacting with laboratory equipment, analyzing the results, and actively
interpreting them to discover how they integrate into the body of existing
theory and knowledge in a field, is a lot more like participating
in a successful software project (or a well-run factory manufacturing
computers, cars, or tennis shoes) than it is like participating in a theological
debate or a lawsuit (though I'm sure there's plenty of the latter spirit at
conferences and in the clash of titanic egoes in the literature).

When it comes to gassing off for pleasure (;->), or reading for pleasure,
it seems easy enough to sniff out sufficient information about your potential
interlocutor or contemplated choice of author to know in short order
whether the effort's going to have enough of a payoff to be worth
the bother.

With a possible conversational partner, there's the old trick of finding
out what kind of books that person likes.  With a lot of the participants
on this list, the Web hands over this information gift-wrapped and tied
up in ribbons.  For example, I can go to Eliezer's "Bookshelf" page
( http://sysopmind.com/bookshelf.html ) and see that he's a fan
of Robert Wright.  That speaks volumes (more than just the volume
mentioned ;-> ) about the kind of attractors in the memetic landscape
he's likely to be hanging out around.  It means that if I were
ever to post a comment on the Extropians' containing the standard
sociobiological view of the relevance of parental investment to human
sexual psychology, I could probably count on Eliezer, at least, taking
my side (though my arguments would probably be coming out of
Donald Symons' _The Evolution of Human Sexuality_, the first book **I**
came across on the subject, rather than Robert Wright).  On the other hand,
I wouldn't dare to post such an inflammatory remark on the Usenet newsgroup
soc.motss (I did once, back in 1989 I think -- it was a mistake then, and
it would be a mistake now).

Of course with Eliezer, as with other extremely smart people I
know, you can count on him putting a personal and perhaps
surprising spin on things, just for the sake of not giving the
game away!  That sort of disagreement for independence's sake,
or just to keep things interesting, is not fatal to there being
a "stable end of a conversation", as long as there's implied
agreement about the basics.

An author is even easier -- you can go straight to the index of a book
you've picked up at Barnes & Noble, find a topic you know about, and
see what the author has to say about it.

Back in the 1970's, what I was a fan of behaviorism, it was a source
of great amusement to me (and a rather shocking revelation about
the nature of some kinds of intellectual discourse) to read transcripts
of "debates" between B. F. Skinner and "humanistic" or "third force"
(after behaviorism and psychoanalysis) psychologists like Carl Rogers.
It became clear after a while that Skinner and these people were
not even **trying** to come to grips with each other's arguments --
they were just talking past each other, on skew trajectories, in
a sort of formal ballet of discourse.  They had long ago decided to
agree to disagree, and were just going through the motions for the
audience's sake.  It reminds me a bit of a comment that Gerald Edelman
made in a _New Yorker_ interview, as reported by John McCrone:
"Interviewed in the _New Yorker_ magazine, Edelman said that the mainstream
of mind science -- dominated as it was by the computational model -- was
so far off the mark as to be 'not even wrong'."  Now when **that** kind
of disagreement is constrained by good manners, you get either avoidance
of discussion, or a "debate" in the style of B. F. Skinner and
Carl Rogers.  If it's not constrained by good manners, but still
taken deadly seriously, you get war.

I'm not sure this is meaningful.  I can't resist saying that this is a
case where we should un-ask the question.

Disagreement for independence's sake?  Heh heh heh.  As I once told a
certain thirteen-year-old, who wanted to break the rules of an
already-complex game just to make it more "interesting":  "Don't break
rules for the sake of breaking them.  If you break rules only when you
have a vastly superior alternative, you will have more than enough trouble
to last you the rest of your life."

Another angle on the Pascal's Wager vs. Cryonics problem is what I call 
"fixity of likelihood".  Basically, god (whichever of the 1000's referred 
to) will be no more likely to exist tomorrow as it/he/she was 
yesterday.  The likelihood of god existing is unchanging.

Cryonics (or more accurately, reversal of present day cryopreservation) 
doesn't have "fixed likelihood".  The likelihood of success increases over 
time.  While god will be no more likely to exist or not in 100 years' time, 
the likelihood of successful cryo-recovery will be much increased or a 
certainty at that time, given continued research efforts of course.

It's a bet between a claimed supernatural being and continued advancement 
by humans.  Ask him, as an atheist, which one he thinks is more likely to 
pan out.

Well, I'm not super-sure myself, but what about the following?
All the functionalists that I know agree that a TM would be
conscious if executing the right program.  Now, this may have
to include being in the right situation, and may have to
include being able to respond to multiple possible inputs.

Whatever.  It was shown by Charles Bennett that any computation
can be accomplished reversibly.  In "Minds, Machines, and the
Multiverse", Julian Brown even says, "The idea that one can 
compute using no energy at all may sound too good to be true,
but remarkably enough, it seems that it is possible, in theory
at any rate.  This conclusion not only has important practical
implications but also offers a new vista of the relationship
between computation and physics".  (I'm not sure how much to
read into that: could a developing civilization go on for
eons with zero energy expenditure?  Somehow, I doubt it.)

In any case, I think that a Turing machine would be just
as conscious of an experience as it un-calculated as it
was when it calculated.  What persuaded me is that the
un-calculation is exactly what would transpire if the
arrow of time were reversed;  but the direction of the
arrow of time is symmetrical (i.e., there's no place to
stand and claim that it's going now one way, and now the
other).  So un-experiencing something would be just as
fun as experiencing it... not "un-fun" at all!

I think the jury is still out on that one. There are apparently some
strong theorems preventing intelligent life from shuffling a lot of mass
into a corner of the universe and then having that collapse in the right
way. But that doesn't mean other topologies are ruled out as possible
omega-spacetimes. For example, if baby universes can be generated and
they could be engineered to omega-collapse, then everything is fine.

It's a good question, and I think this is an excellent thought experiment
for shedding light on the matter.  This is an example of what I was
getting at earlier when I suggested that it doesn't always make sense
to ask where and when consciousness is occuring.

A reversible computer is as likely to take a step backwards as forwards.
So even if it manages to complete a calculation from A to B, the process
will be a random walk, moving forward and backwards many times over each
portion of the path from A to B.

Now if we interpret each step of the computer as instantiating a little
bubble of conscious experience, then the consciousness will move forward
and backwards in time just like the computer.  You'll think thought 1,
then thought 2, then you'll think thought 2 backwards, then forwards
again, then thought 3, then thought 3 backwards, 2 backwards, 1 backwards,
1 forwards, and so on.

However of course the conscious mind is not aware of this.  The structure
of the computer is such that it would have no memory of having gone back
and forth like this.  In the end when it thinks back over what happened,
it will remember thought 1, then 2, then 3, and so on, straight on to
the end.

So there is a real disconnect in this case between what we hypothesize
happening from a functional perspective, and what we have evidence for
happening based on the reports of the conscious mind.  All we truly
have evidence for is that the computation did exist, did complete.
We don't know whether the mind really experienced going backwards and
forwards like that.

And we especially don't know what form the consciousness took during
the reverse steps.  What does it feel like to have memories erased
rather than stored?  There is no way to ask a person and find out
(that I can see).  Certainly if you ask them after a step is reversed,
the answer will obviously be the same as if the step never occured.

I posted an article several years ago [1] about an actual machine which
raised a somewhat similar question about what happens to consciousness
if the machine can't remember certain kinds of transformations.  But I
think Lee's example is even more pointed.

Sounds just like Paul Durham's Theorie de la Poussiere
(Dust Theory) in Egan's _Permutation City_:

"Experiment two, trial number one.  Reverse order.

Paul counted, 'One.  Two.  Three.'...  After an initial
leap into the future, he was now travelling backward
through real time.  It would have been a nice touch if
he'd been able to view an external event on the terminal --
some entropic cliche like a vase being smashed -- knowing
that it was **himself**, and not the scene, that was
being 'rewound' . . . but he knew that it couldn't be done
(quite apart from the fact that it would have ruined the
experiment, betraying the difference between subject
and control).  In real time, the first thing to be computed
would be his model-time-final brain state, complete with
memories of everything that 'had happened' in the
'preceding' ten seconds.  Those memories couldn't include
having seen a real broken vase assemble itself from
fragments, if the vase hadn't even been smashed yet. The
trick could have been done with a simulation, or a video
recording of the real thing -- but that wouldn't have been
the same."

I wonder if this sort of reversibility Gedanken experiment
could be parlayed by a mathematician or philosopher into
evidence that consciousness **cannot**, in fact, be implemented
as a Turing machine.

Well, in an Omega Point you don't need every photon, just enough energy.
Tipler has never claimed the reconstruction of past history requires any
information about it! His solution (and probably the only really
workable one) is to reconstruct all possible pasts, the "real" one is
hidden in the middle of them and you will have restored a huge number of
"what if" worlds.

Yes.  But this immediately brings up the question of whether the
singularity has a general S or sigmoid shape or not.  If there is
an upper level of progress, (i.e. computation density, speed-up
factor, and so on), then your observation is exactly right.

But if there is no upper limit---which many of the people who have
been thinking more about the singularity than I have    appear to 
believe---then it's not clear that any information from these
remote sources would be of any interest whatsoever (except perhaps
to satisfy historical antiquarian instincts).  In other words, to
the extent that the "singlularity" indeed is a true singularity,
then data from elsewhere becomes redundant as well as boring.

That could be it Hal, but I rather suspect that Pascal himself
may have been having a little fun with the whole concept.  I
have always suspected his wager was a little joke that others
took far more seriously than he intended.  Pascal surely realized
the paradoxical nature of his view.  spike

Futarchy is looking pretty good, here.

Think about how broken a system has to be -- to naive (children's?) thought --
such that a quick monotonic improvement like that can't be taken.

IN connection with Reversible Computation and Experience, Hal
Finney mentions a post of his from Sept. 1997

> http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.3Q97/3600.html

in which he examines the issue of memory retention versus
experience.  Actually, that's how *I* would summarize it.
Here is what he really said:

"You could envision a neural simulation on a Time Warp machine. It
would
assume some default pattern of incoming impulses into the part of
the
brain being simulated by some processor. Then, if the actual data
which
arrived was different from what had been assumed, it would roll back
its
state and handle the data as needed. If it turned out that the
default
model for incoming data was reasonable accurate much of the time,
this
could be a very efficient way to simulate the brain on a network.

"The interesting question this raises is whether there would be
any
conscious perception by the simulated brain of the "paths not
taken".
Frequently, part of the brain moves forward in time assuming
some
pattern of outside impulses, only to find out that the actual
pattern
was different from what was assumed, so that it resets its state to
what
it was in the past and proceeds forward to process the actual data.
So
there are transient brain states being computed which do not
correspond
to the actual brain states which the simulation eventually
produces.

"We assume that the (simulated) neural activity is what gives rise
to
consciousness. Therefore it might be that the simulated "wrong"
neural
activity could give rise to a consciousness which does not match
the
"true" consciousness being determined by the simulation. This
false
consciousness would have no way of interacting with the outside
world, or
of revealing its existence through any overt behavior. The person
being
simulated would steadfastly deny that he had any unusual
perceptions
or sensations due to the time warp simulation (because all the
false
ones would get rolled back and erased). Yet we have reason to
think
that he is wrong, by the principle which identifies mental states
with
(simulated) brain states.


"This could be thought of as a case where behavior cannot reveal
certain
mental attributes."


I think that's exactly correct.  To me it's also an illustration
of the difference between memory acquisition and experience.  One
can today have the latter without the former: sleeping pills
containing midazolam prevent short-term memory from becoming
permanent).  In Hal's case, the duration of each piece of
experience is so brief that the experiencer cannot even begin
to articulate his or her experience.

I stress the primacy of experience, and not the memories of it that
I carry into the indefinite future.  Though obviously important,
memories might be artificial, whereas experience, by definition,
is always genuine.

But Hal's post has a disturbing implication.  His description of
a time-warp brain isn't so different from what we now know about
real brains!  Certain experiments indicate that your brain does
take several paths at once, and you only remember the "winner".
I recall an experiment in which they somehow got the subject to
to reliably specify the point at which a certain image or idea
occurred to him.  The trouble was, that by this time the
information that the subject had received was still ambiguous.
(For example, the subject might have heard either "bear" or "bare"
and couldn't yet have formed the proper image.)  Evidently, memories
of the "other paths" were discarded by the brain.

So if I stick to my guns here, the implication is that I may be
conscious (in the long run) of only a small part of my experience.
Very confusing conclusion!

Lee

Just because they have thought a lot about it doesn't make it the least
bit plausible. The fundamental limitations on information storage due to
Heisenberg/Bekenstein, thermodynamics (energy costs of irreversible
operations), lightspeed etc appear to form a very plausible barrier
limiting how much computation you can get. Claiming that a sufficiently
advanced intelligence can circumvent them is handwaving.

Besides, if lightspeed is a limit but you can get infinite computation
locally, then you get something like the Jeans collapse of a gas cloud:
intelligences shrink more and more, but then separate into ever smaller
disjoint regions that shrink into new regions. The result is an infinity
of hyposcale omegas.

You might point out that an investment of several thousand bucks is a lot 
less of a wager than an entire lifetime lived according to what is supposed 
to be pleasing to God.  You might also point out that if you live a life of 
"sin" you only have a 50% chance of going to hell, whereas if you die 
without having made cryonic arrangements you have a 100% chance of staying 
dead.

Hey! You can't find me in a staple (except the sentimental market, perhaps),
and I don't want to take any part in old Cthulhu's small diet.
That said, I like persistent functional programming systems like STAPLE,
and I do intend to get TUNES to run before Cthulhu awakes.

Hum. When Cthulhu awakes, will he have his ass kicked by transhumans?
Or will He actually awake through his incarnation as a transhuman?

Yeah, and think about how broken a system has to be -- to jaded politicos and
elder statesmen as well -- such that a quick monotonic improvement like that
can't be taken.

Lawrence Schulman claims that it is possible to have opposite-running-time
regions and that ³some² degree of contact between them will not destroy the
arrows of time. 
In the same way that electrons and positrons run in opposite time
directions, there are - Schulman suggests - galaxies with backward-running
time, following the timeline from Crunch to Bang.
At this instant they are, perhaps, very old and hence not very luminous,
although they are still exerting a gravitational pull.
I do not know whether, or not, "some" interaction between these
opposite-running-time regions, or galaxies, or universes, could ensure the
infinite computing power. Maybe.

A compromised arrow of time
L. S. Schulman
The second law of thermodynamics - the usual statement of the arrow of time
- has been called the most fundamental law of physics. It is thus difficult
to conceive that a single dynamical system could contain subsystems, in
significant mutual contact, possessing opposite thermodynamic arrows of
time. By examining cosmological justification for the usual arrow it is
found that a consistent way to establish such justification is by giving
symmetric boundary conditions at two (cosmologically remote) times and
seeking directional behavior in between. Once this has been demonstrated, it
is seen that entropy increase can be reversed and that the usual arrow is
less totalitarian than previously believed. In the same vein, other boundary
conditions, modeling shorter periods in the evolution of the cosmos, can be
found that allow the simultaneous existence of two thermodynamic arrows,
notwithstanding moderate interaction between the systems possessing those
arrows. Physical consequences of the existence and detection of
opposite-arrow regions are also considered.
http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/cond-mat/0009139

Opposite Thermodynamic Arrows of Time
L. S. Schulman
A model in which two weakly coupled systems maintain opposite running
thermodynamic arrows of time is exhibited. Each experiences its own retarded
electromagnetic interaction and can be seen by the other. The possibility of
opposite-arrow systems at stellar distances is explored and a relation to
dark matter suggested.

Detectability of Cosmic Topology in Almost Flat Universes

Authors: G.I. Gomero, M.J. Reboucas, R. Tavakol
Comments: 18 pages, 3 figures, LaTeX2e

     Recent observations suggest that the ratio of the total density to
     the critical density of the universe, $\Omega_0$, is likely to be
     very close to one, with a significant proportion of this energy
     being in the form of a dark component with negative pressure.
     Motivated by this result, we study the question of observational
     detection of possible non-trivial topologies in universes with
     $\Omega_0 \sim 1$, which include a cosmological constant. Using a
     number of indicators we find that as $\Omega_0 \to 1$, increasing
     families of possible topologies become either undetectable or can
     be excluded observationally. Furthermore, given a non-zero lower
     bound on $|\Omega_0 - 1|$, we can rule out families of topologies
     as possible candidates for the shape of our universe. We
     demonstrate these findings concretely by considering families of
     topologies and employing bounds on cosmological parameters from
     recent observations. We find that given the present bounds on
     cosmological parameters, there are families of both hyperbolic and
     spherical manifolds that remain undetectable and families that can
     be excluded as the shape of our universe. These results are of
     importance in future search strategies for the detection of the
     shape of our universe, given that there are an infinite number of
     theoretically possible topologies and that the future observations
     are expected to put a non-zero lower bound on $|\Omega_0 - 1|$
     which is more accurate and closer to zero.

It crosses my mind that Edelman (and others) would probably snort at drawing
parallels between "evolved" FPGAs and human brains for much the same reason
he snorts at comparing artificial neural networks to human brains:  namely,
that the result has a static physical structure and function.

In the "selectionist" theories of human intelligence espoused by Edelman,
Changeux, Plotkin, et al., "evolution", in some sense, is a never-ending
process.  Of course, there are nested hierarchies of it -- a person is
born with a fixed genome.  But these folks believe there are somatic
processes, analogous to Darwinian evolution, that continue throughout
an organism's lifetime.  In contrast, with an evolved FPGA as developed
by Adrian Thompson, there's a prespecified problem, just as there would
be in a conventional software-design or electrical engineering application
domain, which is solved without explicit analysis by cranking the handle
of the magic evolution machine.  But at some point the evolution stops
(when the FPGA is deemed to have solved the problem), the chip is plugged
into the system and switched on, and becomes just another piece of
static hardware.  Same with neural networks -- there's a training set
corresponding to the problem domain, the network is trained on it,
and then it's plugged into the OCR program (or whatever), shrink-wrapped,
and sold.

Still too static, folks, to be a basis for AI.  When are we going to have
hardware with the sort of continual plasticity and dynamism that nerve tissue has?
(I know it's going to be hard.  And, in the meantime, evolved FPGAs
might have their uses, if people can trust them to be reliable).

I strongly agree that there is a disparity between income and net worth; the
media does a disservice to everyone by frequently equating one with the
other.  Furthermore, this disparity is encouraged by a government (in the
U.S., but probably in Europe as well) that stiffly penalizes people who make
enough to have substantial savings.  These days, every extra penny I make
between January 1st and April 15th has to be saved to cover the difference
between what is withheld from my income and what the punitive tax rates
require me to pay.  Sure, I may still manage to actually save money 6 months
out of the year, but a moderately high gross income doesn't imply vast
quantities of net income after taxes and basic living expenses.

Given this situation, the fraction of the money I earn that I am able to
save seems to be largely invariant of my actual gross income, despite the
apparent reality that more-or-less fixed expenses should allow me to save
more.  Because of this, I don't think it is substantially easier to save
money with an upper-middle class gross income than it is with a lower-middle
class gross income.

Despite my mini-tirade above, eventual financial independence is easily
within reach of pretty much everyone, except perhaps for people with
pathological psychological conditions.  The "illusion of affluence" exists
mostly because it is easier to maintain the illusion of affluence than it is
to actually *be* affluent.  The biggest problem is finding the discipline to
build real affluence, and recognizing this at a young enough age that it can
really make a difference.  Too many people, like my parents, don't start
thinking about these things until they are in their forties.

The plasticity of the hardware is utterly irrelevant.  It is the interaction
and complexity of the *data* that matters, which is why one should be able
to do AI on just about any reasonable piece of silicon.  There is no magic
in evolvable hardware, it is simply a fast way of evolving data interactions
that could be done completely in software on a boring von Neumann machine.
Hardware and software are equivalent things; hardware is faster, software is
cheaper, and you balance the two depending on the specifications of the
project at hand.

Give me just one example of something you can do in high-plasticity
evolvable hardware that can't be done in software.

Perhaps Edelman et al. should not snort to much as what is merely
a single fleeting point in a sequence of architectures. Yes, FPGAs 
are stupid, yes FPGAs don't compare favourably to brain's fanout 
and connectivity factors (nanofilaments packed in 3d are hard to be 
beat to implement a high-connectivity infrastructure) nor in total 
number of active units, but even current FPGAs need not to remain 
static. That they're typically that is a more or less deliberate 
decision on the side of the implementer. She doesn't understand
circuits which flip through configurations on ms range, especially
if the circuits themselves decide on which next configuration to
choose.

Given that neuronal hardware needs minutes to hours to reconfigure,
reconfiguration of FPGA cells can (YMMV depending on what silicon
you have) happen in ns time range.

But, as I already mentioned, current FPGAs are really lousy, and 
hence I'm really looking forward to CA-flavoured FPGAs, where a very 
small cell with a state is directly connected to other cells, arranged 
as a 2d mosaic. It is hard to predict what the minimum cell size will 
be, but it will probably be not be a lot larger than a square micron, 
and switch well in excess of 100 GHz even in current structure size.

And, of course in computronium the signal-ducting nanofilaments
(encoded as special cell states) will also be packed in 3d, and 
a bit denser than in the real thing. Or some other computation
paradigm might be more useful, encoding information in glider 
configurations, using a packet switched information delivery to
nodes arranged on a grid. We don't know yet, but we will. Figuring
this framework out will be the first step in the parameter
space search.

Of course, if the prespecified problem itself is shifting, and
if you're embedded into such a matrix the things are not nearly as 
deterministic.

Jim, I think you don't realize what we've got here already even with these
stupid FPGAs. The brain has several levels of dynamics: the signalling,
which occurs on the (sub-)ms time scale, adaptation, which takes
seconds, or longer, and the hardware reconfiguration, which takes minutes,
hours, or days. In FPGAs already you have two layers: the state which
defines the hardware connectivity with the state that hardware has at time
t. 

In flexibility, that framework is comparable to biology. What limits it
is the braindead architecture of current FPGAs, the limited integration density,
the whole thing being fixed into flatland, and -- most importantly -- the
limitations within designer's heads.

None of them are likely to remain a constant on the scale of two-three decades.
Even people do adapt and learn -- occasionally.

Disagreement is a symptom of a diseases, i.e., non-truth-seeking.  But its
not always a good idea to just directly eliminate symptoms.  Pain is a
symptom of bodily harm, but if we just eliminate pain direcly, we risk
not attending to real harms.  Similarly, directly eliminating disagreement
might be done via means other than inducing real truth-seeking.

Hydrogen is not at all hard to acquire. You can make hydrogen from
any (preferably hydrogen-rich) fuel by a fuel reforming process.
Googling for "hydrogen" "fuel" "reforming" or "reformer" should 
give you plenty of hits.

As to subject to explosions, I'm too tired (and have sniffed far
too much paint solvent today) to make a websearch, but I suspect
methane will do slightly better than hydrogen in terms of destruction,
though hydrogen has probably much larger explosion corridor.

Wtf, I did make a websearch, and found this:
	http://www.fuelcellstore.com/hydrogen_safety.html
I was wrong on a few issues, but not by much.

Of course a gas pipeline needs to have tighter checking on leaks
due to hydrogen higher diffusivity. But if you make your hydrogen
in the cellar in a fuel reformer, that's quite irrelevant.

What's wrong with methane? What's wrong with hydrogen, for that matter, if
it's made from water, using solar photons usually wasted to heat your roof?

Give **me** an example of just one out of the trillions of instances
of high-plasticity evolvable hardware runnning around on this
planet that's been successfully replicated in software!

Ah, now **there**'s the heart of the question, as far as I'm
concerned.  Don't matter what kind of software you write, if
you don't have big enough iron to run it on.  And what, precisely,
will constitute "reasonable" hardware for this particular job?

It ain't gonna be silicon, I can tell you that (my crystal ball
**insists** this is so, and I believe it, because it's the one the
Wicked Witch of the West had in her throne room.  I never had a
chance at the Ruby Slippers, but I tripped over that ball in this

Agree here. Not quite, actually, because nanotechnology could introduce
a substrate that actually restructures itself adaptively, dynamically.
For instance, one could implement some rarely changing control circuits 
in bucky circuitry, which would be more efficient than computronium
for that specific, rarely but changing task.

I'm kinda missing the word "speed" here.

Hmm. Reasonable as to "number of bits" and "speed of tweakage of said bits",
yes. Silicon does imply photolithography, and photolithography does
imply a certain structure size, flatland, and Moore saturating on that
substrate in about a decade. 

So, I disagree with the silicon part of "reasonable piece of silicon".
I would rather use the more neutral word "substrate".

Yes, but an AI which takes a MYear to say "Hello, world!" is perhaps not
very recognizable as an AI, especially given that you can't assess the
AIness of a precursor, if it's impractically slooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.
If I want to replay one GYear of evolution in practical time, I obviously need
something which is a great deal faster than realtime.

Basically, you don't balance very much, for most current purposes hardware
is a constant. If you want the most of crunch these days it means investing
in air conditioning and a hall full of PCs, and a large number of fat switches.

Speed, of course. That was easy.

Yes, yes, bring on the 3D packing, the fanouts, the connectivity, the

Microsoft is making an ass of itself once again.  If innovation and
profitability and all other goodness and apple pie was not present in
Open Source then Microsoft would have nothing to say about it.  It would
not need to.  But MS cannot with a straight face claim that proprietary
software and methods like its own are at the forefront of innovation,
give users and innovators outside of Microsoft the maximal value,  much
less that they are more secure and more dependable.  Microsoft is the
enemy of progress, not those of us who see that progress is best served
by opening software and and other information sources that greatly grow
in value by being maximally available and useful.  

It is true that the old pure software business models are in trouble. 
But it does not follow that the future must be constrained to support
old models that have been found seriously lacking.

The way I think of it is this.  Those who are both really bright and who
deeply care about changing the world for the better must learn to stand
regardless of the opposition.  For they know that there are no others
who
will do what could be done to improve the world better than they if they
default.   It is not a matter of simple self-confidence but of knowing
that the world and our future is in their hands and on their shoulders.

Or a theoretician or the center of a small web of extremely competent
hackers or one who weaves and starts the dissemination of a new
worldview.  It is simply incorrect to assume that nothing can be done
without having a large part of society behind you or that the amount of
society necessary to an enterprise cannot be motivated by the one or the
few. 

I love Russell, but he was often (with some cause) very cynical.

To put business interest above what is needed for the transformation of
humanity and what could well be required for humanity to survive what is
coming is nothing but EVIL.  Either one is ignorant of the implications
or one knows them and willingly acts against the knowledge.  There is no
"pragmatic" middle ground where evil is excused because it is perceived
as good for their business.

Hear, hear!  Or more generally push for real freedom across the board
and the dismantling of the huge machinery of the State.  A positive deep
vision would also be of tremendous help.

This seems a bit strained to me.  That A has a strong argument for X
that I cannot defeat logically does not compell me to accept X at that
time.  I may believe the argument leaves out something crucial than I
have as yet been unable to identify.  I may be correct or incorrect in
that evaluation and able or unable to express solid reasons for the
evaluation that others will be swayed by.  But to conclude I am simply
irrational or do not care about truth because I did not agree with A
about X in such circumstances does not follow.  

Humans are not pure reasoning machines and certainly not effective
Bayseian processors.  Much of our "reasoning", our processing of data,
concepts and so on is not even in the conscious realm.  It is quite
unlikely that only our conscious evaluations and adhering only to them
at all points will generally bring us closer to truth in all
circumstances.  The argument applies much better to a SI than to a
creature organized as we are.

What the hell does evolvable hardware have to do with this?  If you want to
make a straight hardware comparison to the human brain, you'll win some and
lose some.  You've basically ceded the argument.  Who cares if we haven't
done something as long as we know that its possible (realizing that any
argument to the contrary would be invoking magic)?  It took mankind a while
to learn powered flight as well.

Give me a processor that can properly utilize as many transistors as the
brain has neurons, and it would be a fair comparison.

Some points of clarification. The beta version is available now. This
version does not affect the mailing list at all, the ratings are only
available on the web archive. Also, the ratings apply to the content, not
the author.

The web archives are available at <http://forum.javien.com/forum/index.php>,
and should work with any web browser. There is a lag of a few minutes
between the mail broadcast and it appearing in the archive.

To rate archived content, you need to install client software (currently
only available for Windows, Linux is in the works). To register to get the
client software, go to <http://www.javien.com/members/>.

The ratings use collaborative filtering. That is, the recommended values
that you see will be specific to you. This works by correlating your ratings
with those of other users. For example, when Natasha rates on the basis of
adherence to 'the Extropian principles and a variety of essays that embody
content reflecting the goals, thoughts and feelings of "Extropy"', she will
then see recommendations for content based on the ratings of other users who
share that attitude.

To enter ratings you must create a pseudonymous identity, an "agent", which
has a micropayment account associated with it. We are still restricting the
beta somewhat in that only Extropy Institute members will be given money in
those accounts. But with this email, we are opening it up so that anyone on
this list may get the client software and try out the rating system, but
their account balance will remain at zero.

Enjoy!

Not relevant.  AI is AI is AI, even if we don't have the hardware to run it
fast enough to be useful.

I don't think you understand the problem fully.  Any evolvable hardware
architecture capable of doing AI implies the capability to generate a more
traditional architecture with roughly the same capability, just utilized
differently.  Any algorithm is reducible to an optimal form for any
architecture, and given the proper utilization of the implied circuit
generation capabilities, should give within an order of magnitude of the
same performance.  Evolvable hardware necessarily has a lot of overhead that
would be unnecessary on non-evolvable hardware, which is the trade-off for
speed at a specific task.  You can't claim massive technological
improvements in evolvable hardware without applying the same technological
improvements to non-evolvable hardware.  In the end, given a finite number
of transistors (or whatever) you can only squeeze out a certain amount of
computing power, whether the architecture is evolvable or not (ignoring
intentional stupidity on the part of the designer).  So it is pretty much
six of one, half a dozen of the other (yada yada Kolmogorov yada yada yada).

Hello, 

I received some feedback from one of developers (in Russian).
In short, "Russian Artificial Brain" doesn't seem to exist yet.
That posting was more like ad.

Still, they have some interesting working neural 
models which are subjects of IP protection. 

If someone is interested, I could forward that 
response (in Russian) in private email.
Or, if someone could recommend some reliable 
online RussianToEnglish translator, I could 
make a translation and post it to the list.

Evolvable hardware has the same limitations.  Good FPGAs aren't free or even
cheap.  The limitation is transistor count and transistor technology, not
how the transistors are arranged.

First, that doesn't really answer the question, and second, I would have to
ask "fast at what?".  Are you really going to claim that dollar for dollar
an FPGA can do everything a CPU/DSP can and faster?  The current state of
the computing market isn't completely arbitrary.  Transistor for transistor,
FPGAs offer few advantages (speed or otherwise) outside of specific niche
markets.

Very apt, and if anyone has the credentials to make the observations he does, 
it's Chricton.  I just watched "The Sixth Day" last night and, as usual, was 
angry at the end at the characterization of transhumanist technologies.  Of 
course, it would have been perfectly possible to make a film with just as 
much dramatic tension, just as many shoot-em-ups and obligatory parking 
garage blood-fests, except in which the real bad guys were the biological 
fundamentalists.  There were moments in the film when I had hope . . . but, 
alas, I'm afraid it just isn't meant to be (the pro-science, pro-reason 
Hollywood film, that is.)

Because it embodies, to a degree, a mode of operation which
some (not all, I'll grant you) neuroscientists have come to
believe is the key to intelligence not just in human beings
but in all animal nervous systems.  I can supply references,
if you're interested; if not, that's cool too!

I don't buy that it's possible, at this stage, to make a
"straight hardware comparison" to the human brain without
begging a lot of questions.

Nobody cares, unless they're in a particular hurry, or have
an emotional investment in believing that it's got to be done
in a particular way.

No it wouldn't -- not by a damn sight.  Your processor would still
come up way short.

No, it doesn't.  The paper has nothing to do with "You do not accept A's
arguments therefore you must be irrational."  Rather, it's "You do not
accept A's arguments, therefore you must believe that A is more irrational
than you are" - a belief that is, of course, often correct.  In essence,
Robin's paper demonstrates that everyone believes themselves to be more
meta-rational than average; or rather, acts as if they believed so.

I **knew** somebody was going to say that.  I picked something
off the soc.motss quote page that's apropos:

In theory, there is no difference between theory and
practice. In practice, there is.
 -- Muffy Barkocy

However, the argument's gone a bit off the rails here, in that speed
isn't the **whole** story.  Your original question was (paraphrasing)
"what the hell does high-plasticity, or evolvable, hardware have to do with
making an AI?".  Here's my take on this (my standard disclaimers apply here --
I don't have Eliezer Yudkowsky's brains, Eugene Leitl's degrees, or
Damien Broderick's seriousness of purpose in keeping up with the field in
order to write books about it [not to imply that Eugene and Damien don't have
brains, or that Eugene and Eliezer don't have seriousness of purpose, or...
well, you get the idea!]).

**If** you buy the selectionist arguments of Edelman, Changeux, et al.
about the basis of intelligence in animal nervous systems (maybe
you do, maybe you don't, or maybe you haven't thought about it; but
that's where I'm coming from, just so you know ;->), then there's something
special going on in biological brains (and bodies; they're really not
separable in this model) that cannot be simplified away (and it's nothing
mystical -- Edelman himself pooh-poohs Penrose's invocation of quantum
mechanics, or what Edelman calls "exotic physics").  This "something
special" -- competition and selection among the members of very large and
stochastically-varying sets of active elements (read the authors for
a better description) is probably accomplished directly in "hardware"
in animal brains.  As much **stuff** as there already is in the human
brain, if you're going to replace this squishy hardware substrate with
what Eliezer would (figuratively) call a more "crystalline" hardware substrate,
and **simulate** all that dynamic whoop-de-do in software (utilizing
some source of randomness to provide the variability among
the competing elements -- this is what it makes it different from
a Turing machine, sez Edelman), then that more regular and static
hardware substrate is going to have to have even **more** "stuff" in
it (I don't know how many orders of magnitude, but more than one,
I'd guess) than the already-stuffed biological brain does (just like
a CD player has to have more stuff in it to do basically the same
thing that an analog LP record player does).

I don't really know.  Eugene Leitl probably has a more informed
opinion about this.  Fullerene nanotubes have been getting a
lot of press lately.  Diamondoids out of Drexler have been
mentioned.  Maybe biological tissue -- if it can immortalized,
though I know some sort of (literally) crystalline gizmo has more
psychological appeal for a lot of body-hating techno-nerds
(like me!) -- like those crystals that everything on the
planet Krypton is made out of in the Superman movie (I
just bought the DVD ;->).  It would be nice to be able to
use something that can survive harsher environments (like
deep space) better than biological tissue can, and also
something that could be made to operate at higher speeds.

One thing that will probably keep natural gas as the fuel of choice is that 
hydrogen will embrittle and ultimately make steel gas lines fail. Also, 
hydrogen burns with a colorless flame (it does emit UV, that's how you can 
detect a hydrogen fire) so there are safety concerns with piping the pure 
gas around the country.

Thanks for the extra information, 'Gene. Doesn't it cost a lot to cover your
roof with the gear to convert solar photon energy to hydrogen? I mean, if this
were a feasible alternative to paying the electric utility companies, wouldn't
Californians be doing it right now? And if it is a feasible alternative,
shouldn't we be investing in fuel cell manufacturing?

I rode into downtown San Jose to make a sushi map, or
scope out some places and note when they close, so that
if anyone wants to go on foot after the meetings Friday
or Saturday, they could use that as a reference.

Unfortunately...  I forgot what day it is.

This weekend is not only a major Latin holiday, it was the first
really nice warm summery weekend we have had this year,
and there were approximately 8 trillion people down there
Cinco de Mayo-ing, low riders cruising, senioritas in their
little outfits, parading themselves shamelessly up and down
the sidewalks, cars parked bumper to bumper along the street.
Blocking my view.  }8-[     {8^D

Ill try again next weekend on the sushi map, and perhaps
I will not take the motorcycle this time.

The San Jose Hilton was an *excellent* choice of places
to have E5.  There is loooots of stuff to do right around there
within walking distance and it is a nice safe area of town,
close to the Tech museum, lots of interesting eateries and
such.  This is gonna be fun!   spike

Professor set to 'control' wife by cyborg implant

SURGEONS are preparing to create the first husband and wife cyborgs: they
intend to implant computer chips in a British professor and his wife to see if
they can communicate sensation and movement by thought alone.

The professor hopes it will show how two brains can interact; doctors at Stoke
Mandeville hospital, who will perform the surgery, hope it will lead to new
treatments for paralysis victims.

Butane seems to have potential as well.

http://www.fuelcells.org/fcnews.html
Cosmo Oil Develops Butane-Fueled System for Homes. Cosmo Oil, in cooperation
with Toshiba Corp., has developed a butane-fueled onsite fuel cell system for
power generation in homes. The fuel cell, which has a generation capacity of
up to one kilowatt, is the first time in Japan that fuel cells using butane
have been developed.

"The vision is staggering: a society powered almost entirely by hydrogen, the
most abundant element in the universe . . . The overall goal of DOE's Hydrogen
Program is to replace two to four quads of conventional energy with hydrogen
by the year 2010, and replace 10 quads per year by 2030. A quad is the amount
of energy consumed by 1 million households." National Renewable Energy
Laboratory

http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/geos/prev/Vol1_1/art09.htm
Breakthroughs in fuel cell development are sparking international interest and
the race is on to perfect this ultimate power source. Canada has become a
world leader in fuel cell technology. "We've been working on making the fuel
cell marketable since 1983 and we finally see light down the road," says Dr.
Martin Hammerli, Acting Manager of Hydrogen and Electrochemistry at CANMET's
Energy Technology Centre (CETC).

I consider the situation of two uninformed Bayesian agents becoming aware of=
=20
differences in priors about a binary world-state.  I derive their confidence=
=20
functions in the binary world-state upon the information of the other=E2=80=
=99s=20
priors and show the confidence functions coincide only if priors are drawn=20
from one particular distribution strongly informative on the world-state.  I=
=20
non-rigorously prove the result generalizes to a world with any finite numbe=
r=20
of possible states and to Bayesian agents with access to common public=20
information.  I present arguments for the conjecture that the result further=
=20
generalizes to worlds with infinite states and to Bayesians with private=20
information.  Hence, rational Bayesians with initially differing priors=20
should continue to disagree even when fully informed of each other=E2=80=99s=
 beliefs.

Take a world with two possible states, Q and ~Q.  Assume two Bayesian agents=
=20
with prior degrees of belief in Q, denoted as A and B, and degrees of belief=
=20
in ~Q of (1-A) and (1-B).  For notational convenience in text transmission,=20=
I=20
denote the degree of belief of a Bayesian agent with initial degree of belie=
f=20
X, given information Y, as (X)Y.  Priors provide information in that they=20
depend on the state of the world; for any given prior P there is a=20
probability P|Q of that prior in world with Q and P|~Q in worlds with ~Q. =20
This defines a function f(P) =3D (P|Q)/(P|~Q) which eases notation of=20
confidence functions upon the information of a new agent with prior P.

On learning of B, A should now have a degree of belief in Q of A*B|Q and a=20
degree of belief in ~Q of (1-A)*(B|~Q).  Normalizing A=E2=80=99s total degre=
e of=20
belief to 1 and using f(B) to simplify notation, I derive:
(A)B =3D A*f(B)/( A*f( B)+(1-A))  (1)

And by symmetry

(B)A =3D B*f(B)/(B*f(A) + (1-B))   (2)

If A and B commonize their priors on learning of each other, (A)B =3D (B)A
Solving for f:

A*f(B)/(A*f(B) + 1-A) =3D B*f(A)/(B*f(A) + 1-B)
A*f(B)(B*f(A) + 1-B) =3D B*f(A)( A*f(B) + 1-A)=20
AB*f(B)*f(A) + A(1-B)f(B) =3D AB*f(B)*f(A) + B(1-A)f(A)
A(1-B)f(B) =3D B(1-A)f(A)
F(A)/f(B) =3D A(1-B)/B(1-A)  (3)

This requires f(A) =3D cA/(1-A) (4), with some arbitrary constant c.  Hence=20
priors must be highly dependent on the world-state.  In particular,=20
completely uninformed individuals are almost never profoundly wrong: given=20
world-state Q, the chance of a prior with low A (relatively strong disbelief=
=20
in the actual world-state) goes to 0 as A goes to zero, and does so rather=20
rapidly.  This disagrees markedly with actual experience, which shows most=20
completely uninformed people have very incorrect beliefs.

Let us suppose the agents with priors A and B have access to additional=20
public information E prior to learning each other=E2=80=99s priors.  If they=
 concur=20
at this stage, then ((A)E)B =3D ((B)E)A.  By standard Bayesian inference,=20
((A)E)B =3D ((A)B)E  so ((A)B)E =3D ((B)A)E.  Hence, by Bayesian rules (A)B)=
 =3D=20
(B)A.  Hence two Bayesian agents with access to public information will=20
concur only under exactly the same restrictive conditions required to concur=
=20
in the absence of public information.

A world with three states Q, R, and S can be described with the binary=20
beliefs Q/~Q and R/~R, given that Q implies ~R.  In order for two agent to=20
agree on degrees of belief to all three states, they must concur on both Q=20
and R.  The requirements to concur on binary beliefs Q and R are as above. =20
By induction, two agents will concur on finite multi-state worlds only if th=
e=20
probability of a degree of belief AN in each particular state N follows the=20
condition p(AN) =3D cAN(1-AN).

Even if the world consist of an infinite set of possible states, these can b=
e=20
partitioned into two sets, each of which can be partitioned into two sets,=20
etc., leading to a sequence of binary possibilities Q1, Q2, Q3,=E2=80=A6  Fo=
r two=20
agents to concur on the confidence function over all sets, it seems intuitiv=
e=20
they must concur on Q1, Q2, Q3 =E2=80=A6, with each concurrence requiring th=
e=20
distribution of priors on each Q follow condition (4).

Finally, if Bayesian agents with private information meet, the conclusion=20
above follows by replacing prior A with private-informed degree of belief A.=
 =20
The requirement in (4) still holds, except that now private-informed beliefs=
,=20
rather than priors, must follow the distribution.  I conjecture that if, in=20
some world, (4) holds for private-informed beliefs, gain or loss of private=20
information would in general cause (4) to no longer hold. =20

My personal experience is that priors and private information are only weakl=
y=20
informative; i.e., even given world-state Q obtains, it isn=E2=80=99t partic=
ularly=20
difficult to find uninformed individuals with strong disbelief in Q.  Given=20
this, the probability of a given degree of belief A in Q varies only mildly=20
with whether Q obtains.  Hence the information derived from a given person=20
holding a degree of belief Q is small and a rational Bayesian should have=20
only a small change in belief on learning another=E2=80=99s opinions.  Ratio=
nal=20
Bayesians, then, generally should maintain differences of opinion due to=20
differences in priors.  Under most circumstances, for two agents to commoniz=
e=20
priors requires a violation of Bayesian inference.

Hmm, I'm mentioned in the same paragraph as Bill Gates and Larry Ellison. 
Clearly this is an omen portending that one day I am going to be *really* 
rich.  ;-)

Oracle CEO Funds Age-Control Research

If the best way to beat your enemies is to outlive them, then that may 
explain one of Larry Ellison's favorite investment projects: side-stepping 
the Grim Reaper. The Oracle CEO is one of the largest private supporters of 
research to control aging, investing millions toward the cause via his 
Ellison Medical Foundation.

Bill Gates has also invested millions in biotech, but his funding seems to 
be more focused on curing disease, says Max More, president of the Extropy 
Institute: "Ellison is more interested in funding research for dramatic 
extension of the human life span." One Ellison Medical Foundation grant 
went to a University of Idaho researcher who's studying the longevity of 
birds, which can live six times longer than mice, even with similar 
metabolism and body size.

And the last paragraph is at:

Sure, if you do it after the house was built. Now if you plan the thin-film
PV to be part of the facade/roof, it's just an incremental cost on structural
materials, and of course the economies of scale will soon make it about as
expensive as floatglass sheets. Future alternatives involve flexible solar cells,
possibly from plastic, and artificial photosynthesis, after we get a lot better
with understanding the photosynthetic center, and create cheap, long-lasting
substitutes.

Energy is cheap, and installation costs are high, it needs some R&D and 
a decade of economy of scale powered growth.

Mercaptanes poison platinum group metal electrodes in fuel cells quite
quickly, unfortunately. Only high temperature fuel cells are more or
less immune to them, and you can directly use methan in them.

Hydrogen flame is not that invisible, and it doesn't radiate much
because it doesn't have hot soot radiating as blackbody.

That's an urban legend. It happened in the early days of ammonia synthesis,
but you'll notice the pressure and the temperature at which that synthesis
is conducted. At normal conditions you can use steel pipe just fine.

I don't think that's a problem in reality. But the point is that to start
using hydrogen you can stick to the old methane pipelines. Just just make
hydrogen when you need it.

I did a search on "hydrogen embrittlement". The primary cause seems to be 
wet environments, and cathodic protection of buried equipment, aside from 
fabrication treatments. The pipelines would need to be kept very dry and 
free from anything that could liberate hydrogen ions.

Most buried pipelines are equipped for cathodic protection. This should not 
affect the inside of the pipe....

Main gas lines operate at significant pressures - the long transport lines 
are the ones I am concerned with. Ultimately, a specially coated line will 
be developed to prevent stress cracks and embrittlement, but the present 
infrastructure will limit us to methane (or butane!) for quite a while.

The problem of letting humans sense H2 leaks is a thorny one, if the 
traditional odiferants cause problems in fuel cells. One ray of hope I just 
read about (Science, 4/21/2001) is a mid temp (160 C) fuel cell that does 
not use platinum catalysts. Perhaps this chemistry is resistant to poisoning.

The issues of (largely electrolytic) hydrid and atomic hydrogen
embrittlement and high-pressure/high-temperature typically do not occur
together. The steel embrittlement was an early plague of the Haber Bosch
process, which occurs at 500 atm and 450 deg C. Now these are not the
typical conditions under which a pipeline is operated, especially
considering the temperature.

Methane high-temp cells with nickel electrodes are pretty much immune to

In any case, one would want to generate the hydrogen locally, either from
methane, using existing natural gas infrastructure, or from water via
electrolysis or photolysis, which renders above arguments nilpotent.

Some points of clarification. The beta version is available now. This
version does not affect the mailing list at all, the ratings are only
available on the web archive. Also, the ratings apply to the content,
not the author.

The web archives are available at
<http://forum.javien.com/forum/index.php>, and should work with any web
browser. There is a lag of a few minutes between the mail broadcast and
it appearing in the archive.

To rate archived content, you need to install client software (currently
only available for Windows, Linux is in the works). To register to get
the client software, go to <http://www.javien.com/members/>.

The ratings use collaborative filtering. That is, the recommended values
that you see will be specific to you. This works by correlating your
ratings with those of other users. For example, when Natasha rates on
the basis of adherence to 'the Extropian principles and a variety of
essays that embody content reflecting the goals, thoughts and feelings
of "Extropy"', she will then see recommendations for content based on
the ratings of other users who share that attitude.

To enter ratings you must create a pseudonymous identity, an "agent",
which has a micropayment account associated with it. We are still
restricting the beta somewhat in that only Extropy Institute members
will be given money in those accounts. But with this email, we are
opening it up so that anyone on this list may get the client software
and try out the rating system, but their account balance will remain at
zero.

Enjoy!

I would predict that all the lists except for the "party and light
conversation" list would quickly die; that list would then become
indistinguishable from the original list.

Personally, I really enjoy the list the way it is - it's like an anarchic
Extropian soap opera / talk show. It's the best show not on TV.

I think that Email lists, warts and all, are one of the most effective
styles of forum for maintaining a subscriber base; very low friction... once
you are subscribed, very little proactivity is required to participate (and
no little amount of effort is required to remove yourself). Be careful
before moving to a web-based forum instead of an email list.I know email
seems sooo stone age, but it's working... we have some evidence already that
a web forum isn't necessarily better.

This is a very good point and possibly event true. Nevertheless interacting
with such
an intelligence will truely be a very alien experience and as such the value
of such intercourse
would be very limited indeed. This is the reason designers around the world
from basic
consumer software to robots are trying to make them "human" so that we feel
more comfortable
interacting with them, thus deriving more value from the experience.

EXTRO-5 -- LUNCH GATHERINGS

Spike is already gathering info on sushi restaurants near to the conference 
hotel -- the San Jose Hilton & Towers. We plan to have in the registration 
packets a list of all the nearby restaurants to make it easy for attendees 
to find a place for lunch on Saturday and Sunday (and Friday for early 
arrivals, and Sunday dinner for those who refuse to go home).

I regard networking as an especially important aspect of this fifth Extro, 
so I want to have a list of places to eat and sign-up boards to enable 
people more easily to get to know each other or to talk more by arranging 
to meet at particular places for lunch.

Apart from having a message board where people can sign up to say that they 
will be at  particular restaurant, can you suggest ways to help coordinate 
people who want to flock together? Much will happen spontaneously, but with 
a large group where you can't always easily find someone you want to lunch 
with on short notice, some means of connecting up would be helpful. (Maybe 
in a couple of years we can hand out a cheap PDA that will let you enter 
the people you want to lunch with and the kinds of food you like and the 
software will match you up.)

A public board may not work for everyone, as some may want to meet 
privately to have a focused lunch discussion. Any suggestions welcome!

If traditional odiferants cause problems in fuel cells, don't use 
traditional odiferants

surely someone can come up with substitutes...

Thom's question is quite open-ended, so I couldn't reply quickly. He said 
it was okay to forward his question. Anyone willing to answer adequately 
and help feed a hungry young brain?

Thanks,

Max

While I am not sure if this is the same one as what Spike has on his wall, I
do remember that we had something like the following on ExI's website some
time ago.  I believe it was Eric Watt Forste who originally created or
adapted it:

Easier said than done. The whole point of using methylmercaptane is that
it is organoleptically detectable in ridiculously low concentrations.

More to the point, it is the standard additive to natural gas. You can
hence assume it as a design constant.

May be, but how will you get people to use them?

What your analysis leaves out (I think) is the possibility of symmetry
between the observers.  Of course it isn't rational for a perfect Bayesian
reasoner to adjust vis opinions based on what humans think - at most, vis
opinions should be adjusted when ve encounters a human who could plausibly
be making vis conclusions based on novel but correct information. 
However, a human, encountering another human, must consider the
possibility of an internal mistake as well as an external mistake.  That
all humans evaluate themselves as having a considerably above-average
meta-rationality, and hence a considerably lower-than-average possibility
of underestimating how likely an internal mistake is, is not compatible
with rationality on the part of all observers; it implies an evolved bias
to overestimate rationality or meta-rationality.

In the mean time, perhaps we could have an on-site computer (attended,
at the info desk or registration desk, with the monitor angled such
that each user's lookups are hidden from public view and going back to
a standard query screen between users) to do the same thing?

It would probably also help to have certain designated-open lunches,
for the benefit of members who don't know too many others so they can
just show up (provided they sign up in advance so the restaurant can
know how much table space to set aside).

Even a Friendly AI might need to maintain a personality overlay that could
appear to take offense at insults and so on - a possibility I conceded
after watching episode 3 of "Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040".  I adjusted
pretty quickly by reminding myself of the AI's internal perspective - that
it was just requested behaviors being carried out, with no particular
meaning to the AI - after which I lost the impulse to flee screaming into
the night.  I'm just not sure that the rest of humanity would adjust
equally quickly to an android waitress that sees nothing particularly
wrong or offensive or abnormal about, for example, being asked to lick
spilled coffee off of someone's boots, or an android secretary being asked
to laugh for two minutes.  The point is that a personality overlay would
be maintained as a subgoal of Friendliness - of not sending people
screaming into the night - and wouldn't affect the underlying goal system.

I think you've missed the point.  My argument is not about responding to
arguments at all - it is about responding to opinions, and hence about
responding to all those unconscious processes you celebrate.  You have
unconscious processes and so do they.  To prefer the output of your
processes to theirs you have to assume that you are more meta-rational.

Ok so if it is organoleptically detectable in ridiculously low 
concentrations, then what about not using human noses, what about electronic 
sniffer chips standardised, cheaply mass produced, and manditory by law, 
like smoke detectors?

Eeensy-weensy correction:  To prefer the output of your processes to
theirs, you have to assume that you are better-informed or a better
thinker.  This does not mean disagreement, however; you may both believe
that Pat is the better-informed of the two, and adjust the "compromise"
opinion to be primarily weighted towards Pat's.  If you each believe that
you are the more rational (that is, the better-informed), then to not
think the situation is symmetrical, you must believe that you are more
meta-rational.  If you both believe that you are both more meta-rational,
one of you must be wrong.

I don't know any cheap mass-produced sensors which have an odour
threshold of:

Odor Threshold: Ethanethiol=0.2 ppb, isopropyl mercaptan=0.024 ppb TBM=0.008 ppb

http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:www.oxychem.com/products/msds/m36047.pdf+mercaptan+ppb&hl=en

This is mindbogglingly low. Even while we're not canines, our rhinoequipment

Havn't we discussed this before and found that the basic fallacy here is
pretending that it is without cost to sign up?

If using your money for signing up for Cryonics gives you a lower overall
chance of surviving indefinately than using them for general healthcare or
other things to improve your longivity it's not such an easy choice.

Professor Warwick again.  He'd mentioned this experiment in his Christmas 
lectures.

I've read his book "In the Mind of the Machine".  He accepts that AI is 
coming, but doesn't think humans will survive it.  He doesn't buy into the 
uploading or "machine enhanced human" scenarios.

Interesting work he's been doing with basic neural nets though.

I have not "celebrated" anything, merely pointed out something I
believe has bearing.  I have no clear means to determine who is
and is not more "meta-rational".   I have a more or less
informaed opinion about who I believe is more likely to be
correct in a given situation and on a given subject.

Well if people dared, you could get their cell phone numbers and include
a listing of those in the packet of materials. You could also give a phone
to whoever is manning the public board so people could call in there to
announce newly formed lunch meetings so others have a chance to meet up.

Couldn't find "In the Mind of the Machine" at Amazon or BN, but google worked
wonderfully:
"It is surprising how humans, for the most part, appear to accept as a basic
principle that they are the superior beings on Earth, that is how it is now
and that is how it always will be . . . This is clearly wishful thinking on
the part of humans." --Kevin Warwick
http://www.nua-tech.com/paddy/warwick.shtml
"The human race, as we know it, is very likely in its end game; our period of
dominance on Earth is about to be terminated. We can try and reason and
bargain with the machines which take over, but why should they listen when
they are far more intelligent than we are? All we should expect is that we
humans are treated by the machines in the same way that we now treat other
animals, as slave workers, energy producers or curiosities in zoos. We must
obey their wishes and live only to serve all our lives, what there is of them,
under the control of machines."

At Amazon.com I found these titles by Warwick:
*Failsafe Control Systems : Applications and Emergency Management
by Kevin Warwick, Ming T. Tham
*Robotics : Applied Mathematics and Computational Aspects (The Institute of
Mathematics and Its Applications Conference Series, New Series No 41)
*Control Systems : An Introduction (Prentice Hall International Series in
Systems and Control Engineering)
*Computer-Intensive Methods in Control and Signal Processing : The Curse of
Dimensionality
*Implementation of Self Tuning Controller (Control Engineering Series, 35)

and at BN.com:
*Virtual Reality in Engineering
*Mutual Impact of Computing Power and Control Theory
and a few others...

Warwick has been at this quite a while.

Maybe his chip/human interfacing experiments will soften some of his dire
predictions.

Yeah but the cost (at least for me here in the USA) is less than the cost
of my car insurance every month. If you can't afford to insure yourself
instead of your car, then you should re-evalute your priorities :-)

I apologize for not being complete in my earlier statement

I meant to ask, what about electronic SENSOR chips standardized, cheaply 
mass produced, and mandatory by law, like smoke detectors or Co2 detectors 
that would detect "sniff" a unique chemical dopiant, that would not be 
deterious to the fuel apparatus, this would not be a mercap*, but something 
unique?

I have to admit that's one of his attractions for me.
I may respond to a certain strain of melancholic romanticism
in fiction (Tolkien, Clarke, Stapledon, even J. G. Ballard),
but when it comes to the real world, I need lots and lots
of lemon juice to make even a spoonful of sugar go down.
It's sort of the obverse of that saying "If the world hands
you a lemon, make lemonade."  ;->

I passed a billboard in Times Square this evening as I was
heading for the Port Authority Bus Terminal that made me think
of AIs taking over the world.  It was an ad for one of those nasty
"reality TV" shows, all in red, with a woman in spectacles who
looks something like that no-nonsense chief resident character
on _ER_ played by Laura Innes.  The white lettering at the top
said "YOU ARE THE WEAKEST LINK", and at the bottom, "GOODBYE".
It had a sort of _1984_-ish look, and the woman would be a good
choice for a "Ms." O'Brien.

I thought it was even more menacing than "All your base are
belong to us."  ;->

Curt Adams today offered a derivation purporting to show that if two agents
start with different priors, and then each update their beliefs on the fact
that the other one was assigned the prior they got, then the posteriors of
the two agents will not be the same except under unusual circumstances.  I
agree that Curt has in fact show this.

I suspect that Curt thinks that his result contradicts something that I
have said, but I do not see any contradiction.  The standard agreeing to
disagree literature starts with agents who have the same priors, and show
that updating on statements of opinions produces common beliefs.  I also
have a paper on the causal origins of priors
(http://hanson.gmu.edu/prior.pdf or .ps) which shows how updating on the
fact that you were assigned the prior you got can imply common priors.  But
neither of these contradict Curt's derivation.

I intuitively doubt this, unless you're sufficiently povertystricken that
the marginal value of a few extra bucks of disposable income is very
large.  Suppose, conservatively, that cryonics has a 10% chance of being
successful, factoring in the probability that you will die in a way that
precludes being frozen.  (Any statistics on the number of cryo folks who
die in a way that precludes successful preservation?)  Suppose also that
the chance of your dying in a trucking accident or whatever is 0.2%/year,
at least until you reach age 60 or whenever the chance starts going up. 
Then you'd need to purchase a 0.02%/year better chance of survival, i.e. a
10% decrease in your total chance of mortality, with your $50/month or
whatever your life insurance costs, before it was worth trading in your
cryo bracelet for.

Plus I would think you would need to factor in how many years you would
purchase per 100 dollars spent. My guess is this alone makes cryonics FAR
FAR more effcient.

As I understood the paper you recently referenced on this list, you and Tyler 
were saying people did not act as truth-seeking Bayesians because they 
continued to disagree after extensive exchange of information.  From this
you conclude people usually don't behave as TSB's.  Isn't this reasoning
at odds with my derivation that Bayesian agents with initially differing 
priors will usually disagree even after full exchange of information?

Your paper was indeed based on the assumption of common priors.  
I don't disagree with the conclusion above, given the cp assumption.
But, we all know people often act as if they have differing priors.
You do attempt to justify that people *should* have common priors.

"If John and Mary have different priors, then they should realize some
physical process produced that difference.  And if that difference was
produced randomly or arbitrarily, it is not clear that John and Mary
should retain it."

That's what I was addressing.  If John and Mary do not retain their
priors, the under most circumstances they aren't acting as rational
Bayesian agents.  That seems a legitimate reason to maintain
differing priors.  

Actually, by my analysis, it is precisely when John and Mary's 
priors are *most* arbitrary that they should disagree most.  The
better-based the priors are, the more encountering each other will
lead to agreement.

Thanks!

OK, but it is nothing more than this, which I stole from Ralph Merkle:

Doesn't Innes do a terrific job as Dr. Weaver?  Shows to

No government regulation is necessary to equip every human with
noses, and the smell of "gas" (methane is odorless) has been
firmly entrenched in our culture as "uh-oh, we have a problem".

Of course there are still Darwin award winners who insist to light 
a match, or flip a switch (okay, latter is a probably a reflex) to 
investigate where the gas leak is...

This thought is entirely new to me, yet makes perfect sense.
(After all, truly deterministic and spontaneous action occurs
only when entropy increases, no?)  But in none of my readings on
reversible computation have I ever seen this point made.  So what
is going on?  Perhaps the authors of most works assume that you'd
need just a tiny minimal amount of entropy increase to drive a
calculation forward, and then an equally tiny increase in entropy
to drive it backwards.

If you then keep decreasing such a minimal entropy increase, then
"mistakes" occur, and the process takes a step backwards while its
long term progress is forward, and vice-versa.  Random walks with
p arbitrarily close to .5 do eventually move in the right direction.
Perhaps Hal's point isn't as significant as I was beginning to think
(he implies that it's not terribly significant).

I would like to insert here that "the feel", itself, is a rather long
computational process.  Therefore, so far as I can see, it probably
makes no difference to the conclusion here that you and others (who
are also up to speed on this issue) arrive at.  Thus it follows that
if you had to choose between an experience that expended entropy X but
backtracked at numerous points, and the same experience that went
straight to the conclusion, but expended 2X entropy, then you
should be indifferent.

But not me.  In 1996, I started a thread called "Repeated Experience",
and I think that I won all the arguments about it---or at least didn't
lose---except for one point Robin Hanson got me on.  I was (and still
am) convinced that in almost all thought experiments, repeated 
experience is to be reckoned as highly as the "original" (identical)
experience.  I mean (and meant) that to be taken quite literally.

So I, on the other hand, might prefer the longer "back-tracking" 
experience, since I would gain more additional desireable runtime
from it (unless, of course, it was undesireable experience).

:-)  For example, if you and I attend the same party and are 
equally ravished, then I might be able to prove to you that
it "lasted longer" for me (even though I don't remember it),
and point out that certain exceedingly pleasurable transitions
that occurred during the party were experienced by me many,
many times, and by you only once.

The monthly cost for a suspension contract seems to be a fairly small
amount compared to whatever value you put on your life, other outlays
for lifestyle and perhaps also the cost of longevity health care.

So the matrix becomes:

                             Not signed up       Signed up
Cryonics doesn't work             O                O - C
Cryonics works                    O              O - C + L

C is the cost of cryonics, L is the value of your life (assumed to be >>
C) and O is the amount of money you can spend on other beneficial stuff.

If cryonics has probability P of working, then the benefits of signing
up are better than the benefits of not signing up if
P(O-C+L)+(1-P)(O-C)>O, or PL>C. So roughly speaking, if the value of
your life times the chance you think cryonics has to work is on the same
order of of magnitude as cryonics costs, then it starts to get
interesting.

This thought is entirely new to me as well, and makes absolutely no sense
at all. I don't recall the canonical definition of reversiblity (a 30 sec
session with Google should pull it up), but I would define it that during
system evolution no two or more states may be mapped to a single state.

If you don't erase information, in theory you can make computations at
constant entropy. This is theoretical best case, in practice you will have
to make allowance for an entropy increase, but a smaller entropy increase
than in the case of irreversible system evolution. This is true also for
current computers, but it is not visible because this vanishes on the
background of normal operational power dissipation.

In case of high switch density and rapid rate of operation, you would want
to use reversible computation, or risk turning your piece of computronium
into a pool of carbon lava.

I consider Warwicks speculations combined with his media savy a quite 
worrying threat to transhumanism. The risk is that he manages to do 
spectacular stunts, drawing attention to his ideas about the imminent 
cybercalypse, helping spread an anti-AI sentiment ("terrestrialism" in the 
terms of Hugo de Garis, who is doing nearly the same thing). The problem here 
is that he has not really given much thought to likely development paths and 
forms of human-AI interaction. This is why the E5 panels about this issue are 
so important: we better do the analysis and start a more serious debate on 
how to make AI social than professor Warwick does.

I admire the courage of him and his wife, though.

And what is the cost of passing a selection of your knowledge, skills and
qualities to a child or a young person, who thus continues the "life" of the
meaningful points of your existence?

I don't have any extractable meaningful points of my existence.  I just
want to achieve immortality the Woody Allen way: by not dying.

Having a kid or mentoring a young person is entirely orthogonal to that
basic desire. It is basic, since it is irreducible to a series of
deductive steps. It is anchored purely in emotion, and hence doesn't need
to be explained.

The desire to have children is clearly NOT orthogonal to the desire to never
die, either in terms of common human psychology or in terms of biology.

In biological terms, neither the desire to live forever nor the desire to
have children are "irreducible."  They are both at least largely reducible
to the desire to propagate one's DNA.  (Or, to put it differently, of the
desire of one's DNA to propagate itself using one's human body/mind as a
medium)

In psychological terms, I'm curious: does the person who wrote this actually
~have~ children?  There is a real subjective feeling that I have that my
kids carry on some "essence" of myself.  I am sure that I am not the only
parent to have this feeling.  And it seems mighty plausible that this
feeling originates, evolutionarily, from the fact that a parent's DNA wants
the parents to protect his/her children.

I have to agree with Eugene here.  Hal seems to be talking about a
"completely" reversible computer, which I don't think is what people
mean by a reversible computer.

You were addressing updating on the fact that someone else received

What is the cost today? Could your house be used to pay for the procedure

"mind child."
That *is* your baby, right? (Don't worry. Nobody's demanding child support.)

I always suspected I was a freak, thanks for confirming it ;) What I meant
to say that I don't mind having children, but I don't consider them as my
proxies. I do not go on living in them in any meaningful way after my
worldline ends, as the genome does not encode the person, nor do a few
disparate meme make up a person, not even a fragment of a person. Kids are
nice, kids are horrible, but they're just kids. No more, no less.

I do not deny that the DNA is modulating my decisions, but the result is
the same: we do things because we want them. We can't dump all our
motivations in a purely rationalizable terms. Whenever one pursues a chain
of logic, one invariably winds up at some basic unquestionable motivations
which are not rooted in reason. I believe Aleks was implying that the
desire to live forever was somehow wanting in comparison to the
constructive tasks accomplished by having biological or memetic children.

While I do not deny that these tasks are constructive (in fact I might
still engage in some of them) they're in no meaningfull way better (in
absence of a global metric) than the desire to live on, while shifting
from pure Darwin to a mix of Darwin/Lamarck, and to joing the stellar
Diaspora. Whatever floats your boat.

> In psychological terms, I'm curious: does the person who wrote this
> actually ~have~ children?  There is a real subjective feeling that I

The person in question (who's that? hey, that's me!) does not have
children. Of course the fact of having a child expresses some latent
biological programmes, modulating your behaviour. If you know young
parents, you're surely aware of what I mean. Some of them are even aware
of what is happening to them, as their attitudes are being rather
forcefully readjusted. Biology is nothing to be trifled with.

> have that my kids carry on some "essence" of myself.  I am sure that I

I do not deny your subjective experience, of course, but this does in no
way invalidate absence of such subjective experience in my case.

> plausible that this feeling originates, evolutionarily, from the fact

That seems like a rather probable assumption to make. It is interesting
that the shift is so profound that the loss of control itself is perceived
as a positive thing.

I do believe that the above is important as well, though I don't see how it
in any way counters the inclination towards cryopreservation.  A young
person (i.e.: child) will indeed have a large part of the parent stamped
upon his personality and will necessarily have a large amount of the
parent's "knowledge, skills and qualities."  However, would the child not
also like to have hope that "daddy's not dead?"  The death of a parent
(particularly for a child under 15 is a devastating thing and impacts a
child's development much more than most things that parent could pass on.
The question of "why" the parent is dead is one that is most often not
easily answered.  At least with cryonics, it provides the child with hope.
Even if the parent dies when that child is an adult, the above points that
Aleks makes have already been passed on.  I am not sure how one cancels out
the other.

Anders, I agree completely on the disturbing message that Warwick is 
pushing (without any hint of alternative possibilities that I have seen). 
The Saturday morning Extro-5 discussions *will* be important in countering 
this. Apart from the press present at the event, we need to put together a 
statement following the event (on this and other issues) presenting 
alternative views.

The Extro-5 presenters will not all be in agreement, but any announcement 
of our discussions can show the alternatives to the nightmare 
human-annihilation scenario that Warwick, de Garis and some others are 
drawing as the only picture.

Onward!

I think, you forget an important point in this discussion:

What if the singularity comes before I die, rendering the
money I spent on cryonics useless?

This changes the risk/payoff matrix this way:


                         Not signed up   Signed up  
Singularity occures       
before I die or           
cryonics doesn't          A                A-C
work


Singularity comes         A                A-C+L
after I die and
cryonics works


So if you are optimistic enough, you don't sign up!

If you are that optimistic re: the Singularity, then why worry about the
here and now at all? If you were 100% convinced that the Singularity can
be made to occur soon, AND that it will be a vastly beneficial Singularity,
then why aren't you cancelling your vacation trips and donating every
single spare DM you've got to SIAI or another organization that you think
will accelerate the arrival date?

The fact is, no one can be that certain. You have to have a backup plan
just in case.

Not to mention the fact that it would really suck to die in an accident
or other premature way right before the Singularity, and not make it to
it because you passed on cryonics.

That's doesn't seem real smart, genius or not.
But then again, a true genius is encouraged to be
annoying by mere mortals since being annoying
is the trait that allows the mere mortals to level
the playing field by constantly pointing out how
annoying they are.

I'd tend towards #4 along with the cat, perhaps
yawning even wider.

The discovery of my own claim to genius was
unearthed by the branch of the US government noted
for taking Pacific atols via amphibious landings.  Today
they claim they want "a few good men". But at that
time - roughly coincident with the setting of Kubrick's
"Full Metal Jacket" - they would take just about anyone,
and often did. They took me, after all.

At boot camp at Parris Island, SC in mid-November '68,
we spent the better part of a day taking a battery of
standardized tests, including an IQ test.  We did this
just after getting at least 6 different immunization shots
rammed rudely into various parts of our body.

Perhaps a week later, during the time we were allowed
to shower or take a dump (choices!) the DI yelled,
"Lambert! Come here you crazy fuck"

"Private Lambert reporting to the Drill Instructor," I
said after running to him like a fool fearing for  life
and limb.

"You got the highest mark on this island this year
on the IQ test.  Are you some kind of fucking genius?
Then why do you look so stupid? Do you think you're
smarter than me? Hey Ladies... Lambert here thinks
he's a fucking genius."

There follwed a number of questions for which there
are only wrong answers and wrong answers get
your toes mashed with combat boots or a couple
of rigid fingers driven into your solar plexus. He
was aiming to prove that genius doesn't hold much
currency in Marine boot camp, and true value lies
in knowing the pressure points that can turn
someone unconscious faster than a network
sit-com. It was show time and I was the show.

They made me take the IQ test again. While my mates
were crawling on their bellies through a swamp
somewhere, I sat taking the exact same test, this
time alone except for a corporal sitting in front of me
watching my every move. Did they think I copied my
answers from the paper of the kid from West Virginny
sitting next to me who's IQ was less than the average
yearly temperature in Nome? (true fact... one guy was
booted out because his IQ was below the lowest of low
standards, 80, I believe.)

Since I took the test before and wasn't quite as
woozy from the shots nor as sleep deprived, I guess I
got a few points higher. The DI said after the second
test results came back, "Lambert, I guess you are a
fucking genius after all. Who would've fucking believed
it. La dee fucking dah." I think this last sentence has
framed how I think about standardized tests ever since,
"La dee fucking dah."

All this did was get me noticed in a place you want to avoid
being noticed.  The practical outcome was that I was assigned
to "teach" Marine recruits who couldn't break down and
reassemble a rifle bindfolded within an alloted time how to
do it. In some cases this was a hopeless proposition, for
there were a couple of guys  who couldn't do that simple
task in a million years even without a blindfold or a time
limit. When they couldn't pass at the official test, I got
the shit kicked out of me again )but they never needed
such excuses anyway since the best lesson you could
ever learn was to get the shit kicked out of you for no
particular rhyme nor reason).

{Anway, coming down from the USMC rant... trying
to wash away the smell of gunpowder mixed with
the sweet aroma of pot smoke and the never
forgotten ring in the ear of anti-war protests...}

These days, popular educational theorists down play
the IQ tests as any full measure of intelligence. They
claim 7 types of intelligence, only a few of which are
touched on by an IQ test.  The 7 intelligences are (if I
remember correctly): mathematical, spatical, verbal,
musical, physical (mechanical), intrapersonal (knowing
one's self) , and interpersonal. It is this new way of
viewing intelligence that helps explain math genii who
can't tie their shoes or why someone like Muhamed Ali
with a measured IQ of 85 can get the world begging at
his feet, playing the press and media like a violin virtuoso.

It seems your friend, Ann Marie, got short changed
in respect to interpersonal and perhaps intrapersonal
intelligence. You might untactfully explain to him
that these will catch up with him sooner  than any
inability to make correct change and are much more
useful types of intelligence than any talent for solving
complex equations in your head.  When all is said and
done about IQ tests,  "La dee fucking dah" about sums
it up. I think my DI was a genius.

I've long contended that "genius" intelligence is akin to having a chair
with one leg very long.  It can be a lifelong struggle to get the other
parts in sync.  Intuitively I'd call genius the integration of the "short
legs" into the precocious model.

1.) Chicks don't necessarily dig a high IQ.  I'm still alone, and I
score about 140-160 (140 on one part, off the scale == higher than 155
on the other).
2.) 140 is not genius level, in my book.  That's close enough to my IQ
that I can make comparisons to me without being too far off.  I'm
probably smart enough to say that if you compared me to two randomly
selected people, I'd be smarter than both of them, but I can't solve
twenty partial differential equations in my head or anything like that.

Is this a Stanford-Binet IQ test that he scored so well on?  If so,
aren't those typically given to children, whereas others, like the
WAIS-III are given to adults?

If so, is this person not an adult?

That's me.  I can use it to build confidence.  There's not much else
that I can do with is.

I've never accomplished very much, so I wouldn't say that.  On the other
hand, while I do feel that accomplishment is in an entirely different
category, I also think that it's quite important.  Ask this friend of
yours about a few questions that an average genius should be able to get
right:

1.) Who wrote Faust? (this was the final question for the ``common
	knowledge'' section of the WAIS-III)
2.) In _A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man_, what is the
	significance of color?
3.) Some people say that _The Odyssey_ is more of a story about
	Telemachus than abous Odysseus.  Do you agree or disagree, and
	why?
4.) Prove that if a positive integer is not a perfect square, its square
	root is irrational.
5.) Prove Fermat's Last Theorem (the proper response is: No!  That's
	100 pages long!)
6.) Which increases faster--exp(x) or x! ?
7.) State the law of Universal Gravitation
8.) Define conservation of energy and momentum
9.) What is the speed of light equal to?  No, I mean, what are the
	constants that must be multiplied together to get the speed
	of light?

10.) Here's a slide rule.  Add the following numbers...

I've always been firmly a #3 sort of person, moreso after they moved the 
bell curve ~down~ on the Stanford-Binet IQ tests a while ago (which does 
beg the question: does that mean people actually ~became~ smarter?. :-) )

I have a few people in my life who I would regard as true geniuses because 
of their accomplishments and their ~applied~ intelligence, but they don't 
acknowledge that themselves (which I consider a good sign). Note the 
emphasis: it isn't how big, but how they use it. :-)

Another reason why I never joined MENSA.

But then again, I may be in the minority here. If so, please regard it as a 
sign that I'm not a genius.

The problem as I see it is that Warwick's Performance Art gets confused with his job as a professor.  It happens when artists are both professors and Performance Artists.  Laurie Anderson had an easier time of it because her intention was to entertain with intelligent sound bytes while bringing literature to her themes and the body of her work has been to inspire and communicate rather than to disarm.  Stelarc is another example of a Performance Artist who uses the machine/human medium to shock his audience, but his work his art and not a sidebar to being something else.

Performing stunts is a way for Performance Artists to obtain attention.  I'm not familiar with the aesthetics of Warwick's work so I cannot critique it fairly.  Laurie Anderson is a highly skilled visual and electronic artist and Stelarc has an elegance in his graphic designs as well as a fine sense of how the human/machine can interface for communications and interplay.

I'm not very familiar with Warwick, but there is an interview with him located at http://www.laspirale.org/pages/afficheSommaire.php3?type=interview
In this interview he is called a transhuman. However, he does not profess to be transhumansit.  I agree with Warwick that Bill Joy could possible have an implant himself in a couple of years. The difference here is that Warwick does it for sensationalism, but Joy would more likely do it because his doctor suggests it.

I see Warwick in the same artistic category as Orlan or the person who has plastic surgery to look like Aphrodite. The waters run shallow.  The only disclaimer here is that I may not be a totally fair critic because I am an artist and I think these examples weaken the value of art.  Alternatively, if Warwick, for example, wants to be a cyborg he may be confusing the transhuman ideal with the cyborg.  Artists who put a lot of technological gadgets on their bodies may enjoy the ride, but may not be in sync with the concepts of transhumanist thinking. I have written about this issue in the Transhumanist Arts FAQ.

Yes, I think that Extro-5 will peek into many social issues running ramped in human/machine crossing points.

She's Ann Robinson, British TV personality (Nice comparison BTW!).  It's a 
very popular gameshow in the U.K., where Robinson displays her now 
trademark cutting (and at times bordering on cruel:) criticism of 
contestants who are doing badly.  It's now gone stateside, where it's doing 
a storm in the ratings apparently.

The basic premise is that a group of people answer rounds of questions, at 
the end of each round voting out of the game the individual who did 
worst.  Then the "Weakest Link" line comes in, and they are expelled from 
the game.

They were going to try find an American presenter, but there were none with 
her, ahem, character disposition:)

She sure is.  She did a consumer affairs programme for several years called

A good point. I agree that Warwick is indeed doing a kind of
performance art. Engineering sometimes makes wonderful performance
art, and robotics is of course especially amenable to it. 

But I think Stelarc has created something far more integrated than
Warwick. Stelarc's art is based in a postmodern
deconstruction/reconstruction of the body and its role, which is quite
consistent. The robotic and cyborg performances of Warwick does not
fit well with his views on the future of human and robot interactions
- one one hand slapstik and gadgetry, on the other hand the
terminator. It doesn't fit together artistically in my opinion. 


[ The art critic as a science reviewer: "While the logos and technique
of the paper are impeccable, there is a lack of pathos that weakens
the introduction and discussion section. The figures complement the
text, but the strength of the microphotographs overwhelm the quiet
cadence of the prose; especially the intense colors of the
immunological stainings would be more at home in a assertive rather
than exploratory paper." :-) ]

That's implicit in the entire "What if I spent the money on healthcare
instead?" thread.  Otherwise, even if you spend the money on healthcare,
you *will* die eventually and you *will* need cryonics to have any hope of
surviving at all.  It's the Singularity that means that you only have a
10% chance of dying or whatever; otherwise, of course, you have a 100%
chance of dying.  If your life really matters to you, then even this close
to the Singularity, signing up for cryonics is simply a commonsense
precaution.

You make a huge assumption with the consistency assumption, that a prior is=20

This assumption is a generalized equivalent to my condition that prior=20

Another way of stating it is that you effectively assume everybody has the=20

Technically, you're right that we agree; we've both shown a strong=20

I think that even this conversation is moot... Why would any
body try to argue against a foolish outlook? You just point
at them and go "FOOLISH"... that should be sufficient... Yes?

A person either believes in insurance or they don't. We call
the people who don't victims and if they're really lucky victims
we call them survivors.

My belief has nothing to do with it. The only alterntive that
insures I even have a whisper of a chance of surviving a car
crash, or coronary, or having the International Space Station
fall on me, is to get my vital bits into cryosuspension, as quickly
as possible after the signs of life leave the meat... Everything
other option has me recycling carbon, nitrogen, and working
at my own little personal entropy.

Of course not, that was never the question... it has much more to do

Now you're just making sense... this isn't a sensible conversation, it has
nothing to do with sense... the only sensible choice is to set up some
kind of insurance policy that pays for cryonics if you bite the semi big
one...

Lame arguement...
On the Whoops I missed Singularity side:
   if it's an insurance policy that you can change, you don't
   spend the money till your hinny needs a liquid N2 bath
   anyway... so you only spends it if ya needs it...

On the flip side...
   you assume that money will be something more valuable
   then funny paper with old dead white guys on it after the
   singularity hits... interesting thought... hmmmm.

Christian... didn't anybody ever wave a boy scout at you???
Ever heard of BE PREPARED? or how about MURPHY's
LAW??? One takes meaningful and thoughful precautions
to insure that one's vital contribution to the species remains
intact... your arguement verges on a Darwinian Selection
Factor... think about it.

The search facilities provided by the new Javien host for
the Extropians' list archive resulted today in my making an
extremely startling and amusing discovery.

Before describing it, I must provide some context by
revealing a bit more (not too tedious, I hope) autobiographical
detail than I have heretofore posted on this list.

I moved to New York City at the end of 1978, following a
rather unsuccessful couple of years (almost) at an intentional
community in Virginia called Twin Oaks.  While supporting
myself as a computer operator at a New York bank, I was able
to resume my abandoned college career at New York University.
After taking a computer (assembly language) course with a
grad student there named Clint Goss, who became one of the
founders of a start-up software company, I got a job in
late '81 with that start-up company, called Philon.  A
lot of the folks who worked at Philon in the mid-80's have kept
in touch over the years, including Clint, another student
of his named Mark Meretzky, Mark's best friend Michael Goldfarb,
and a number of other pretty on-the-ball computer types.
Some of the friends of these friends have also been drawn into
the circle.

Last summer (July 15), I was invited to Mark's 45th birthday
party at the Greenwich Village apartment of another ex-Philon,
Benny Pollak.  Also in attendance were Mark's friends Liz and
Victor Duchovni, with whom I have since become friends myself,
and who have invited me to dinner on many occasions (I've mentioned
Liz before -- she's the mathematician with the four- and six-year-old
sons, and Victor is a computer security expert at J. P. Morgan).

O.K., that was the historical background.  Here's the proximate
background.

Liz has a moderate taste for SF.  She was already familiar with authors
William Gibson and Bruce Sterling (I gave her a set of CDs of Gibson
reading _Neuromancer_, which she liked a lot), but I've introduced her
more recently to Greg Egan.  She loved _Permutation City_, and
has tackled _Diaspora_.  Well, naturally, that led to my mentioning
the Extropians' mailing list, which she has occasionally dipped into.

One evening at dinner, Liz said to me, "Victor and I know this
guy who intends, with perfect seriousness and as matter-of-factly
as you'd talk about buying a car, to live forever.  He sounds
like the kind of person who'd be interested in this Extropian
stuff.  I wonder if you've ever seen anything by him on the
list?  His name is Perry Metzger."  I answered that he certainly
wasn't one of the more recent regulars, but that I'd poke around
in the archive and see.  Listing by author in the old lucifer.com
archive, I did manage to come up with one 1997 item,
http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians.1Q97/4197.html ,
which seemed a bit in-your-face for somebody who wasn't even a
list regular (it's a harrumph along the lines of "if you're
all so smart, how come you aren't all rich?"), but which I forwarded
to Liz for her amusement.  She replied "Yep, that's Perry, all right.
Some people think he's a bit full of himself, but I like him because
he seems to me like a pussycat trying to convince everybody
he's a lion."  She said she was going to invite him to her
Passover seder, and that I might get to meet him there.  I was
rather looking forward to meeting this character.

I can just imagine what the conversation at the dinner table
would have been like if he had actually managed to make it
to Liz's seder:

PERRY:  Well, you may not know this, but as a matter of fact
I actually **founded** the Extropians' mailing list.

ME (out loud):  Oh really?

ME (to myself):  Uh huh.  Sure, pal, tell me about it.  Good grief,
Liz warned me this guy might come off as a bit arrogant, but she
didn't tell me he was an out-and-out nut case!

No doubt, Perry would have had some cause for irritation
as I sat there smirking and glancing at Liz, who would have
been listening with a half-puzzled smile on her face and
a twinkle in her eye as if to say "I don't know what's going
to happen next, but this is turning out more interesting
than I anticipated."  It might almost have been a scene
worthy of a Woody Allen movie.  Unfortunately (or maybe just
as well!), Perry did **not** make it that evening.

So what did I discover today as I experimented with the search
facilities at the Javien archive?  Well, as folks with more
of a clue about the history of the Extropians' than I had
will already know, I found evidence that one Perry E. Metzger
did indeed found this mailing list, for example:
http://forum.javien.com/forum/XMLmessage.php?id=id::ORYIIztK-DwFY-BlgR-OkJb-TExsdUVWYWps
and
http://forum.javien.com/forum/XMLmessage.php?id=id::KnA8TzVH-ADAv-YmxV-PiZq-aT1ATDUHd2ww

Well now I'll **have** to meet him, of course -- if nothing else,
so I can plague him to add his own personal list archives
from the earliest days when he was active (which he surely must
have kept, just out of sheer ego, if he's the founder) to the
Javien archive [*].  Liz has already promised to invite him to dinner
sometime soon.

Not too long ago, I felt like a total outsider in this company,
even after having been posting for some months.  Now, I feel
a bit like the long-lost step-cousin of the Crown Princess
Anastasia.  ;->

Jim F.

[*] Hmm...  I've just heard something that may indicate that early
participants of this list were guaranteed anonymity outside the
list membership, and that it would be a violation of an implied
contract for the archives to extend any further back than 1996.
If so, that's a shame.

The article in Wired news from a couple of weeks ago that announced
the restoration by Google of the Deja Usenet archives back to 1995
( http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,43392,00.html )
seems to be playing up the embarrassment factor for folks who were
hoping some of those old posts were gone forever.  I suppose it's
only a matter of time before somebody gets the bright idea to sue
Google for damages resulting from the unexpected return of an
indiscreet Usenet post.

For my part, I'd be thrilled to death if Usenet could be pushed
back even further, to the 80's, even though I myself posted some
rather indiscreet articles to soc.motss back in '88 and '89 -- you
only expected them to last a few days before being displaced by
incoming news feed, in those days.

Whatever happened to the motto "information wants to be free"?
Ah, well.

Yes, Perry started the Extropians list. See 1991 in the ExI history:

http://www.extropy.org/success.htm

Once an incredibly prolific poster, Perry eventually went cold turkey and, 
as far as I can tell, went on to make plenty of money. It's been a while 
since Perry has dropped by. Perhaps we can snare him in the Extro-5 tractor 
beam.

Cheers,

Max

Ralph, if you wake up after being frozen, it's because SIAI succeeded
bigtime.  *If* you want a body post-Singularity, you can pick one out
after you wake up, and I see no good reason why you would want one with
modern DNA.

Even if this isn't so, I don't see why anyone would want to be reanimated
by a human team, especially if you could wait a couple of years and have a
really high-res reanimation done by a superintelligence.  (Remember, you
can only be reanimated once - any information lost is lost forever.)  The
only thing I could see changing this logic would be if vitrification
protocols and the legal environment advance to the point where you could
freeze and revive a *healthy* human without any damage at all - in which
case cryo really would be a temporal transport method, in fee simple, for
cancer patients and such, or even people who are too far behind on the
organ transplant lists.  But the damage done by present-day freezing is
such that you really want an SI doing the information readout.

Wellll.... Why `heartwarming', hmmm? Why `convenient'? Could it be because
we have evolved to chunk our abilities in this way, and to recognize them
in action, just as we have with colors out of a continuous spectrum? Or
perhaps, better, as we have with bipedal ambulation compared with, say,
brachiation, sliding forward on the buttocks, rolling along the ground,
flapping the elbows and hopping, etc, as preferred methods of human
locomotion?

I think just for the moment I'll go along with Howard Gardner and Jerome
Bruner and those guys who've been working in this area for the last few
decades, and take Eliezer's guess as an interesting `sidewalk supervisor'
opinion.

You're not wrong.  Intelligence *is* compartmentalized.  But not into
convenient, heartwarming seven-item lists.

Assuming, SIAI succeeds, and the AI is not Friendly?

All hard-edge Singularity scenarios are iffy. The softer the edge,
the higher the probability of survival.

Because I don't trust the superintelligence to be motivated to
reanimate extinct primitive lifeforms. Of course it could do it,
but why *should* do it?

I don't see how that follows. Given good training sets a dumb neuronal
filter could remove the ultrastructural artifacts. The whole point of
freeze/slice/scan is that it doesn't require an out-of-this world
technology.

On 5/4/01 I posted the following problems.  See below
for answers.

1.  There are two bags, each with 10 coins.  Half the coins
    in the first bag are counterfeit, and all the coins in
    the second bag are counterfeit.  Someone hands you a bag,
    and you happen to pull a coin out of that bag and examine
    it.  If you see that the coin is counterfeit, what is the
    probability that you were handed the counterfeit bag?

2.  A little girl's father discovers that his wife is
    pregnant again (but they don't know the sex of the
    unborn child).  The man decides to visit a mathematician.
    "I have two children, sir", he says, "and one of them
    is a girl.  What is the probability that the other is
    a boy?"  What did the mathematician tell him?

3.  You're on the Monte Hall show, and there is a big prize 
    behind one curtain, and junk prizes behind the other two
    curtains.  You pick one of the three at random.  Monte
    then opens one of the other curtains and shows you a
    junk prize, and asks if you still want to keep playing.
    You say, "Yes, but let me switch my choice to the other
    curtain!".  Monte says, "That's weird," but allows the
    switch.  What is the probability of your getting the big
    prize?  (As is widely known, Marilyn Vos Savant humiliated
    some experienced mathematicians with this old problem.)

4.  You wash up on a desert island where it is known that Long
    John Silver has hid a lot of gold in one of three strongly
    built shacks.  You begin dismantling one of the three.  A
    lightning bolt comes out of the overcast sky and strikes
    one of the other shacks, destroying it and revealing that
    the gold wasn't there.  What is the probability that the
    gold will turn up in the shack that you are not working on?

Hint:  one of the answers is 1/2 and the others have the same
answer.

***Answers***   For problems 1, 2, and 3, the answer is 2/3.  For
problem number 4, the answer is 1/2.  Thanks to Amara for an
especially nice explanation of the Monte Hall problem.

Well, I'll go along with J. Goard here.  The advocates of Spearman's "g",
(for general intelligence), have been gathering data for the belief in
a mostly-single intelligence far longer than just the last few decades.
The overwhelming single fact about all the intelligence tests is that
high scores on one **always** predict a high score on the others.  But
this also jibes with one's personal experience: you mostly know, after
just a few minutes conversation, how intelligent someone is (be honest).
Of course there are exceptions, and of course there are variations, but
on the whole this fits very well with the "traditional" view of IQ.

For the same reason that a program does anything, because it's
built that way.  Now I know that you contend that writing such
a program may be vastly more difficult than anyone thinks, but
that's a different question.

You neglected the possibility of read-only.  I hope that my

enough for quite a number of higher fidelity scans to be
made and set running.

I think you mean to say that it is *nearly* equally likely to take
steps in either direction.  There needs to be some small bias to get
something predictable to happen.

A good article on intelligence, factor analysis, g, and the theory of
multiple intelligences is the 1998 Scientific American article available
at http://www.sciam.com/1998/1198intelligence/1198gottfred.html.
It also contains links to Gardner's controversial theory of multiple
intelligences at http://www.harding.edu/~cbr/midemo/mifirst.html.

Some of Gardner's intelligences are unproblematic, such as linguistic,
logical-mathematical, and spatial intelligence, which have long been used
as parts of IQ tests.  When he gets into musical, bodily-kinesthetic,
and naturalistic intelligences (the last defined as "the ability to
understand, relate to, categorize, classify, comprehend, and explain
the things encountered in the world of nature.  People such as farmers,
ranchers, hunters, gardeners, and animal handlers may exhibit developed
naturalistic intelligence.") it gets much more questionable IMO.

Yes, Perry Metzger founded this very list.  He is still active on the local
list for his region and participates in dinner get-togethers.  I know this
because I frequent the various regional Extropian lists wishing I were
closer to *anybody*.

He did not drop out of the list as much as he specialized and went on to
bigger and better things.  Perry was one of the motivating factors in the
early days.  He definitely shaped the early Libertarian view of the list,
and personally performed most of the work.  He maintained the list well, and
managed to experiment with PPL, anarchy, and decentralized control without
resorting to dictatorship.  He also maintained a "no arguing over the
basics" policy which kept the noise level down and diverted recurring
nonsolveable conversations off-list.

This list owes a lot to Perry Metzger.

It seems to be a fact, that money is quite valuable NOW.
I did not discuss about its value after the singularity.
(Anyway, Ray Kurzweil predicts (in the "Age of Spiritual Machines")
serious deflation for this century.)

I am not quite sure which organizations accalerate and which ones 
postpone the singularity...;) 

Even if I were sure, it is highly unprobable that my money would
accelerate the coming of singularity so much that the probability
increase of being alive at the time of the singularity would pay off.

I think it is a reasonable decision the spare that money.
Even if the singularity comes soon, it may be that the eternal life
won't be cheap.

Imagine: you signed up for Cryonics. The singularity is here.
You have signed up for cryonics. And you can't buy eternal life
lacking of money. You must take your bath instead and wait that
somebody revives you as a charity act. Your only solace is that the
technics of cryonics is "nearly" perfect.

If the probability that this backup plan works is neglectible 
in comparison to being alive at the time of singularity, then it
is not worth paying for. That's what my matrix says.

I don't know where your numbers come from. The commonsense of the

Physics would seem to make high-res bulk images without degradation of
structure rather impossible. Of course, if you use destructive (layer by
layer abrasive) cryo AFM, you can record the relevant info. Assuming
you know what it is, of course, or have enough storage, so that you record
stuff you can make a few more passes over, to be catched by better
algorithms.

I had hope there would be something like a Body Shop (so you did not have to

you could select from one you want. Going to the gym I realize that you
would need data sheets on the bodies because some great looking people have
major joint or internal organ problems. There would most likely have to be a
computer program to compute mind/body comparability, you would not want to
wake up in a body and find your mind and the body's dopamine receptors
interactions made you insane. 

There is also the problem of fashion, right now I would most likely want to
have a body and face like Frank Sepe but what happens if the fashion was an
aquatic octopus body when you were reanimated. Talk about be in the out peer

I was making a *normative* argument about rational beliefs, not a descriptive
model of actual beliefs.  Yes, people disagree, and that can't be explained
by assuming people are Bayesians with the same priors.  That has been the
whole point of this discussion.  I argue that not all possible priors are
rational -- rational priors should be obtained from "uberpriors" via
conditioning.  I do *not* assume that everyone has the same uberprior,
actually, but I do describe plausible constraints on such uberpriors that
imply common priors.

A FEW OF MY FAVORITE THINGS:

Maalox and nosedrops and needles for knitting',
Walkers and handrails and new dental fittin's,
Bundles of magazines tied up with string,
These are a few of my favorite things.

Cadillacs, cataracts, hearing aids, glasses,
Polident, Fixodent, false teeth in glasses,
Pacemakers, golf carts and porches with swings,
These are a few of my favorite things.

When the pipes leak, When the bones creak, When the knees go bad,
Then I remember my favorite things and then I don't feel so bad

Hot tea and crumpets, and corn pads for bunions,
No spicy hot food and no food with onions,
Bathrobes and heat pads and hot meals they bring,
These are a few of my favorite things.

Back pains, confused brains, and no fear of sinnin',
Thin bones and fractures and hair that is thinnin'.
And we won't mention our short shrunken frames
When we remember our favorite things.

When the joints ache, when the hips break, When the eyes grow dim,
Then I remember the great life I've had, And then I don't feel so bad.

THEN I REMEMBER THE GREAT LIFE I'VE HAD
AND THEN I DON'T FEEL SOOO BAAAD

technique and style which stems from the earlier genre of Actionists and
resembles much of Vito Acconci's body work but uses different tools. He
automorphs himself, but purely for the art of his work and not his personal
life.  Warwick's mutations are not clearly aligned with any one art genre
but rely on the genre of Performance Art to tie the modifications to his
body with his desire to be recognized as a cyborg.

>Stelarc's art is based in a postmodern
deconstruction/reconstruction of the body and its role, which is quite
consistent.

I'll have to ask Stelarc about this statement, I'm not sure he would agree. 
Postmodern has a unwelcome feeling for us Performance Artists :-)  Stelarc's
work is of Transhumanist Arts period rather than Postmodern period. 
(Although most critics prefer to use period that have already occured.)

("Dissanayake defines postmodernism as, “ . . . a declaration of the end of
all isms and movements, of the impossibility of further theory.” (1995, 199)
“Dennis Fehr . . . describes Postmodernism as a philosophical patchwork that
covers the postindustrial West . . .   [To Fehr] Postmodernism is about
connecting, combining, erasing lines, taking down walls.” (Walkup, 1999) 
Perhaps, postmodern art is the result of, “ . . . a cacophonous pluralism, a
barrage of media-cussed voices with no commitment to change society. [A time
when] Genius in art came to mean nothing but the ability to elicit column
inches and produce striking, flashy artifacts.” (Jeffries, 1998)")

The more appropriate idea about Postmodern Art would be the ability to
produce a body (no pun intended) of art with content rather than being
concerned with its object.  I rather like this and consider Conceptual Art
as a powerful medium.  However, I not accustomed to referring to
Installations or Performance Art as Postmodern.

>The robotic and cyborg performances of Warwick does not fit well with his
views on the future of human and robot interactions - one one hand slapstik
and gadgetry, on the other hand the terminator. It doesn't fit together
artistically in my opinion.<

His concept doesn't "work".  It could be for the reasons you suggest above
but, simply put, a misuse of machinery for shock factor is weak and
transparent. Art lacks value when the artist employs a sensationalized
notion without a paralleling conjecture. Thus, I would not categorize
Warwick’s art as Transhumanist Arts or even transhuman, but his body, with
it's augments are indeed transhuman.

An ultra-intelligent machine is one that understands that human parents don't
earn their children's trust by acting as they *should* but rather by doing
what is best for the children (which smart kids detect), and the best that
parents can do for their children is to provide them the opportunity to reach
their full potential. To explore that potential completely requires us to go
beyond words... a universe an ultra-intelligent machine could outdo good
parents in providing.

Make that "McFlies"

"Nanoscale listening devices based on the Ormia ear are under development at
several industrial and university laboratories..." --Science Daily

If several labs can fly into development of nanoscale listening devices (based
on one "fly-sized" experiment
http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/March01/fly_ear.hrs.html ), it makes me
wonder how many labs are trying to develop full-blown AI.  Developing AI has
at least a thousand times more potential pay-off, so it seems reasonable to
speculate that a thousand times more effort goes in that direction.

It follows that if your life doesn't really matter to you, neither cryonics

Extropians,

The evolution of extropy is severely hampered or enhanced by the quality of
general education. If you're concerned about "education" and how it became, well,
how it became what it is, check out the following websites:

and

Don't blame me if from now on you now wake up in a cold sweat!

I think the problem is that there is no good distinction between a skill
and specialised intelligence. A well learned skill allows the skilled
person to generalise to new situations.

As for naturalistic intelligence, I read a fun paper demonstrating that
general knowledge of and language use of terms related to trees has been
in a steadily decline since the industrial revolution. So if one accepts
naturalististic intelligence, then it has likely decreased.

The so called "Great Books of the Western World" is a 60 volume set

Here's a chance to purchase an instant classic library.

No.  If surviving matters to you primarily as a subgoal of something else,
then the Singularity has relevance if and only if it advances the
"something else", while cryonics matters if and only if the "something
else" is still relevant and advance-able post-Singularity.

Okay, I see the point of dispute.  I strongly doubt that we've evolved to
chunk our abilities a certain way, or indeed to chunk them any way at all,
but that's not the point.  You can obviously come up with a metric for any
variety of "intelligence" you like, from plumbing intelligence to
Broderick-novel-plot-recall-intelligence.  But the true, underlying
components of intelligence - the ones that correspond to hardware - are
neither heartwarming, nor convenient.

> and to recognize them
> in action, just as we have with colors out of a continuous spectrum?

One of the reasons we know that color recognition is evolved is that all
languages follow a certain hierarchy of color distinctions and, within
that hierarchy, they all name the same colors.  The eleven basic color
categories - black, white, red, yellow, green, blue, brown, purple, pink,
orange, and gray - are not all within all languages, but in those
languages where they are present, they always refer to the same color
prototypes; and in those languages that have fewer basic categories, the
basic categories are always some union of the basic terms listed.  When a
language has only two basic color terms, they are "black" and "white", or
rather "cool" (black, blue, green, gray) and "warm" (white, yellow,
orange, red).  When a language has three basic color terms, they are
black, white, red.  When a language has four basic color terms, the fourth
is one of the following: yellow, blue, green.

The actual hierarchy is:

black, white
red
yellow, blue, green
brown
purple, pink, orange, gray

A language that has a word for pink will always have words for brown,
green, and red.

("Basic Color Terms", Brent Berlin and Paul Kay, 1969.  As summarized in
"Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things:  What Categories Reveal about the
Mind" by George Lakoff.)

Demonstrate a similar set of language-level distinctions for intelligence
categories and your name will live forever.

Heh.  Well, that's your decision.  Just bear in mind that where an
academic field has been corrupted by political influences, it's very easy
for people who have been working there for "decades" to be totally,
flagrantly, utterly wrong.  I'd trust an amateur reader of "The Adapted
Mind" over any academic trained in the "soft" social sciences when it
comes to knowing, for example, "whether the brain has domain specificity
or is a general learning machine", because it is known that the standard
social sciences model is blatantly untrue, for political reasons, with
respect to that particular question.

PS:  I also agree that spatial and linguistic intelligence are
unproblematic, although linguistic intelligence might well be separable
into "lexical" (word-memory), "comprehension", and "expression"
components.  All of these are known to be abilities that are supported by
specific and distinct hardware, such that damage to a hardware module
results in selective damage of the ability and nothing else.

Researchers in Washington, D.C., now report that calcium carbonate, 
or calcite, can adsorb an excess of left-handed amino acids onto some 
of its crystal faces and of right-handed amino acids on other faces. 
Robert M. Hazen and Timothy R. Filley of the Carnegie Institution 
of Washington and Glenn A. Goodfriend of George Washington University 
report their results in the May 8 Proceedings of the National Academy 
of Sciences.
"It is very exciting," says Max Bernstein of NASA's Ames Research Center 
and the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute, both in Mountain 
View, Calif. "Such results provide a plausible scenario by which... amino acids
could be separated from their mirror images, potentially solving a vexing problem

Yes, although the bias can in principle be as small as you like, depending
on how long you want it to wait.  I wonder what it would be like if you
were implemented on a computer with no bias?  I guess the question is how
far it would get via random walk before the computer falls apart (sqrt(t)
steps after time t).  But using zero energy has enough advantages that
maybe in some circumstances you would risk it.

"Chunking" is a very strong term, and I'm not sure of its meaning in this
context.

But it would be completely absurd to argue that the human brain does not
have multiple specialized intelligences.  Neuroscience shows rather clearly
that different brain regions are specialized for different types of
functions.  And basic human experience shows that some people who are
super-smart in math are poor in humanities, and vice versa.  And some people
who are very clever at all sorts of intellectual things are much LESS clever
at manipulating social situations.  Etc.

One could make a more plausible argument that the need for multiple
specialized components is not a GENERAL property of any intelligent systems,
but only a PARTICULAR property of the human brain and other systems similar
to it.  I think this is also badly wrong, but at least it's not contradicted
by vast amounts of direct empirical evidence.  It's merely contradicted by
vast amounts of INDIRECT empirical evidence, as well as by common sense.

It's a fact known to anyone who's done practical AI work that a more
specialized approach to a given problem is going to be more efficient than a
more general approach, in almost all cases.  Building a real AI thus
requires a very delicate balance between generality and specialization.  One
needs, in fact a general intelligence mechanism that can also serve as a
sort of "mind OS" on which numerous specialized intelligence mechanisms can
run.  But you've heard this spiel from me before...

Regardless of political influences, it is possible for people who have been
working on something for decades to be totally, flagrantly, utterly wrong.
That is the nature of science and any other intellectual endeavor.

This strikes me as a rather absurd statement.  I grew up around academics
trained in the social sciences and I can assure you that they hold a very
wide variety of views -- much wider, for example, than the set of views
represented on this e-mail list.

In fact this statement of your strikes me as a flagrantly wrong attitude
that is directly attributable to corruption by political influences ;>

I don't like Political Correctness any more than you, but nor do I like glib
stereotyping of social groups with which the stereotyper lacks detailed
experience.

Sorry if I'm being touchy -- my dad is a social scientist, and he actually
isn't the ONLY one out there who's not a complete idiot....  There is  LOT
of idiocy in the social sciences, to be sure -- my dad recently wrote a
paper arguing that about 90% of statistical work ever done in sociology has
been useless.  But there is also a lot of good work and solid thinking, by
people of both liberal and conservative persuasions.

Isn't that a bad thing?  I mean, doesn't holding a "wide variety of views"
mean that at most one of them is right, all the others are wrong, and that
they don't have enough evidence to constrain the space of their theories? 
This isn't actually my argument in this instance, but it deserves pointing
out.

Anyway, I have no way of contradicting the assertion that "many social
scientists are in tune with modern cognitive science, modular neurology,
and evolutionary psychology", or that "academic freedom in the social
sciences is such that most of the smart ones have already abandoned the
Standard Social Sciences Model in favor of the Integrated Causal Model
proposed by Tooby and Cosmides in _The Adapted Mind_."  I simply state
that I have yet to see such a tendency show up in either the popular press
or Eurekalert press releases, which I realize could both be dissociated
from the mainstream academia.

In any case, my statement holds true, not because of conformity among
academics in the soft sciences, but because the central,
taught-in-textbooks dogma of those academic fields is flagrantly wrong. 
Whether academics are tightly or loosely distributed around this prototype
- whether they are all wrong in the same way, or whether only 90% of them
are wrong (in different ways) and the remaining 10% have converged to
normal science - the average amateur reader of the *correct* formulation
found in mid-level evolutionary psychology will still be more reliable
than a randomly chosen academic in a soft science.

Perhaps.  I'm not sure you're entirely free from SSSM contamination
yourself, which may account for some of it.

Counterfactuals are often trickier than they look.  Hofstadter has some
fun with this in GEB, as when you drive through a swarm of bees and think
"good thing they weren't made of cement."

But they get even trickier when you try to imagine who "you" are in a
world with a different history.  What if I were that poor orphan I see
in Bombay?  Who was I in ancient Egypt?

I'm not sure these questions make sense.  I can conceive in principle of
estimating a probability of a given objective world, one in which there
is an individual with particular characteristics (perhaps similar to mine)
as an orphan in Bombay, or living in ancient Egypt.

But I don't think it would make sense to say then that that person was
*me*, in the way we usually think of identity.

In the context of this paper, what does it mean to say that I might
have had different priors, or that your priors and mine might have been
reversed?  To some extent, my priors *are* me.  Or at least, they are
the seed which grows into me.  Change these and the resulting person
would not be me.  Maybe he'd be you, maybe he'd be a new person entirely.

I don't see how an agent can give a meaningful estimate of the probability
that *he* might have been given different priors.  If you swap his
priors with someone else, you don't thereby give him different priors.
Identity goes with the priors, plus the experiences.  If you swap the
priors but don't swap the experiences, you've created two new people.
If you swap priors + experiences, you've simply relabeled the existing
world and haven't really done anything meaningful.

No doubt other people have different philosophical views about the
nature of identity where swapping priors makes sense.  But I think the
paper needs to address this issue head-on rather than talk of swapping
priors as though it were a philsophically unproblematic counterfactual.
(Of course, that's assuming that I didn't miss the point entirely.)

It is really an application of the bias-variance dilemma in learning
theory: a learning system will make mistakes due to inherent biases and
variance due to lack of learning. A system with no bias will have a
large variance and requires a lot of training to become useful, but a
carefully selected bias (= prior knowledge of the domain) can reduce the
variance quite a bit. The price is of course that now the system is
biased towards a certain domain and certain mistakes.

The right balance here is of course another learning problem. In nature
it is defined by the fitness value of an individual and can be learned
by evolution.

I don't understand why that doesn't apply to what you wrote
(in principle, at least), or why you didn't address it.

Your scenario about being unable to afford eternal life
provided by the Singularity---because somehow your cryonics
expenditures impoverished you---just does not hold up.

In the first place, you don't seem to understand the scope
of the transformation that comes with a Singularity.  To
imagine yourself pitifully ensconsed in your wheelchair at
age 90, able to somehow make it into your dewer to get frozen,
yet unable to benefit from the Singularity, is silly.  If you
live through the minutes preceding the Singularity, whatever
issues that you find that you still have to worry about, well,
concerns about money and cryonics won't be among them.

Why are we discussing this issue in general terms?

Let's take a specific example:  Margaret Mead.  How many of the social
scientists of your acquaintance regard her as (A) an important
anthropologist whose work on Samoan customs helped to reveal Western
customs such as sexual jealousy as cultural artefacts rather than inherent
properties of human nature, or (B) one of the all-time rose-tinted
screwups of cultural anthropology, whose work was disproved in toto by
Derek Freeman (who spent six years on the project rather than twelve
weeks)?  If most social scientists you know think of Margaret Mead as a
screwup and believe that sexual jealousy is an evolved human universal,
then either my statement was unfair and stereotypical and I'm attacking a
straw man in an already-won war, or there's a very strong selection bias
in the sample group of "social scientists who Ben Goertzel feels like
talking to".

Okay, sure enough, this article discusses the "Brownian" type 
reversible computer that Eugene and I had never heard of.  And,
of course, as Hal had inferred, it's a perfectly good way to
do reversible computing.  But it's not the only way.  You all
have surely read about the billiard-ball model, which Bennett
also discusses here.  This more familiar model proceeds in a 
linear trajectory, and is exactly what I had in mind when I
first raised this topic, and evidently what Eugene and Robin
had in mind as well when they responded.

So for zero energy, Hal, and a possible resumption of our earlier
discussion, consider that by "reversible computing", most people
are talking about something like the billiard ball model.

Yes, you're saying much the same thing as me.  But to be accurately applied
to real Ai problems, learning theory has to be made to take into account
both space and time complexity, and to be gauged in terms of average-case
performance, etc. etc.  Not that many of the known formal theorems actually
apply under these realistic assumptions, but the underlying concepts still
pertain.

There is not much hard evidence in social sciences, so, yes, the evidence
does not constrain the theory space nearly as much as in most physical
sciences.

I actually don't know what dogma you're referring to.  What is the central
dogma of all social sciences?  I have studied them extensively and I somehow
don't know....  What standard textbooks are you referring to, in particular?

The data in social sciences is sufficiently scanty that there is a lot of
room for multiple interpretations, and hence lots of room for personal or
political bias to affect one's choice of interpretation

Sure.  But being unable to afford the eternal life afforded by

I don't actually know ANY social scientists who believe Margaret Mead's work
on Samoan sexual customs was accurate.  And I know a LOT of social
scientists.  Even radical feminist commies who worship Margarat Mead now
accept that this work was largely wrong.

Most social scientists don't 100% accept Derek Freeman's portrayal of Samoan
sexual life either -- although it's generally accepted as closer to the
truth than Margaret Mead's original account.

Many social scientists believe Mead was an important anthropologist even
though some of her work was inaccurate.

In contemporary anthropology courses, the "classic" anthropologists like
Mead, Colin Turnbull ("The Forest People") and so forth are generally looked
down upon as having been pre-scientific, and given short shrift.  They come
up in the intro course but appear nowhere in advanced coursework.

So I really do believe that, in this particular example at least, you're
attacking a straw man.

Similarly, in modern psych courses, Freud and Jung are mentioned in Intro to
Psych and in Theory of Personality or a couple other courses, but they
rarely show up in advanced work -- it's all about experimental design, data
analysis, and so forth.  I taught some Jung in an advanced psych course once
and the students were flabbergasted that I had the guts to bring up such
unscientific stuff in a senior-year course (I just introduced his theory as
a metaphor for some dynamical systems theory based data analysis we were
doing).

There certainly IS a lot of narrow-mindedness and foolish dogma in the
social sciences, I wouldn't deny that.  But it's not nearly as simplistic as
you're implying.  These are smart, well-informed people making much subtler
mistakes than you seem to realize.

A very common mistake made in sociology nowadays, for example, is applying
statistical methods when there are too few data points for them to be
meaningful....  And somehow the outcome of the half-bogus statistical
analysis tends to reflect the political views of the scientist involved.
For instance, conservatives do half-bogus statistics to prove that gun
control increases violence.  Then liberals do half-bogus statistics to prove
the opposite.  Ultimately, a lot of qualitative analysis is needed to guide
the use of fancy statistics.  But a lot of contemporary social scientists
don't want to realize this, because qualitative analysis has a bad name
because of work like Mead's in the past.  Yet, what recent experience proves
is that fancy statistical work is not devoid of bias either, rather it's
strongly guided by it, in complex & subtle ways.

To me, your view of social scientists is similar to the view I used to have
that "rich people are greedy, selfish bastards."  Well, now I know a lot of
rich people, though I'm far from rich myself.  Some of them are greedy,
selfish bastards.  A lot of them aren't.  And when the rich people I know DO
make what I view as selfish moral errors, biased by their wealth, they don't
do so nearly as crassly or stupidly as I had naively thought before.

I can't remember if I read about this before or
after Derek Freeman's scandalous book about Mead's
sojourn in Samoa, but I saw somewhere (I don't remember
where) a claim that Mead had reacted in the 50's to
the first Kinsey report by saying that Kinsey's
research ought to have been suppressed, beccause it
was a threat to the social fabric.  If it's true,
it's something I could never forgive her for, entirely
apart from the doubts surrounding _Coming of Age in Samoa_.

Unfortunately, Margaret Mead is a bad choice for an example. Since much of my
academic background is in anthropology, I can say with a fair amount of
certainty that her theories have become increasingly less credible over the
last ten or fifteen years, and some anthropologists have tossed her out
completely (except for her place in a historical context). As for your
multiple choice setup, neither answer would be completely accurate, and I
don't think too many serious social scientists would call Mead a screwup
because later generations have replaced her theories with ones that work
better. This isn't how science works. Whether she turns out to be right or
not, her significance is based on her contributions to an ongoing body of
work.

Okay.  I accept this result.  I still maintain that almost all the social
research that shows up on Eurekalert appears to be politically correct
crap, but I suppose it's barely possible that the soft sciences aren't
complete intellectual wastelands and that some of its members are slowly
straggling into the light of the twenty-first century.  If you want any
more than that out of me, you'll have to actually show me a social
scientist doing something right <grin>.

Oh by the way, Eliezer, if you enjoy reading exposes about the
politics of science, you should check out _Defenders of the Truth:

Such an answer (if supplied by a social scientist) is one that I would
rate as indicating a continuing problem.  Margaret Mead did not make a
small improvement that was later replaced by a large improvement.  She
made a horrendous mistake and screwed up the entire field of anthropology
for decades.  The only comparable error I can bring to mind is Minsky and
Papert killing off the entire field of neural networks, and hers was
vastly worse.

You know, I could almost swear I've visited this page before, or
an earlier incarnation of it, perhaps a couple of years ago when I was
first scoping out the Extropians' -- but if so I had clearly forgotten
all about it.  I also now seem to recall feeling a tingle of recognition
when Liz first mentioned Perry's name, as if it **should**
have meant something to me.

On the other hand, I've been having feelings of deja vu
so often in recent years that I'm almost wondering if
it isn't a sign of some sort of incipient dementia ;-> .
In fact, sometimes when I post a message to the list,
I get the nagging sensation that I might already have said
the same thing ;->  ;-> .  I fear, one of these days,
that I may go into a recursive deja vu loop, and blow
my stack.

There are indeed conceptual difficulties with counterfactuals, and with
identity.  But counterfactuals are ubiquitous in language and science.  So
I'm not sure I should discuss it unless they are more difficult than usual
in my context.

Folks on this list should be familiar with a wide range of identity issues,
such as for example whether an upload copy of you is you.  I think we're
used to thinking of this as a matter of choice, and of definition, rather
than of reality.  Each of us gets to decide what variations on us are close
enough to still be "us."  Even if it isn't "you" you should still be able
to make sense of the counterfactual - just call it the "you-substitute."

It is hard to make much sense of most physical laws without counterfactuals.
They tend to say what would happen if you did things you usually don't do.
And prior probabilities themselves don't make sense without counterfactuals.
So I don't consider it a great leap to consider counterfactuals about which
prior you have.  And I don't see how you can talk about the causal processes
that produced your priors without counterfactuals.  Perhaps Nick Bostrom,
who is better trained than I in philosphy, could offer his opinion on this
topic.

Especially if Rosenblatt's death a few years later was actually
a suicide, as has been rumored.  These sorts of affairs also
have very human consequences.  They may be inconsequential eddies
on the fringe of the memetic envelope, but on an individual scale,
they can destroy lives and careers.

I think that I understand what you are saying.  You're saying
that some non-cryonic life extension capabilities that might
be available pre-Singularity might be pricey.

Yes, that's true.  I hope that they also, like Cryonics, cost
just a few dollars a day.  My mother is on social security in
the U.S.  She collects more than 20 dollars per day.  I dare
say that in the U.S. and quite a number of countries, people
won't have a problem funding both cryonics and the life
extension capabilities that I think you are referring to.

We must not forget the point that Ann Marie Tobias made in 
this thread a while ago, namely, that most of the resources
targeted for cryonic suspension---i.e., life insurance 
premiums---are eventually convertable into resources that
could be used for other eventualities.

Your remark gains its greatest saliency when we consider that
the cost of certain life extension techniques might be dear.
This will provide difficult tradeoffs in more than just the
one way that you bring up.

Eurekalert, as I understand it, presents research for which the researchers
have released formal press releases.
Naturally, in the social science domain, this is going to tend to be biased
toward research with political content or implications.  It's by no means a
fair sample of social science research.  New theorems discovered in
mathematical psychology don't tend to merit press releases, for example.

I do think that social science has a far higher ratio of crap than hard
science.  But I'm not sure this is due to political biases, I think it's due
to the fact that the data constrains the theories so much less.

> If you want any

Some EXTREMELY USEFUL social science research has been done on the topic of
welfare reform, recently.  See my father's papers on the topic, and
references given therein:

http://crab.rutgers.edu/~goertzel/welfarepage.htm

The following page contains links to socioeconomic analyses of the recent
changes in Brazilian economic policy, effected by President Cardoso, which
have been rather successful [Cardoso is a sociologist and attributes his
successes in government in part to his understanding of various aspects of
sociological and economic theory]:

http://crab.rutgers.edu/~goertzel/fhc.htm

On a less pragmatic and more theoretical level, one fairly interesting
subfield of social science is the study of "social networks."  This subfield
uses some nice statistics and graph theory, and relates to complex system
science in various ways.  A bunch of links to resources in this area is
given in:

http://www.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/netgroup.htm

I think this area of research has a lot of potential, but remains moderately
boring due to its static rather than dynamical focus.

This is just a random sampling based on my own knowledge and interests.
There is a lot more out there, believe me.

In terms of classic anthropology, try reading Colin Turnbull's original
books on the Mbuti pygmies.  There were some errors there, but also a lot of
deep observations, regarding such things as the different views of time that
Stone Age people tend to have, as opposed to industrially or
post-industrially acculturated people.  I find this stuff quite fascinating,
more so than Margaret Mead's work by far.

I won't bother to link to all the high-quality research that exists in
cognitive, perceptual and social psychology.

The frustrating thing about social science, to me, isn't that there's no
high-quality work.  There is lots of it.  It's that the high-quality work
that's there very rarely addresses the core issues one would like to
understand about people or societies or economies.

This is similar to the situation in AI.  It's not that the papers in the
journal Artificial Intelligence are *bad*.  Most of them are actually quite
interesting, in themselves.  They just don't tell you much about how to make
thinking machines!!

Here is another data point.  What I know about the controversy
comes from the pages of "The Skeptical Inquirer", the CSICOP.
I had thought, from the remarks there, that more anthropologists
support Margaret Mead's than Derek Freeman, and that a majority
thought Freeman to merely have an axe to grind.

(I hope that you are right.)

Folks,

	I'm still considered a member of the LDS church, and most of
my friends and family are also Mormon.  Evidently many of my friends
and family think the LDS church is against Cryonics, and hence they,
are hostile to the idea.  Here is a draft of a letter I intend on
sending to my current LDS bishop, in an effort to find out what, if
any, support, or lack there of, I might expect from the LDS church.

	Has anyone else ever attempted something like this?  I'd be
interrested in hearing any feedback anyone might have, on my intention
of asking this of my LDS bishop.

	Thanks,

		Brent Allsop


==================================================================


Dear Bishop <name removed>,

	I've got a question for you.  As I believe you know, I'm in
the process of signing up for cryonic preservation.  From the
extropian point of view, it's unfortunate that the laws of the land
are not set up a little more fairly for cryonic "patients", which some
people consider mere "corpses".  Because of this, legal threats from
family, state, or even religious organizations and their members,
especially if they are family members, can be a significant threat to
the extropian community that desires to be cryonically preserved.

	Compounding the problem, when the patient most needs it, when
the time comes, he is unable to stand up for, or even communicate in
person, his own desires.  Hence in anticipation of such we must make
extra effort to anticipate all possible eventualities, and try to plan
for them in advance, so that there is the minimal possible threat to
our possible survival unto the age when there is no more death and
people live forever.

	Also, as you know, most of my family and friends are LDS.  It
seems to be a popular belief in the LDS church that "Once the prophet
has spoken, the thinking has been done."  Many members seem to value
the teachings of the church over their own thinking.  So, it is my
feeling that it is important to me to try to find out, before it is to
late, the church's position on members seeking to be cryonically
preserved, and any possible effect such might have on my family,
friends or even the voting people in a state which I might be residing
when I die.

	In my belief, there should be no conflict whatsoever between
making every medical effort possible to live as long as possible.
But, evidently many LDS, including some in my family, believe the
church's position is to choose death, and to be against anything that
might eventually give eternal life.  Because of many people's self
perceived idea that the church is against this, they seem to be very
hostile to the idea of my seeking after this.  To the point that I
fear for my life because of the actions, or lack of actions that any
of these people could take when the time comes.

	Alcor is the name of the organization that I have selected to
provide this service for me.  On Alcor's "Application For Membership"
form there are section where supporting people and organizations can
be entered.  There is a "Contacts" section where close friends that
may be able to help in time of need can be listed.  For example, Alcor
may require simple assistance for something like having someone go
around to pick up large quantities of ice to help with the procedure.
There is also a "Suspension Endangerment Contacts" section.  Here is
the description from the form for that section:

) Suspension Endangerment Contacts.
) In case of large financial expenditures being required to fight
) legal attacks on your suspension, general financial or legal
) set-backs which threaten the suspensions of all Members in
) suspension, or the dissolution of Alcor it may be necessary for
) Alcor to convert the suspension from Whole Body Suspension to
) Neurosuspension or to terminate the suspension.  As a safety
) measure, you may designate certain individuals(s), organization(s),
) and/or institution(s) as Suspension Endangerment Contacts.  Such a
) designation does not create a contract with the Suspension
) Endangerment Contacts on the part of either the Member or Alcor.
) Such Contacts might include individuals or organization you have
) left funds with for the specific purpose of providing a back-up fund
) for your cryonic suspension.

	What I am asking is: would it be appropriate for me to ask the
LDS church to be one of these Contacting organizations?  To me, such
would be an indicator as to whether the church is hostile to people
seeking after eternal life, or would the church be supportive and not
try to interfere with members seeking after such?  I know of no other
way to find out such information, other than by asking if it would be
OK, for me to put the LDS church, and you as my Bishop, or an official
representative of the church, on this form as a "Suspension
Endangerment Contact".

	In addition, could I inform my Home Teachers of my desires,
and can I ask them if it is OK to add them, as official Home Teachers
of the LDS church, to the "Contacts" list on this form, and keep the
form updated with whoever my current Home Teachers, and Bishop are?

	As it says on the form, there is no contract, whatsoever,
committing anyone on such lists to do anything on my or Alcor's behalf
when the time comes.  For me, it would simply be a critically
important explicit show of an indication that, even if you do not
happen to believe in cryonics, that you will not try to take action to
prevent this from occurring.

	It's hard to imagine all possible eventualities that might
become relevant in the future.  But for example, being autopsied is a
big danger to extropians.  In many states, it is the law that under
certain circumstances, a body must be autopsied after death.  Having
the brain autopsied like this, as far as Alcor and extropians are
concerned, is equivalent to murder.  There are legal teams in place to
do all they can to try to prevent such.  Having my bishop testify on
Alcor's behalf in court, as evidence that it is was truly my will to
be preserved, and not be autopsied, could be life saving to me.

	If any kind of court action ensued, for any reason, of which
the above is just one possible example, I feel it is critical that I
no, now, which side of the court people will be on.  Will the church,
and my family members, vote to pass laws which take away the rights of
people with such desires?  If there was a court case, involving me
being preserved, what side would my LDS family members be on?  Would
they be for or against me?

	As you know, I've been a member of the LDS church my entire
life.  Though I don't believe in all the teachings and practices of
the church, I do all I can to support my family in the Church.  I've
been a full tithe payer my entire life, held multiple church jobs most
of my life, I served a mission, primarily because of my
parents... and so on and so forth.  It is my desire to continue this
support of my family, for as long as is required and as long as this
is their choice.  But my question is, is it within the church's
teachings to behave similarly in return?  I know many LDS do not
think to highly of Cryonic Preservation.  But, will they try to make
efforts to frustrate my will?  Or does the church really teach things
like: "Let them worship how where and what they may"?

	I suspect the Church has never considered such, and may not be
interrested in considering, simply on my behalf, giving you (and my
home teachers) the go-ahead to, as official representatives of the LDS
church, to be listed as supporting contacts on my Alcor Application.

	If this is the case, then I would desire to ask you (and my
home teachers) simply as friends to be listed as such.  Would this be
OK with you, or would you prefer to not be listed as such even as a
personal friend?

	As you know, I am also a member of the UU church.  Many UU
members are "green" people.  Some of their beliefs are that the world
would be much better if humans would just go away and stop polluting
nature.  Some of them believe that people seeking after eternal life
would be a bad thing.  Non the less, most of them support people
having their own will.  They will do anything to try to help their
will be fulfilled.  I've talked to my UU minister, Mark Salkin, about
this same issue and have made this same request.  The UU church is all
for having Mark Salkin, as a representative of the UU church, being
listed as a "Suspension Endangerment Contact".  This simple fact gives
me great comfort and peace of mind, for this has indicated to me that
this is one less thing that I must worry about and try to put effort
towards anticipating.

	If it turns out that the LDS church is against seeking after
eternal life via medical research and such means as cryonic
preservation, or that many of it's members believe they should do
things like vote for laws making it very difficult for cryonics
patents to fulfill their will, or scientists to perform such research,
it is my feeling that continuing to support such an organization may
be akin to donating money to a terrorist group that has vowed to take
legal or perhaps even some of it's members to take terrorist actions
against Alcor, it "patients", scientists doing any eternal life
research and so on.  And of course any such support wouldn't be to
rational for a person also paying money to an organization like Alcor
and giving support to the extropian community.

	Anyway, I'm not really sure how to go about all this, nor if
this is the best way to precede.  Perhaps you can provide some advice
as to how best to precede with all this?  I figured I'd at least start
with an e-mail like this.  I hope you can understand how important
this is to me.  I'm very excited over the idea that my UU friends, and
especially my Extropian and Alcor friends are willing to go to such
extreme efforts on my behalf.  Though I would appreciate it and though
I believe such would be precisely one of the purposes of "home
teachers", I'm not really asking the Church, my LDS family and
friends, for anything like this.  All I'm really asking for is that
they give me some kind of indication, now before it is to late, that
they will not stand in the way of my other cherished infinitely loving
friends that are so willing to do so much for me.  Hopefully, when the
time comes, everyone will already know what is going to occur.
Hopefully things will go according to plan and I will be able to cover
the cost of all these efforts now.  I want to do all I can to have
this all set up in advance, so that everyone knows what to expect and
so things can go smoothly, and that if there are any risks or threats,
I might be able to address those now, while I can, before it becomes
to late.

	There are many Extropians that have the faith and hope that a
cure for aging might be discovered and achieved before any of this is
necessary.  They are certainly making dedicated efforts in this
direction, because of this faith.  I hope that you wild think that
such would be a very exciting worthwhile thing to hope for.  But since
an accident could occur at any time, I feel "now is the time to
prepair" and that it is not wise "to procrastinate the day...."


	Sincerely,

Don't trust CSICOP.

I think the evidence overwhelmingly indicates that we live in an unmagical
universe, but I no longer consider CSICOP a valid source of evidence for
that proposition.  Basically, they stepped over the line and co-founder
Dennis Rawlins eventually blew the whistle on them.  The summary page that
I usually refer people to appears to be down, but here's the link anyway:

ftp://ftp.primenet.com/pub/lippard/jjl-on-mars-effect

Try looking for Dennis Rawlins's "sTARBABY" and Philip Klass's "CRYBABY";
having read through both, and Jim Lippard's summary, I think it's pretty
clear that, while neither side is angelic, Rawlins's basic accusations are
unrefuted and that CSICOP is guilty as charged.  The lesson I'd draw is
that you can have a Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims
of the Paranormal, and a Committee for the Skeptical Investigation of
Claims of the Paranormal, but they shouldn't be the same organization.

This is a gross overstatement, and suggests you may be ignorant of the vast
body of anthropological work that has nothing to do with Mead and is not
influenced by her. No one in the field has ever held her up as some sort of
icon or queen bee (or even as anthropology's Einstein), so to argue against
this is pointless. You're entitled to your opinion, of course, but you're
simply wrong.

Elizer, Im not up to speed on the state of the art in

about it in recent years after it seemed so promising
12 yrs ago.  Could you give us a one paragraph

No, this was long before then.  I think there was a paper in 1967 and a
book in 1969, if I recall correctly.  Essentially, Minsky and Papert
proved that a two-layer Perceptron (which was what a neural network was
called back then) couldn't compute the XOR function.  Which killed off the
entire, then-nascent field of neural networks.  Eventually someone noticed
that a three-layer neural network (with a total of five neurons) could
easily compute the XOR function and the entire field came back to life. 
It never lived up to its initial hype but is still thriving today,
especially those efforts that strive for greater biological realism in the
networks.

I am oversimplifying slightly - what really brought the field back was
backpropagation, which is what enabled the training of multilayer networks
- but the fact still remains that Minsky and Papert's eulogy was
incredibly premature and did a lot of damage.  Nothing remotely on the
scale of Margaret Mead, though.

I'm sure there's a lot of anthropological work that has nothing to do with
Mead and is not influenced by her.  Anthropology is one of the primary
sources of empirical data for evolutionary psychology.  (Which is a bit
unnerving, actually; if anthropology has been that screwed up by politics
before, I must consider the possibility that it is presently being screwed
up by the same forces, and that some of the data underlying evolutionary
psychology is false.)

Okay.  I think the statement that "No one in anthropology has ever held up
Margaret Mead as an icon" is simply wrong.  Perhaps nobody holds her up as
an icon today; she was certainly an icon in the past.

Fifteen years ago, I trusted them completely.  I expected that
if and when any extraordinary claim were verified, they'd be
the first to acknowledge it.  Which is silly, of course.

They are engaged in a war.  They see the rising tide of
pseudo-scientific crap as potentially disasterous for our
society, and I agree with them.  They don't focus on
esoteric matters such as "the Mars effect", except when
it can be used to illustrate wrong-headed or fraudulent
pseudo-science.  For those unbiased souls who wish for an
even-handed analysis of, say, astrology, the Skeptical
Inquirer is not the magazine to read.

For what they do, and for what they're good at, I cherish
them still.

About my data point:  they presented both sides of the Freeman-
Mead controversy, mostly in articles by Freeman and counter-
articles by Mead's supporters.  I know their political bias,
and if Ben is right (that not so many anthropologists and
sociologists still follow Mead), then they indeed could be
responsible for the impression that I got.

On the whole, however, they do a pretty good job suppressing
their political bias,  which emerges much more clearly in their
sister publication, "Free Inquiry".

mainly on marine phytoplankton has re-opened the debate on the status of the
Gaia Theory. But James Lovelock, the scientist who first proposed the Gaian
model of the earth as a self-regulating organism, dismisses the notion that a
"thoughtful" review of new evidence, published today, threatens the theory.
"The important fact to keep in mind is that without sulfur gas from organisms
... the earth would probably be less cloud-covered and much warmer than now,"
he told BioMedNet News.

The production of atmospheric sulfur by oceanic plankton is often cited as a
classic example of Gaia in action, notes Rafel Simó, a marine biologist in the
Department of Marine Biology and Oceanography at the Institut de Ciències del
Mar in Barcelona.

Interesting. I suspected quartz to be playing that role. However, life's
chirality can be adequately explained by autoamplification of a rare

Mead's influence within anthropology was immense.  It was Mead
who gave almost limitless credibility to Franz Boas' whole 
program of repudiating every 19th century belief about society
and anthropology that he could.  For all the evils of 19th
century views, Boas and Mead went way too in the other direction,
especially in causing entire abandonment of the very idea that
there is a "human nature".  Only in the last two decades of the
20th century were these baleful influences finally countered
successfully.

But the wreckage within anthropology caused by Boas and Mead
pails in comparison to the untoward influence they exerted on
greater western civilization.  Almost every kind of socialism,
and every government program designed (with the best of intentions,
of course) to improve the lives of people, got support from what
was being proclaimed within the social sciences at the time,
which in turn rested to a great degree on the supposed
"scientific" results obtained by Margaret Mead.

Would you please give some examples from "the vast body of 
anthropological work... not influenced by her"?   (Thanks!)

Looks like the war rages on, Ben.  There still seems to be a fairly large
disparity between the group that thinks that Mead was at most a minor
nuisance, or perhaps a good researcher who moved the social sciences in
the right direction despite her minor foibles, and the group that thinks
that Mead managed to do almost as much damage as Marx.

I'd like to just say, for the record, that a lot of ideas - my passionate
denouncements to be specific - would pass as normal in the hardcore
ev-psych community.  Likewise, my ideas on altruism would pass for mundane
among most Eastern philosophies.  But remember this:  I USE A DVORAK
KEYBOARD.  My strange allegiances are not random, though I've accumulated
enough of them that at least some of my opinions will be out of place in
any one community.  I am more than an iconoclast:  I am the Iconoclast of
the Better Way.

Yes. the book _Perceptrons_ was published in 1969 and really put a damper on 
the hype. However, Minsky and Papert did show that three-layer networks could 
do XOR in the book, it was just that they were pessimistic about finding a 
training rule for such networks.  

(Why care for XOR? Because it demonstrated that there were simple operations 
the networks could not perform; the book gives several other examples of more 
behaviorally relevant things like parity and pattern recognition simple 
perceptrons cannot do).

Actually, I think it did a good thing. It made the field more cautious and 
less hyped. The book is good science and hence far from the claims of Mead. 
It was the rest of the field that should be blamed: in the face of adversity 
it just caved in, and did not meet the challenge posed by Minsky in finding a 
multilayer training algorithm.

When I was talking about mentoring, I was not talking about an emotional act,
but about a rational and purposeful act of preservation and transmittal of
knowledge. The point is not in spreading memes, but in teaching how to think
well, and listing what knowledge is available. Knowledge and information are far
more fluid than DNA, they can, are, and should be re-engineered and improved by
each new generation. Dogmas are rigid, and need heavy infrastructure to survive,
as institutionalized religions demonstrate - what a waste.

Eugene mentions basic unquestionable motivations, not rooted in reason. Exactly:
people evolve, and the motivations that ensure superior reproductive fitness
proliferate in the population. Wanting to survive, and wanting to reproduce are
examples of two perhaps most important desires. Would you now stand by these
evolved patchy selfish heuristics, and forget about reason?

The fundamental concepts are life and scarcity. Scarcity implies competition,
competition implies adaptation. Scarcity is an essence of the universe (as far
as we know), while the odds of the long-term surival of life is what our
fundamental rational goal could be. It's far-fetched and notional, but it still
implies some concepts such as creation of better forms of life, continuous
improvement, expansion, etc.

Best regards,
                Aleks

Hum. I admit I'm rather ignorant about this particular field,
yet that your assertion raised my interest. Do you have pointers
to documents about what happened? By Minsky, I only read
"The society of mind", which I thought was a challenging vision
of how neural networks could work, in an abstract way.

Rational and purposeful evaluation within the rational selfishness
framework is by definition limited to the life time of the agent. Of
course your DNA wants to invest into vehicles continuating said DNA, and
that's perfectly allright from DNA's point of view. But it's hardly
rational from my purely selfish individual monkey's point of view. Screw
DNA. I owe my DNA nothing.

Excuse an old Ferengi, but knowledge and information per se are quite
worthless to me personally, if I can't profit from them. This doesn't mean
they're worthless to other people, of course, and purely rational beings
are about as abundant as unicorns. Or Ferengis.

Apart from a few foundations, which must remain immutable, lest the whole
memetic building collapse into random rubble (or, losing tracking, floats
away in the evening breeze) you'll find very few static dogmas here.

If you stick around, you might notice that we habitually fabricate ground
beef hamburgers from our sacred cows here.

I do not necessarily want to reproduce. For some weird reason, I want to
live forever, though, or at least die trying. (I grant that one tiny voice
to my DNA). You can assume this is an immutable cornerstone. It might
appear random, and wanting, but I stand by it. Life is good, death is bad.
I could imagine worse origins to base my framework of reference upon.

All very nice, but adaptation only means death in the darwinian framework.
If we're not limited to the darwinian framework, death becomes an option,
instead of default.

What's wrong with going Lamarckian, and _becoming_ better forms of life?

Italy's radicals raise clone debate

Radical Party leader Emma Bonino went on a five day hunger strike

May 8, 2001
Web posted at: 6:50 AM EDT (1050 GMT)

ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Minority parties in Italy are seeking to raise issues
largely ignored by mainstream politics in campaigning for this Sunday's
general election.

The Radical Party wants to turn the spotlight on euthanasia, therapeutic
cloning and freedom of scientific research.

But CNN's Alessio Vinci says these are issues that neither of the two main
candidates for prime minister have addressed.

As voting day approaches, Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right House of
Liberties coalition is maintaining a clear lead in opinion polls over
Francesco Rutelli's centre-left Olive Tree Alliance.

The Radical Party, lead by former European Union commissioner Emma Bonino,
has already successfully campaigned to legalise abortion and divorce in
Catholic Italy.

Bonino, in a protest against lack of media access, last week went on a
five-day hunger strike.

She said: "Because these are issues that go through all the coalitions, so
they are very much disturbing.

"Neither Berlusconi nor Rutelli want to be disturbed. so the expulsion from
the media of the radicals is simply instrumental."

To call more attention to the issue of free scientific research, the Radical
party is running Luca Coscioni for parliament. He is a former marathon
runner and university professor who in 1995 developed a severe form of
sclerosis.

Coscioni is campaigning for a change to Italy's laws on stem cell research,
which some scientists believe could speed cures to Parkinson's disease,
Alzheimer's and even some forms of cancer.

Stem cell research is currently allowed -- with restrictions -- in much of
Europe and in the United States, but prohibited in Italy.

The Radicals position has infuriated the Catholic Church. Monsignor Elio
Greccia, said: "(It is) the destruction of human embryos.

"Even if they are used to cure other human individuals, it represents ... a
murder of human individuals, even if at an embryo phase, and it represents a
sort of human cannibalism."

Right wing parties are attempting to focus on illegal immigration and
linking it with rising crime.

The mayor of Altivole in northeastern Italy, Gino Dalese, said: "Six or
seven years ago, before the immigrants arrived, we had no crime. Now our
cars get broken into and our houses get burgled."


Silvi Berlusconi feels the heat on the campaign trail
Rightist national alliance leader Gianfranco Fini has questioned why
immigrants have to be brought in to fill northern Italy's vacancies when
unemployment in the south of the country stands at a high 20 percent.

A United Nations report last year calculated Italy needed to take in nine
million immigrants over the next 25 years to keep its workforce at a viable
level.

Berlusconi's party published its manifesto on Monday, promising tax cuts,
more jobs and stronger economic growth.

The 85-page document included pledges to lighten Italy's tax burden by 70
trillion lire ($32 billion) and create 1.5 million jobs over five years.

Rutelli's party published its election pledges in April, promising broadly
similar goals, including tax cuts, tougher law and order and institutional
reform.

The chief point of the substrate change is that you can test-drive
modifications in the virtual sandbox, before hot-plugging them into
reality. Allow some brief shutdown for maintenance, otherwise you can
patch a live systems. Very difficult to do with monkeys.

Nothing is wrong with recycling, unless you're the object being recycled.
This particular object will only be recycled under much kicking, and
screaming. Not even over my cold, hard body, if safely stashed away in a
dewar.

Optimizations does not necessarly include extreme sanction. The first
patch to apply to the monkey platform is a more plastic outlook when the
age-related artifacts start to kick in.

Also, the world needs a great deal more young people to neutralize static
old people until said patch becomes widely available.

In these times of disposable consumer items, one must ask oneself whether it is
cheaper to fix and patch, or to recycle.  It's a simple question of cost, not a
fundamental philosophical issue. I'm all for Lamarckism, if it is cheaper, and
if it provides the level of invention offered by random ways of Darwinian
optimization.

Death is recycling, and nothing is wrong with recycling. Do not be so fond of
these worthless evolved phobias of death. The focus must be on life, and death
is not the opposite of it, just another aspect of the optimization process.

An interesting approach, good luck with it!

Just a few notes: you mention both cryonics and extropians in the first 
paragraph. Does you bishop understand what you mena with these terms?

You also use the term "eternal life". Wouldn't that be misinterpreted in this 
religious context? Wouldn't "life extension" or "increased lifespan" make 
more sense with less risk of misunderstanding?

The note about the UU church was a nice touch - that introduces a bit of 
eccleastical competition. Overall the apporach of suggesting that the LDS 
could take a good stance seems to work fine, but you might want to re-word 
the section about terrorism - that is bound to cause antagonism towards your 
case.

I don't think that is a good model.  The Brownian motion aspect
of reversible computation is a way to use the latent heat in
material to drive forward a computation.  For example all chemical
reactions are inherently reversible.  You can eliminate adding extra
heat to a reaction by using the latent heat in the environment and the
fact that the probability distribution of the energy of individual molecules
will mean that some of them will have more than the required activation
energy to drive the reaction forward.  However you may have to wait
a long time to get significant numbers of molecules to go through
the transition state.  You still lose energy here because the
product molecules have to give the transition-state energy back
to the environment.

The Fredkin/Toffoli "billiard ball" reversible computation model is
a better analogy.   The real point you have to understand is that
it isn't how you do the computation (you can do the computing for *free*
(e.g. Brownian motion as a driver)) -- its whether or not you erase
bits!  The is the very counterintuitive result of all of the physics
of computation work done by Landauer, Bennett, et al.

So when you do reversible computation you must save all the intermediate
states and then roll them back to their original state after you have
computed your result.  The majority of the heat you produce using this method
is produced in the erased bits of the final result (there are of course
some losses in all the intermediate steps and the trick will be getting these
to the smallest levels possible).

I believe Michael Frank has a paper that determines the size a reversible
computer must be to trump any non-reversible computer (its *very* big).

What isn't clear is whether you are always going to pay a "real time"
penalty by shifting to reversible computation (note that Eric's
rod-logic reversible computers only function ~1 GHz and we will probably
be pushing 10-15GHz in non-reversible architectures before we make
the transition to reversible architectures).  Of course what you
sacrifice in "real time" you get back (several times over) in parallelism.

Now, of course the interesting thing about this is that if you are
always saving the "intermediate" states of your consciousness in this
very long reversible computation and you get the results and do a
roll back it seems in some strange way that you have killed all the
copies...

There is indeed this disparity.  However, neither of the sides in this
dispute believes that her work about sex life in Samoa was correct.

This is what I meant when I said that, even if a lot of social scientists

Quite so, except that I wouldn't lean too heavily on the "countered
successfully" part; after having lived for more than a decade
with somebody who is now a film professor, and who is drenched
in the culture of academic humanities studies, I would point out
that the phrase "human nature" is still fightin' words to a lot
of intellectuals.  Also, would you really care to debate, in person,
the nature of "human nature" with somebody like Stephen Jay Gould?
(pardon me, while I find the nearest closet to hide in).

But apart from whatever scientific influence Mead may have exercised,
she cut quite a figure in the popular media while she was alive
(like Dr. Ruth, but with immensely more gravitas).  She wrote newspaper
articles, and was a formidable presence at speaking engagements,
with her trademark cape and walking stick.  Also a fearsome
opponent in debate, I've heard (where was that closet, now?).

This seems right to me.  Actually, I've always thought that the Tang (or as 
old farts like me were taught to romanize it, "T'ang") represented a real 
high-water mark for Chinese civilization, immediately before the Sung.  
Deeply influenced by a robust and creative influx of Buddhism, the Tang were 
horse-riding, clever, optimistic adventurers. Tang women were the most free 
that China appears to have ever had; many being renowned poets and artists.  
Tang sculpture - especially their wonderful equestrian works - expressed a 
naturalistic yet distinctly Sinitic humanism.

You're right that the Mongol conquest was likely the catalytic event that 
sent China into an introspective and deep conservatism.  However, the seeds 
of Confucian orthodoxy were already there.  It only took the humbling 
experience of conquest by the western barbarians to cause the phase-change of 
ossification that locked China into almost a thousand years of stasis.

Interestingly, a similar phenomenon happened with Islamic culture.  The 
conquest of the Islamic heartland by Ghengis and his progeny also caused a 
premature closure of the Islamic world to new ideas from outside and 
innovation within their own cultural realm.

So in the interests of continuing the ongoing western 
renaissance/enlightenment (or whatever we want to call it) we better keep an 
eye out for anything that might cause such a closure. While Mongolian 
invaders appear unlikely, we might need to look for some culture or group 
achieving hegemony to such an extent that the dynamism of the enlightenment 
(which is still driving us, thankfully, despite postmodern confusion) is 
lost. 

One such possibility would be a resurgence of the romantic idea complex, now 
empowered by connections with strong stasist groups. A green corporate 
technocracy might be very dangerous (sounds a lot like something that might 
appear in the Alpha Centauri computer game :-) if it could develop. The core 
of such a complex would be the idea of scarcity, the world as a zero-sum-game 
and risk aversiveness, perhaps coupled with various essentialist ideas about 
the natural (and possibly traditional or national) as the good. Another, less 
likely possibility would be a confucian capitalist China rising to dominance, 
perhaps subduing the current culture simply by showing an apparently working 
strong non-enlightenment based system.

Our historical mission as extropians (sorry, I just wanted to test how it 
would feel to write that :-) is to make sure such closure scenarios doesn't 
happen. It can be done in several ways: first, we need to understand this 
kind of closure better. We might develop technologies making it harder to 
suppress dissenting or free opinions and ideas. But we should remember that 
even if you can think freely, if your entire culture (including your own 
upbringing) regards it is a worthless pursuit, then it will be hard to get 
any debate or change going. Most likely the best cultural defense is a 
cultural offense (thanks Natasha :-) both demonstrating the practical and 
moral value of change, freedom and new directions, as well as hitting the 
stasist views hard with both subversive alternatives and criticism of their 
core assumptions. 

The nature of Monkey was... irrepressible! :-)

By the way, my own view of Margaret Mead is that she was VERY smart and
intuitive and had a lot of great insights.  However, she also made a lot of
bad mistakes.

Comparing her impact to that of Karl Marx is a bit silly, in my view.

As a social theorist, Marx was much deeper than Mead, and had far MORE
profound insights.  He introduced the notion of class into social discourse,
which is a major contribution much greater than anything Mead contributed.
But, Marx also made a lot of very bad errors, of course.  More so than Mead,
he tried to force the diversity of human affairs into a narrow theoretical
framework (based on Hegel), and it just didn't work, even though it led to
some interesting ideas.

However, unlike Mead, Marx had a huge impact on world affairs, which appears
to have been on balance a rather negative effect (although this is obviously
hard to fully assess, since we don't really know what the most probable
course of world events would have been had "Marxism" never existed).

This is a funny way to look at things. It reminds me of all those companies
that save money by downsizing essential employees, and find out afterwards
that they can't turn a profit for some reason. Or, why not lop off your legs
and get a wheelchair? Surely you'd require less food. Also, one of the arms
has got to be redundant.

More seriously, you have an implicit assumption here that survival of the
species, or survival of intelligent life, or some otherwise defined class,
is our "supergoal" (to borrow some jargon). Many here would argue that this
is fundamentally at odds with extropianism, which has a more individualistic
outlook... we would save ourselves, at the cost of the long term good of the
species perhaps. Although it is not at all clear that this is a required
tradeoff.

Death is death is death. Natural selection is all well and good, it's gotten
us this far. However, it's capricious, and it's cruel. The idea that
intelligent beings would willingly submit themselves to it's tempest, given
the option to not, is ludicrous.

I think the point that you are wanting to make is that natural selection is
more efficient than the alternative, whatever that may be. I don't think
that's necessarily so. The idea of becoming transhuman is that we can shape
ourselves as we see fit, and as is best to meet the challenges of our
environment. We can use many tools to do this, simulated natural selection
amongst them. Plain vanilla natural selection (ie: kill lots of intelligent
beings, repeat) is an extremely slow way to improve our fitness in the
universe. It would be ludicrous to suppose, for example, that you could put
a population of practically immortal transhumans next to a population of
naturally evolving humans, and expect the "natural" humans to compete.

Evolution is fine, fabulous. Natural selection is clumsy, slow, tyranical,
and incredibly inefficient. Take it down from the pedestal.

Living in Northern California, I really appreciate this news. (Only the True
Death is worse than losing power while on the Other Plane.)
Peter Fairley writes, "These "micropower generators" aren't just about
emergency backup, either. They can provide higher quality power 24/7 than you
can buy from your local utility. Plug into one of these systems and you'll
avoid the computer-crashing voltage spikes and sags that mar the electricity
coming out of a garden-variety wall socket. And micropower means you can
forsake the grid when power prices surge, or even make an extra buck by
exporting power to your neighbors. Spread enough micropower throughout the
grid, and the grid itself will begin to learn tricks that could make
regionwide power outages an unpleasant memory."

That's the (potentially) good news. The (same old) bad news is that although
we may like the idea of "Power To The People" the DemocRATs don't.
Representative Richard A. Gephart and his socialist pals want to cap energy
prices, thereby decreasing or removing incentive to develop alternative
sources of electricity. Thankfully, socialists are in the minority on this
issue. If people can achieve energy self-sufficiency, they can jettison an
entire layer of tax subsidized bureaucRAT control. No wonder they sound
worried.

Exactly. I would say we owe no allegiance to any abstraction, be it 
'humanity', 'Homo sapiens', 'western civilization', <insert suitable national 
state> or even 'progress'. Abstractions are abstractions and should not be 
regarded as goals in themselves. On the other hand, I think most of us think 
that progress is good because it benefits us and enables more valued things 
to come into existence and that it is a good thing if our species/descendant 
species survive since we care about the survival of ourselves, our children 
and our creations.

I'm not certain the choice of nonbeing is always wrong, but it should be a 
choice, not a necessity. I think we are in the long run aided more by the 
love of life than the aversion of death - fear of becoming dead is good for 
making us avoid individual actions and specific threats, but love of life is 
a better guide to the more complex and long-range choices.

Exactly. Whether evolution works well or not depends a lot on the fitness 
landscape - if it is smooth and has a good kind of modularity it works well. 
But we want to move into new fitness landscapes, where evolution would be a 
less suitable guide.

At this point I should probably state that I agree with this assessment of
Mead's work, as did all of the professors I had when I was studying anthro. The
only coursework that featured her (or Boas for that matter) dealt with the
history of the discipline. It's possible I received a skewed perspective,
though. I was in school in the mid-80s at a small college, and it may just be
that the group of professors I had weren't pro- or anti-Mead, but just not
interested in her at all. They had their own particular biases to think about!
;-)

I wish I could, but I can't! I'm not trying to be evasive, but this statement
was more anecdotal than factual. It's been over ten years since I studied
anthro, and I haven't stayed in the field (I actually work as a network
specialist). Like I mentioned above, my perspective could simply reflect the
fact that I studied under professors who weren't particularly interested in
Mead one way or the other, although I've spoken with a couple of friends who
actually are anthropologists and they don't seem to have much to say about her
either (and both went to school in different parts of the US than me). Our
department was pretty evenly divided among hardcore physical
anthropologists/archaeologists and cultural anthropologists. The first group
was very scientific and uninterested in theory, while the second group were
pretty much all theory (but no Mead!).

I wasn't really interested in defending Mead or anthropology in general, but
was just trying to provide a more neutral persepctive. I'm certainly not
interested in becoming involved in a "war." Yawn.

My own ignorance of what has been happening in anthro since I lost interest in
it is reflected in the statement you quote above, although that was always my
impression. I'm beginning to think I should have stayed out of this one!

As for the vehemence directed against Freeman, this is just pitiful. If social
scientists want to practice their discipline as science (and many do), then
they need to be willing to drop their ideological adherence to theories (and
theorists) in the face of factual evidence to the contrary. Of course, some
"hard" scientists have this problem as well. Maybe it's human nature!

If this is true, it may explain why I am not quite willing to say "I am an

Well put! It's long been my contention that where natural selection ends,
artifical selection begins (this is an oversimplification). Intelligent agents
(ourselves, for instance) then become responsible for their own evolution, and
for the evolution of intelligence in general, using whatever tools they are
capable of making. Since we humans have evolved through natural selection to
the point where we can do this, I don't see how it could be anything but
"natural" for us to do so. If we were to continue to rely only on "plain
vanilla natural selection" (as if we could, now), we'd pretty much be headed
for stagnation or extinction.

A similar perspective is presented much more eloquently in the last chapter of
Wyn Wachhorst's The Dream of Spaceflight: Essays on the Near Edge of Infinity,
a book I would highly recommend. His writing is sort of a cross between Carl
Sagan and Loren Eiseley.

What on Earth is that comment supposed to be about?

I would offer the following test for whether you are an Iconoclast of the
Better Way:

1)  Do you vote for the same political party your parents did?  Are you
aware that 95% of the variance in political preferences is accounted for
by reference to parental preferences?  Isn't that pathetic?

2)  Do you have the same religion you were brought up in?  They can't all
be right, can they?  Would that strategy really work if everyone used it?

3)  WHY THE HELL AREN'T YOU USING A DVORAK KEYBOARD?  Did you even TRY
it?  Just once in your life?  Doesn't continuing to use Qwerty indicate
that sheer mental inertia is just about the only driving factor in your
life?

Never trust anyone who doesn't use a Dvorak keyboard, that's my motto. 
Whether you use Dvorak is the simple, clear-cut, acid test of whether you
converge to true thoughts and the best ways or whether you're just
staggering through life with a head full of nonsense.

(And yes, I know that Dvorak exaggerated his original results and that
someone went back and debunked them.  But just because the original claims
were inflated doesn't mean that a home row of "asdf jkl;" is superior to
"aoeu htns".  I've actually used both keyboards, and I'm here to tell you
that Qwerty sucks.  All you need to do is type "the" on a Dvorak keyboard
and you will never, ever go back.)

I'm sorry I don't have time to organize my thoughts better, but let me
note that although the Brownian computer is not the only possible model
of reversible computing, it does work in principle (and some biological
processing of DNA can be modelled rather well as a reversible Brownian
computation).

Hence the puzzles that I posed regarding the nature of conscious
experience on such a computer (which may step backwards as well as
forwards) are still valid and must be addressed.  After all it is possible
that our universe is being simulated on such a computer right now.  Do we
notice?  Maybe you un-read and re-read this message half a dozen times.
What impact would this have on our experience of the universe?

Some people on Wei Dai's everything-list propose that each possible
observer-moment (for all possible conscious observers) makes up a set
and that we randomly experience observer-moments chosen from that set.
Hence we are more likely to experience observer-moments with a larger
measure.  The regularity of the universe is explained by the fact that
the programs to generate lawful observer-moments similar to what we
see are much shorter and hence more probable than programs which would
generate random, chaotic observer-moments.

A consequence of this view is that observer-moments which execute
more often would be more probable.  Hence we are more likely to be
experiencing observer moments that have been executed multiple times.
This might suggest that Brownian implementations would be preferred and
make it more likely than not that we are running on a Brownian computer.

(Wei Dai suggested that another consequence is that observer-moments
running on large computers would have larger measure than those running on
small computers.  This addresses the paradox that running a calculation
multiple times in parallel can be the same as running the calculation
a single time on a larger computer.)

Kevin Warwick has created robots with the brain power of a wasp, and may soon
have built robots which are not only more intelligent than humans in some
ways, but also superior in their practical skills. In this book he argues that
humans may be at the mercy of these life forms, and be treated in the same way
as humans treat animals today. He proposes that there is an urgent need for an
anti-proliferation treaty to prevent these and other even more horrifying
scenarios.

"anti-proliferation treaty"? Hmmm... sounds like the prelude to enforced
"relinquishment."

See, he first has to prove that intelligent robots are possible/feasible, then
the urgency of an anti-proliferation treaty becomes less laughable. (Or his
brain has already been displaced by alien intelligence... Only his surgeon
knows for sure.)

How Did We Get So Smart? Study Sheds Light On Evolution Of The Brain 

Princeton and Bell Labs scientists have devised a simple but powerful method 
for analyzing brain anatomy, providing the first reliable measure of how 
brains of humans and other mammals are related to one another across 
evolution. 
In a paper in the May 10 issue of Nature, the researchers show how comparing 
the relative sizes of 11 brain parts reveals a unique brain structure for 
each species. They calculated the percentage of total brain volume 
contributed by each part and created the term "cerebrotype" to describe the 
resulting 11-number characterization, just as the word "genotype" describes 
the unique DNA sequence for each species. 

The analysis shows that mammals fall into a spectrum of cerebrotypes, with 
humans at one end and insect-eaters, such as hedgehogs, at the other. 

"Intuitively, we know there is something about our brains that is extreme," 
said Sam Wang, an assistant professor of molecular biology and the senior 
author of the paper. "What we have here is a direct measure of one way in 
which our brains are extreme." 

The findings support the "social intelligence" theory of primate evolution, 
which holds that prehuman ancestors were at an advantage for survival if they 
excelled at complex social dynamics such as working in groups and predicting 
the behavior of others. 

Wang and colleagues based their work on a 20-year-old database assembled by 
German researchers who catalogued information about the brains of 300 
animals. Wang's co-authors on the paper are Princeton undergraduate Damon 
Clark and Partha Mitra, a scientist at Lucent Technologies' Bell Labs. 

The researchers were initially interested in a comparative study of brains as 
a means of identifying general principles of brain organization. "We were 
looking for underlying engineering or design principles that might account 
for how evolution led to one brain architecture and not another," said Mitra. 

The research may help scientists understand the selective forces that drove 
the evolution of humans and other animals. Brain areas that showed the most 
growth over the course of evolution are likely to perform functions that 
conferred a selective advantage, said Wang. 

The research confirmed, for example, previous studies showing that one brain 
area, the neocortex, grew rapidly over the course of evolution, expanding 
from 16 percent of the brain in insect-eaters to 80 percent in humans. The 
neocortex is responsible for social interactions, reasoning and other complex 
cognitive tasks, suggesting that the outcome of social interactions has been 
a powerful evolutionary force. Interestingly, even when Wang and colleagues 
eliminated the neocortex from their analysis, humans still had a unique brain 
structure, appearing on the extreme end of the chart. 

In general, the researchers found that animals with the most similar 
cerebrotypes were also the most closely related by evolution. Within groups 
of related species, total brain size varied by as much as 100-fold, but the 
relative sizes of their brain parts -- their cerebrotypes -- remained 
relatively constant. Shifts in cerebrotype occurred with the emergence of new 
groups, such as the evolution of older monkeys into the great apes into 
hominids. 

Another implication of the research is that the genetic mechanisms that 
control the development of the brain's structure may be much simpler than 
previously thought. Wang speculates that many differences between the brains 
of humans and those of the simplest mammals may result from evolutionary 
pressures on just a few genes. 

The reason is that, as evolution progressed, the relative sizes of the 11 
brain areas shifted in only limited ways. If there were hundreds of genes 
independently controlling the sizes of the brain areas, then there would be a 
great diversity of cerebrotypes among mammals -- much more than what the 
researchers found. Instead, they were able to reduce the many variations 
between the 11 brain areas to a relatively simple, two-dimensional diagram. 

Cerebrotype measurements also could lead to a better understanding of how the 
brain works by making it easier to correlate the cognitive abilities of 
various animals with their brain structures. For example, the researchers 
found that one brain region, the cerebellum, had the same approximate 
relative size in most mammals. However, whales, dolphins, and certain bats 
appeared to have larger cerebellums. They later learned that these species 
navigate by a kind of SONAR -- bouncing sound waves off their surroundings. 
The measurements suggest that the cerebellum plays a unique role in the 
complex calculations involved in that function. 

Previous brain-comparison studies had focused on either the whole brain or 
did not compare brain regions directly with each other. Some, for example, 
measured the relationship of overall brain size to body size and compared 
that measure among species of different body weights. That analysis yielded 
inconclusive results, suggesting that human brains were most closely related 
to those of spider monkeys, which are not considered to be close evolutionary 
relatives. However, the researchers' new results follow widely accepted 
evolutionary charts: mammals that are closely related by evolution also 
proved to have similar cerebrotypes. 

"It provides a little insight into who we are and how we got here," said 
Wang.

Here Comes The Holodeck: Virtual Reality + Artificial Intelligence = New 
Training Tool

The use of virtual reality or arcade games to practice hand-eye coordination 
or quick reaction, or even to teach factual information is easy to understand 
and well accepted. But can such techniques also teach sound judgement and 
clear thinking in an emergency? 
New programs developed by the University of Southern California's Information 
Sciences Institute (ISI) and two other cooperating USC institutes are 
designed to do just this by melding advances in artificial intelligence with 
state of the art work in rendering virtual environments in animation and 
sound. 

A "Mission Rehearsal Exercise" developed for the U.S. Army by ISI, the USC 
Institute for Creative Technology (ICT), and the USC Integrated Media Systems 
Center (IMSC) takes soldier-trainees on a virtual reality mission in a 
troubled town in Bosnia. There, they must deal with a situation threatening 
to spin out of control. 

It uses a movie-theater-sized (8 -feet tall, 31-foot wide) curved screen that 
looms around trainees. Combining with the screen images is highly directional 
and lifelike "immersive sound," creating a convincing illusion of being 
present at the scene, rather than observing a show. 

The scene is populated with animated figures that exist only as computer 
programs, but are nevertheless autonomous agents who can interact with human 
trainees in real time. 

An article about the Mission Rehearsal Exercise (MRE) program appeared in the 
documentation for AAAI Spring Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and 
Interactive Entertainment, at Stanford University March 26-28 2001. 
Presentation of another paper, along with partial demonstration of the system 
is scheduled for the Agents 2001 conference in Montreal, Que. May 28-June 1, 
2001. 

The army simulation is an early attempt to reach toward the "holodeck," the 
virtual reality training and recreation facility seen in "Star Trek: The Next 
Generation," according to project leader Jeff Rickel of ISI. 

In one simulation scenario, a lieutenant enters the village to deal with one 
problem -- a weapons inspection team being threatened by an angry crowd -- 
and finds another one as well: an American jeep has accidentally struck and 
injured a local child. 

Should the lieutenant split his forces to deal with both situations? If so, 
how? Meanwhile, a TV camera crew arrives, further complicating the situation. 

The scene of the village uses 3-D computer modeling to create basic shapes 
visible from any angle enhanced by texture mapping. The group used commercial 
software from Boston Dynamics to add animations of people, and an extremely 
sophisticated sound system -- with multiple sound tracks (up to 64 tracks for 
some effects) played through no less than 12 speaker channels. Chris 
Kyriakakis of the IMSC created this system. 

Two kinds of autonomous software agents inhabit this complex and convincing 
environment. Most are basic robotic programs that carry on a limited range of 
pre-scripted, routinized behavior -- milling in the background, standing 
around, etc. 

Three -- the detachment medic and sergeant, and the anxious mother -- are 
more complex. These are software actors who have substantial abilities to 
react to what the trainee does. Their faces change expression, thanks to 
software from the Santa Cruz, CA-based Haptek Corporation. They move, and 
most strikingly, they can respond to speech. 

Scripted characters are relatively easy to create, explains Rickel, "but have 
limited flexibility, making them well suited for bit parts." AI characters 
are more difficult to program, but can interact with people and with their 
environment in more flexible ways, making them well suited for key roles such 
as the mother, sergeant, and medic, who all have to interact with the human 
lieutenant. 

Research by Rickel and his colleagues, who also include Jonathan Gratch, 
Randall Hill, and William Swartout of ICT and Stacy Marsella of ISI, has 
built on earlier work at ISI by Rickel and W. Lewis Johnson developing a 
teaching agent called "Steve." 

Steve instructed Navy recruits in a virtual-reality world presented through 
VR glasses, responding to their simple questions. The Sergeant and the Medic 
are more advanced versions of Steve. Steve's appearance has been updated from 
the legless floating presence in the early version to a more lifelike form. 

The third AI character, the Mother, adds another layer: she goes beyond words 
to the expression of emotions. Gratch and Marsella were responsible for this 
feature. 

Another major addition to the Steve agent is the use of a dramatic story 
line, with continuing incidents driving the action. To keep score at the end, 
a television story reported by the news crew on the scene records the result 
of the trainee's responses to the situation, chronicling either an abandoned 
boy in critical condition, or a boy out of danger because of timely action. 

"The work we have done in one way shows how far away the holodeck is -- but 
in another shows how useful it may be," Rickel said. "The project represents 
a grand challenge for both AI and virtual reality, but the potential payoff 
is a powerful new medium for experiential learning." 

"What makes the Mission Rehearsal Exercise project unique is that we are 
bringing together for the first time a set of technologies including 
immersive audio, large scale graphics, and virtual humans and linking them to 
an interactive story line to create a compelling experience." added William 
Swartout of the ICT. 

"The synergies that result are powerful. We were surprised to find that even 
though the system is still at its beginnings, some people came away from the 
simulation emotionally moved. I don't think this effect is due to any one 
element alone, but rather it is due to all of them working together."

The QWERTY design is reputed to be far inferior to the "scientifically"
designed Dvorak keyboard which claimed to offer a 40% increase in typing
speed. Supposedly, the Navy conducted experiments during the Second World War
demonstrating that the costs of retraining typists on the new keyboard could
be fully recovered within ten days! According to the path dependency theories,
no producers found it profitable to create Dvorak keyboards since everyone
already knew QWERTY, and no one learned Dvorak because there were no Dvorak
keyboards.

This is an ideal example, which accounts for its continued use by virtually
every author looking for an example of path dependence. The number of
dimensions of performance are few and in these dimensions the Dvorak keyboard
appears overwhelmingly superior.

Yet upon investigation, this story appears to be based on nothing more than
wishful thinking and a shoddy reading of the history of the typewriter
keyboard. The QWERTY keyboard, it turns out, is about as good a design as the
Dvorak keyboard, and was better than most competing designs that existed in
the late 1800s when there were many keyboard designs maneuvering for a place
in the market.

Ignored in these stories of Dvorak's superiority is a carefully controlled
experiment conducted under the auspices of the General Service Administration
in the 1950s comparing QWERTY with Dvorak. That experiment contradicted the
claims made by advocates of Dvorak and concluded that it made no sense to
retrain typists on the Dvorak keyboard. This study, which was influential in
its time, brought to an end any serious efforts to shift from QWERTY to
Dvorak. Modern research in ergonomics also reaches similar conclusions. This
research consists of simulations and experiments that compare various keyboard
designs. It finds little advantage in the Dvorak keyboard layout, confirming
the results of the GSA study.

So on what basis were the claims of Dvorak's superiority made? We discovered
that most, if not all, of the claims of Dvorak's superiority can be traced to
the patent owner, Professor August Dvorak. His book on the relative merits of
QWERTY versus his own keyboard has about as much objectivity as a modern
infomercial found on late night television. The wartime Navy study turns out
to have been conducted under the auspices the Navy's chief expert in
time-motion studies -- Lt. Commander August Dvorak, and the results of that
study were clearly fudged. The study also appears to be lacking in anything
remotely related to objectivity. The difficulties that we had getting a copy
of the Navy study, and the fact that it is mentioned, but never actually
cited, convinced us that those economists enamored of the Dvorak fable never
actually perused a copy of that study.

Many other aspects of the received story were also erroneous. It turns out
that there was intense competition between producers of various keyboard
designs early in the history of the typewriter keyboard. And contrary to prior
claims, there were many typing competitions between touch typists on various
keyboard designs, and QWERTY won its share of such competitions. Thus QWERTY
was put through a fairly severe set of tests by the market, and the reason
QWERTY survives seems to be that it is a reasonably good design.

We published a very detailed account of all this the Journal of Law and
Economics in the spring of 1990. Yet in spite of this five year old paper,
which has not been factually disputed, economists working on path dependence
topics continue to use the QWERTY keyboard as the main example to support
their theory that markets cannot be trusted to choose products. One could
hardly find better evidence of this theory's lack of empirical support than
the continued use of a result that is known to be incorrect. The QWERTY story,
by the way, is cited in Reback's paper (his footnote 44).

We are already not subject solely to natural selection. For example, if you like
green eyes, you will choose a partner with green eyes, and a certain proportion
of your offspring will have green eyes. You don't have to wait for a random
mutation. You just pick it off the shelf, be that reason or impulse, and mix it
in your own genomic stew. It's Lamarckism, just that the iteration is a
generation, and that the scalpel is a bit blunt. Surely we'll fix that.

But my point is not to exemplify natural selection, as I have stressed before. I
agree with most of your objections to it. I'm just pointing out that design and
selection, without exploration, is dangerous.

----------

Computers – the link between soap bubbles and satellites

A computer model originally applied to understanding the
formation of soap bubbles has been used to gauge how much fuel
is left to manoeuvre communications satellites - a development
potentially worth millions of dollars for the companies that
operate the satellites.

As a bonus, the technique, developed by engineers at Purdue
University in Indiana USA, uses temperature data that is already
collected routinely, so it does not requires any additional
hardware and can be applied to existing spacecraft. Satellites
are maintained in geostationary orbit about 22,500 miles above
Earth by firing small rocket thrusters, and they have to be
replaced before they run out of fuel and lose position. In
addition, enough fuel must remain to get the old satellite out
of orbit to make room for its replacement.

Since a single satellite may earn annual revenues in the
billions of dollars, companies have an interest in avoiding its
premature retirement.

More accurate fuel-gauging methods are needed so that companies
can better determine when to replace a satellite. For satellites
that send signals to pagers or residential TV dishes, just one
pound of hydrazine rocket fuel translates into about $2.5
million in revenue so the hydrazine is worth more than its
weight in gold.

Precisely measuring the amount of propellant in a satellite's
fuel tank is not so easy. Steven Collicott, an associate
professor of aeronautics and astronautics at Purdue and one of
the authors of the new system, pointed out that 'it's not like a
car's fuel tank, which has a little float that floats on top of
the gasoline and moves a lever. Floats don't work in space
because everything is floating.'

Conventional methods involve estimating fuel consumption from
the number and duration of all rocket firings since launch.
However, the Purdue engineers used a model created in the early
1990s by Kenneth Brakke, a mathematics professor at Susquehanna
University, initially to describe the mathematics behind such
phenomena as the formation of soap bubbles.

Collicott's application of the model uses routine temperature
data from the satellite to monitor how much fuel is left in the
tank. Heaters are needed to keep the fuel from freezing, and
those areas of the tank that contain fuel take longer to heat,
while portions of the tank that are empty heat up faster. The
more fuel that is present, the longer it takes to heat.

The model uses the temperature information to provide a
detailed, three-dimensional understanding of where fuel is
located inside the tank. That information can, in turn, be used
to calculate how much fuel remains in the tank. The technique
may be improved in the future, as researchers gain a better
understanding of how fluids behave in weightlessness.

I think this is quite a possible scenario ( I agree there's not much chance
of nomad incursions these days) which is why the example of the Ming is
rather scary. They were able to eliminate several important technologies and
to restructure the economy (by reducing the role of money, going back to
peasant agriculture, discouraging or even banning long distance trade and
encouraging local self-sufficiency) in such a way as to eliminate the
dynamism of the T'ang and Sung for about 500 years. Point is we mustn't
think that technological dynamism or progress is irreversible.

Couldn't agree more - popular culture and art are enormously important in my
view. I would add one thing: divided political power-China was a one state
civilisation with no competing sovereignties (see Joel Mokyr's thoughts on
this in The Lever of Riches).

I should introduce myself - I'm an historian in Manchester UK. I don't know
if it's unusual to find historians among extropians/transhumanists but then
I'm also a libertarian, SF fan and a congenital optimist (but then what else
can I be as a Manchester City supporter!). Steve Davies

About the implicit assumption that in the default case, there is *a* better

and disadvantages...

The thing is that there is just not enough objective data to choose between
two political parties as similar as the ones we have in the US.  So the
choice largely comes down to bias, or habit.

In a sense, religions can all be right.  I'm not religious as you know.  But
the benefits conferred on people by believing in religion may be largely
independent of the particular religion in question.

survive."

Frankly, no.  Sheer mental inertia is not just about the only driving factor

There are also the ever-present cravings for sex, food, and water.

The faces of the quartz provide L/R symetric faces upon which
aminos could build, and the electrochemical properties of quartz
works for building such structures. At that point Left and Right
handed proteins duke it out and the best one wins. If you already
have a world with right handed sugars...

The synchtron radiation idea has pertty much been shot down...

Most radiation just doesn't penetrate a cold dark nebulae where
all that fun chemistry is happening, while on the other hand, if
you've got enough energy to penetrate the nebulae, you almost
certainly have enough energy to blow away the complex and
delicate molecules that you're interested in, in the first place.

Once you have all those wonderful rich organics falling in comets
and carbonaceous meteors... they need a safe place away from
the intense UV, and harsh environment to begin having some real
fun. Rocky substrates... mica, quartz, fun muddy places... that's
the ticket!

As far as I know it doesn't matter which handedness you use, as long as
it is the same. Of course, you might want to have left-handed DNA for

Hi all,

Yesterday evening it suddenly struck me that it has been a year since Sasha 
Chislenko passed away.  As a result, I also realized that it had been 
nearly a year since I had looked through his homepage.  I did so this 
morning, and it is a reminder of how much the transhumanist community lost 
with his death.  I encourage you all --particularly those of you who are 
new to transhumanism-- to go to http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/home.html and 
look at the comprehensive content and writings which are enclosed within.

Though I am very much looking to Extro-5 and know that it will likely be 
the best one yet, I can't help but think that something will definitely be 
missing.

Yeah, well after I wrote that I thought of some of the famous
anthropologists doing field work, like Raymond Dart and Konrad
Lorenz.  They sure weren't afraid to rock the boat, and if
they were unduly influenced by the Boas school, it didn't show.

Well, I once heard from a reliable source that Freeman is 
considered a nut case by his colleagues---not that this
has anything to do with his research per se, but perhaps it
does help explain some of the animosity towards him that we
see.  If that's true, then certainly it's unfortunate that
he personally is the spokesman for debunking of Mead's work.

Like I said, I've heard about the results debunking Dvorak.  I would not
overlook, however, the fact that the debunkers are making political hay
out of their own results as well; path dependency is presently a
politically controversial issue.  To my everlasting regret I failed to set
up a before-and-after quantitative comparison for my own switch, but the
results of the alleged debunking simply do not conform to my own
experience.  I would similarly report from my personal experience that the
chief advantage of the Dvorak keyboard is rhythm and the distance your
fingers need to travel.  I expect that both the Navy results and the
modern-day anti-path-dependency results were politically biased - for
example, the report I read focused almost exclusively on typing speed,
which as stated is not what I found to be the chief advantage of Dvorak.

Steve! I thought the person behind the emails might be the Prof. Steve 
Davis that I met and liked back in the 1980s, when I was still in England 
and active in the Libertarian Alliance.

BTW, my second ever public talk, which I gave to that organization, was 
"Aspects of British Economic History:  Some Libertarian Perspectives" 
Sunday July 29 1984.

Steve, I don't know how much you know about Extropy Institute, but welcome 
to the list. If you're now scratching your head, I should say that I 
changed my surname in 1990, well after we last met.

Yes, historians are underrepresented on this List though, as you can tell, 
certain people have plenty of knowledge in certain areas -- Greg Burch 
especially in Chinese history, and quite a few of us in the history of 
technology. I'm delighted to meet you again, if virtually. Any chance that 
a stingy state university would pay your travel costs to come to the 
Extro-5 conference where we will be addressing the issues you're discussing 
with Greg?

Cheers,

Max

Yes, that's quite right.  I didn't leave Judaism because of a decision
that there was no one true religion; I left Judaism because it was WRONG. 
It made assertions that are, unambiguously, factually untrue.

There are, of course, many cases where there is no one true way.  I am
totally uninterested in having a preference in such cases, except where it
reflects a personal taste of some kind, in which case I am uninterested in
trying to persuade others of my personal taste.  There's no point in
trying to communicate an opinion to others unless it's an objective fact,
or the unambiguous result of objective facts plus panhuman cognition or
audience-majority common assumptions.

In other words, there's a selection bias in my verbal outputs.  I have no
interest in trying to convince you what kind of pizza to order.  Dvorak,
however, is unambiguously better than Qwerty.

As for your assertion that my distaste for cultural relativism is
religiously derived, does that mean that science, which states that
Einstein's theory is THE law of gravitation and superior to any law of
gravitation that uses an inverse-cube law, is religiously derived?

Cultural relativism is not a means of finding truth; it is an excuse for
avoiding the social discomfort that sometimes accompanies the act of
expressing an uncomfortable truth or a truth which is not widely held. 
Cultural relativism is a defection in the game known as Finding the
Truth.  Things can get better only if people are willing to speak the
words "better" or "worse".

There are more than two parties.  And if you don't have a strong reason,
or even a weak reason, to prefer one candidate over another, then you
shouldn't vote in that contest.

My personal philosophy is unambiguous on this topic; it says "You
shouldn't believe something because it benefits you; you should believe
things because they're true."  When I come across a force that could mess
this up, such as an evolutionary selection pressure that translates into a
cognitive pressure on what people believe, I do my best to counteract the
cognitive pressure to maintain clarity of reflection.

World's oldest computer rises again

Researchers in Berlin, Germany have built a reproduction of the first
freely programmable computer, originally constructed by engineer Konrad Zuse   
in the year 1941. The replica will be presented the day after tomorrow, on the
60th anniversary of the "Z3." In May 1941, completely unbeknownst to the
general public, Konrad Zuse had fulfilled his dream of an automatic computing
machine and rung in the Age of Computers.

The inventor had built the Z3 using 2,500 phone relays in his apartment
in Berlin. The machine was capable of carrying out any combination of basic
arithmetical operations, and had memory for 64 numbers. The original was
destroyed in 1943, during the war.

The researchers say they built the replica of the Z3 using smaller
relays. They constructed the machine's architecture such that the flow of data is
shown by tiny light-emitting diodes. Thus, the replica is both historically
accurate while also being suitable for bringing the history of machines
to life for schoolchildren and students. The model has been scaled down so
that it can be shown at various exhibits and in museums in future. A 1:1
reconstruction was built in the 1960s by Konrad Zuse himself, and is
housed in Munich's Deutsches Museum.

I don't know that A/V inputs surpass keyboard inputs.  I've never used
one.  I do know that the "feel" of typing and speech is different -
coding, in particular, might require keyboarding, unless the language was
specially designed to be codeable via speech recognition.

How so? In what way is life a non-abstract grouping? More importantly, it's
not even clearly defined, and will become harder to pin down as we venture
further into nanotech, and begin to make all kinds of interesting
self-directed & self-replicating greeblies.

Yes, they certainly are. I don't think that we can pick any motivation, and
call it anything other than arbitrary. When you get right down to it, there
is no purely rational basis for doing anything at all, which does not rest
on some arbitrary axioms, like "it is good for me to survive". As an
example, can you present a purely rational case that our prefered objective
should be the continuance of the class of living things, in preference to
other goals such as continuance of the self? Some redundance for the sake of
clarity... I don't claim to be able to present a rational argument for the
continuance of self as the fundamental goal.

Your question is an interesting one... "Can you transcend your "naturally
selected" impulses and comprehend with the mind alone?"

I think this comes up especially when we contemplate changing fundamental
aspects of our minds, like extending our intellectual or emotional
capacities, gaining "direct control" over emotional states, being able to
fiddle with our primary motivations. It always begs the question "How do you
decide how to change yourself?" The implication being that such a decision
to alter your mental makeup is firmly rooted in your mental makeup; thus you
cannot escape your biological, historical inheritance.

There is not an entirely strong position, however. It falls down when we can
see that the process of mental modification is an iterative one. We begin
with an un-altered mind, call it M0. M0 decides to alter itself, to become
M1 (which is indeed determined by the drives of M0). M1 then alters to M2,
and so on, ... at any point in the future we have mental infrastructure Mn,
where n can be an arbitrarily large positive integer.

You would agree that decisions made by the human mind are extremely complex,
and though we can say that they are driven by our biological history, the
derivational path is messy, to say the least. Chaotic, some might say.

When we add a re-entrant iteration to such a complex system as the mind, it
becomes clear that the basis of our decisions as being entirely rooted in
biology, after a short number of iterations, is meaningless. Although it is
technically true that we are still wholy derived from our environment, there
is no way that, given the biological past of  a being, one could derive Mn
for n greater than some fairly small constant. The system is too dynamic,
unpredictable. So, in effect, our biology is lost to time.

What replaces our biology, our evolved motivations and desires, as the
driver for that change? It's not an easy question to answer, and I suspect
it is highly dependent on initial conditions, and the kind of attractors
that exist in the space of mental modification. I strongly suspect that
there is a relatively rational attractor, into whose thrall some minds would
fall; that modification would be primarily driven by rational choices based
on needs in a given environment. But there are probably others, eg: I
imagine there could be a fairly coarse "self-indulgent"/pleasure seeking
attractor, where minds are driven by increasing narcissism and sensualism.
It sounds like fun, actually :-) I'd suspect that could be fairly unstable,
especially where a mind modified itself into the region of a different
attractor on some fleeting whim.

There are likely a lot of other examples, and those I've given above are
hopelessly crude. The point, however, is that we absolutely can escape our
biology. We can even be in control of that process in some important sense,
eventually. Beings who modifiy their mental state to become something new,
will do it purposefully. We would expect that they (we?) will be rather
intelligent people... they will not be blind to the dynamic nature of
themselves, and to the rather tricky topology of the space that they
traverse. The whole idea of "self" may come to change it's meaning somewhat
(for the better, in my opinion).

No arguments there. One of the grounding concepts of extropy is dynamism...
no one is interested in a centrally controlled sculpting of humanity. The
idea is yet again that individualism reigns... self modification will be
diverse, and performed according to the desires of each person upon his or
her own self. Thus, while any individual can choose to risk exploratory
behaviour, or else to shun it, the whole space of self modifying individuals
will tend to be incredibly diverse and interesting. Without a central
organising factor, it cannot help but be exploratory, and evolutionary as a
whole, in a pretty fascinating way.

Certainly not, and for two reasons.  In the first place, what Greg
Egan was talking about was not reversibility in the sense of
reversible computation.  He simply ran some scenes in a different
order.  If the successive states are denoted A--B--C--D--E, then
he was only talking about having a copy experience D--E, then C--D,
and so on.  This is nothing more than slicing up calculations that
are still "forward" going.  With reversible computers, of course,
we are talking about sequences such as E--D--C--B--A.

The second reason is that Greg Egan does not appear to be talking
about the kinds of computation, in general, that can be accomplished
by a Turing machine (or a computer).  In a very confused way, he
appears to be talking about a restricted kind of computation.

Anyway, let me digress to explain how Egan was probably going wrong.
I used to think that I knew exactly how it happened.  If you ask anyone
who is reading this what a good mathematical model of the conscious
development in real time of an organism should be, they'll sooner or
later point you in the direction of non-linear dynamics (chaos theory),
because of the way that our lives, as well as so many other physical
phenomena, exhibit features not found in differential equations.

I mean to say that it wouldn't have occurred to Maxwell to attempt
to model millions of interactions large scale objects using
differential equations.  There is a clear non-compressibility
of the entire "calculation" of varies and mixed kinds of objects,
much as one sees in Conway's Life.

Differential equations are a tool useful in non-chaotic calculations.
Yes, it's true that the initial conditions determine the final state
just as in, say, cellular autonoma.  Yes, it's true that differential
equations can display sensitive dependence on initial conditions.  
But unlike the kind of chaotic development that I'm talking about, in
which each state is necessary for the calculation of all following
states, differential equations often submit to formal symbolic
methods in such a manner that intermediate states (and calculations)
can be ignored.

I think that Greg Egan refers to "differential equations" at least
once, though I can't find it.  But on pages 48-49, what he's talking
about is just not clear.  He says, first, "His model of a brain was
being fully described at half-second (model time) intervals---but each
description still included the results of everything that "would have
happened" in between".   Now from this you would think that the
emulation of Paul Durham was not experiencing each of the little
steps during the half-seconds.

But then on the next page he goes on, "The equations controlling the
model were far too complex to solve in a single step.  In the process
of calculating the solutions, vast arrays of partial results were
being generated and discarded along the way.  In a sense, these
partial results **implied**---even if they didn't directly represent---
events taking place within the gaps between successive complete
descriptions."   And when the whole model was arbitrary, who was to
say that these implied events, buried a little more deeply in the
torrent of data, were any "less real" than those which were directly
described?"

It's obvious that he's leaning way too heavily on some very unclear
concepts such as "implied", "represent" and "fully described", or
at least trying to get some strange mileage out of them.

For sure it was sensitive dependence on confused concepts that
led Greg Egan downward into the Theory of Dust.  And it's not
impossible that he knew this perfectly well, and was having some
fun, as he seemed to indicate in one interview.

There is no opposition between egoism and altruism.

What does "altruistic sense" mean? How does it oppose practicality?

You're resorting to false dilemmas between choices that are not even
mutually exclusive.

Yet another false dilemma.
Man is part of nature.
Any artificial choice is also ipso facto a natural choice.
If you're going to oppose "natural" to "artificial",
then you must establish a believable assessment of what this
"natural choice" would be in absence of humans.
Which is of course _completely_ meaningless in any case
were human behavior is considered.

So you think you're intelligent? prove it! I don't believe you, so far.

Here's a shameful hysteron-proteron.
There is no way in which intelligence makes responsibility possible.
Quite on the contrary, responsibility is the very principle behind
natural selection that made evolution possible, and that caused
intelligence (or at least, any trace thereof that can be found)
to appear, to begin with.

Remove your quotes, and consider how "do so" is generic in your sentence.
Then you'll have reached the tautology. Now, move on.

Most of the natural selection ain't vanilla.
Although vanilla is indeed the product of natural selection.

If your post was coherent with the ideas of this book, then I'd definitely
disrecommend it. But I prefer to think that your recommendation is worthless
in itself, and does not taint a book that might otherwise be admirable.

[ François-René ÐVB Rideau | Reflection&Cybernethics | http://fare.tunes.org ]
[  TUNES project for a Free Reflective Computing System  | http://tunes.org  ]
As far as natural selection applies to the human world, we don't ever get to
"let nature decide", because we ARE part of that nature that decides. Hence,
any claim to "let the nature decide" is just a fallacy to promote one point
of view against others, or to ignore one's responsibilities.

The three-body problem is unsolveable for time T without computing all the
intervening states between now and T.  One presumes that the same holds of
the hundred-trillion-synapse problem.  Egan's scenario, which involves
selectively refusing to compute certain intervening periods, is therefore
impossible.

Robert Wright discusses this event in _Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny_
(2000), in Chapter 12 "The Inscrutable Orient" (pp. 162-164):

"The impetus behind [globalization] is strong largely because individual
states see that their long-term interest lies in plugging into the system...
China, of all nations, should know.  Its epic mistake -- the mistake that
got it labeled an underachiever -- was unplugging from the system beginning
in the late fourteenth century.  The consequences of this, a single political
decision, have ever since been taken as final proof of some deep
anti-modern streak in the Asian character.

CHINA CHICKENS OUT

The unplugging came during the Ming dynasty, which reigned from 1368 to
1644.  When the Ming vanquished the Mongols, it was in theory a
glorious moment for China: renewed native control after a century of
barbarian rule...  

The irony of this isolationism is that during the early Ming period
the Chinese were king of the sea...

The reasons for China's withdrawal are much debated...  The historian
John King Fairbank concluded simply that "anti-commercialism and
xenophobia won, and China retired from the world scene."  Others
discern a more rational move.  The historian Peter Perdue sees China
consciously shifting resources from one vast project -- ocean voyages
that had shown little profit -- to another vast project:  building
the Great Wall to keep barbarians at bay.  In this view, the move
was neither mindlessly xenophobic (centuries of barbarian rampages
were no figment of China's imagination) nor anti-modern (the Great
Wall was high-tech back then).

Whatever the cause for China's withdrawal, the timing was bad.
For centuries, China had been a big exporter of good ideas, and
western Europe a big importer.  Now, just as Europe's social brain was
really humming, China opted out of the exchange.

The timing was bad in a second sense, too.  Over the next half-
century, European nations would embrace sailing big-time, and
find the New World.  Some scholars believe this stroke of fortune
explains why the industrial revolution happened where it did..."

"I think [philosophy is] very important in the present world

Right, and speech recognition for input devices helps to move  keyboards
toward obsolescence for some people, while for people who can't speak (well
enough), Raymond Kurzweil has designed systems with input devices to bypass
that difficulty, as we know. Perhaps it's all a matter of individual need and
personal preference. The dvorak keyboards I've seen (and handled) left me
cold. I like the split keys arrangement, and the half keyboard looks mighty
interesting, though I haven't tried one. Anyone else?

Matias Half Keyboard

http://computers.cnet.com/hardware/0-1016-8-5754760-7.html?tag=st.co.1016-8-57
54760-6.txt.1016-8-5754760-7
Much research has gone into designing effective one-handed keyboards, but most
require adaptations; for example, the user may have to learn chord typing.
However, the $99 Matias Half Keyboard makes use of the touch-typing skills you
may already have, delivering all the functionality of a full-sized board in
half the space.

The left hand knows what the right's doing
The Half Keyboard is half of a traditional QWERTY keyboard, on which your left
hand also fulfills the functions of your right. Why buy half a keyboard? PDA
devotees, CAD users, gamers, or anyone who regularly uses a stylus, a graphic
tablet, or a joystick might appreciate the efficiency of using just one hand
for keying, while your free hand uses your input device of choice.

With the Half Keyboard, the left-hand keys become the missing right-hand keys
by using the spacebar as a toggle key. For example, typing to means reaching
for T key as usual, then holding down the spacebar and hitting W, which
becomes an o as long as the spacebar is depressed. Matias offers a
downloadable (45K) demo of the system at its Web site.

The Half Keyboard has other special keys and combinations. A unique corner key
switches the keyboard between number pad, navigation (cursor and Page
Up/Down), or function-key mode, while special characters (such as @) are typed
by hitting Shift twice. Standard left-hand letters are printed in big white
type on the keys, right-hand letters in smaller white type, numbers in yellow,
and navigation keys in blue. It sounds crowded, but the colors help you keep
it straight.

The learning curve
Whether the Half Keyboard works for you depends on your existing typing skills
(or lack thereof) and maybe your general level of dexterity. Matias believes
that touch typists can achieve 18 words per minute (wpm) within five minutes
(and have clocked speeds up to 64wpm). Normally, we touch-type at 100wpm;
we're not sure we ever reached 18wpm during our time testing the keyboard, but
we'd estimate, at the rate we were going, that it'd take us a work day to get
up to that speed. It might have been easier if Matias included a nub on the F
key, like the tiny bumps on the F and J of most keyboards, which tell you by
touch that your fingers are on home row. Those who aren't touch typists might
actually have an easier time adjusting to the Half Keyboard because they're
not married to a specific layout. In any case, Matias's 30-day money-back
guarantee on the device means you can find out whether it works for you before
committing to it permanently.

The Half Keyboard also comes with a one-year warranty. The unit is available
for PC and Mac users, as well as for various PDAs. Tech support is available
toll-free, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET, and also via e-mail at the company Web site,
which offers a short list of FAQs, downloadable drivers, and manuals.

Your better half
While the Half Keyboard's unique design makes it potentially more efficient
for users who switch frequently between keying and using an input device,
learning to use its multifunction keys could be a challenge for some typists.
If the efficiency of the device intrigues you, just remember there may be a
learning curve at the beginning.

Yes, I gather that there was a certain atmosphere of paranoia
in those days (perhaps not surprising, since Perry Metzger
is extremely interested in cryptography).  Of course, that was well
before the Web as we know it had taken shape, and folks had
started plugging into this global consciousness booster (a far
more extropian notion, IMO, than that of a secretive mailing
list guarded against the prying eyes of government spies).

I've got a bee in my bonnet now -- I'm wondering if Metzger would
agree to the idea of attempting to wriggle out of the blackout
on the early posts by, for example, sending e-mail warnings
to the early authors, and permitting anybody who wishes to
opt out, and then incorporating the remaining authors'
posts in the new Javien archive.  I think an opt-out, silence-gives-
assent scheme would be more practical than actually attempting
to get positive permission from everybody involved.  In fact,
I just got a similar privacy opt-out form from my car insurance
company (which has apparently been acquired by the Citigroup financial
services conglomerate), that would allow me to prevent having my name
used for marketing purposes by other Citigroup companies.  I guess
that if I **don't** send in the opt-out form, they'll assume I'm giving
my permission.

Of course, I don't know if anybody, even Metzger, kept a complete
archive of the period 1991-1995; even though he was the list
founder, he might, as most people would, only have archived the messages
that struck his fancy, and thrown away the rest.  Trying to actually
**reconstruct** a complete archive by merging various partial ones
would be a lot of bother, possibly more than it would be worth.
And even of the messages that somebody might have saved in those
days, to expect that they would still be around is another story --
50 megabytes was a lot of disk for a PC in 1991, and even 1995 was
before the days of cheap recordable CD (it's almost hard to remember
the times when disk space was actually a limiting factor).  Still, even
a partial archive of early messages would be better than nothing
(particularly since the ones that people actually bothered to hang on to
would likely be the ones of greatest interest).

I'll have to run all this past Metzger if I ever run into him.
And I'll certainly mention that you said hello ;-> .

Yes, as a matter of fact Liz herself (the woman through whom I
will meet Perry, if that ever happens), warned me just last night:

"Danger Will Robinson! ... The people trying to fight for encryption,
including Perry, have a very strong sense of a right to privacy. Be
respectful of it or you will get flamed.

This has been a public service announcement."

Sigh.

It seems like an irreconcilable tension -- on the one hand
you have people who are fearful of immersing themselves in the
public datasphere, unless their real-world identies can be
**completely** concealed, which is something that government
intelligence agencies, the police, and business interests like
the RIAA,  absolutely do **not** want anybody to be able to do,
and which may be a chimerical goal anyway (even if you're willing to
pay for an anonymizing service like ZeroKnowledge to surf the Web,
how do you know you're **really** safe from the FBI?).  Even our
friend Max More began singing a different tune after
being anonymously slandered on the list.

And on the other hand, you have what I (in my more expansive
moods) consider the **true** extropian vision (whatever the
hell that may mean ;-> ) of people plugging into a sizzling
global mind, the sort of ratcheting-up of the density of
interconnected discourse that Robert Wright, for example,
(in his book _Nonzero_) believes is responsible for the
upward swing of cultural evolution.  And archives and search
engines are an **essential** part of that -- they make it
possible to organize views into a staggering heap of data
like Google's terabyte Usenet archive that actually make
it all **useful**.

I don't know how to reconcile this dilemma, except that I do
know that when I'm feeling most alive and optimistic, I swing
toward the latter view.

Also, it seems to me that **fostering** paranoia can also
be used by big bad governments and other authorities to
further repressive goals, on the old divide-and-conquer
theory.  Employers have been notorious for this in the past --
no posting on the company bulletin board without permission,
and certainly no soliciting for union membership!  And remember the
days when to reveal your salary to a co-worker was considered
at many companies a firing offense?  And certainly, companies
didn't want their employees talking to customers or the
press, unless they were explictly authorized to do so.

But all the big bad authorities (except for the RIAA)
seem to have given up (for the time being, at least)
on serious attempts to rein in all the electronic yakking
going on.  Have you seen the book _The Cluetrain Manifesto_
( http://www.cluetrain.com/ )?

But, at any rate, it's becoming clear to me that **I'm** probably
not the person to pursue this idea with respect to the early
Extropians' list.  I just had a burst of adrenaline engendered
by the juxtaposition of three events -- Google's Usenet
archive coming back on-line, the new Javien archive making
the existing Extropians' archive actually useful, and the truly
weird business of finding out that I barely missed being in
the farcical situation of sitting at the same dinner table
with Perry Metzger, discussing the Extropians' mailing
list, without knowing that the person I was talking to
**started** the damned thing (and I wouldn't have believed
him -- I would have assumed that he and Liz had cooked up
a little leg-pulling skit for my benefit, a little snipe-hunting
exercise for dim Jim.  I don't expect Perry Metzger to be particularly
impressed with me anyway, but at least I have escaped making
a first impression as an utterly clueless foof!  Not that I care
that much; after all, I **am** an utterly clueless foof! ;-> ).
If the annexation of the early conversation to the archive
were a soluble problem, it seems likely that it would already
have been solved by now.  Still, maybe now that I've been
forewarned and prepared to treat the issue more gingerly
and respectfully, I'll **still** run it past Perry (very,
very carefully, as they say on alt.sex.hedgehog.ouch.ouch.ouch
;-> ).

It seems that feeling about the 1991-1995 privacy agreement
still runs strong.  I wonder if early posts could be cleared
by **content** -- e.g., excluding discussions of cryptography
and other sensitive (potentially incriminating) topics?

I may have misrepresented the extropian position in that last paragraph, but
do note the last sentence... I am by no means suggesting a relationship of
mutually incompatibility between the good of the individual and the good of
the species. Truly, I'd say they are fairly closely aligned. Natural
selection has managed to produce our species, members of which quite often
hold personal survival as their highest goal; if that was in opposition to
the good of the group, it likely wouldn't be a viewpoint represented with
such frequency.

Also, think of this... extropianism might be an highly individualistic
philosophy, yet it has catalysed the formation of this rather cantankerous
group. How would that be? Have a look at people who espouse this philosophy,
and you'll find people who care about providing others with the ability to
act in an individualistic fashion. In some senses this really is
altruistic - we care about the future, and what it brings, because in the
end we really like people and care about what happens to them. Also, as
you've pointed out, there is a practical aspect. Humans achieve more as a
group than individually. The kinds of technologies we are looking at require
cooperation amongst people on often massive scales. Also, a society which
treasures individualism and dynamism is more likely to allow you, the
individual, to do the things you want to do - it mightn't help you much, but
it's unlikely to get in the way.

I think there's a great temptation to see individualism as being opposed to
the best interests of the group, often colouring it as immoral or even evil.
That's an unfortunate simplification, which ignores the fact that the group
is, in the end, made up of those individuals, who are not entirely blind to
their interdependence.

I'll just make a quick comment that having an individualistic outlook might
colour your political views a bit, but it doesn't dictate them. It doesn't
necessarily progress to "I gotta get some big g*ns and put in razor wire".
In fact, I believe you can support some fairly major governmental
infrastructure without contradiction, although your demands on the
transparency and accountability of such institutions might be pretty high.

We are in accord. Unlike someone else who replied to you rather
discourteously and without much evidence of a point, I find what you have
said here completely agreeable. It's a line that I continue to push...
"natural" loses it's meaning when you talk about what humans will do next.
We'll do what we will do; it's our nature.

I tried switching.  I found that Dvorak is in fact better for English text,
but not for coding and Unix.  Possibly because coding and Unix have adapted to
Qwerty, but still, the rhythm and frequencies of computer text are a lot
different than English.

So I use a Kinesis keyboard, where the physical distance to all keys is closer
to being constant.  Nyah.

It's really interesting to see somebody thinks about this stuff.  I've long
been interested about the Sung/Ming dichotomy; the Sung were so 
technologically innovative and the Ming so conservative.  I've seen 
tertiary sources claiming the Sung were close to an industrial revolution
when the Mongols finally managed to take them out.  In contrast,
the Sung had a bad military track record while the Ming were the 
terror of East Asia for quite some time.  I wrote on this in college
(specifically why the Sung had such a lousy offensive military) and was 
depressed to find how little information on the Sung was available
even at the University of Chicago, which has one of the best libraries
in America.  

Do you have any sourcces you can point me to on the conservatising cultural
innovations of the Ming or the sources of Sung technical dynamism?

That's a good way of putting it.

Yes, Dvorak is slightly less superior for coding; I've noticed that as
well.  On the other hand, it depends what language you're using
(*cough*Python*cough*... the Better Ways all work together, you know...)

Hm, I looked this up online, but it appears to require actual hardware
rather than hitting a software switch.  If switching to Dvorak required
new hardware I wouldn't have chosen it as an iconoclasm archetype... I
should probably try one of those keyboards if I ever happen to run across
one, though.

If you're *asking someone else* how many iconoclasm points you have... oh,
never mind.  The motorcycle doesn't count; the Kinesis is worth a couple
of points; the recumbent bicycle scores a lot of points but still not as
many as a Dvorak keyboard.

Indeed.  (Although some Kinesis models switch to a Dvorak keyset at a
keypress, avoiding OS configuration.)

Man, your irony detector needs an upgrade.  He really doesn't care what you
think of his iconoclasm.  My friends thought you were being ironic, but I had
to tell them it didn't look like it.  Unless my detector needs the
recalibration.

And I could argue with your choices, but don't think it's worth it.

Nobody ever gets my Hofstadterian irony, a tradition going back to the

I was speaking metaphorically here, but I guess I was simply trying to make it
clear that my perspective was based on practical considerations, not altruism. I
wasn't attempting to place them in opposition.

See above.

Again, see above. This is metaphorical language, not an assertion of scientific
fact (and you seem to have conveniently left off my parenthetical statement that
this is an oversimplification). The terms "natural selection" and "artificial
selection" have generally agreed upon meanings that have nothing to do with my
personal philosophy, and I was simply using them in a conversational way.

Well, if one is calm while reading what I said, it's pretty clear I agree with
this. Again, I wasn't attempting to place anything in opposition to anything
else. This is a misreading on your part.

In intelligent discussion (as opposed to unprovoked attacks), I think (damn,
there's that word again) this response would be referred to as ad hominem. It's a
weak strategy, is uncalled for in this case, and totally destroys your
credibility. Perhaps in the future you might consider taking a deep breath before
responding.

Okay. However, I wasn't making the point you seem to think I was. Perhaps you
misunderstood my use of the word responsible.  There's a difference between
"responsible for" (in charge of, which is what I meant) and "responsible to" (an
obligation).

This makes no sense to me. Again, I think you're arguing against something that
isn't there.

I quoted this phrase from the original post I was responding to, and was using it

Well, now. This is way over the top and entirely unwarranted, especially since I
wasn't being argumentative or combative, and I was responding to someone else's
post, not yours. Just because the emails arrive in your mailbox, it doesn't mean
they're personal attacks on you. Relax a little. Take a walk.

Personally, I don't give a damn what you think. If you don't want to read the
book I recommended, it's your loss.

Hey, good, I ride a motorcycle and a recumbent bike.  I assign
myself 5 points of ... iconorclasm.

The Dvorak keyboard is very tempting except for the problem of
having to use multiple keyboards at work.  Otherwise I probably
would have switched long ago.  spike

Well, I don't know how extropian probability questions are and do they
belong on this list?  Maybe they do, since they exercise our brains and thus
prevent Alsenheimer's...

I disagree with this one.  (As you see I am trying to be diplomatic here
)  ).

First, one of course assumes that sexes are equally probable (they aren't),
otherwise this would not be an interesting little problem.

One has to be careful about formulation of the problem.  Lee wants to ask
"given that there is at least one girl, what is the probability that there
is one boy and one girl".  The answer to this is of course 2/3, just as Lee
claims.

However, this is not what Lee is really asking.  Note the pair of phrases:
"one", and "the other".  What the father is really asking is "I have picked
one of my children (not necessarily at random). That child is a girl.  What
is the probability that the other child is a boy".  To this question the
answer is 1/2.

In Newtonian mechanics you cannot, of course, compute all the intervening
states between now and T, yet we may obtain arbitrarily precise approximations
(modulo their uselessness for large enough T).  Consideration of the three
body problem actually helps Egan's point rather than hinders it.  Recall that
I had also quoted:

>> But then on the next page he goes on, "The equations controlling the 
model were far too complex to solve in a single step. In the process 
of calculating the solutions, vast arrays of partial results were 
being generated and discarded along the way. <<

See?  Sometimes he's saying (a lot of) intermediate steps are calculated,
and at other times he appears to imply that they're being skipped.  Using
the principle of charity obliges us to read him in the strongest way that
we can.  Clearly he's using "equations" in the same manner as one would
speak of "differential equations", and their intractability in this case
also suggests something enormously difficult (like the three body problem).

Again, the totally weirdest thing is that anyone but Egan would have
suggested an iterative (chaotic) model, in which the intermediate
calculations don't **approximate** anything, but rather **comprise**
the calculation in question.

By hundred-trillion-synapse problem, I think that you are referring
to an example of the latter iterative model, and not an example of
the former differential equations model.  Yes, we certainly think
this also to be incompressible (no short cuts), just in the way
that a Life position is incompressible.

However, speaking again of reversibility, and the n-body problem, I
wonder if there is any way, for some extremely large integer n,
to dismiss the possibility of n bodies acting under Newtonian 
gravitation so that they implement a conscious calculation.  My
intuition says that this has to be impossible.  But just because
there is no entropy increase (Newton's equations are time reversible)
is itself not enough to rule out consciousness, as we know from the
universality of reversible calculation.

An emerged autocatalytic set, draining the racemate ursoup of one

matter which of them, R or S.  Since it was capable of autoamplification,
it amplified a random nanoscale event to macroscale.

The other enantiomeres in the pool were sometimes coupled via racemisation
reactions, and were generically not inert to the suddenly changed global

Because it's abiotic, pretty ubiquitous and comes in two chiral flavours,

Absolutely not, as the enantiomeric excess would be only just a few
percent in best case. "Rare event" being of course emergence of an
autocatalytic set from the random ursoup.

Panspermia would of course remove the need of local emergence, by relying
on an infectious seed meeting favourable conditions on the prebiotic
Earth.

Good.

Next, I could argue that the term "practical" is misleading, too,
and has a long tradition of being used in fallacies. Its only relevant
meaning, relative to empirical rationalism (as opposed e.g. to
contructivism or irrationalism), is so tautologically good that it doesn't
need mentioning, except in debates about rationality.

Now that you made some clarifications, I think that your message
could have been phrased in a meaningful, positively informative way;
but you chose to make "oversimplications" (as you put it,
which is also an oversimplification of the process
that led to your statements having an obvious fallacious interpretation):
you chose to resort to forms of expression
that are loaded with meanings opposed to what you think
(as compared to what you later explained you meant or didn't mean),
and to use common language in areas where it specifically fails.

I think putting conciseness before correction is just wrong,
All the more since your post wasn't concise.
I'll grant you that there is one metrics according to which
your means of expression might have looked like a win:
it might originally have took you less time to think about
and write your message in this incorrect form
than it would have in its correct form.
But as you can see, this time you thought you won,
was first lost by other people trying to decode what you say
or being misled by it (loss multiplied by the number of readers),
and then by yourself clarifying your position.
Either in a specifically altruistic point of view, or in a specifically
egoistic point of view, in all practicality, your choice was thus wrong.

And I don't think that attacks, even unprovoked,

It was undeniably ad hominem, but note that it was not argumentum.
Thank you a lot for taking up the challenge
and making your post level higher.
*Now*, I believe you.

I apparently participated in a working overall,
I don't think it was uncalled for,
and it's a risk I'm taking (though maybe lightly so).

Thanks for reminding me. I'll try.

I'll return the argument to you:
I should take time to be less aggressive in my replies,
you should take time to be more precise in yours.

> There's a difference between "responsible for" (in charge of,
> which is what I meant) and "responsible to" (an obligation).
I've never seen the term "responsible to", so I'm not sure what you mean.
Can you expand?
Maybe you're trying to talk about intelligent handling of responsibility.
Which, in the context of justifying intelligent choice about the future,
is but a hidden tautology (which is, of course, true).

Then to use your terms, I invite you to be "responsible for" your posts
and not just "responsible to" them. (Doesn't sound right.)

Not all arguing is "against". Don't let my questioning your own personal
intelligence let you polarize the debate in terms of "for" or "against".
I was putting your argument in perspective, and showing how
the specifics to which you apply them are irrelevant to its purpose,
thus factorizing your argument.

Too large of a task, too sensitive. I think that I probably violated
it with my extropians light-bulbs jokes renewal from last year and the
Reputations listing (for which I apologize, if I stepped on anyone's
toes). I have my own private archive (saved what I thought was most
valuable to me) of the extropians list from that time.

BTW, the person that you may have the hardest time is with Tim May,
more than Perry.

The list atmosphere at that time was the way that it was because it
was a private, closed list: that atmosphere fostered the intensity of
the low-noise discussions. People felt secure that discussions on any
topic, (for example, all aspects of social communities, cryptography,
chemical substances, etc. etc) could be made without repercussions
from the outside. I sincerely doubt that some of those discussions
would have occurred if folks thought their words would be open to the
world to read 10 years later. (I know that *I* would have posted
with different writing style, different topics, if I had thought
my old words would be public.)

ESO Press Release 10/01

The Harsh Destiny of a Planet?

The VLT Uncovers Traces of Stellar Cannibalism

  Summary

  Did the star HD 82943 swallow one of its planets?

  What may at a first glance look like the recipe for a dramatic
  science-fiction story is in fact the well-considered conclusion of a
  serious scientific study, to be published by a group of astronomers in
  Switzerland and Spain [1] in tomorrow's issue of the international
  research journal "Nature".

  Using the very efficient UVES high-resolution spectrograph at the ESO VLT
  8.2-m KUEYEN telescope, they have convincingly detected the presence of
  the rare isotope Lithium-6 (6Li; [2]) in this metal-rich, solar-type dwarf
  star that is also known to possess a planetary system, cf. ESO Press
  Release 13/00.

  Unlike the Lithium-7 (7Li) isotope of this light element, any primordial
  Lithium-6 would not survive the early evolutionary stages of a metal-rich
  solar-type star. The Lithium-6 now seen in HD 82943 must therefore have
  been added later, but from where? The astronomers believe that this
  observation strongly suggests that the star has at some moment engulfed
  one of its planets, whose Lithium-6 was then deposited in the star's
  atmosphere.

  This surprising discovery represents important observational evidence that
  planets may fall into their host stars.

  PR Photo 17/01: The spectrum of HD 82943 with the Lithium absorption lines.
  Artist's impression (drawing and video) of the engulfment of a planet.

HD 82943 and its planetary system

The last few years have seen the discovery of more than 60 new planetary
systems. One of the most prolific planet search programmes is being carried
out by the Geneva Extra-Solar Planet Search Group, by means of the CORALIE
spectrograph at the 1.2-m Leonard Euler Swiss Telescope at the ESO La Silla
Observatory (Chile).

One of the stars included in this programme is the dwarf star HD 82943 in
the constellation Hydra (The Water Snake). It is slightly hotter and larger
than the Sun and was recently found to harbour a planetary system with (at
least) two giant planets, cf. ESO Press Release 07/01.

Like most extra-solar planets ("exoplanets") found to date, the orbits
of the objects orbiting HD 82943 are quite unlike those expected from
traditional theories of the formation and evolution of such systems [3].
Contrary to the giant planets in the Solar System, those at HD 82943 have
rather elongated orbits, and they are unsually close to the central star.

Astronomers believe that giant planets must form in comparatively cool
environments, as this was the case in the solar system. The existence of
systems in which the giant planets are much closer to the central star can
only be explained by certain dynamical processes, e.g. significant orbital
changes with time ("orbital migration") or the effects of strong
gravitational interaction between several planets.

These processes can explain the short-period planetary systems found to
date, in which planets are very close to the central star, and also the
very elongated orbits found in some cases.

These theories also predict that it may be the fate of some planets to fall
into their host star.

The significance of Lithium

Unlike most other elements lighter than Iron, the light nuclei of Lithium
(both the Lithium-6 and Lithium-7 isotopes [2]), Beryllium and Boron are
not produced in significant amounts in the stellar spheres of fire.

In fact, Lithium-6 is extremely "fragile", being easily destroyed by proton
collisions at a temperature of "only" 1.5 million degrees -- by comparison,
the fusion of Hydrogen to Helium takes place at about 10 million degrees.
In the case of solar-like stars, any Lithium-6 atoms present in a newborn
star will be "burnt" during the early evolutionary stages. Strong internal
motions will thoroughly mix the outer (cooler) and inner (hotter) stellar
layers, and Lithium-6 will completely disappear in just a few million
years. We would therefore not expect to find any Lithium-6 in a developed
solar-type star.

However, during the later evolutionary stages the outer layers of a
solar-type star remain better "separated" from the hotter central parts.
Thus, if some Lithium-6 is now picked up from the outside, it is therefore
possible that it will be preserved in the upper, cooler regions for some
time, possibly billions of years.

Unlike stars, planets never reach temperatures that are high enough to burn
their initial content of Lithium-6. Consequently, planets will retain their
Lithium-6. So, if a planet happens to fall into a solar-type star like HD
82943, we may then be able to detect this isotope in the stellar spectrum.

In the case of "metal-poor" stars -- that are less rich in metals than the
Sun -- the mixing process in the early phase is less efficient and some
original Lithium-6 may actually survive.

Detection of Lithium-6 in HD 82943 with UVES

  ESO PR Photo 17/01

  Caption: The spectrum of HD 82943, showing the region around the Lithium
  absorption line. The general shape of this spectral line is caused by
  Lithium-7 atoms in the atmosphere of the star, while the presence of
  Lithium-6 causes a certain asymmetry. Model computations have been used
  to calculate the amount of the two Lithium isotopes; the two fully drawn
  curves correspond to 6Li/7Li = 0.12 (red) and no Lithium-6 (0.00; blue),
  respectively. The difference (O-C = Observed - Calculated) is shown below
  and demonstrates the very good fit for an isotopic ratio of 0.12 (red
  dots). Technical information about this photo is available below.

The possible presence of Lithium-6 in a stellar atmosphere can be checked
by means of a detailed analysis of the star's spectrum. For this, the
astronomers search for a very small asymmetry in the "stronger" absorption
line in the red spectral region that is caused by Lithium-7 atoms in the
stellar atmosphere.

However, this type of investigation is critically dependent on the
availability of very detailed and "clean" spectra (i.e., very high spectral
resolution and excellent signal-to-noise ratio). This is a great
observational challenge and to date, only about five stars are known to
display the signatures of Lithium-6 in their spectra, cf. ESO PR 08/00.
In all cases, the measured isotopic abundance ratio is very small, with
6Li/7Li less than about 0.05. All of these stars are metal-poor and may
have retained some of their initial Lithium-6, see above.

Until now, no convincing detection of Lithium-6 has ever been made in a
metal-rich, solar-type star.

The UVES spectrograph at the 8.2-m VLT KUEYEN telescope is perfectly suited
for this kind of study. Three high-resolution spectra of HD 82943 were
obtained in June 2000 that show a significant asymmetry in the Lithium-7
absorption line, cf. PR Photo 17/01. After a careful analysis, this
asymmetry is confirmed as the spectral signature of Lithium-6 atoms. The
observed abundance ratio is 6Li/7Li = 0.12. This is unusually high when
compared to the detections in metal-poor stars and is in fact more
compatible with the value of 0.08, observed in solar-system meteorites!

HD 82943 has swallowed a planet

The astronomers believe they know the answer: "The simplest and most
convincing way to explain this observation is that one or more planets,
or at least planetary material, have fallen into the star, sometime after
it passed through its early evolutionary stage", says Nuno Santos of the
Geneva Observatory.

Garik Israelian of Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias adds: "One may also
try to determine the quantity of material needed to explain the observed
isotopic ratio of 0.12. Based on the mass estimate of the star HD 82943 and
the known Lithium-6 content of meteorites, it appears that the star has
swallowed the equivalent of a giant planet with twice the mass of Jupiter".
If the unlucky planet were of the terrestrial type, in which the relative
Lithium-6 content is higher, it would have had a mass of about three times
the mass of the Earth.

The observational search for Lithium-6 in other stars with planetary systems
now continues. In due time, it will permit to better understand the
formation and evolution of the newly discovered exoplanets. In particular,
it will demonstrate whether the fall of planets into their host stars is a
common process or not.

More information

Further detailed information is available in the research article ("Evidence
for planet engulfment by the star HD 82943", by G. Israelian, N.C. Santos,
M. Mayor and R. Rebolo), published in the May 10, 2001, issue of the
international research journal Nature.

Notes

[1] The team consists of Garik Israelian and Rafael Rebolo (Instituto de
Astrofisica de Canarias, Spain), Nuno C. Santos and Michel Mayor (Geneva
Observatory, Switzerland).

[2] The nuclei of Lithium-6 (6Li) atoms consist of three protons and three
neutrons; those of Lithium-7 (7Li) have three protons and four neutrons.
Both isotopes were produced during the Big Bang and in spallation reactions
in the interstellar medium.

[3] According to the "traditional" view, giant planets like Jupiter would
be formed by rapidly accelerating ("runaway") accretion of gas around an
initial, icy "planetesimal" with a mass of about 10 Earth masses. An
associated prediction was that giant planets would only be found at a
distance of at least 750 million kilometres (5 Astronomical Units; or five
times the distance between the Earth and the Sun) from their host stars and
that their orbits would be circular, like the orbits of the planets in the
Solar System.

Technical information about the photo

PR Photo 17/01 shows the spectrum of the V = 6.5 mag star HD 82943, as
obtained on June 7, 2001, with the UVES spectrograph at the 8.2-m VLT KUEYEN
telescope. It is based on three exposures made with Image Slicer 3 in
Director's Discretionary Time in Service Mode, and each lasting 120 sec.
The spectral resolution is 110,000 and the final S/N-ratio is about 500.

Indeed, I do think that, at its heart, Western science's quest for "one true
equation" underlying everything can be directly derived from Judeochristian
religion with its "one true god."

Perhaps the universe is not actually structured such that there is one
compact pattern that explains everything, either in the domain of spiritual
experience or in the domain of physical law.  Perhaps there are multiple
overlapping patterns....  This is how it seems right now in the physics
domain -- quantum theory and general relativity being examples of deep,
overlapping, difficult-to-unify patterns -- but we, our archetypal view
being the Judeochristian "one true law" approach, persist in believing there
MUST be an elegant underlying unifying equation....  Perhaps the one who
creates the next great physics theory will be an AI who lacks this bias!!

I think that both cultural relativism and "absolute truthism" (to coin a
phrase to characterize the opposite extreme) can be used in good or bad
ways.  [Yes, I'm aware that the notions of "good" and "bad" in the previous
sentence can be interpreted in either a culturally relative or an absolutist
way.  I believe that sentence is true under BOTH interpretations.]

You know that classic picture that looks like either a vase or a pair of
faces, depending on how you look at it.  Or the Necker cube, which can look
like it's pointing in, or out.  Perhaps reality is like this in some
respects, but with vastly more than two complementary views.  One can make a
mathematical argument in this regard, though I don't have time to do so
right now.

I agree that some of the advocates of cultural relativism are habitual
abusers of the notion.  On the other hand, so are some of the advocates of
absolute truthism.

For instance, it seems extreme to me to claim that music from all different
cultures can be "compared" in some way, so that the best Chinese opera can
be judged objectively against the best Western opera. Yet, within a single
culture, comparison is much easier -- there's something close to a consensus
about which Western operas are great and which are not, and which Chinese
operas are great and which are not.  Traditionally, adherents of absolute
truthism claimed that Western  music was intrinsically superior to all other
forms of music, which were somehow primitive and intrinsically inharmonious.
Actually, to a large extent, these critics just had culturally-biased
"ears".  On the other hand, it also seems extreme to me to claim that all
forms of music are equally good -- some cultures, for instance, really ARE
(in my intuition, and overall cross-cultural human consensus) more musically
prodigous than others.

Real truth seems to be an interesting mix of absolutism and relativism;
either extreme attitude is an unproductive one.
I think that a mix of absolutism and relativism is best.  Funnily enough,
this is what most humans have evolved to profess.

Sure.  I was assuming that our "default person" had made the consensus
decision to vote for a candidate who had a plausible chance of winning.

I myself didn't make that consensus decision; I voted Green in the last
Presidential election, whereas my mom voted Democrat and my dad voted
Communist, just for the hell of it, because he wanted to vote for Bush but
his wife threatened to kill him if he did ;>

It's no individual's opinion, but it may be a mass nonlinear superposition
of many peoples' opinions.

The "physical world" itself may be this, actually.  This is the direction in
which quantum gravity leads us.

I find the following a typical bizarre pseudo-argument.

===========

There appears to be little fear that human cloning will have a significant
effect in sport. If say, Michael Johnson were cloned, the result would
almost certainly not be the same world record-setter as the original,
researchers say, because environmental, nutritional and motivational
factors also play significant roles in developing athletes.

"If I'm the clone of Michael Johnson, I've got to bend myself into all
sorts of shapes to run, because genetically that's what I'm destined to
be," Dr. Friedmann said. "I run and run and run, and I can't ever get
anywhere. Then what am I? I'm a Michael Johnson who can't run. That's a
nobody. That must be a crushing experience to
learn you're not what you're genetically destined to be."

===================

I agree with the general moral sentiment, and that cloning will seldom
yield a xerox copy, partly due to stochastic developmental cascades, party
because of the factors listed in the 1st par. BUT having allowed this, how
likely is the scenario in the 2nd? From infancy you are given this (perhaps
soul-destroying) enhanced environment to make you MJ Mark II, and even so
you *can't ever get anywhere. Then what am I?* What indeed? A proof that
god intervenes deliberately to turn one twin into a nebbish just to spite
impious cloners? This is question-begging of a remarkable order, I reckon.

It might be true of an Einstein, of course, since it's surely harder to
replicate the unknowable experiences of a genius, and the multiple genes
involved in creative intelligence presumably offer vastly more stochastic
pathways to go haring off in different ways.

Of course, the whole point of Wright's book is that, while events
such as the Ming turn toward isolationism may have sucked for the Chinese,
they don't make a dent in the envelope of cultural evolution -- in the
case of China's abandonment of progress, it just meant that the locus of activity
representing the leading edge of the envelope shifted elsewhere (to western Europe).

Wright's position is, of course, an **extremely** controversial one.
Most mainstream historians (so I've heard) still react to the idea that
history has a "direction" the same way that Stephen Jay Gould reacts
to the suggestion that evolution has a direction -- with an intimidating,
loud, and dismissive snort.  But the whole notion of exponential technological
progress leading to the Singularity, of which Ray Kurzweil seems now to have
emerged as the most publicly-visible exponent and champion, is simply
an intensification of this idea of "directed history" as described by Wright
in _Nonzero_.

However, the notion that no one polity or government has the power
to halt the global trend has also appeared in responses to Bill Joy's
call for "relinquishment" -- if it doesn't happen here, or in the
open, that just means it'll happen elsewhere, or in secret.  This view
appears, for example, in Eliezer's remark "Maybe refusing to develop AI today
sounds vaguely plausible, but are you really going to keep the moratorium
going for a thousand years? For a million years? ... The possibility of
superintelligence seems to be practically built into the structure of the
Universe as something that we have to confront eventually." (in "The Path to
Survival", on the Web page of responses to Bill Joy at

The best Chinese history I've read recently is "The Search for Modern China", 
by Jonathan D. Spence.  Spence picks up the thread of Chinese history at a 
point later than we're discussing, in the "high Ching" period, but does talk 
a little about the Ming antecedents of the Confucian orthodoxy that reigned 
supreme in the high Ching.  He also provides a quick sketch of the senescence 
of Ming institutions that led to the successful Manchurian invasion of North 
China that gave rise to the Ching dynasty.  

Over-all, the book is very well written and an excellent introduction to the 
compelling story of China's initial exposure and reaction to the swiftly 
modernizing West, a subject of interest to extropians because that story 
provides insight into the nature of Western modernism through the contrasting 
case of China during the period when the ideals of the Enlightenment were 
transforming Europe, America and Anglic Asia.

Here's a private exchange I had this morning with a friend of considerably 
"pinker" political sentiments than me:

Fuel cell tech is much more likely to see significant implementation and 
further development over the next few years than solar photovoltaic did in 
the 1980s and 90s for a few very good reasons:

1.  The technology is much closer to being practicable on scales that are 
meaningful for real-world applications at many scales than photovoltaic was 
in 1980, 1990 or even 2000.

2.  Fuel cells scale to many different kinds of applications, from powering 
wristwatches and notebook computers, to households and cars.  Solar 
photovoltaic is still nowhere near such a level of development.  Further, the 
defense R&D establishment has a MAJOR application crying out for fuel cells, 
which is the powering of man-portable systems (i.e. the Starship Troopers 
initiatives that are getting a LOT of attention these days).

3.  Despite the fact that hydrocarbon fuels are still plentiful, we're seeing 
some artificially created "energy crises" in places like California and 
Europe.  These crises could be addressed quickly with technologies that are 
currently well understood and are relatively friendly to the environment, but 
the sausage grinder of legislation and regulation in these places is likely 
to continue to make a hash of energy policy for quite some time to come.  
Small-scale fuel cell generators offer individuals, small groups and 
enterprises a way to sidestep the still heavily-regulated power grid and 
solve an immediate problem: keeping the lights on.  This real current demand 
is IMMENSE and very well may drive development of fuel cells over the finish 
line to real products very quickly.

First, your question is based on the incorrect assumption that a fuel cell 
SYSTEM requires pure hydrogen as a fuel.  Many of the systems about to hit 
the market contain fuel reformer elements that allow them to run on natural 
gas.  Thus, the near-term goal is to be able to buy a reasonably-priced 
appliance to which you can connect existing gas lines to your home or 
business.  While these systems do produce carbon dioxide as a by-product, the 
net effluent of this waste gas is no more than what a central generating 
plant would exhaust to produce an equivalent amount of power and may well be 
less, given the higher efficiency of a catalytic fuel reformer over a 
combustion process, even the relatively clean combustion in a gas turbine.  
Furthermore and very important, the exhaust from a natural gas-powered fuel 
cell system doesn't contain the many trace gasses that arise as combustion 
by-products, especially NOx.  Beyond this, of course, the other by-product of 
a fuel cell, chemically pure H2O, would be an ecological boon to 
water-strapped areas.

Beyond this, I don't disagree that we should and likely will see 
implementation of fuel cell technology on large scales as well as small 
scales.  I'm an advocate of small-scale implementation for social and 
political reasons as much as technological ones.  Competition from 
small-scale applications can only make the main power-grid system operators 
and regulators wake up and take notice.  For 125 years they've held a 
pampered, protected place in our industrial ecology and it's time they felt a 
little real pressure from another way of doing things.

I actually think a MJ II would likely become a better runner than MJ I
because of environmental factors; from childhood, his parents would interest
him in running, give him the best coaches, etc. because they would know that
under the proper conditions he would become a great runner. There could
always be accidents -- including genetic ones -- to prevent him from
reaching his predecessors' excellence but I bet that more than 50% of MJ
clones would be better than MJ himself in running.

1) It is a well known fact that the QWERTY layout was specifically
designed to minimize the problem of common consecutive keystrokes
locking up a mechanical typewriter. In other words, it has a built
in governor.

2) last time I checked the speed records for typing were held by
persons using Dvorak keyboards.

3) I use a standard QWERTY keyboard because that's what came with
the machine, and I don't type fast enough for it to make a
difference (60 words a minute tops.)

<snip some good reasons from Greg>

Also, the efficiencies of fuels cells do not change significantly with
scale, transmission lines are a significant drain on efficiency, and local
installation makes the use of cell waste heat (for water and space
heating) more practical. 

On the down side, it is probably only possible to sequester CO2 at large
central power stations, should this prove necessary for global warming
reasons.  The jury is still out on that one...

This makes no sense to me. Differential equations are one of the main
mathematical handles for linear and nonlinear physics, as well as for
every other physical approximation that I'm familiar with.  Even if
your differential equations computes into a coupled system of a
million-by-million eigenvalue matrix, the mathematical formulation of
your differential equations is still valid.

Are you maybe mixing "continuous" and "discrete" ??

Spike, I was raised fundie Christian.  And as you know if you didn't tow the 
line (repent, accept Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, etc., etc.) 
your chances of eternal damnation were 100%.  What I meant above was that 
there is only a 50% chance (at best) that that theology is accurate.

:



Do you have any sourcces you can point me to on the conservatising cultural
innovations of the Ming or the sources of Sung technical dynamism?

Most of the work was originally done in specialist journals but recently it
has been making its way into more accessible publications. There is a brief
but suggestive survey in Peter Jay: Road to Riches or The Wealth of Man
(London, 2000; Weidenfield & Nicolson) pp 93-104. Two more excellent recent
works are Kenneth Pomeranz: The Great Divergence (Princeton, 2000) - it's
worth having a look at the excellent reviews of this book on Amazon- and
Timothy Brook: The Confusions of Pleasure (University of California 1999),
this one looks at the cultural roots of the policies of the Ming. I'd also
recommend Gang Deng: The Pre-Modern Chinese Economy (London, 1999;
Routledge) , John Merson: Roads to Xanadu: East and West in the Making of
the Modern World (London, 1989; Weidenfield and Nicolson) and Mark Elvin:
The Pattern of the Chinese Past (London, 1973; Eyre Methuen) - I have
problems with some of his arguments but the book is full of otherwise hard
to get information. On technology there's Joseph Needham's monumental work.
Interesting that you did work on the military weakness of the Sung, that's
another very interesting story

CO2 reduction emission is not the primary goal of fuel cell use (though it
of course occurs due to use of more hydrogen-rich fuel, higher efficiences
of operation, no transport losses, heat/power coupling and synergism with
other promising technologies such a photovoltaics and solar hydrogen).

Right now fuel cells would reduce emissions and make the power grid more
reliable, which are sufficient reasons to push their use at least in
California.  Simultaneously, photovoltaics should be considered to augment
peak demand for air conditioning, and otherwise be used to sell power back
to the grid or used for local water electrolysis.

hmm.. "enantiomeric" 

enantiomer Chemistry.  Either of two molecules of the same chemical
composition that are mirror images of each other but not identical,
such as one of a pair of optical isomers containing chiral carbon
atoms. (from Academic Press Dictionary of Science and Technology)

Got it. Thanks 'gene. I won't ask how you calculated "just a few
percent".

Yes ... the panspermia basic assumptions are suspect.

This is very interesting for me. I haven't read Wright's book but I am
familiar with that line of thought. I am very sceptical of the strong
teleological model which sees History as the inevitable unfolding of an
inherent neccessity, both because I reject the philosophical basis for most
such models and because I think the empirical evidence contradicts it. So I
am not keen on the idea of History as leading inevitably up to
Singularity/Communism/the Second Coming/Liberal Democracy or whatever. I am
much more sympathetic to a weaker form which says that certain developments
are not inevitable but if they do occurr they become very difficult to stop
or reverse. So, human beings remained hunter-gatherers for a long time and
it was not inevitable that they would discover agriculture but once they had
the spread of agriculture and other institutions such as money, trade,
cities and government (and religion?) was inevitable and ultimately
unstoppable. This implies that the appearance of a technologically
innovative civilisation was a matter of chance but, now that it has
happened, it's unavoidable and irreversible.
 However I would make one caveat: My personal view is that historically,
after agriculture comes along, there a series of levels of social
organisation/technological development which we can think of as equilibrium
points. There are several examples of a society suddenly and
catastrophically collapsing from one equilibrium to a lower one. This
involves a marked diminution in division of labour, much less trade, more
local self sufficiency, reduced urbanisation, less literacy/numeracy and a
decline in the use of a whole range of technologies even when, as often
happens, the knowledge of the technology remains. The best known case is the
collapse of classical civilisation in the 5th/6th centuries but the most
spectacular is the sudden demise of Mayan civilisation. So I wouldn't assume
nothing can go wrong. I'm not worried by kooks like Zerzan as much as
selfish and short sighted elites - they are more dangerous because they have
the power!

As I understand it predestination says that even if you do toe the line you
still have a good chance of being one of the damned - after all God decided

Hi Max,

I remember you well, I have actually followed what you've been up to over
the years partly through the web, partly through mutual acquaintances (I met
some when I was at IHS about 10-11 years ago). I would love to come to
Extro-5 but I'm all tied up right now until the end of June with exam
marking :(. (There are consolations to that - I had a student today tell me
how Jeremy Bentham is the distinguished prefessor of History at University
College London! He also thought John Locke was a 19th century philosopher!).
I am over in California later on in the Summer so I'll call you then.

Cheers

Steve

Dvorak doesn't require a special keyboard; you just download a Dvorak
keyboard and drag it into your system folder (MacOS) or go to "Properties"
in the "Language" panel in the "Keyboard" control panel (Win).

Besides which, it's not the typing speed, it's the effort.

What do you think of the recent paper in Science claiming these major
collapses of civilization were linked to major detrimental climactic change?
(usually extended droughts, IIRC)

It is always possible to *DEFINE* some alknowing "God" that would know
our destiny beforehand (or rather, intemporally).
But this is utterly irrelevant, in as much as we don't possess the same
information as God, and must act according to whatever information WE have.
What's amazing is how this relativity of point of view (which is not quite
the same as relativism) is completely missed by most people who debate about
such issues as predestination and determinism, or morality or economics in
general.

I can't disagree with that. However, I was using the word "practical" in a
conversational way. It, too, has a commonly understood meaning that has nothing
to do with what you or I think.

Well, sure. But again, I was only being conversational, using common language. I
wasn't really interested in its relevance to empirical rationalism. This is
something you've tacked on.

It was my decision to construct my post in the way I did. I had no interest
beyond that. My goal was to respond in a converstational manner to something
someone else had said, to agree by making my own perspective known. I'm sure it
could have been "phrased in a meaningful, positively informative way," but that
was not my goal.

I wasn't trying to be concise. I was being conversational. This assumes that if
someone is interested in hearing (or reading) what I have to say, they can. If
not, they can use the delete key. I wasn't interested in converting or
enlightening anyone--I was just putting in my 2 cents.

I'm definitely not interesting in a "win." How boring and archaic.

In conversation there is no correct or incorrect form. Conversation is
self-expression. If I were engaged in a debate or were writing a scientific
paper, this might apply, but not in this case. Of course, one person's "correct"
may not be another's. This seems highly subjective and is uninteresting to me.


> But as you can see, this time you thought you won,

Since I never claimed to have "won" anything, and since I have now stated that I
have no interest in winning, your statement is nonsensical. If this is the
perspective you operate from, fine. Please don't attempt to apply it to me. It's
a waste of everyone's time.

Since you're the only person who has complained, this argument is specious.
Again, if you don't like my post, please delete it. I do it all the time.

My choice was my choice. Right and wrong don't enter into it. This is ludicrous.

You're welcome, I suppose. To me this has now become a waste of time and is
boring. It appears our needs are different, as well as our styles.

Any reasonable person would likely disagree with you.

I think that attacking is a useless and unproductive way to discuss anything, and
reveals an immaturity on the part of the attacker. I can speak from personal
experience on this one.

An interesting proposal, but unworthy of consideration. Aggression and
lack-of-precision are not equitable. Aggression is destructive (entropic) and
harmful, while lack-of-precision (at least in this case) is, at worst, ignorable.
So, please, feel free to ignore it.

I'm responsible to my boss (have to do what he says, have to show up at
prescribed times, must perform work), to the government (don't like this one, but
must pay taxes, must obey laws, etc.), to my family (I like this one, but must
help provide for, must spend time with). These are all obligations of various
types, which could be shirked if I chose to (with varying consequences). I'm not
really an expert on this, so you may want to explore this on your own. I'm simply
speaking from personal experience.

Okay. Sure. Whatever. (Yawn.)

You have it reversed. I am "responsible for" what I post here because it is
something I am in charge of. No one else is doing it for me, and my posts won't
appear here unless I do them. Maybe this is colloquial use of the word that is
unfamiliar to you. Since it is part of my conversational vocabulary, and since
I'm not a linguist, I really don't know. (Can anyone help with this?) Since I
have no obligation to post here, the "responsible to" term doesn't apply. If
you're suggesting that I am somehow obligated to construct my responses in such a
way that is agreeable to you or anyone else, then I will have to disagree with
you. Again, this is what the delete key is for. Since I'm not interested in
converting or convincing you or anyone else of anything I say, then this is
doubly obvious. If you don't like it, don't read it.

Besides a simple keymapping utility change there is the matter of
the physical keyboard layout, apparently you are just memorizing
the new layout (security through obscurity? ;) ). One of my former
co-workers spent an afternoon once prying off the keys on his IBM
keyboard and placing them in their new (Dvorak) locations.

That's not a good thing, the keys are subtly angled to reflect their
(current) locations.  I'm just memorizing the new layout.  If one has
trouble with this, just buy a set of temporary key caps or print out a map
and keep it nearby.  If you're looking at the keys while you type, that's
already a bad habit, and Dvorak is a good way to break it.

Legend has it that Dvorak is more effective than any password at
preventing unauthorized use of one's computer, but I rather doubt it,
unless the would-be system breaker doesn't know where the Keyboards
control panel is.

> >Besides which, it's not the typing speed, it's the effort.

Not necessarily.  I know that the limiting speed of my own typing is more
often thought speed than typing speed - certainly for stuff like "Friendly
AI", less so for code.  I don't really try to push my speed all that often
- in fact, I'm trying to push it right now and it's an interesting
experience - I just type at an ordinary relaxed rate.  Dvorak is certainly
much more relaxing if that's what you're doing, and it's also possible to
push yourself without breaking your fingers in half.

You just said the Better Ways work together.  The Better Way of Unix doesn't
have a Keyboards control panel.  Well, some Linux desktops might.  If I turned
off the virtual consoles on my OpenBSD system, then haha, good luck getting
anything done without a keyboard.  

Although X cut-paste can get you pretty far, actually.  Mostly I'm pointing
out a seeming break in your Iconoclasm.

4-5 years ago, when the list was in another period of angst about its own
quality, I noted that there were people whose posts I almost always enjoyed
reading, and then there were all the others (sometimes good posts, sometimes
flaming; good posts on topics I didn't care about; down to /dev/null bait.)  

Feeling overwhelmed by volume, I had procmail put mail from the first group
into a separate mailbox from the rest of the list, and took to reading that,
occasionally dipping into the main mailbox.

Then, at Robin's suggestion, I offered to send a digest of that filtered
mailbox to people, and some people liked it, and apparently still do.  So I
offer it again.  

I do not claim to be offering an objective take on the cream of the list,
merely posts from the people I personally find interesting.  The sole claim to
possible public interest in this is that some people, including some of the
ones I select, have liked my taste in people.

I also cannot guarantee regular service, although I've been pretty good in the
last two weeks, and when I'm on the ball the digest is sorted, pruned, and
sometimes has interesting posts from the main list.

A proper subset of selected people: Robin Hanson, Greg Burch, Max More, Hal
Finney, Amara Graps, Anders Sandberg, Sasha Chislenko (oops, should remove
that), me, and the not-me from Australia.

There's no automatic subscription address, just me.  If you reply to the list
I'll laugh at you.  If you reply to the digest messages you'd end up writing
me; I don't think anyone's been dumb enough to do that by accident in the last
4-5 years, impressively enough.  Possibly because anyone subscribing has
basically given up on active participation.

Caveat subscribor.

Ben, don't assume that because there's a single word, "Judeo-Christian",
that Judaism and Christianity have the same basic pattern.  They're more
alike than, say, Islam and Buddhism, but they aren't the same.

One of the strongest driving causes behind my original break with Judaism
was when my teachers and parents tried to explain to me that two ancient
rabbis making contradictory statements could be "both right" and that
"you'll understand when you're older".  The original cause of my break
with orthodoxy was at age five, when they tried to explain that you didn't
have to understand the words in order to pray.  Even at that age - before
I had even begun to formulate abstract concepts about relative
trustworthiness - I was basically sure that I was right and they were
wrong.  But people trying to explain to me that two contradictory
statements could be "both right" was when I started to totally distrust
the *system*.

One of the reasons why I have confidence - too much confidence, you would
undoubtedly say - is that from the very beginning of my life I have
refused to compromise with blatant nonsense and I have so far always
turned out to be right, even as a five-year-old opposing my parents, my
teachers, an entire community of adults and a thousand-year-old
tradition.  Maybe you would chalk that down as another problem caused by
religion - getting away with breaking with it makes you overconfident -
except that, as I understand the pattern, people usually accept what
they're told when they're young and reject it only in the course of
growing up, with great stress.  I simply never accepted the really dumb
ideas to begin with, and I'm proud of that.  So maybe it's not just a
fortunate coincidence.  To phrase it in Hansonian Bayes-speak, maybe a
refusal to compromise in the face of social pressure is a powerful enough
factor that it licenses one five-year-old reasoner to maintain his own
opinion in the face of the disagreement of his entire social universe -
because the independent intelligence of one five-year-old Eliezer is
closer to rationality than the forces that underlie memes.

I don't think there must be an elegant underlying unifying equation.  I
think there's very probably an underlying equation or underlying cellular
automaton or underlying something, but our civilization is too young to
make pronouncements about that.  Cultural relativism, though, exists for
memetic reasons, not because someone examined the ultimate underlying laws
of physics.  The idea that there could be "more than one truth" is a
social and memetic event, used to avoid unpleasant disagreements, not a
theory of physics.

The reason why physics searches for one unifying equation is simple:  The
last generation of physicists got away with it.  Maybe it won't work for
the next step beyond relativity and quantum mechanics; maybe we've reached
the point where the Universe has complex structure rather than simple
structure.  I, for one, think that string theory is but sheer bogosity.

Incidentally, aren't you the person who insists that intelligence has an
equation, and aren't I the person who insists that the
hundred-trillion-synapse problem is as mathematically intractable as the
three-body problem?

As a general rule, I'd be careful in stating that the search for truth is
a religious concept.  Religious concepts exist for reasons.  The drive to
discover truth is innate and hardwired.  Religions insist that they are
objective truth in order to take advantage of our evolved drive to believe
objectively true things.  Cultural relativists who argue over whether
tigers are "really" dangerous get eaten.

Here, again, we see the standard argument for cultural relativism:  "A
said that [totally arbitrary cultural construct 1] was objectively true,
but B said that [totally arbitrary cultural construct 2] was objectively
true, and there's no way to decide between them; therefore, there must be
no such thing as objective truth."  A truthist would simply say that A and
B are both wrong and that they both mistakenly believe their personal
preferences to be objective truth.  It doesn't mean that objective truth
is nonexistent, just that humans are evolved to sometimes try and state
that something subjective is really objective, in order to give it greater
memetic potential.  What possible bearing could that have on whether
underlying reality is subjective or objective?

> truth.

Suppose I didn't have one.  Would that prove there was no truth?  Anyway,
there's a rough definition of the Consensus in:

http://singinst.org/CaTAI/mind/consensus.html

> >Science isn't somebody's opinion.
> 
> It's no individual's opinion, but it may be a mass nonlinear superposition
> of many peoples' opinions.

Describe it as a mass nonlinear superposition of many peoples'
*convergent* opinions, where the thing converged *to* is actual reality,
and you've just reinvented the idea of the Consensus.  All our ideas are
ultimately subjective, in the sense that they exist in our brains rather
than underlying reality.  But there is *still* an underlying reality, and
in some cases the ideas are very tightly bound.  You cannot "say whatever
you want" and be "just as right, ultimately" because that violates the
binding - the sensory, predictive, and manipulative binding that is the
reason why intelligence exists in the first place.  The Consensus is
nearly as unforgiving as physical reality; it is not 100% right, but it is
99.99% right, and the instant you cross the line you get eaten by one of
those subjectively "dangerous" tigers.

This precise, unforgiving binding is what we call "truth".  The stuff
truths are bound to is what we call "reality".  Within the Consensus, a
"subjective" issue is one that is roughly arbitrary in the sense of being
determined primarily by initial values, with little or no convergence; an
issue that is determined primarily by reference to the initial settings of
internal cognitive values.  An "objective" issue is one settled primarily
by reference to external reality and therefore convergent.  Cultural
relativism consists of arguing that since some subjective issues were
claimed to be objective, nothing is objective and everything is true.  A
truthist would simply say that the claimants were WRONG.

I was going to mention earlier that in my case it also has to do
with "I don't often think that fast". I learned to type on a manual
Royal 440.

I took speed reading when I was younger, and soon ran into the
problem with comprehending difficult material. I was at a party one
time (my place) and someone was bragging that he could speed read
anything.... I handed him a copy of R. Buckminster Fuller's
"Synergetics, Volume 1". 

I won the bet.

My earlier experiences with speed reading led to one of my favorite
slogans. "Anything that can be speed read, should be....."

Good location to download a MacOS Dvorak keyboard - I believe the Dvorak
typing course at
  http://www.karelia.com/abcd/
has a link to one, although apparently the newer MacOSes have one built-in
already.

Speaking of which, a good place to find a Dvorak typing course is:

Karl Svozil wrote [in Randomness and Undecidability in Physics, World
Scientific publ., Singapore, 1993] that:

 "chaos in physics corresponds to randomness in mathematics, 
and randomness in physics may correspond to uncomputability 
in mathematics".

And the reason may be found: a random sequence cannot be computed;
it is only possible to approximate it (sometimes very crudely).

Strong Determinism vs. Computability
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9412004
Are minds subject to laws of physics? 
Are the laws of physics computable? 
Are conscious thought processes computable?
Currently there is little agreement as to what are the right answers to these 
questions. Penrose goes one step further and asserts that: "a radical new 
theory is indeed needed, and I am suggesting, moreover, that this theory, 
when it is found, will be of an essentially non-computational character.". 
The aim of this paper is three fold: 1) to examine the incompatibility between 
the hypothesis of strong determinism and computability, 2) to give new 
examples of uncomputable physical laws, and 3) to discuss the relevance 
of Goedel's Incompleteness Theorem in refuting the claim that an algorithmic
theory---like strong AI---can provide an adequate theory of mind. Finally, we 
question the adequacy of the theory of computation to discuss physical laws 
and thought processes.

The flaw in your argument is that the mathematician is obligated to
entertain no hypotheses concerning the procedure by which the parent
determined the truth or falsity of the statement "one of my children
is a girl".  The only thing that matters is whether the statement is
true.  It's not the case that the father is saying "I have picked...".

The mathematician's sample space in this case consists firstly of
all parents in the universe, then that set restricted to all parents
having two children, and then finally that set in turn restricted to
all parents who have two children one of whom is a girl. If the
mathematician then assumes that each such parent in the universe
has an equal chance of being the particular parent in question,
it follows that in two cases out of three the parent's other
child will be a boy.

It may help to consider that from the mathematician's perspective
there are actually three types of parents, not four.  There are
those with two girls, those with a girl and boy each, and those
with two boys.  It can be misleading to think that there are four
cases, namely GG, GB, BG, and BB, because one is then tempted to
infer some sort of order (although many people do go on from that
analysis to obtain the correct solution).
 
Of the three actual kinds, their weights are 1/4, 1/2, and 1/4 
respectively. Since the last case has been excluded, it follows
that the probability is 2 in 3 that the mathematician is dealing
with a parent from the second category.  I've inflicted this
problem on numerous acquaintances since the time years ago
when I made it up.  But you have formatted the most substantial-
sounding objection I've heard.  Thanks for the critical thinking.

Lee,

I don't think your word problems provide the necessary priors.  To
estimate the probabilities, I would need to know the algorithms used by
each of the people making statements, and that information is not
provided.

For example, suppose that you're on a game show called "ExtroQuiz" and
there are three doors:  A, B, and C.  One door has a prize behind it.  You
pick door C.  The game show host opens up door A, and shows you that it's
empty.  What is the probability that the prize is behind door B?  Answer: 
0%.  Why?  Because the game show host *knows* the standard answer to this
riddle, *knows* that most Extropians will switch to B, and he opens A *if
and only if* the prize is actually behind C.

The "mathematician's daughters" is a much worse instance of the problem. 
If you know that the mathematician will say "At least one of my children
is a girl" for BG, GB, and GG, but say "At least one of my children is a
boy" only for BB, and the mathematician says "At least one of my children
is a girl", then the probability that the other child is a boy is 2/3.  If
you know that the mathematician will say "At least one is a girl" for GG,
"At least one is a boy" for BB, and pick a statement at random for BG and
GB, then the probability that the other child is a boy is 1/2.  I think
that most people unconsciously assume this kind of symmetry by default -
it seems, a priori, a more likely visualization of the underlying causes -
which is why most people return the allegedly "wrong" answer 1/2.  To
assume otherwise requires that one assume the mathematician has an
inherent bias towards naming girls, which is an odd thing to assume about
someone.  The above mixture of probabilities is exactly what results from
the mathematician picking one child at random and saying "At least one of
my children is an X", in which case the statement provides no information
about the second child.  Most people unconsciously assume that's what the
mathematician did, in which case the given answer, 1/2, is exactly
correct.

I've *always* felt that riddle had a problem; now, twelve years later, I
finally get to articulate it.

(In Lee Corbin's question as stated, I expect that the mathematician
hypothesizes the father to be symmetrical, rather than hypothesizing that
the father exhibits a feminine bias, and answers 1/2.)

We have since the days of the Bernoullis been formulating differential
equations to describe a lot of physical phenomena.  Whether it's heat
flow in solids (Fourier's big breakthrough) or cables hanging in
catenaries, using the language of mathematics to express infinitesimal
constraints has been extremely productive.  But it is only in this
arena, important as it is, that differential equations are of any use.

>Are you maybe mixing "continuous" and "discrete" ??

No.  Discrete mathematics is less amenable to this sort of "global"
technique.  Sure, there are difference equations in finite mathematics
that resemble differential equations, and we surely use algebra to
specify constraints.  But no one has ever seriously proposed, for
example, that solutions to chess problems might be facilitated by
equations.  Nor do quantitative equations illuminate axiomatic
developments.  And I hope that no one has tried to frame
"intelligence" in terms of differential equations.

In my original post of Thursday May 10, from which the above
quote was taken, I tried to explain more fully why computation,
which, since the days of Turing we've come more and more to see
as fundamentally discrete, can't be straitjacketed by differential
equations.  Its very nature, wonderfully and visually epitomized
by Conway's Life and other cellular autonoma, seems significantly
different.  The closest that I myself have come to capturing the
essential difference is what I mentioned yesterday in this thread,
namely that from a computational perspective, the myriads of intermediate
results necessary in the numerical solution of differential equations
are merely approximations to the mathematical truth.  But in iterative
calculations of this other kind, e.g., Life, chess, Turing machines,
and the disjointed details of our lives on Earth, the necessary
intermediate results **are** the "mathematical" truths themselves.

What? Your parents might have *lied to you*?! Wash your mouth out, you

I really can't see how you'd get a 0.5 probability, Zero. Wouldn't you need
to take account of all the other competing doctrines and sub-doctrines, at
least extant and possibly in the past (although I suppose any one true god
would not have allowed the one true faith to die out)? Mightn't you then
need to do some transform on that number, perhaps scaling it directly or
inversely (since the devil's option is always the most attractive) by the
number of adherents of each doctrine? Can't see how you'd get anything
remotely as high as 50:50.

It's an easy mistake to make. Isn't his clothed and seated body still on

Another way to illustrate why it is best to switch doors after Monte
opens one is by restating the game thus:  Monte offers you one of the
three doors, but before you choose, he writes a letter on a card and
places it face down.  This is the letter of a door that he knows has a
goat behind it.  He says that after you choose a door, which might be
the one he wrote, he will reveal the door written on the card.  That
illustration may help some to understand why its best to switch, assuming
one prize and two zonks.

Eliezer's contention is incorrect methinks.  If you choose C and it is a
zonk, Monte must open A, for he knows B is the prize.  If you choose
C and it has the prize, Monte can open either A or B, and then you
switch and get zonked.  So assuming Mr. Hall wishes to zonk you,
he can do so only if you originally chose the prize door, 1/3 chance.

This is a tricky game that illustrates how very poor is the human
brain for understanding stochastic processes.  The door switching
strategy holds only if Monte *always* opens a zonk door and
gives you a chance to switch.

Imagine the game is restated thus: you pick door C.  Then Monte
says "Eliezer, if I agree to reveal door B, will you switch to door A?"
Then one is left second guessing a possibly malevolent game host.

Since we are discussing probabilities and things that can easily
be calculated, heres one for you:  suppose you choose a number
randomly (x), you know that the probability of its being prime
is about 1/ln(x).  OK, suppose you pick two random primes and
multiply them together to get a composite C.  What is the probability
that C+2 is prime?  Is it still 1/ln(C+2) ?

The answer to this is not trivial, and it bears directly on the discussion
on page 87 of Damien's updated version of The Spike.  spike

Trouble with all this is that one can make contrary or maybe parallel
assertions and be no less wrong.

The drive to discover truth cannot possibly be innate and hardwired, since
survival in a hypercomplex world is best attained by pragmatic adjustments,
and hold the grand theory. We know for certain that human minds are very
bad at logic and reasoning (Johnson-Laird, Tversky and Kahneman, et al).

Some religions insist that their doctrines are objectively true in order to
take advantage of a local cultural preference for believing objectively
true things except when the local culture prefers to believe anything at
all that's convenient just at the moment.  

And especially:

Cultural anti-relativists who argue the other guy is full of shit gets
beaten savagely, shunned, left mateless and perhaps killed as a real pain
in the ass and know-all-know-nothing.

Sad but true (some of the time).

In this instance, where Monte's actions are fixed, *and the door he
reveals is predetermined*, the problem is equivalent to the
lightning-strike riddle that Lee asked.  The card he turns over may have
'C' written on it.  In this case, if he reveals 'A', there is no reason to
switch.

Who says that Monte *must* open a door?  If I choose C and it's a failure,
Monte can simply not open any doors at all.  He only has a logical
motivation to open a door, possibly causing a change in my actions, if he
wants me to switch; he only wants me to switch if C actually has the
prize.  Of course, if Monte realizes that I know this, and I have
correctly picked C, he will fake me out by showing me B.  This is why
Bayesian reasoners should never play zero-sum-games with each other.

I don't understand what you mean by this.  I would say that the drive to
believe true things is an emergent global property of individual cognitive
steps that are locally adaptive.  If you see a yellow tiger, you will
thereafter believe that tigers are yellow, and not that they are blue.  If
someone says that tigers are blue you'll say "What?" and walk away.  This
is not necessarily the result of an explicit hardwired Quest for Truth -
although there may well be one.  It is the result of the procedure we use
to determine, locally, which things we believe in.

> We know for certain that human minds are very
> bad at logic and reasoning (Johnson-Laird, Tversky and Kahneman, et al).

No; we know that human minds commit acts of reasoning that do not
correspond to formal logic.  Our "failure" on the Wason test is simply a
specialized form of reasoning that is more useful in the real world.

No, anti-relativists who don't choose their fights carefully get beaten
savagely.  Since the act of choosing *not* to say the truth is a local
benefit at a global expense, one should always strive to be just a little
less "pragmatic" than the people around you.

Nothing - just says "Is that your final answer?" in portentous tones, with
no accompanying demonstration or additional information.  He doesn't
*want* you to change your choice.

On ExtroQuiz, if you pick door C, and the prize is behind door B, apparently
the gameshow host does not open door A and show that it is empty. What,
then, does the host do instead?

...unless ve knows that contestants would know this, and thus take no
opening as a cue to switch (.5 chance vs. 0 chance of prize).  On
ExtroQuiz, the host knows that the contestants have done all the
second-guessing that matters, and thus know the host's algorithm (or
lack thereof).  Given that, how can the host act so as to minimize the
guest's chances of winning if:
a. the guest picks the prize door?
b. the guest picks a non-prize door?

If the host assumes that I will outguess ver, vis best strategy is to
decide in advance that ve will do nothing regardless of which choice I
make.  Any other strategy increases the amount of information I have
(we're assuming I've outguessed ver) and thereby increases my chance of
winning.

So, if he says "is that your final choice", you say "No, no, no", and choose
another door, 50% chance.

On the other hand, in this scenario, if he does show you another door, you
never switch.

Of course, in that second case it's probably not possible to know if you are
playing the normal or extro version...

<br>
<b>ABSTRACT<br>
</b>Because of accelerating technological progress, humankind may be
rapidly approaching a critical phase in its career. The prospects of
nanotech systems and machine intelligence present us with unprecedented
opportunities and risks. Our future, and whether we will have a future at
all, may well be determined by how these radically transforming
technologies are managed. A better understanding of the transition
dynamics from a human to a =93posthuman=94 society is needed in order to plo=
t
approaches that maximize the probability of a favorable outcome. Of
particular importance is to know where the pitfalls are: the ways in
which things could go disastrously wrong. While we have had long exposure
to various personal, local, or endurable global hazards, this paper
analyzes a rather recently emerging category: that of <i>existential
risks</i>. These are threats that endanger the survival of intelligent
life or that could ruin the potential of human civilization for all time
to come. Some of these threats are relatively well known while others
(including some of the gravest) have gone almost unrecognized.
Existential risks have a cluster of features that make ordinary risk
management ineffective. A clearer understanding of the threat picture
will enable us to formulate better strategies, and several implications
for policy and ethics are discussed.<br>

For me, this is one additional reason to focus on the 
physics-astronomy-cosmology manipulations of Extropian proposals and 
conjectures, understanding that if cryogenics or 21st century uploading 
really pays off, that would be fabulous. But unless we have these

http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_1326000/1326657.stm

Author Douglas Adams, who wrote The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, has 
died suddenly aged 49. 
Mr Adams died on Friday morning in Santa Barbara, California, following a 
heart attack, said his spokeswoman Sophie Astin. 

Adams's novel was turned into a BBC series 
The author became a household name when the cult science fiction novel was 
turned into a BBC TV series. 
Adams was born in Cambridge in 1952 and educated in Essex before returning to 
Cambridge to study at St John's College. 
His career included work as a radio and television writer and producer before 
his life was changed by the publication of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the 
Galaxy in 1979. 

Film

The satirical tale chronicled the journey of alien Ford Prefect and his human 
companion Arthur Dent throughout the universe after the destruction of Earth. 

It centred around the search for an answer to life, the universe, and 
everything - which turned out to be 42. 



Arthur Dent and Slartibartfast became cult figures
 
The novel went on to sell more than 14 million copies worldwide and was 
followed by the sequels The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, Life, the 
Universe and Everything and So Long and Thanks For All the Fish. 

In recent years the author had been working on a Hitchhiker's Guide movie. 

There was much speculation about who would play Arthur Dent, with Hugh 
Laurie, Rowan Atkinson, Jim Carrey, Ben Affleck and even Bruce Willis said to 
be in the running. 

Adams married Jane Belson in 1991 and had a daughter, Polly, in 1994.

LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE MAY 11 2001
MAY IS NATIONAL SKIN CANCER AWARENESS MONTH

May 7 was designated Melanoma Monday.  Melanoma Facts:  Melanoma is now
the seventh most common type of cancer in the United States.  Although the
US population increased 10% from 1980 to 1987, the number of melanomas
increased 83%.  Twenty-five percent of melanoma cases occur in people 39
years old or younger.  Melanoma is the most frequent cancer among women
aged 25 to 29 and the second most frequent among women aged 30 to 34.  The
death rate from melanoma has tripled in the past four decades.

IN THIS ISSUE, MAY 11 2001:

LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE:  Three hundred-fifty cancer treatments
await approval

PROTOCOLS:  Skin Aging, Cancer Surgery

FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK:  The Dream Cream, Solarmax

LIFE EXTENSION MAGAZINE COVER STORY:  What's wrong with the FDA


LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE:  Three hundred-fifty cancer treatments
await approval

Lack of participants in clinical trials has caused a delay in the approval
of new cancer therapies, and less options for people facing cancer.  More
effective and less toxic than their predecessors, new cancer treatments
have yet to complete the approval process due to a lack of  trial
volunteers. An estimation of less than three to five percent of cancer
patients participate in the trials, mostly due to lack of awareness of
their existence.

Robert L Comis MD is president of the Coalition of National Cancer
Cooperative Groups, a network of cancer clinical trial specialists.  He
announced, "Right now there are 350 new treatments out there ready to be
tested. If we're stuck at three to four percent of adult patients
participating in clinical trials, it will be years before these new
treatments are not only tested but become available once we show that
they're effective."

Clinical trials of cancer drugs involve giving the patient the current
best known treatment for a particular cancer, or giving cancer patients
the opportunity to try a new one. Patients receive leading-edge care
during the studies.  The drugs have already been screened for safety.
Ellen Stovall, president of the patient advocacy organization, the
National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, stated, "The most notable
misconception about clinical trials is that if you participate in a
clinical you're going to be a guinea pig, or that you are going to get a
'placebo,' or no treatment. The fact is both of those things are totally
incorrect."

For cancer patients for whom other therapies have failed, participation in
a clinical trial of a new therapy could offer renewed hope.   For a list
of some open clinical cancer trials, go to
http://www.cancertrialshelp.org/patient_caregiver/trial_list.html

PROTOCOL

Skin Aging

The sleep hormone (melatonin) and the antistress hormone (DHEA) are both
found in human skin. Both are converted to other entities with important
jobs to do.

Studies show that both DHEA and melatonin are absorbed by skin when
applied topically. A study from CHUL Research Center (in Canada) shows
that the activity of DHEA applied topically is 85-90% greater than when
taken orally (at least in rodents). No special carriers are needed to get
DHEA and melatonin into skin. A properly formulated topical preparation of
melatonin and DHEA will contain just enough hormone to benefit skin
without providing enough to escape into circulation.

DHEA has another important defense: it keeps chemical carcinogens from
binding to DNA. According to some very interesting rodent studies
conducted at Fels Research Institute and Temple University, cancers simply
can't get started if enough DHEA is present. If this research holds up in
humans, topically applied DHEA is an exciting prospect for skin cancer.

Avoidance of more than modest exposure to the sun's ultraviolet light is
critically important to protect the skin against the oxidizing effects of
solar radiation. Ultraviolet rays are categorized by wavelengths: UVA,
UVB, and UVC.  The ozone layer filters out the UVC and much of UVB rays,
but the ozone layer is not what it used to be, and it seems to have little
or no effect on UVA rays which make up 90% or more of the sun's radiation
that reaches the earth. Indeed it is exposure to UVA that causes most of
the photoaging damage: the premature wrinkles, loss of elasticity,
hyperpigmentation, and dry and leathery dull texture.

Rejuvenex with Advanced Vitamin C contains minimal sunscreen protection
(SPF-12), but ingredients such as vitamin C complex, vitamin E, ceraphyl
GA-D, vitamin A, and RNA do more to prevent and repair DNA damage than
even the strongest sunscreen.

The Dream Cream, also known as RejuveNight, contains all the antiaging
ingredients (including DHEA and melatonin) to help the skin repair, renew,
and revitalize itself. Although it was intended as an intensive night
recovery cream, it can be used any time. The precise DHEA amounts and
melatonin, together with associated factors, work specifically in the
epidermis of the skin, not transdermally. There is no sunscreen in the
Dream Cream, so if using it during the day in the sunlight, the user

Cancer Surgery

Scientists believe that a primary tumor sends chemicals to signal new
blood vessels to grow into itself, but at the same time also sends a
chemical signal that prevents other tumors from growing in other parts of
the body. Advanced biomedical technology has now pinpointed those signals,
and most scientists accept that the angiogenesis process (stimulation of
new blood vessel growth) regulates the growth of metastatic tumors.

Once the primary tumor is removed, there is nothing to stop other tumors
from growing elsewhere. That's why some cancer patients often get worse
after undergoing tumor removal.

In recent years, several drugs-including interferons, steroids, and
certain hormonal agents-have been developed to stop or slow angiogenesis.
In fact, at least 11 anti-angiogenic drugs are now in clinical trials and
three have proved effective enough to make it to final phase.

Some of the drugs, like endostatin, are derived from natural proteins,
while others are based on smaller molecules. Ironically, one promising
drug on trial now is thalidomide, which once was sold as a sedative which
caused notorious birth defects in the children of women who took it.

FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK

The Dream Cream

The Dream Cream contains DHEA and melatonin, both of which protect and
moisturize skin when applied topically. DHEA protects skin cells from
injury, particularly thermal injury, and improves blood vessel integrity
within the skin to help protect cells from oxidative damage. It softens
rough, dry skin for a moist, dewy look. Topical melatonin protects against
UV-induced skin damage and skin aging. Research from Zurich University in
Switzerland has demonstrated the benefits of melatonin as a potent free
radical scavenger in skin. According to Dr. Nichols Hall, it is during
slow-wave "delta sleep" that our body recovers from the stress and fatigue
of daily living. Since melatonin is secreted only at night, applying the
Dream Cream at bedtime will augment the rejuvenating ingredients your skin
needs to enhance its ability for repair, renewal and revitalization.

Solar Max

Formulated by Life Extension scientists Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw Solar
Max 17 is a waterproof and sweat resistant sunblock that is instantly
absorbed by the skin and provides the latest scientific protection without
that greasy messy feeling. Now you can get the UV protection you want
while moisturizing your skin to feel luxuriously smoother and softer.
Great for daily use during outdoor activities.

UV exposure from the sun causes skin damage. Regular use of sunscreens may
reduce the chance of skin damage, some types of skin cancer, premature
aging of the skin and harmful effects due to the sun.

LIFE EXTENSION MAGAZINE COVER STORY

Congressional committees and investigative journalists have exposed
massive incompetence, neglect and fraud at the FDA. In the Courts, the
agency continues to lose critical cases as Federal Judges rule that FDA
policies are blatantly unconstitutional.

In the article that begins on the next page, we reveal the most recent
defeats the FDA has suffered in the Federal Courts. We then follow with a
report that deals with FDA problems uncovered by Congressional committees
and investigative journalists.

For the past 21 years, The Life Extension Foundation has compiled evidence
indicating that the FDA is the number one cause of death in the United
States. The FDA causes Americans to die by:

Delaying the introduction of life saving therapies

Suppressing safe methods of preventing disease

Causing the price of drugs to be so high that some Americans do without

Denying Americans access to effective drugs approved in other countries

Intimidating those who develop innovative methods to prevent disease

Approving lethal prescription drugs that kill

Censoring medical information that would let consumers protect their health

Censoring medical information that would better educate doctors

Failing to protect the safety of our food

Misleading the public about scientific methods to increase longevity

A few days ago, I finished reading _Dinosaur Extinction and the End of an
Era: What the Fossils Say_ by J. David Archibald.  (This is part of
Columbia's "Critical Moments in Paleobiology and Earth History Series."
Another title in this series, which I enjoyed reading several years ago, is
_The Emergence of Animals: The Cambrian Breakthrough_ by Mark A. S.
McMenamin and Dianna L. Schulte McMenamin.  I plan to read more books in
this series.)  In it, Archibald takes on the bolide [asteroid or comet]
impact theory of extinction.

I admit, I have some problems with it.  What!?!  The usual way the scenario
is put, it's hard to believe anything above bugs and bacteria would survive.
There has to be a reason why crocodiles, mammals, lizards, toads, and birds
made it, but T. rex didn't.  A big asteroid hit would seem to be more
egalitarian in its affects, taking out all major groups -- not specifically
targeting nonavian dinosaurs.

He then presents marine regression as a major cause of extinction here.
Marine regression is -- you guessed it! -- the tide going out and not coming
back.  Archibald points out the myriads effects of sea level changes and how
this correlates well with the fossil evidence -- much better than an impact
or massive volcanism.

He thinks a mixture killed off the nonavian dinosaurs, including marine
regression, large scale volcanism, and -- you guessed it -- an impact.  It's
very well written and he goes through pains not only to explain the ideas,
but to show the shortcomings of his science, paleontology, and the fossil
record.

Anyone have any thoughts on this?

Cheers!

Just to let everybody know that I've decided I need
to cool my fevered brain by unplugging from the
crackle and sizzle of this all-too-addictive
conversation for a while.  I was brushing my teeth
this morning and saw smoke in the bathroom mirror --
it seemed to be coming out of my ears (;->).

Also, I desperately need to catch up on some of
the more mundane aspects of life -- like sleep, and
housework! (you just **can't** get decent robots
anymore!!).  And, I need to reverse the flow of
information for a while -- stop blathering, and
resume reading (for one thing, I've made promises
to folks on this very list to read this and that,
which I'll **never** get around to keeping if I
don't shut up).

I need to unsubscribe to avoid the temptation to
post "just one more" reply to this or that thread,
but I'll certainly still be reading my private
e-mail.

Cheers, everyone!

Mitch:

Thanks for the info. I recently lost a friend and teacher who had suffered three strokes in the last six months. It is
always tragic to lose a valued compatriot, and so it goes, regrettably.

Obligatory correction: "cryogenics" works just fine; people have been liquefying gases and refrigerating down close to
absolute zero for many many decades now. You can even buy liquefied gases at welding supply shops.

I think you mean "if cryonics...pays off".

The above groups all differ from dinos in that they 
can take refuge underground or underwater*.  If the 
earth was put on "bake" for 1 day, as one estimate of 
tecktite heat delivery has it, the dinos would indeed 
be all gone and the above groups still there.  

* it wasn't all birds.  Actually birds were almost
entirely wiped out.  Only one group of shore birds 
survived.  They then radiated to current bird niches.
The near-elimination of birds *may* have provided the
opportunity for bats to emerge.

I just heard yesterday of a discovery of a suspicious
carbon layer at the Triassic/Jurassic mass extinction
boundary.  An interesting point is that the end-
Cretaceous and end-Permian extinction match up with
*both* massive bolide impacts *and* bogglingly large
flood basalts.

I don't get that.  Sea level changes happen all the time.  I just saw
a palentologist talk about the 300-meter drop at the end of the Miocene
oscillation.  The graph of late Tertiary sea levels looks like the path
traced by a yoyo as its operator walks on uneven ground.

I was there for the presentation and I, literally, felt slightly sick to

You and our marvelous French extropian/cryonicist friend are exploring
what these phrases mean, and it was interesting to see how the ambiguity
derailed the discussion.  I agree with your first two examples, but not
the last one.  We would normally say that you are responsible **for** your
family (although maybe you DID mean something else?).

and then Neal correctly noted that Francois-Rene was misreading
what he meant by "responsible".  I'm not exactly sure what Francois-Rene
meant, but there is no doubt that the word in question is causing
confusion.  IN this case, "[advanced creatures] become responsible for
their own evolution" means roughly that they are in control of their
own evolution.  I'm finding it surprisingly difficult to be precise,
here, and really can't improve much on what Neal then wrote:

Alas, there is only one solution to this quagmire that I know of.
When one begins to sense that any word or phrase is causing trouble,
then one simply stops using it, at least for a while.

You're expressing how a statistician would answer.  The father
didn't take the problem to a statistician, or to any sensible
person.  He asked the question of a mathematician who plays
by rules that I discoursed upon in my last post.  Any math
textbook is riddled by problems that would appear equally 
problematic from the viewpoint you are advocating.

Then Eliezer brings up what is apparently a distinct problem:

>The "mathematician's daughters" is a much worse instance of the problem. 

Okay, so now the subsets go as follows (I'm still following the
procedures used by mathematicians):  The set of all parents is
reduced all the way down to the set of mathematicians with two
children (at least) one of whom is a girl.

>If you know that the mathematician will say "At least one of my children
>is a girl" for BG, GB, and GG, but say "At least one of my children is a
>boy" only for BB, and the mathematician says "At least one of my children
>is a girl", then the probability that the other child is a boy is 2/3.  If
>you know that the mathematician will say "At least one is a girl" for GG,
>"At least one is a boy" for BB, and pick a statement at random for BG and
>GB, then the probability that the other child is a boy is 1/2.

Maybe mathematicians would be inclined to mean something different than
ordinary people would with these statements, maybe not.  But for the
purposes of a math problem, it's immaterial.  As I said in my last post,
all that matters is whether the statement "I have two children, and one
of them is a girl" is true.  In the math problem, we really shouldn't
make any further hypotheses.

>I've *always* felt that riddle had a problem; now, twelve years later, I
>finally get to articulate it.

Which riddle?  The one I asked (about the man whose wife is pregnant
and who cunningly---or stupidly---goes to a mathematician to talk it
over and carefully neglects to mention certain information), or the
"mathematician's daughter" problem that you just posed?

>(In Lee Corbin's question as stated, I expect that the mathematician
>hypothesizes the father to be symmetrical, rather than hypothesizing
>that the father exhibits a feminine bias, and answers 1/2.)

As I say, the mathematician's ideal role is to avoid hypothesizing,
and I have no idea what "feminine bias" means here.  Given only the
actual statement that the father made, the answer 1/2 is incorrect.

I guess you know by now that you have completely changed the problem.
It wouldn't be of any advantage here to change (see Amara's original
explanation, and Eliezer was right to point out that your new version
is equivalent to the fourth problem on my list).

You also write intriguingly,

I'm lucky to have that book, wherein on page 87, it is related 
that a certain ominous **Mr. Jones** has determined the rate at
which very large prime numbers are likely to be discovered.
Now I would think that surely the probability that C+2 is
prime is indeed proportional to 1/ln(C+2).  Yes?  It would be
marvelous if someone had found otherwise.  What's the connection?

This still sounds like an attitude of surrender to me.  Tarski
nailed down what we should mean by "truth".  I agree with those
who advocate the "correspondence theory", which is essentially
that minds map features of the universe, and do so with varying
precision.  Highly accurate maps we call true, and inaccurate
maps we call false.  We shouldn't give up trying to get our 
maps as accurate as possible.

We only need keep in mind, as the great Count Alfred Korzybski
said, "the map is not the territory", (Science and Sanity, 1933).

I don't see any arguments for that conclusion.  You show that
rational Bayesians should agree if and only if that's true.  The assumption
is outrageously false; it requires that prior differ only due to valid
reasoning based on the evidence of the beliefs themselves.  Human
uninformed beliefs are caused by developmental, genetic, and memetic
processes that have essentially nothing to do with the truth of such 
things in the real world.  The reason my mother and I differ on the 
existence of God has nothing to do with the existence of God.

In addition, it's an odd "norm", at least for humans.  We have the priors
we have; to change them requires violating Bayesianism. 

>I do *not* assume that everyone has the same uberprior,

>imply common priors.

You assume everybody agree on world_state_function/belief_state and
on probability(belief_state).  It's trivial to derive a 
belief-state-independent
world state function (i.e. a prior) just by averaging 
world_state_function/belief_state
by probability(belief_state).  So you do assume everybody has the same
uberprior.

I would actually split your above assumption into two parts; one, that 
everybody
has the same uberprior, and two, that everybody agrees on the evidential
status of beliefs.  The two assumptions are quite independent, and putting
them this way makes it easier to discern how most people would address 
the issue.  Rational people understand that uninformed beliefs are minimally
informative about the world and so effectively agree on the evidential status
of beliefs; hence they disagree on the uberprior. phrased
as "what would you expect the world to be like if you didn't exist".  My 
mother
thinks God would exist even if she didn't; I think if I weren't here God still
wouldn't either.  Ditto for differences on this group on the appropriate value
of Cisco stock, plausibility of friendly AI, etc.

There are three criteria for ascribing validity to truth-claims; they are:
1) correspondence with the referent observed world
2) external coherence with contiguous and/or related truths, and
3) internal consistency (the truth-claim cannot be self-contradictory)
All three of these criteria must be met for a truth-claim to be considered valid, and where 1) or 2) occurs, the others seem to occur also.  #3 may occur in untrue statements, but it is never absent from true ones.

2. ASTROBIOLOGY: ON THE SEARCH FOR EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE
     Nearly 30 years ago, Carl Sagan (1934-1996) wrote the
following: "Civilizations hundreds or thousands or millions of
years beyond us should have sciences and technologies so far
beyond our present capabilities as to be indistinguishable from
magic. It is not that what they can do violates the laws of
physics; it is that we will not understand how they are able to
use the laws of physics to do what they do. It is possible that
we are so backward and so uninteresting to such civilizations as
not to be worthy of contact, or at least of much contact. There
may be a few specialists in primitive planetary societies who
receive master's or doctor's degrees in studying Earth or
listening to our raspy radio and television traffic. There may be
amateurs -- Boy Scouts, radio hams, and the equivalent -- who may
be interested in developments on Earth. But a civilization a
million years in our future is unlikely, I believe, to be very
interested in us. There are all those other civilizations a
million years in our future for them to talk to." [*Note #1]
... ... T.L. Wilson (Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy,
Bonn, DE) presents a review of some current considerations
concerning the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, the
author making the following points:
     1) The author points out that N.S. Kardashev, in 1964,
classified possible extraterrestrial civilizations according to
the energy at their disposal, the scheme permitting a
determination of whether, in a context of communication, we would
be dealing with a civilization like our own (type I), a rather
advanced civilization (type II), or a vastly more advanced
civilization (type III). The transmission power of a type I
civilization is equal to the power expendable by all the
technological activity on Earth. For a specific direction, this
can be achieved by coupling the output of a 1 megawatt
transmitter operating at 10 centimeters to a 100-meter-diameter
telescope. The transmission power of a type II civilization is
the entire output of the Sun, which is equal to 10^(14) times a
type I transmission. The transmission power of a type III
civilization is equal to the power from our entire Galaxy, or
10^(11) times a type II signal.
     2) The author points out that humanity has sufficient
resources at present to broadcast messages comparable to a type I
civilization in a specific direction, although in practice the
types of transmission are based on isotropic radiators. A type II
transmission might be transmitted by an extraterrestrial
civilization that had captured all of the power from its central
star. Such extraterrestrial civilizations are often referred to
as "Dyson civilizations". Type III civilizations have captured
the power of an entire galaxy.
     3) The author points out that F.D. Drake, in 1965, proposed
what is now called the "Drake equation" as an attempt to quantify
estimates of the number of extraterrestrial civilizations. The
equation takes the form N = RanbcdL, where (N) is the number of
extraterrestrial civilizations in a galaxy communicating at any
given time, (R) is the average rate of galactic star formation,
(a) is the fraction of stars accompanied by planets, (n) is the
number of planets per star system with conditions needed to
support life, (b) is the fraction of habitable planets on which
life actually arises, (c) is the fraction of the life-bearing
planets that develop intelligent life, (d) is the fraction of
intelligent species that develop communication technologies, and
(L) is the "life-span" of the communicating technological
culture.
     4) The author points out that stars are concentrated in
galaxies, and there are more than 20 galaxies within 3 million
light years of our own Galaxy. In principle, we should be able to
receive a message from type II or type III extraterrestrial
civilizations in any of these galaxies with technology currently
available. With an average of 10^(10) Sun-like stars per galaxy,
we could detect messages from extraterrestrial civilizations even
if the product of the last 5 terms in the Drake equation were
less than 1 part in 10^(8). The author suggests these
considerations provide a rationale for all-sky untargeted
searches: With the possibility of at least modest numbers of
perhaps readily detectable extraterrestrial civilizations
(especially of type II or type III), the extra sensitivity
conferred by targeted searches would not be an absolute
requirement for success. However, the fact remains that no
confirmed transmissions in the centimeter-wavelength range have
been received, from which it has been claimed that type II and
type III extraterrestrial civilizations do not exist at the
present epoch. The author suggests this claim is overstated: it
may be valid for a sizeable part of our Galaxy, but only if the
extraterrestrial civilizations are broadcasting in the
centimeter-wavelength range without interruption -- and if they
wish their signals to be detectable.
     5) The author points out that there is an advantage in
transmitting signals at short wavelengths, and this explains the
interest in optical searches for extraterrestrial intelligence.
The author suggests the following example illustrates the
advantages of optical searches in regard to effective radiated
power: An extraterrestrial civilization orbiting a Sun-like star
could use a laser to illuminate a 1-meter optical telescope
through narrow-band optical filters. The extraterrestrial
civilization could then produce a short pulse lasting 1
microsecond or less, and this would produce a flash 300,000 times
as bright as their Sun. Even without optical filtering, the flash
would still be 30 times as bright as their Sun, and this factor
would rise to 3000 if the diameter of the telescope were
increased to 10 meters (the diameter of our current Keck
telescopes). Because of the short pulse length, such optical
signals would not be found in conventional optical astronomical
surveys.
     6) The author points out that if extraterrestrial
civilizations exist, they are not making their presence obvious.
This in itself suggests that type III and perhaps type II
civilizations are at best extremely rare. There are, however,
many possible reasons why we have not made contact with
extraterrestrial civilizations: a) They may simply be very few.
b) There may be a number of extraterrestrial civilizations, but
these may be sending messages in optical or near-infrared ranges
that we have to explore comprehensively. c) There may be
extraterrestrial civilizations, but these may not be interested
in communicating and choose to keep themselves hidden. This is
more speculative, since it depends on the cultural aspects of
extraterrestrial civilizations. From searches so far, the lack of
contact demonstrates that transmissions, if any, involve weak or
intermittent signals (or both).
     7) The author suggests there seems to be no hope for faster-
than-light travel, so actual visits from extraterrestrial
civilization are unlikely. Even with the most efficient
propulsion systems, the energy needed to reach stars at 10 light
years in 20 years would be the equivalent of the present world
consumption for 1000 years. Such expenditure of energy would
hardly deter a type III extraterrestrial civilization, but even
then, broadcasts make more energetic sense than personal
appearances. There have been suggestions that extraterrestrial
civilizations might populate space with self-replicating machines
in space probes. This would allow colonization of large regions
of space in relatively short intervals of time, but it seems
vastly more complex than communicating by means of
electromagnetic radiation.

Related Background:
PROSPECTS FOR THE SEARCH FOR EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE
The conjured image is poignant: intelligent life sprinkled
throughout our Galaxy, each sprinkle separated from the others by
1000 light years, each sprinkle searching for the others with
radio transmitters and receivers, small robotic spacecraft sent
beeping into empty space between the stars, the beeping like a
faint bleating in the dark as the sprinkles search for each
other. Of course, the conjured image may be wrong: there may be
intelligent life dense in the Galaxy; or we may be alone. It does
not matter. For the human species on this planet Earth, the quest
is part of our destiny, part of what we do as a species, and it
will go on as long as we remain civilized.
... ... J.C. Tarter and C.F. Chyba (SETI Institute, US) present a
review of current and future efforts in the search for
extraterrestrial intelligence, the authors making the following
points:
     1) During the past 40 years, researchers have conducted
searches for radio signals from an extraterrestrial technology,
sent spacecraft to all but one of the planets in our Solar
System, and expanded our knowledge of the conditions in which
living systems can survive. The public perception is that we have
looked extensively for signs of life elsewhere. But in reality,
we have hardly begun to search. Assuming our current,
comparatively robust space program continues, by 2050 we may
finally know whether there is, or ever was, life elsewhere in our
Solar System. At a minimum, we will have thoroughly explored the
most likely candidates, a task not yet accomplished. We will have
discovered whether life exists on Jupiter's moon Europa, or on
Mars. And we will have undertaken the systematic exobiological
exploration of planetary systems around other stars, seeking
traces of life in the spectra of planetary atmospheres. These
surveys will be complemented by expanded searches for intelligent
signals.
     2) The authors point out that although the current language
is that of a "search for extraterrestrial intelligence" (SETI),
what is being sought is evidence of extraterrestrial
technologies. Until now, researchers have concentrated on only
one specific technology -- radio transmissions at wavelengths
with weak natural backgrounds and little absorption. No verified
evidence of a distant technology has been found, but the null
result may have more to do with limitations in range and
sensitivity than with actual lack of civilization. The most
distant star probed directly is still less than 1 percent of the
distance across our Galaxy.
     3) The authors conclude: "If by 2050 we have found no
evidence of an extraterrestrial technology, it may be because
technical intelligence almost never evolves, or because technical
civilizations rapidly bring about their own destruction, or
because we have not yet conducted an adequate search using the
right strategy. If humankind is still here in 2050 and still
capable of doing SETI searches, it will mean that our technology
has not yet been our own undoing -- a hopeful sign for life
generally. By then we may begin considering the active
transmission of a signal for someone else to find, at which point
we will have to tackle the difficult questions of who will speak
for Earth and what they will say."

Lee,

I'll venture a guess that you and I defining "differential equation"
differently.

My definition of "differential equation":

     function => evolve(function)
     where "evolve" is over time or over space or both

Differential equations can describe almost every phenomena that
I can think of.

The subject of this thread says "reversible" and since I jumped into
this topic in the middle without reading all of the earlier posts, I
don't know if we are still assuming "reversible". For the record, I'm
not.

I don't agree. Here are some examples that coupled partial
differential equations can model:

(These are macroscopic phenomena)
    fluids
    clouds
    chemical waves
    populations
    markets
    cerebral cell assemblies
    ferromagnetism
    the immune system
    avalanches
    interstellar medium
    shocks
    bird flocks
    urban growth
    snow crystals

The microscopic view of these complex systems can be described by
the differential ("evolution") equation, where each component
depends on the space and time of the components:

x' = F(x,lambda)

where F in a nonlinear function F of the vector x, depending on an
external control parameter, lambda. The emergence of order, or phase
transitions, can occur a couple of ways: reversible structures in
thermal equilibrium (growth of snow crystals for example), or
irreversible structures far from equilibrium (most of the interesting
phenomena...)

During the phase transitions of nonlinear dissipative systems, the
old structures become unstable and break down by changing control
parameters. On the microscopic level, the stable modes of the old
states are dominated by the unstable modes. Hermann Hakan calls this
the 'slaving principle' because the stable modes are 'enslaved' by
the unstable modes at a certain threshold. Variables are eliminated
which results in an enormous reduction of the degrees of freedom,
and a new structure emerges because the remaining unstable modes
serve as "order parameters" for the macroscopic behavior of the
system. The evolution of the macroscopic parameters are described by
differential equations. In contrast to the properties of the
elements of a system at the microscopic level (for example, atoms,
molecules), the order parameters denote macroscopic features of the
whole system. A qualitative metaphoric example would be a laser:
where the the slowly varying amplitudes of modes serve as the order
parameters because they start to enslave the atomic system.

One can always choose the time at which to compute the functional
evolution, so I still don't follow why you are emphasizing
"intermediate results". One can study the system to determine the
phase transitions, in order to know at which time important
structures appear.

Hmm. Are you meaning "emergent order" ??

Differential equations (albeit VERY coupled and nonlinear and dissipative
and far-from-equilibrium, and hard to compute on today's computers) can
model most of these systems.

And if I don't keep losing hard drives (or can eventually
recover the data off the ones that have gone belly up)
then I've got sci.life-extension and the ageing topics

I want to give my best wishes to Brent Allsop as he endeavors to reach out 
to the LDS church leadership to learn what he can expect from them in 
regards to cryonics.

I would like to thank Anders for the excellent advice he gave on how to
improve the letter.  It is very important to avoid confusion and offense.

I expect the church to reject the idea of being listed as a contactee in any 
cryonics contract.  But, a definitive reply from the church's senior 
hierarchy which does not outright condemn cryonics could help mormon 
cryonicists(like me) a great deal.

I realize church leaders may see cryonics as a sign of weak faith.  I see it 
as the ultimate in life extension and not a sure doorway to absolute 
immortality.  I definitely look forward to learning the reaction Brent gets.

best wishes,

John

Some species are more robust and more capable of
adapting to changing environments than others.  We
have plenty of examples of species living today that
are on the ragged edge, such as the taxifornia condor.
It survives today only because of extraordinary efforts
on the part of the environmentalists to keep them
soaring.  Apparently this movement does not accept
extinctions as a natural part of evolution, and so attempt
to prevent all extinctions.

On the flip side, we have plenty of examples of super
robust, super-adaptable species, such as rats, mosquitos
and humans.  spike

Ominous?   Cooool, Ive always wanted to be ominous.  Every time
you hear of an ominous donor giving money to something, you'll
know that was me.

Im leading you to an apparent paradox, Lee.  The reason I mention
the C+2 problem it is this will lead you to the following:  Since
we have no reason to believe that the probability of C+2 is anything
other than 1 / ln(C+2), lets assume it so.  Now open a spreadsheet
to make this easier.  Get your two randomly chosen primes (neither
of which can be 2), multiply them together to generate the composite C.
Now fill down, C+2, C+4, and so on.  In the next column calculate
1 / ln {the first column}.  The second column is the probability of
each number to its left being prime.  Now calculate the cumulative
probability of C+2 and C+4 prime, then C+6 also prime, and so on.

What did you find out?

One of the many fascinating aspects of living when we do is that for
the first time in all human history, it is possible to make a prediction
about when the record for the largest known prime will be broken.  To
do this, all you need to know is the following:

1.  Now and for all future time, the largest known prime will always
be a Mersenne prime, since there is no known way nor any anticipated
discovery that will allow megadigit non-Mersenne numbers to be tested
for primality.

2.  You need to know the status of the GIMPS project, the Great
Internet Mersenne Primes Search.

3.  You need to understand how to calculate the probability of a given
number of being prime, given that it is of the form 2^P-1 where P is
prime.

4.  You also understand how to adjust the probability if the number has
already been checked for small factors {"small" being defined as factors
smaller than about 6 octillion}.

When making the estimate for Damien's book, we had to make several
assumptions regarding the future of GIMPS, all of which were done
by extrapolation in May 2000.  We extrapolated the growth in
the number of participants (which we assumed would grow linearly)
the speedup of processors (Moore's law with a 2 yr doubling time),
the continued steady improvement of the algorithm, plus several other
assumptions which have proved fairly accurate with two notable exceptions:

a) I failed to foresee the People's Republic of Taxifornia's power crisis

b) I did not account for the fact that George Woltman, the founder of
GIMPS {may he live forever and fill the earth with his descendants}
would continue to *optimize* the Prime95 fourier transforms for
*specific processors*.  George is pending his time doing this for nothing
instead of taking that skill and making about a jillion dollars with it,
which proves Eliezer's point that there are a few people in this big
world who do things like this.

I apologize for free-associating from one small phrase in Nick's message:

> Because of accelerating technological progress, humankind may be
> rapidly approaching a critical phase in its career.

I read "critical phase" and it reminded me of two phenomena: phase
transitions, and critical points, both of which are thermodynamic concepts
governing the behavior of solids, liquids and gases.

I wonder if we could be said to be approaching a phase transition?
Perhaps our concept of the Singularity could be said to represent a
phase transition in human affairs.  We could be moving from a solid to
a liquid, or a liquid to a gas.  The new state would be characterized
by having many more degrees of freedom.

How much more can we milk out of this somewhat ill-fitting analogy?
When phase transitions occur, they often start at an interface between
the two phases, which then grows, one phase gaining at the expense of
the others.  Think of bubbles at the bottom of a pan growing as molecules
transition from the liquid to the gas phase until the bubble breaks free.

In this model, the Singularity would start with a small group and then
expand, more and more people being invited (or compelled) to join,
each undergoing a sudden transition, a Vastening.

We could even think of this rather literally, a nucleation site which
is a source of knowledge, people clustering around it and gaining the
knowledge needed to Transcend, then breaking free like a bubble and they
are gone, waiting for the next group to undergo the same sequence of
steps.  This is something like Vinge's scenario in Marooned in Realtime.

I'm trying to work the critical point into this imagery.  It is the
point at which the distinction between water and gas becomes moot.  See
http://www.uni-koeln.de/math-nat-fak/phchem/deiters/persons/globass/critical.html.

This might represent a "soft" transition to a Singularity.  Rather than
a specific interface with people on one side or the other, we instead
have gradual increases without any sharp, well-defined transition,
until suddenly, to our surprise, we find ourselves having Transcended so
gradually that we never noticed.  In the diagram above, we'd take a path
which circles around the critical point, the liquid-to-gas line endpoint,
something like the dotted arrows shown.  We'd go from one phase to the
other without transition.

Well, it was meant as a generic ref. I suppose the standard texts (a while
back) were 

Peter Wason and Phillip Johnson-Laird, THE PSYCHOLOGY OF REASONING:

Phillip Johnson-Laird, MENTAL MODELS, Harvard UP, 1983

I'm sure there must be a lot since then...

For this we have simulations.  This is a pretty simple case...

Case A: Host says nothing, so contestant never has a reason to switch.

Case B: Host reveals a nonprize door after initial choice, always
choosing the contestant's door if the contestant chose a nonprize door;
contestant switches only if contestant's door is revealed.

Case C: Host reveals a nonprize door completely at random; contestant
only switches if contestant's door is revealed.

Case D: Host reveals a nonprize door completely at random; contestant
always switches.

Each trial was for 1000 runs; the number given is the number of times
the contestant won in that trial of that case.

All I know is (1) one of C+2, C+4, C+6 is composite, so summing
the probability is going to start giving a funny result, (2) 1/lnx
is a rather poor approximation, and so summing it is doubly suspicious.

But I have some good materials on "The Prime Number Theorem" and
will try to have a go at them.

It wasn't just the dinosaurs, no land species that weighed more than about 40 pounds
survived, perhaps because small animals are more numerous than big ones so there
was a better chance at least two would get lucky.

Then why did more than half of the marine species become extinct too? And why did
it happen in less than a hundred years, perhaps much less? And how did  all those
Buckeyballs (C60) get made at that time if not by an impact? And what about the
excess of iridium, where did that come from is not from space?

Yes.  This is broader than what I meant by "differential equation".
Into your definition, it looks to me as if the number theory
Collatz function (defined on each positive integer)

        x => x/2      (if x is even)
        x => 3x + 1   (if x is odd)

is also a "differential equation".  Is it, (in your book)?

I, on the other hand, had characterized differential equations as
always expressing infinitesimal constraints, and stated that they
were useful only in this "arena" (a very poor word choice).

You then gave a nice list of "examples that coupled partial

But isn't it true that, to take populations for example, one 
proceeds by assuming continuous values, rather than discrete?
It's not surprizing that this approach can yield a great deal,
(though some of your examples are new to me).

You then go on to summarize in a very nice way (and in a way
that I'm sure I don't fully appreciate) some interesting results
concerning nonlinear dissipative systems and so forth, that I
don't quite understand the relevance of in this discussion you
and I are having.

Well, what I was referring to was the kind of calculation that
needs to be done in, say, the three-body problem, where one must
calculate numerical values for differentials, add the results to
the variables in question, and recalculate the differentials and
so forth.  The Lorenz equations, as you know, are the prime example,
(but the Rossler quations are easier to type :-)

   x' = -y - z      (where ' denotes derivative with respect to t)
   y' = x + ay
   z' = b + (x - c)z

It's in this sense that "intermediate" values are needed; one cannot
simply calculate what x, y, and z are at time t=20, for example.

As I think you said, there are closed form solutions for exceedingly
few differential equations, so computer generated solutions always
take some kind of path like this.  (I was using Greg Egan's phrase
"intermediate results" mostly to try to read him in the most charitable
way.)  But here is exactly what I meant by the foregoing paragraph:

Take the Rossler equations above, for a concrete example.  Given
particular initial values, they define a mathematical truth.  There
exist exact real numbers that correspond to values of t, but we can
never do more than approximate these real values (unlike the case
with the Collatz iteration, say).  That's all I meant by "the numerical
solution of differential equations are merely approximations to the
mathematical truth."  Is this still problematic?

Am I reading you right?  You believe that chess can be modeled
by differential equations?  And Turing machines, i.e., computer
programs?  And Conway's Life?  It's simply not the case that
differential equations can model these in any useful way, unless
(again) you're using the term "differential equation" in an
amazingly broad way.  (I.e., are Conway's Rules further examples
of what you'd call "differential equations"???)

Now of course when I write about "our lives on Earth", that's so
broad that of course some aspects are captured extremely well by
differential equations---by many aspects, I submit, cannot be
so captured.

Thats right, but you started your sentence with "All I know is..." and
listed two truths, but in fact these are not all you know.  I kinda tricked

you, since I started with having you randomly pick two primes {non-2
both}, multiply them to generate C.  So you know that C is odd, as are
C+2 and C+4, etc, so the probability of prime approximation needs
to be adjusted accordingly.  {8-]

Before I belabor this whole thing more than I already have on a list
that is not primarily about primes, let me just do this:  I wish to put
together a paper on this topic which I have been thinking about way
too much for the past year, regarding predicting the next record prime,
then posting it on a website.

I wish to draw parallels between that concept and predicting the time of
the singularity, for oddly enough, both problems, predicting the
singularity
and predicting the next record prime, present similar paradoxes.

Unfortunately I dont expect I will have it ready by E5, because I
need to read The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, plus study
Eliezer's latest work before then, otherwise I risk being left behind
in what promises to be the best discussions I will hear in this year.

We don't actually adapt: we cheat, using technology. 
It forms a hyperadaptive, insulating layer between us
and the harsh environment, homeostating the technowomb
within. Are you feeling cozy yet?

Now the interesting stage is when the encrustation with
technology becomes so heavy that we don't perceive it
as an external layer. When the prothesis becomes the
limb, so to speak.

Amusing trivia :

This 3-door Monty problem was a thread that lasted six weeks on
the Usenet newsgroup: sci.math.num-analysis in the Summer of 1995.
It is unusual to have a topic generate that  much  discussion..
so be prepared!

At that time, the participants had divided themselves into
"two-thirdsers," and "one-halfers" and had vigorous debates.

I was so amused by the whole thing that I wrote an article about
this long thread for an Internet newsletter that I was writing for
at the time, and my spouse (now ex) wrote a simulation and put it on
the Web to show that the result had to be 2/3. I don't think that
simulation exists now, but it would be easy to write to prove
for yourself.

Are the people here speaking about the Bayesian approach to rationality
familiar with Solomonoff's principle of induction?
It seems to me that Solomonoff uncovers a bigger part of the picture
than just the Bayesian deduction principle.

Ray Solomonoff, one of the co-founders of the field of Algorithmic
Information Theory, simultaneously with Kolmogorov and Chaitin,
introduced a nice way to explain how rational induction is possible.
Roughly said, rational induction consists in dynamically trying to
find a minimal algorithmic model for the observations of the world;
when you add new observations, you try to find the minimal model update.
The actual probability measure is not computable, but can be computably
approximated from below. It verifies Bayes' theorem with respect to adding
new information. It depends on an algorithmic context, although up to a
constant factor, that tends toward one when comparing the outcome of two
different rational predictors faced with the same long sequences of random
observations. It thus defeats Karl Popper's limitation against
context-independent induction, by being context-dependent; yet with an
asymptotically irrelevant initial context. It is an induction principle
that neatly formalizes Moore's Law (commonly retro-stated as "pick the
simplest available explanation"). Now of course, see how a Solomonoff
predictor can only be _approximated_ by computational agents. This entails
that we (rational sentient beings, including AIs and ETs) are all irrational,
when faced with complex enough problems. However, there are convergent
algorithms to extract all information there is from "simple enough" systems
that can be described in rules polylogarithmically simpler than the observed
system. Etc.

Considering that, I'd rather say of rational agents that they are
Solomonovian than Bayesian.

PS: Solomonoff Induction is well-explained in chapter 5 of Li and Vitányi's
"Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and its Applications, 2nd Edition".

I agree, but this assumes that only those survived the impact.  Are you sure

I'm not sure.

Did only "super-adaptable" organisms survive?  What is the evidence?

Archibald does not completely disagree here, though he does look over which
species survived, when the extinctions seem to take place, and alternatives
to explain its disappearance.  On the first, it's important to know to
narrow down the causes.  Marine regression would kill certain organisms and
benefit others.  Specifically, freshwater species would do better under
marine regression, while large land vertebrates and marine species would
not.

On the second, timing is important; if the last example of a certain species
occurs five million years before the impact, cannot be sure that an impact
did them in.  There seems to be plenty of evidence of a decline in nonavian
dinosaurs before the Creataceous-Tertiary Boundary.

On the third, it's just good science to have alternative explanations.  May
the best one win.  Again, Archibald does think a bolide impact played a
role.  He also thinks the evidence is strong for marine regression.  Imagine
this: small impact combined with an ongoing process of marine regression.
If this was the case, it would have a huge impact -- no pun intended -- on
the biosphere.  The ongoing marine regression would've upset many local
biomes, putting them on edge.  An impact might have pushed them over the
edge.

Cheers!

I think this is only considering adaptations narrowly as new big [stuff we
can see if the fossil record] body biologically made parts.  If you also
include other stuff -- changes to brains, changes to behavior, and so on --
then you might change your assessment of human adaptability.  Certainly,
technology matches up well with behaviorial changes.

If people put one-half of the effort of writing
even a simple simulation into carefully thinking
about the problem, they'd learn something.  But
it's more fun to just write code than to think.

I didn't get what you meant by "I'm responsible to", because you were
proposing a dilemma between two meanings for "responsible",
which once again turned into a false dilemma. These meanings do not oppose.
Once again I'm responsible to my boss for my work.
There's no meaning to "in charge of" but that of an obligation of result.
And an obligation is but the data of some sanction, that will select
for or against certain behavior patterns.

As for the role of intelligence in evolution, the ultimate principle behind
evolution is that individuals are responsibles to their genes and memes
and soul or whatever for what they do toward their spreadth and survival.
That's the basis very of natural selection. Any intelligence comes afterward,
as an emerging pattern that is positively selected. Oh, and that all was
about the fact that memes are now the preponderant factor for life change,
as opposed to genes, well, uh, sure. No great news, either, though news that
deserve more than being drown into lots of fallacious small talk.

Better than not using words: use them in context.
Words are things with dynamic context-dependent meaning,
but they are used to denote context-independent concepts
(or rather, concepts that contain their contextual closure).
When the contextual closure is uncertain or contextual conflict is detected,
it's possible to build some common context, out of the negociation that any
rational conversation is. What's wrong is to use the uncertainty so as
to build fallacies of distraction, ambiguity, or missing the point,
or whatever.

I guess I am an extropian, but I think I am much more pessimistic
than most as of the you people on the list seem to be as for
the timing for the Singularity, or the transition to posthumanism.

At times, your predictions sound a bit like
the ones from various millenarist christian sectarians
who enjoin to "Repent, for the End of the World is near".
Except that you're optimistic and physicalist
rather than pessimistic and metaphysicalist
about the nature of the nearby catastrophic event.
But somehow, I doubt we're to see this Singularity,
the end of such a transition, or anything like immortality
achieved in our lifetime.

For one thing, about the timing before some AI emerges (if it ever does),
I don't think that AI is possible least there is already
the well-developed equivalent of what TUNES (or Flare?) should be
to serve as a proper autocatalytic development platform.
For another thing about phase transition:
I believe that from the large body of historical data we have,
we're already in one, but one that,
albeit it seems instantaneous in geological times,
is very long in individual human life time,
and there's no reason to believe we're at the end of it.
Of course, the best (or rather, the only) way
to successfully predict such future is to make it happen.
So you're welcome to prove me wrong.
Meanwhile, my ambitions (TUNES) are much in retreat of the great changes
you're looking for, although I'm convinced their success
can be instrumental in making these changes come sooner
(which I still don't expect to be soon).

Yours freely,

As for cryonics, well, ahem, why not?

I'm not sure it's the economically most interesting way to promote
one's genes, memes, or whichever eternal things we wish to promote
about us "selves". Which raises the question of identity:
what are "we"? What is "I"? What am I striving for and toward?

A few things To take into consideration:
(1) we can promote these genes and memes beyond our individual life
by spreading them the "usual" ways through heredity and civilization.
(2) even with cryonics, life expectancy is finite, so we even with it,
we have to consider eventual use and comparative risk/payoff for
these former methods, too.
(3) life expectancy through cryonics depends on one being conserved,
despite the repeated violence that greedy people disrespecting one's
property might exert for centuries during which one is not there to
consistently defend it and adapt, until technology is not only much
much advanced than it is, but also not so much advanced as to make
the kind of individual resurrection to happen that one can afford
a kind that will the resurrected one a lone animal in a zoo, watched
with a mix of contempt, indifference and bemusement by much superior
transhumans. This can make the risk*(payoff-cost) integral quite small.

Of course, what's great about individual liberty
is that we all bet for our own lives, and
are ultimately responsible to our "selves", whatever they be,
for what we do toward the outcome that we desire for them.
Life on the evolutionary scale is the ultimate free market.

I disagree in the sense that using technology is not cheating.
We need to recognize that all adaptive species use technology
in a sense.  As a child I was taught that humans are the only
species that uses technology, but I begged to differ then and
I beg to differ now.  Examples are as simple as the tortoise
digging a hole and to protect herself from predators and
temperature extremes.  We needn't look to the chimps stripping
twigs to extract termites, when the termites themselves use a
far more sophisticated technology to create an artificial
environment for themselves.

We should see that stage as now.  Humans evolved,
therefore everything humans do is natural.  Why should not
the prosthesis be considered the limb now?  Should not
the computer, and the net, be considered an extension
of our brains, and even part of our brains?

Technology *is* an adaption.  spike

Wow, so much for analysis and prognostication. Basically, the article 
suggests that the technological forecasting is always wrong and always 
hideously, overly optimistic.

------------

First, I realize that in my previous message (Re:  I disagree with Lee's
answer), I was a bit disrespectful of Lee's views.  I apologize.

However, Lee, instead of pointing it out (which is the best course of action
in such cases), responds in kind, which I quoted above.

Lee, your long argument in favour of your answer is not needed.  I don't
need your "help".  Of course I saw your argument immediately.  If you read
my message carefully, you will see I said
>>The answer to this is of course 2/3

Anybody with common sense or probability training or intelligence, will
quickly arrive at this answer.  This list is comprised of people who want to
preserve their thinking, therefore there must be something worth preserving,
and so questions such as these are not "fun" as you claim, but boring - in
my humble opinion.

-------------------------
Now, to the argument.  Lee responds:

>The flaw in your argument is that the mathematician is obligated to
>entertain no hypotheses concerning the procedure by which the parent
>determined the truth or falsity of the statement "one of my children
>is a girl". The only thing that matters is whether the statement is
>true. It's not the case that the father is saying "I have picked...".

I agree of course that the mathematician is obligated to entertain no
hypotheses in addition to what the father said.  But you are now quoting
only part of the father's statement.  Let me quote the whole relevant
statement that you wrote:

>>

and I responded
>Note the pair of phrases:>"one", and "the other".

Lee, did you carefully read your original message and this response??  Why
do I have to keep repeating them?

--------------------------

So, finally,  I think this is a good question for the linguists.  Are there
any linguists on the list?  Or anybody knows good linguists??

The question is:  take the statement:

>>"I have two children, sir", he says, "and one of them
>>     is a girl.  What is the probability that the other is
>>     a boy?"

In this statement, does the person:

1.  focus on one particular child and then on the other child? (in this case
the answer is 1/2)
2.  does not focus on any particular child at any time (in this case the
answer is 2/3)
3.  it is ambiguous and cannot be inferred whether he does or does not focus
(in this case the original question that Lee posed is ambigous)

So, linguists, please respond...  Thank you.

Mark Galecki

These greeblies would be life, but I'd question their sustainability which
hasn't been proven in the course of several billion years, unlike DNA-based
ecosystems.

Our genetic development has been very additive, with complexity rising more
frequent than decreasing. This is both inefficient, and enabling for reverse
engineering.

But I'm unable to understand the significance of your derivation. Retrograde
analysis is only a cognitive tool to understand why our emotions are such as
they are. We are not interested in what exactly was happening, we try to
understand the purpose of emotions.

I agree that we should consider an escape from our biology in order to gain
flexibility of living spaces, energy efficiency, etc. But diversity is
beneficial, and the old lifeforms might be good to keep as a back up.

But when deciding what is good or bad, it's good to have a purpose or goal.

Individualism is an extreme statement, just as groupism is. In reality, two
individuals have a lot in common, genetically and memetically --- in that sense
they are instances of the same virtual individual. Progress is impossible
without increasing the number of winners and decreasing the number of losers.
But individualism leads to too many petty conflicts. Also, we are not completely
disjoint: genetically, all DNA-based live entities are relatives, some are
closer (siblings) than others (cousins). But the objective would be to balance
the cooperation and competition to maximize the fitness of future generations.

It seems to me that individualism is excessively risk-averse and wipes out
diversity too quickly.

Regards,
            Aleks

Extropians, let me quickly introduce a new related topic with a new
subject line, then I need to run downtown and create a San Jose
restaurant map for our guests coming to E5.

Im indebted to Martin Gardner for the following illustration:
A prisoner is sentenced to the ultimate punishment.  He is
told his execution will take place on some unspecified day,
Monday thru Friday inclusive.  The judge specifies that the
prisoner will not know which day he is to meet his fate until
the day of his demise.  Sitting forlornly in his cell, it occurs
to him that his date with destiny cannot be on Friday, for if
he is still among the living on Thursday midnight, then he
would *know* he is to be executed on Friday, which violates
the judge's stipulation that he will not know the date of his
execution.  Similarly, he cannot be executed on Thursday, for
he already determined his date cannot be Friday, so if he is
still with us on Wednesday midnight, then similarly Tuesday
midnight, and so on.

The prisoner determines by this line of reasoning that his
execution cannot take place according to the judge's
instruction.  A greatly relieved prisoner is startled by the
hangman, who shows up Wednesday morning.
Surprise!

Those that are following this thread and the previous
threads regarding probability of record primes, do ponder
this apparent paradox of the unexpected hanging so you
will be ready for where I am going with the notion of
probability distribution functions and their relationship
to the unexpected singularity.  Comments and questions
welcome in the meantime, while I go sample sushi
restaurants.  {8^D  0====   spike

There are several skeptics about immanent Singularity on this list,
including myself.  Of those who discuss the immanence of the 
Singularity, a majority think it is; but I note many people don't
get involved in such discussions. 

I'm curious whether anybody on this list takes actions that would be
irrational or unusual under the general assumption of no immanent
Singularity.  For example, taking a 125% mortgage on your house
(since you may not need to pay it) or refusing professional education
intended primarily for financial gain.

Extropians -- here is the press release for Extro-5. If you haven't checked 
the conference pages recently, please note that there have been quite a few 
recent updates.

I'd very much appreciate it if you could forward this to any person or 
group who you think is likely to be interested. (But please don't spam 
lists that aren't likely to be interested!)

If you are coming to Extro-5 but have not yet registered, I urge you to do 
soon as soon as possible. It helps us with planning (especially arranging 
the right number of banquet meals) and reduces congestion at the 
registration desk.

Onward!

Max

For Immediate Release

THE FUTURE'S BIG THINKERS
CONFRONT ISSUES AND DEVELOP SOLUTIONS

E X T R O - 5 Conference: Shaping Things to Come
San Jose, California, June 15-17, 2001

We cannot ignore the growing confusion, concern, and opposition to the 
technologies that can improve and transform the human condition.

Strident voices and legislation threaten to hold back progress in biotech, 
information technology, the spread of open markets, and the development of 
technologies that could cure age-old ailments, extend our lives and augment 
our capabilities.

The Extro-5 international conference assembles big thinkers from numerous 
fields to provoke our culture to think more carefully about the more 
plausible perils of progress and to shape the future for the better.

Extro-5 will respond to influential figures who oppose the development of 
powerful new technologies. Bill Joy has called for limits on free speech to 
stop the spread of certain technologies. He is joined by various 
"ethicists" and even Prince Charles in calling for a moratorium on genetic 
technologies. Others oppose technologies such as stem cell research that 
could cure disease and extend life spans.

At Extro-5, a unique convergence of experts will separate the real concerns 
from those rooted in lack of knowledge or unexamined or outdated 
assumptions. Each session will bring together several high powered thinkers 
to examine the impact of advanced and accelerating technology, to look at 
opportunities and to anticipate and proactively address potential problems. 
These big thinkers and achievers will address issues around four major themes:

-- Machine Super-Intelligence -- Threat or Opportunity?
-- Thriving in the Information Economy
-- Mastering the Information Explosion
-- Overcoming Resistance to Superlongevity and Augmentation

Each issue will be explored from multiple disciplines while allowing ample 
time for interaction between audience and presenters. The Extro-5 
conference goes beyond voicing the views of the top experts. It also 
provides an unmatched networking opportunity for those seeking to shape the 
future for the better.

Big thinkers at Extro-5: "Shaping Things to Come" include inventor, 
entrepreneur, and writer Ray Kurzweil, leading information economist Hal 
Varian, science correspondent Ronald Bailey, leading information economy 
strategist Steve Flinn, cyberspace economist David Friedman, best-selling 
author Greg Bear, extropic philosopher Max More, evolutionary biologist 
Michael Rose, artist and cultural catalyst Natasha Vita-More, co-architect 
of the pre-Web Xanadu hypertext system Mark Miller, and other leading 
thinkers from computing, artificial intelligence, law, "hard" science 
fiction, Internet technologies, neuroscience, and business.

Don't miss out on this singular chance to listen to and network with those 
who are shaping the future. Stimulate your brain, expand your vision of the 
future, make contacts for your interests and businesses. Attendance is 
limited, so register now to secure your place.

Case E: Host reveals a nonprize door only if the contestant's first
choice is the prize.  Contestant always switches when given a choice.
WinRatio of zero, if contestant has no learning function, rising to one
if contestant figures it out and host doesn't change strategy- which of
course he will.  I'm amazed nobody ever punched Monty's lights out.

The only "Moore's Law" I've ever heard of concerns the rate of progress in building microcircuits.

Could you, perhaps, mean "Occam's (or Ockham's) Razor"?

Volume/surface ratio of a human indicates you can't cool a human body via
surface transfer without requiring some rather fancy fractal heat exchanger
inserted into your body (recursive pipes going down all the way to 
(sub)micrometer scale). Even then, you'll probably need perfusion with 
iceblockers prior to that and removal of said iceblockers after devitrification
(could use ohmic heating or chemical enthalpy (catalyzed oxygen/hydrogen
combustion in situ)). Of course, this is quick, since the fractal plumbing 
can double as cryoprotectant loading/unloading infrastructure.

Now this is asking for some fancy (stiff (since high-throughput), intelligent
(inserting and retracting that heat exchanger is rather nontrivial)) NEMS 
plumbing, and even then, there will be damage. You'll live, but I very much
would not like to go through the ordeal unaesthesized. It would hurt like
the dickens, and the aftermath of the process will weigh upon you heavily
for days.

So unless you shut down the higher cortical function for hours to days, 
to repair the bulk of the damage occured, allowing the patient to recover 
until enabling brain activity, the procedure will be rather, er, disruptive.

The organ vitrification thing is rather different.  It's a single organ,
monotyped tissue allows you to optimize cryoprotectant solutions in a way
that is impossible a complex system. Volume/surface ratio is way better than
a human (in absence of fractal heat exchangers). And you're willing to 
tolerate a lot of tissue damage, because your alternative is 100% tissue 
damage. A kidney doesn't think, and a brain with 50% of the cells taken
out of circulations will still produce an EEG.

So "without any damage at all" boundary conditions is rather harsh. It is 
not being met by any imaginable technology, i.e. based on known physics.

So what on Earth does Mark feel that he should apologize for?  Even
his second statement, "As you see I am trying to be diplomatic here."
struck me as odd.  In retrospect, I should have realized that Mark has
much higher standards of politeness than I do.  I think that he was
reluctant to come out and say, "You're wrong, because....".

Of course.  But perhaps you should think of others on this list
who aren't as mathematically sophisticated as you are.  It wasn't
wrong of me to provide a very thorough explanation, (in order to
cut down on unnecessary misinterpretations and misunderstandings).
I'm sorry that it offended you.

This isn't true.  (Sorry for being blunt.)  Eliezer Yudkowski wrote

and that's a sensible point of view, even for someone with
"probability training and intelligence".  The problem is
deliberately tricky and provocative, and debates about it
can bring out some interesting points.  I think that is fun.

I entitled the thread "Fun With Bayes' Theorem",  because I
thought some would find those problems entertaining.  But if
those problems were as boring as you say, it's interesting
that you responded to them.  :-)

Now, I want to fully apologize for responding to you as I did
when I wrote "The flaw in your argument is...", because it was
unnecessarily condescending.  It was even a worse gaffe because
you, Mark, had already given me hint that you adhere to a very
high standard of politeness.

On the other hand, if you expect people to say "I think that you
may be mistaken" when the truth is that they think that you are
dead wrong, then you are going to be very often offended.  But
the whole question of how to go about being decently polite in
email is still open, in my book.

I suppose you meant "imminent" rather than immanent, didn't you?
I for one think that we are in a transition phase,
and that sooner or later, something that looks like
what some people here seem to call "the Singularity"
(emergence of some form of individual existence significantly
different from what the human race used to be) will happen.
I do think such "Singularity" is _immanent_ to the progress of mankind
(but I haven't RTFM'ed enough yet to have a good enough opinion
on what people here actually call the Singularity -- it's on my TODO list).
I don't think it is _imminent_ at all, though.
I don't expect it in my life time, except as a faint probability
in a few decades at the very least, if I help it well enough.

This reminds me of an idea I had after some Jehovah's witness
told me the End of the World was near: next time I meet a JW,
I want to loan him money with a high interest, that he'd only start
paying me back after a few decades, way after the remotest date
he expects the end of the world to happen. Problems being:
(1) to convince the JW that he is not doing anything dishonest
 accepting this deal, or betting money at all (maybe find some
 non-monetary way of turning things, so he won't be frightened?)
(2) the JW actually being solvent and willing to pay when the time comes
 to pay his debt.
(3) such a loan contract holding in court, rather than be cancelled as fraud.

This now reminds me of Robin Hanson's obsession about putting betting markets
everywhere. How can we lower transaction costs so that it becomes possible
to actually bet on more and more topic?

I'm afraid this is how I see most of our predictions.  After watching the
moon landings, I regularly saw predictions of Moon bases by 1980, Mars bases
by 1990, flying cars in the year 2000. AI such as HAL was predicted to be
this year, as well as a manned mission to Jupiter.  I really thought I would
live to visit other planets, but now that hope seems unlikely unless a major
breakthrough in life-extension allows me to go farther into the future.

Predications such as these are routinely over-optimistic.  Although
technology is advancing at a phenomenal rate, most people underestimate the
inertia of most human's desires that things remain the same.  Our biggest
threat is not the inability of technology to progress, but the antagonism
most people feel toward technology.  Most people actively oppose all this
neat stuff we are talking about.

Look at what happened to the space program once people decided that we
didn't want a space race anymore.  Expect the same apathy toward other
technologies.  How fast can progress occur in a capitalist system if nobody
wants it?

Progress is not inevitable.  Progress is not popular.  Progress is not
likely.
We really are going to have an uphill battle to fight for the future.

I did carefully read your response.  Please allow that I just didn't
think that you were right.

Here was how you originally answered:

> However, this is not what Lee is really asking.  Note the pair of phrases: 
> "one", and "the other". What the father is really asking is "I have picked 
> one of my children (not necessarily at random). That child is a girl. What

But aren't we talking about the entire set of parents who could
truthfully say all this?  Isn't it true that of all those parents,
two out of three of them in reality have a boy too?

Of course, if he were to say "my oldest child is a girl...", or
"the one my mother likes best is a girl...", then we no longer
have distinguishable cases.  (My apologies Mark: I'm sure that
you already know that; I'm speaking to make sure that I'm not
misunderstood, and because I think that it is interesting.)

It's possible that your "focusing" query for linguists does indeed
somehow (it's by no means clear to me) isolate one of the children.

The rest of this post addresses Mark's question for linguists,
and in my opinion, has little mathematical interest.

I agree that it's likely that the person speaking has one
of them in mind, but not necessarily!  If you had two girls,
and someone asked you, "do you have a girl", you might say
yes immediately without thinking of either one.  You would
then be capable of saying "one is a girl!", "one is a girl!",
each subsequent time that you were asked.  So we can contrive
situations where someone might make the above statements
without thinking of a particular child.

[Yes, this is a linguistic, not a mathematical consideration.
In mathematics problems, as you know, it's not important to
consider what someone may or may not be mentally focusing on.
The hard facts are all that matter.  There is a certain

Some may claim that, and I cannot state categorically that they

Oops. Yes I did. Doh. Mea culpa.

Since I get an opportunity to complete my previous message,
note that Solomonoff's principle is an abstraction of actual learning
processes, that purposefully neglects the cost of finding what is
"the simplest". More effective induction models would take learning costs
into account. Also, in a more concrete model, asymptotic context-irrelevance
is not very interesting, unless it can be replaced by quantitative
non-asymptotic results. Reversible complexity measures (using reversible
algorithms rather than arbitrary ones) can provide better approximations
that take resource usage into account. When context is important, TAI
scientists have also developed notions of mutual complexity, common
knowledge, etc., to compare the informational content of contexts
relative to some common root. Anyway, what I mean to say is that it's a
fun field of science to explore, in which there are elegant mathematical
results that often prove useful to computer scientists or logicians,
that brings cybernetical insight, and has applications in computer learning.

Darn. When TUNES is reasonably working, I guess I ought to do more of TAI.

Exactly. It is a milleniarist meme I really get irritated at. It blocks
critical thinking because it both attracts us away from the present
concerns with its glorius light and blinds us with it. The credo that we
cannot know anything beyond it is an excuse for lazy thinking, and the
end time thinking it engenders is more of the type "when will it occur?"
than "what are the options?".

Exactly! This is my position too. That doesn't mean the rate of change
or lifespan could not become so great that we get to experience the
inflexion point of the grand sigmoid curve of history (if something like
that happens). 

I don't believe in phase transitions to posthumanity started by a tiny
nucleus (other than that ideas and inventions have to come from
somewhere, and this is where the entreprenurs of thought are needed),
they will encompass a large part of our society and economy. I use the
term "a swell" - a broad change across society, possibly taking quite
some time - rather than the elitist "spike" of a transition caused by
some single nucleus.

Spike brings up the "Unexpected Hanging" (see below).

The way I think of it, the prisoner wins if when the
judge comes into his cell, the prisoner is (a) not
surprised, and (b) can explain logically to the judge
why he is not surprised.  Otherwise, he loses.

Now the prisoner wins if, as Spike relates, the judge
shows up on Friday and says "ah ha!".  The prisoner
calmly retorts that since the sentence has to be carried
out on one of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or
Friday, (if it is to be carried out at all), and since
the first four are now impossible, the judge has failed
to surprise him, and so he must go free.

But would you believe the prisoner if you came for him
on Thursday, and he made the following argument? "Your
Honor, I knew that you would come today.  Why?  Because
it was clearly stated that you were to surprise me.  As
is easy to see, you could not surprise me if you came
tomorrow.  Therefore it was obvious, as soon as I got up
this morning, that today would be the day, so you have
failed to surprise me, so I get to go free."

Unlike Spike's claim, the resourceful prisoner says 
something quite similar, but more elaborate, on Wednesday
as well (since Friday and Thursday are clearly crossed
off as possibilites).

Explaining exactly where and how the prisoner goes wrong
isn't easy.

Suppose we distinguish intelligent beings by their abilities to change
the world to suit their desires. There likely exists some upper limit to
the possible powers set by physical law. The simplest singularity
scenario could be seen as the transition from a newly evolved and fairly
powerless species that is driven by its own self-interest to acquire
power over the world to a species that has reached a high degree of
control. The transition is fairly quick because power to affect the
world can be used to gain more power (although the complications of
self-modification and what cultural drives are necessary/influential
remains to be studied), and this leads to a quick (in evolutionary
terms) transition.

Maybe there exists several "phases" in the diagram. Suppose we have two
variables: power over the external world, and power over the form of the
species. The first limits the second to some extent, while the
autopotence of a species presumably could help it acquire more control.
Still, the classic fairly human but technologically advanced people of
much traditional sf could perhaps be seen as existing in a phase with
high external power but (possibly deliberately ignored) little
autopotence. The posthumans and SIs we discuss seem to exist in a phase
where autopotence has been dominant, leading to high degrees of internal
and external power. A purely protean species with limited external power
could be possible (and is another sf trope) but doesn't seem likely
since the ability to modify oneself is in the end limited by ones
ability to affect the world - we are after all subsets of it. 

In this scheme, a species could undergo two separate singularities: one
autopotent and one external. For example, first nanotechnology and later
perhaps femtotech are rapidly developed, creating a situation where we
have great control over the world but limited abilities to modify our
own cognition or create AI. After some unspecified interval this is
achieved, and a second self-modifying singularity occurs. The reverse
scenario might also occur. I don't consider these divided scenarios very
likely, but we might be seeing sequences of singularities.

In Orion's Arm we even played with the idea of a hierarchy of
singularity levels of intelligence, where the first singularity was
followed by new singularities at an ever increasing rate:

Exactly. It might be a very quick change which we doesn't notice anyway.

I wonder about heats of transition? The change in entropy between
different phases release or absorb energy. Some transitions might
require the addition of significant amounts of work to occur, while
other might be self-driving.

Tech prognostication is optimistic always in the short term,
laughably pessimistic always in the long term.

Consider further that predictions tend toward optimism when
there is a lot of attention focussed on a situation that is rapidly
changing.  One can make a lot of "money" in ideas futures by
understanding this phenomenon.  Consider the price curve of
the meme "computer defeats world chess champion."  Over
the years, the price of this meme went way up each time there
was a match, even when the experts were pretty much unanimous
that the human would win.  Drawing attention to the question
caused optimism that the computer would pull an upset.  It
did so, by the way, in spite of the expert's predictions, in 1997.

A more interesting question now would be: when might an
ordinary desktop computer (under $2k U.S), running commercial
chess software (under $200 U.S) defeat the reigning world
champion under match conditions?  Do you notice that the top
grandmasters are no longer reporting their results against the
best software?  I suspect that it is scalping them on a regular
basis these days.  That day of the $2k chess champion is nearly
upon us as the software evolves and the hardware just keeps
Moore-ing along.  spike

This is correct.  I would just like to expand on this a little bit by
stating that it is possible to compute the maximum possible accuracy of a
prediction for a given problem.  As you suggest, sufficiently complex
problems and sufficiently small predictors will produce an intelligent agent
that is provably unable to give a better prediction than you'd get by
flipping a coin.  

Somewhat counter-intuitively, you actually can get *better* results in some
cases with small predictors by flipping a coin than by using the predictor.
In these cases, one could easily claim that the predictor was in an
"irrational" state.  The "irrationality" (which really isn't much more than
an observer bias in many cases) is usually caused by insufficient
experiential data and/or insufficient predictor memory.  The "irrationality"
of the predictor is intimately related to the theoretical accuracy of the
predictor as mentioned above, and could possibly be quantified as the
deviation from the maximum for the given configuration.  When the
irrationality is sufficiently large, the trustworthiness of the predictor
plummets.

This is one of the de-facto reference texts on the subject, being heavily

This is the fundamental fallacy.

What matters, from a Bayesian perspective, is not how many parents *could*
say this, but how many of them *do* say it.  If half the parents have a
50% chance of saying this and half have a 100% chance of saying it, that's
different than if all the parents have a 100% chance of saying so - even
though, in both cases, all the parents "could" say it.

Out of all the parents who *could* say "At least one of my children is a
girl", 2/3 of them have a boy.  Out of all the parents who *do* say "At
least one of my children is a girl", 1/2 of them have a boy.

"Isn't easy" is, of course, relative to the explainer.

The prisoner can be fairly sure - say 99% sure - that the judge won't show
up on Friday, because even an idiot could see that wouldn't be a
surprise.  But the prisoner can only be 80% sure that the judge won't show
up on Thursday, because it takes brains to realize that crossing off
Friday makes Thursday certain.  If the judge hasn't shown up on Wednesday,
after all, the judge may just be the sort of really foolish person who
doesn't realize that showing up on Friday spoils the surprise, and may
hence fail to show up on Thursday.  As for Wednesday; well, on Wednesday,
even if you're sure the judge won't show up on Friday, you're pretty
uncertain as to whether he'll show up on that day or Thursday.  And on
Tuesday it's pretty much a complete surprise.

Incidentally - this occurred to me afterwards - this is not me saying,
"I'm a better explainer than you, nyah nyah."  This is me saying "I get
strongly annoyed when people say that things like this are hard to
explain."  It symbolizes a psychological disconnect.  Our instinctive
reactions, our automatic intuitions, carry all the necessary information. 
Trust your intuitions enough to verbalize them.

I think that Spike has nailed it   :-)

Perhaps the reason is the following.  Laughable optimism
characterizes the possible developments that are easy to
see coming.  So it was laughably optimistic, for example,
to believe that flying cars were immanent.

But in the long term, developments that couldn't have been
foreseen are the ones that dominate.  And that's why the
long term prognostications are laughably pessimistic.

I didn't realize that they were no longer reporting

can still reliably beat any commercial software.

I am sufficiently innocent of Bayesian statistics that I have to 
admit that anything is possible; if you're right, then there is
a demarcation between what mathematicians would or should say,
and what statisticians could or do say.   :-)

But why are the parents who *do* say "At least..."   different than
the parents who *could* say it?  The earlier idea, who *could* truthfully
say what, seems much easier to grasp.  As for what people do say, this
would seem to me to depend a great deal upon the particular situation.

For the same reason that the set of people who can jump off buildings is
different from the set of people who do jump off buildings.  I deny that
the distinction between "mathematician" and "statistician" is the right
one to make here.  The mathematician is not being confronted with the fact
that a person *could* say something but the fact that the person *did* say
something.  Now, if the mathematician were to ask the father "Is at least
one of your children a girl?" and the father answered "Yes", that would be
an *entirely different* matter.  In fact, I bet that if you presented the
riddle this way, a much larger percentage of the reasoners would get it
right the first time.

Hey, I just made a testable prediction!  Anyone want to try it?  Robin?

Yes, that's why I said that the riddle does not adequately specify the
priors.

Situations where those parents who have both a boy and a girl will choose
at random whether to say "At least one of my children is a boy" or "at
least one of my children is a girl".

Here is a problem that I left off my original post
because I thought that it was too similar to one of
the four.  But maybe not.  Possibly, it may clarify
the current discussion.

5.  There are two cards in a hat: one is red on one side
    and blue on the other side.  The other is red on both
    sides.  You reach into a hat and select one of the
    cards at random, and slap it down on the table.  If a
    red surface is now showing, what is the probability
    that the other side is red?

This is wonderful! Rather than gibe at the writer's failure to foresee
transistors, let's consider this a sort of drastically wrong-scale and
slightly too early view of Drexlerian nano-assembly matter complication.

Alternately, if people would just try to write some simple simulations,
or try a few direct experiments for things that can't easily be
simluated, when they have spent years beating their brains out about a
particular problem in a near void of actual data, much insight could
also be gained.

Actually, we were assuming that the host's strategy, or set of
strategies with probability of each, was known to the contestant.  This
would be a contestant coming into the game show after carefully
reviewing lots and lots of prior episodes, and maybe also sitting in
the audience for prior ones that season, or just asking contestants in
prior shows (perhaps in exchange for a small piece of the winnings).

Well said.  I would add that it can be good to verbalize them not just
to others, but also to oneself.  That way, one can know why one's
instincts lean a certain way, and know better when to trust them - and
when not to.

It's kind of like an AI, having come online and interacting with the
world, but created in a way such that the AI's programmers have no hope
of understanding the AI's code without help, trying to self-diagnose so
as to find out how the AI works, and maybe how to translate human minds
into AIs so they no longer have to worry about wetware faults.

Good work Adrian, but, I'm scratching my head, because it seems to me that
you missed the one sequence that represents the original puzzle.
Contestant chooses door.  Host chooses a nonprize door from the unchosen
two.  Contestant switches from his first choice to the other unrevealed
door.   

Am I missing something?

2/3

If you don't specify the color showing, it's 3/4, 4
possible sides, 3 of which have a red side opposite.

OTOH, your chance of getting the card with a blue side
is 50/50... the 2/3 results because you exclude 1/2
the times the card with the blue side is picked in
your initial conditions.

2/3, of course.  But just in case, I wrote a computer simulation to test
it, and it's still 2/3.  (I just needed a break from thinking in English

But the people who do jump really are wildly different

But problems that almost everyone gets right just aren't
much fun.  As my topology professor used to say, "you

Choose at random?  Here, I suspect, is where Bayesianism comes in.
The B statisticians are happy to assume certain priors when there
is no evidence for them.  Now, I've always liked that, and feel
that in many cases it is justified, because it enables them to
give answers to questions that others shy away from (complaining
of insufficient data, etc.).

But in some cases, like this, they start reading into situations
protocols that aren't needed to answer the question.  In this case,
as you say, they demand a "do" (and then have to conjure up what
could reasonably cause the "do").  Staying with *could*, on the
other hand---which mathematicians apparently are more prone to
do---obviates further assumptions.  One simply considers sets
and subsets, and so on, and defines probability accordingly.

But some things really are hard to explain!  Isn't it true,
for example, that some things are a lot harder to explain
over the phone?  Well, some things are hard to explain, period.
For example, I don't enjoy explaining why the earliest sunset
occurs weeks before the shortest day, and the latest sunrise
occurs weeks after the shortest day, simply because it's very
difficult to explain.  Has to do, I think, with the unobvious
amount of background material that is needed for some
apparently simple phenomena.

I don't quite understand the downside here.  The upside is that
for certain explanations, I can be forewarned that the going is
going to be rough...  (and so I can take a quick glance at my
watch and make a hasty exit :-)

Note the difficulty in finding out how the humans are
doing in the Harvard Cup, in which the top U.S.
grandmasters plus some slashers from overseas
gather semiannually to play rapid format against the
commercial software.  The percentages had reached
about 40% software until about 4 yrs ago,
when they stopped making the results public.
At that time they were using 200 MHz Pentium II
class processors.  I haven't been able to find a
Harvard Cup or equivalent carbon vs silicon
competition using the >1 GHz class of processors.

Or perhaps I just can't find those results, or
they are for sale somewhere, don't know for sure.
It could be that the top GMs now realize that they
are giving away their trade secrets by making those
games public.

>  But regardless, any grandmaster today

Monday's Chronicle quotes Vladimir Kramnik, the
young commie grandmaster that recently scalped
Garry Kasparov:  "We are in a very interesting phase,
when the strength of the best GMs and that of the best
chess programs run by the best processors are about
equal.  Nobody knows what will happen next."

I suspect I know what will happen next.  spike

Which is all fine and good except when it gives you the WRONG ANSWER.  In
this case, "could" may be more convenient (why?) but it is still the wrong
way to define the mathematical problem given the word problem.  Our entire
real world consists of "did", not "could".  "Could" is the rational
construct; "did" is the observed reality.  If you want to pose a
mathematical problem, you should use a pure mathematical language, or a
word problem with no flexibility in the priors.  To put it another way,
Bayesian probabilities automatically govern all problems that are posed in
real-world language, and if you want to pose a purely mathematical
question in that language, you need to eliminate any Bayesian
ambiguities.  If you don't, then somebody who gives a "common-sense but
wrong answer" that is actually correct gets to gloat over you instead of
vice versa.

Yes.  Quite right.  I apologize for what I wrote.  (I was in a
very bad mood, and still need to learn not to write email when
I'm like that.)  Not only should you write a program when you've
(temporarily) given up working on a problem, but, depending on
many factors, one might find the program more edifying.

The only danger that I know of, is that getting the answer 
sometimes causes people to believe that they understand the
answer.  Looking up the answer to an exercise in the back of
the book is exactly the same:  while often you oughtta, just
to make some progress, there still lies before you the goal
of actually understanding the exercise.

The Harvard Cup site says the tournament has not
been held since the sixth one in December of 1995 with
the playoff in May of 1996.

http://www.h3.org/HarvardCup/HarvardCup6.html

That tournament was about 35% silicon 65% carbon,
actually a better for result for the carbon units than the
previous tournament held a year earlier.

OK, so it was 133 and 166 Mhz Pentium Pros.  In
any case, since then we have had three generations
of processors and more than a factor of 10 improvement
in processor speed.  I saw a 1.7 Mhz P4 for sale at
Fry's last week for 1400 bucks.  I bet those machines
would scalp some the best carbon based players.

However, I now suspect some such tournament
must be taking place somewhere, behind closed
doors with the scores being kept secret for reasons
obvious to those handful of players in this world
who manage to make a living playing chess.

Of course, then we better reevaluate what we think. After all, we
transhumanists seem to be optimistic about both near and far
developments. Hence we better be more cautious about the near future and
the speed various transforming technologies appear, while our wild far
future extrapolations might be too *mild*.

I read that many years ago when I read Sir Arthur's book, quite avidly.  
Let's look at Herman Kahn's forecast's when he was involved at the Hudson 
Institute. I would say the 90% of his forecasts, turned up goose eggs. No 
cigar, and no home-based nuclear reactors. So what is holding back 
technological progress? Basically there is development and research money 
available, not as much as all the companies and universities want; but 
substantial sums, nevertheless.

I disagree that it is psychological human inertia. I believe that its simply 
most companies (World-Wide) tend to focus on rapid return on their capital 
investments. Regarding this, I have observed last Fridays' USA Today business 
section, which focused on the fact that many companies are now backing away 
from being a 'public' company and opting for private corporation, that do not 
sell stock and IPO's. This seems to be an emerging trend.

The things that have driven successful technologies, have been profit, wars, 
international competition, and climatic change, resource depletion 
(independent of climate) and accidental discoveries. Everyone on this list is 
well versed in these notions, but we can argue this contention later, if 
anyone wishes.

In a way, our technologies have achieved a level of comfortable living. Most 
of us, who are healthy enough, young enough, can note that most people in our 
respective countries are fairly contented, at least not driven to the point 
of demanding actions by the government en masse.' So, this is a quandary, 
that good living may dissipate the demand for progress.  Ah! But there are 
some intractable such as disease and aging and death. So we see that the 
Lion's share goes into medical research, which "may" be slowly paying off, if 
the new cancer therapy developed seems to indicate:

Science-Week (http://scienceweek.com)is a (not terribly expensive) pay-for 
weekly e-mail periodical, that I have a subscription to. Recently Science-
week has introduced a program whereby every subscriber can designate a 
second person to receive a copy of the e-mail for free, so long as the 
primary subscriber continues their subscription. I don't know of anyone 
who would benefit from a free subscription, so I'm asking the extropians. 
If you are interested in a free subscription to science-week, or know 
someone who is, let me know.  First come, first served.

PS:> I currently have a 3 year subscription, but I don't guaratee that 
I'll renew when that term has expired.

For the 3-door Monty problem, most humans intuitively compute 1/2.
Since the correct answer computes to 2/3, this problem's answer
goes against intuition (aka common sense).

You do not need any simulation, as the following discussion shows:

  A     B     C
+---+ +---+ +---+
|   | |   | |   | 
| 0 | | 0 | | 1 |
| 0 | | 1 | | 0 | 
| 1 | | 0 | | 0 | 
|   | |   | |   | 
+---+ +---+ +---+

Assume you choose door A.
Then Mr.Gameshow opens a door from the set {B,C},
namely the one with a zero behind it:

  A     B     C
+---+ +---+ +---+
|   | |   | |   | 
| 0 | | X | | 1 |	X = taken (equal to zero).
| 0 | | 1 | | X | 
| 1 | | 0 | | X |	(in last case, Mr.Gameshow could equally
|   | |   | |   |	 well choose 'B' as 'C'. 'C' taken here)
+---+ +---+ +---+

Now compute the number of '1's behind A
to the number of '1's behind B and C.

A contains 1/3 and B+C contain 2/3 (total = 3/3 = 1, naturally).

I do not see as "absolutely incomprehensible and unpredictable to
us-current, but within the constraints of the physical laws, but not
necessarily as we know them" can be seen as "too mild".

It's less a prediction than an admission that we can't make a prediction,
and hence shouldn't.

And for us who know you, it is both a good thing and very funny!

Maybe one could define personalities from what drugs leave the
personality invariant. I suspect I am a caffeine-invariant person.

Agreed in part.  I think it does behoove us to, not repent, but ask
ourselves some pretty deep questions about just what it is we wish to
achieve, who it is we as individuals and peoples are, what it is we wish
to become and most importantly how we might get there as peaceably as
possible from where we are today. 

The milleniarist theme strikes a chord of truth because we are coming up
on literally the end of the world as we know it.  What will we make
along the way and afterward though?   What are the central themes?  How
do we free ourselves from what is now enough to see with fresh eyes but
not free ourselves from all moorings so much we float off into fantasy
like so many hot air balloons?

Here I disagree.  The difference in capability and richness of
experience between technological haves and have nots will become so
great and the cost of technology will drop precipitously enough that the
technology will spread extremely quickly if we go the relative slow ramp
up by augmentation.  Add AI or NT and the curve becomes extremely
steep.  It is not elitism but simply the size and power of the coming
wave.  Whether a few doppler out of sight and change everything or the
masses rise that steeply and quickly is not very relevant to the size or
too its steepness.
The result will be substantially the same.

I humbly suggest we get on with "preparing the way" for what is coming
and with shaping it where we can.

Well, a geometry problem might be difficult to explain, if you don't
resort to a protocol that will help the other person draw the correct figure.
It's first a matter of having an expressive enough common protocol;
afterwards, it's a bandwidth problem that will determine communication speed.
Oh, and of course there's a prior information problem to determine if there
is enough information to transmit, and/or enough distributed information
for the new information to emerge out of the communication.

Reminds me of that Bastiat quote:

What a lot of trouble to prove in political economy that two and two make four;
and if you succeed in doing so, people cry, 'It is so clear that it is boring.'
Then they vote as if you had never proved anything at all.
	-- Frederic Bastiat, "What Is Seen and What is Not Seen", 1850

In that case, the problem lies in the rational ignorance of voters,
whence stems their ignorance of political economy.

One thing that throws everything out of kilter is, as you've 
suggested, expediency. The best tech may not win. The most logical 
progression may not happen. If, for instance, the best tech which 
leads to the most logical progression is owned by a company which is 
a complete blockhead, the tech loses out to something perhaps 
inferior and more expensive--but aggressively pursued by someone else 
who wanted the fastest way to make money from waiting customers. If 
it's the first or only option for the customers, the inferior tech 
may win and the prediction is out the window.

Politics and cultural factors bollix up predictions as well.
New discoveries, of course. And unforseen dead-ends.

Regarding earlier comments made that computers were beating grandmasters on 
a regular basis, I searched Usenet archives for the opinions of chess 
players re this idea, and they seemed to agree that no, generally, 
grandmasters were not usually beaten  by software. Also, there were many 
players, usually not the very top players, but very good players, 
nonetheless, whose *specialty* was beating computers, and that those players 
almost always beat the computer.

However, most good players usually lose to the best software, and of course, 
time, algorithms, and hardware march on....

One prescient Usenet comment remarked on how a chess tournament was recently 
won by a computer brought in by the Dutch team, and the poster asked, well, 
if they can win a tournament using a computer, what's next for the Dutch, 
winning the Olympics shotput competition by bringing in  a cannon?

Reminds me of the Hyperchess challenge. Instead of having two players, each 
side is allowed any configuration of teams, computers, Internet support etc. 
The challenge is not really the game, but to find effective methods of 
quickly collaborating.

DOUGLAS ADAMS (1952 - 2001)

LAMENT FOR DOUGLAS
By Richard Dawkins
[5.14.01]

This is not an obituary, there'll be time enough for them. It is not 
a tribute, not a considered assessment of a brilliant life, not a 
eulogy. It is a keening lament, written too soon to be balanced, too 
soon to be carefully thought through. Douglas, you cannot be dead.

A sunny Saturday morning in May, ten past seven, shuffle out of bed, 
log in to e-mail as usual. The usual blue bold headings drop into 
place, mostly junk, some expected, and my gaze absently follows them 
down the page. The name Douglas Adams catches my eye and I smile. 
That one, at least, will be good for a laugh. Then I do the classic 
double-take, back up the screen. What did that heading actually say? 
Douglas Adams died of a heart attack a few hours ago. Then that other 
cliché, the words swelling before my eyes. It must be part of the 
joke. It must be some other Douglas Adams. This is too ridiculous to 
be true. I must still be asleep. I open the message, from a 
well-known German software designer. It is no joke, I am fully awake. 
And it is the right - or rather the wrong - Douglas Adams. A sudden 
heart attack, in the gym in Santa Barbara. "Man, man, man, man oh 
man," the message concludes,

Man indeed, what a man. A giant of a man, surely nearer seven foot 
than six, broad-shouldered, and he did not stoop like some very tall 
men who feel uncomfortable with their height. But nor did he swagger 
with the macho assertiveness that can be intimidating in a big man. 
He neither apologised for his height, nor flaunted it. It was part of 
the joke against himself.

One of the great wits of our age, his sophisticated humour was 
founded in a deep, amalgamated knowledge of literature and science, 
two of my great loves. And he introduced me to my wife - at his 
fortieth birthday party. He was exactly her age, they had worked 
together on Dr Who. Should I tell her now, or let her sleep a bit 
longer before shattering her day? He initiated our togetherness and 
was a recurrently important part of it. I must tell her now.

Douglas and I met because I sent him an unsolicited fan letter - I 
think it is the only time I have ever written one. I had adored The 
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Then I read Dirk Gently's Holistic 
Detective Agency. As soon as I finished it I turned back to page one 
and read it straight through again - the only I time I have ever done 
that, and I wrote to tell him so. He replied that he was a fan of my 
books, and he invited me to his house in London. I have seldom met a 
more congenial spirit. Obviously I knew he would be funny. What I 
didn't know was how deeply read he was in science. I should have 
guessed, for you can't understand many of the jokes in Hitchhiker if 
you don't know a lot of advanced science. And in modern electronic 
technology he was a real expert. We talked science a lot, in private, 
and even in public at literary festivals and on the wireless or 
television. And he became my guru on all technical problems. Rather 
than struggle with some ill-written and incomprehensible manual in 
Pacific Rim English, I would fire off an e-mail to Douglas. He would 
reply, often within minutes, whether in London or Santa Barbara, or 
some hotel room anywhere in the world. Unlike most staffers of 
professional help lines, Douglas understood exactly my problem, knew 
exactly why it was troubling me, and always had the solution ready, 
lucidly and amusingly explained. Our frequent e-mail exchanges 
brimmed with literary and scientific jokes and affectionately 
sardonic little asides. His technophilia shone through, but so did 
his rich sense of the absurd. The whole world was one big Monty 
Python sketch, and the follies of humanity are as comic in the 
world's silicon valleys as anywhere else.

He laughed at himself with equal good humour. At, for example, his 
epic bouts of writer's block ("I love deadlines. I love the whooshing 
noise they make as they go by") when, according to legend, his 
publisher and book agent would literally lock him in a hotel room, 
with no telephone, and nothing to do but write, releasing him only 
for supervised walks. If his enthusiasm ran away with him and he 
advanced a biological theory too eccentric for my professional 
scepticism to let pass, his mien at my dismissal of it would always 
be more humorously self-mocking than genuinely crestfallen. And he 
would have another go.

He laughed at his own jokes, which good comedians are supposed not 
to, but he did it with such charm that the jokes became even funnier. 
He was gently able to poke fun without wounding, and it would be 
aimed not at individuals but at their absurd ideas. To illustrate the 
vain conceit that the universe must be somehow pre-ordained for us, 
because we are so well-suited to live in it, he mimed a wonderfully 
funny imitation of a puddle of water, fitting itself snugly into a 
depression in the ground, the depression uncannily being exactly the 
same shape as the puddle. Or there's this parable, which he told with 
huge enjoyment, whose moral leaps out with no further explanation. A 
man didn't understand how televisions work, and was convinced that 
there must be lots of little men inside the box. manipulating images 
at high speed. An engineer explained to him about high frequency 
modulations of the electromagnetic spectrum, about transmitters and 
receivers, about amplifiers and cathode ray tubes, about scan lines 
moving across and down a phosphorescent screen. The man listened to 
the engineer with careful attention, nodding his head at every step 
of the argument. At the end he pronounced himself satisfied. He 
really did now understand how televisions work. "But I expect there 
are just a few little men in there, aren't there?"

Science has lost a friend, literature has lost a luminary, the 
mountain gorilla and the black rhino have lost a gallant defender (he 
once climbed Kilimanjaro in a rhino suit to raise money to fight the 
cretinous trade in rhino horn), Apple Computer has lost its most 
eloquent apologist. And I have lost an irreplaceable intellectual 
companion and one of the kindest and funniest men I ever met. I 
officially received a happy piece of news yesterday, which would have 
delighted him. I wasn't allowed to tell anyone during the weeks I 
have secretly known about it, and now that I am allowed to it is too 
late.


Richard Dawkins, Daniel C. Dennett, Douglas Adams, Jared Diamond, Steven Pinker

The sun is shining, life must go on, seize the day and all those 
clichés. We shall plant a tree this very day: a Douglas Fir, tall, 
upright, evergreen. It is the wrong time of year, but we'll give it 
our best shot. Off to the arboretum.


* * * *

The tree is planted, and this article completed, all within 24 hours 
of his death. Was it cathartic? No, but it was worth a try.

'Virtual reality' is on horizon - really
http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/1,1249,270017782,00.html
      By 2020, you'll still be able to tell what's real from what's not. But
by 2030, as tactile immersion is achieved, there will be "no clear distinction
between virtual reality and reality," [Ray Kurzweil] said.
--------
The computer as we know it will become as obsolete as an 8-track cassette
because everything's getting smaller, Kurzweil said. Eventually, transistors
will be as small as a few atoms. Processing power is doubling every year. The
very near future holds "ubiquitous high bandwidth."
      As those factors merge, he said, we will be computing all the time,
though we won't use computers.

     Everything that can happen has already happened, not just once,
     but an infinite number of times, and will continue to do so forever.

Subject: Keith Henson case sentencing Wednesday May 16

Keith Henson is being sentenced on his 422.6 conviction on
Wednesday.  He has spoken with a probation officer with some
knowledge of the case, who has told him the political pressure
placed on the judge will result in the maximum sentence, a year
in prison.

Incidentally, the posts being used in deciding his conviction
weren't even written by Henson, but by someone else.

Here we have a conviction of "hate crimes" without hate, or a crime.

Now if this stands in California, anyone who posts articles to Usenet
that someone claims, no matter how unreasonably, somehow scares
them, can apparently get a conviction and put someone away based
on nothing more substantial than dislike.

In this particular case, it appears to be, piss off the Scientologists,
go to jail, and it doesn't even apparently matter whether you wrote
the posts in question or not.

In any case there will probably be very bad news in this case on
Wednesday.

       As those factors merge, he said, we will be computing all the time,

Children's Perceptions of Scientists
http://news.bmn.com/hmsbeagle/102/notes/adapt
"It's time to introduce children to some real scientists."

The wacky characters that introduce kids to science may be doing more harm
than good. Reinforcing the white-man-in-a-lab-coat or mad-scientist stereotype
could diminish not only children's interest in science, but also the diversity
of future scientific workplaces.

Not needed.  You were factually correct, IMO.  The answer in this case
is not one extreme or the other (pure thought or pure action), but
balance.

True.  But if one practices explaining it to oneself as one would
explain it to a novice, or a child (if that metaphor is clearer), then
one can find ways to explain it to others easier...and, not
infrequently, come to understand it better oneself.  At least, I have
used this technique myself when faced with confusing collections of
facts, and I feel that I understand those things better as a result,
though I am not certain how I could objectively test this.  I have
found that for even the most difficult problems, repeating this
technique has allowed me to eventually boil anything I have tried it on
down to layman's terms.  This happens most often through a combination
of finding commonly-used terms that adequately describe a concept, of
finding commonly known concepts with a small and clearly describable
set of differences from the concept being explained, and of determining
what large sections of complexity can be reduced to a few statements
while hiding the details from the basic explanation (with the
understanding that, if those details are desired, they can be requested
after the basics are digested).

I was leaving that one out since I thought everyone already knew that
one, but since you asked...

Case E: Host reveals a door other than the one the contestant picked.
If the contestant picked a non-prize, host reveals the other non-prize,
and contestant switches (thus to the prize).  If contestant picked the
prize, host reveals a random non-prize, and contestant switches to the
other non-prize.

Subject: Lagrangian multipliers and neural learning?
Sender: owner-extropians@extropy.org

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

I am not an expert of neural networks and AI, but I am
interested in them know some of the most basic ideas there.
I am curious about the opinion and thoughts of the gurus
in this list on the (possible) connection between neural
learning and Lagrangian optimization.

Recently, worked on some very new and cute
optimization algorithms using sophisticated Lagrangian 
relaxation techniques, which seems to be a topic 
becoming more and more recognized in areas outside 
the classical nonlinear optimization to which they belongs 
historically. These methods based on a duality between
two types of variables: the original ones and the 
so called "Lagrangian multipliers" which may be familiar
to some of you from elementary analysis courses.
Generally they are much more useful than a simple 
optimization method learnt there. There is huge theory
about them with deep results and a lot of applications.

An interesting thing about them (to me) is that they seem
to be closely related to neural learning algorithms, since
this lagrangian multipliers can be interpreted as a 
weighting of some components of the dual of the objective
function. So during the algorithms, this dual variables
punish the "bad" variables by increase their weight, so
the algorithm can learn that they are "dangerous" and
should not increase (or decrease) them.

Of course this description was highly surficial and far
from being scientific.

I also know that AI consists of much more than neural 
learning, but this is also considered to be a possible 
component of a future AI.

My question: is this connection recognized and exploited
by the researchs of AI?
Do they use the results and strength of the theory and 
methods of Lagrangian relaxation  explicitly or implicitely?

(It is well possible that this connections are already 
discovered and heavily used by AI experts: I am a newbie
in this terrain.)

Thanks, Christian Szegedy

As I said in my last message, "I was making a *normative* argument about
rational beliefs, not a descriptive model of actual beliefs."  If there
are constraints on what beliefs are rational, then upon discovering
that your beliefs violate those constraints, you should want to change
your beliefs to avoid those violations.  This sort of change seems
perfectly rational to me, even if it violates a naive Bayesianism.

I don't follow you.  My short paper http://hanson.gmu.edu/priof.pdf
describes uberpriors as q_i, where the i subscript allows different
people to have different uberpriors.  I do not require q_i = q_j.

the problem is that a factor of 10 improvement doesn't buy you much in
chess since the tree to be searched is exponential.  Algorithms and
evaluation improvements make a much bigger difference.

They are played and (some at least) are not behind closed doors.  There
was a recent match between 10 IMs and GMs versus Deep Fritz and Deep
Junior (two very strong programs, Fritz and Junior, running on Quad PIII
1Ghz.  It has become a custom to prepend Deep on any program when it runs
on multiprocessors), and the computer pair won 15-5 or something along
those lines.  Deep Junior also took part in a super-GM tournament recently
(super-GMs mainly being top 20 people) and came fourth with 50% score.
There is a match coming up (or just happened, dunno, haven't been keeping
up) between Kramnik (current world champion) and either Junior or Fritz.
Kramnik is a computer specialist though, so he is supposed to win.  Both
Junior and Fritz have FIDE ratings that would put them in the top twenty,
and they play quite a bit of tournaments.  Shredder, the current computer
champion, doesn't play much though.

I don't have an answer to the question, but I do have a book I would
recommend.  I look forward to reading it myself:

Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks:
Steps toward Principled Integration

Edited by Vasant Honavar & Leonard Uhr

The material seems thorough and extensive.  The sections are:
1. Symbol Processors versus Connectionist Networks
2. Representation and Inference
3. Vision
4. Language
5. Learning

I hope this helps,

Leonardo

Dear all,

I am happy to announce a very special speaker for TransVision 2001:
Peter Houghton, who was the first person in the world to have had
implanted an artificial heart pump powered by an external battery -
the Jarvik 2000 (see
http://www.channel4news.co.uk/home/20000908/Story02.htm).

An abstract for his talk "An Early Transhuman?" can be found at
http://www.transhumanismus.de/TV2001/program.html#houghton.

Best wishes,

Frank

Any expert French speakers here?

In my dream, I (or the viewpoint character) was in a busy room with (I
suppose) a hard bitten French woman journalist sitting behind a monitor.
She said something brusque about some news that was in LUH-cong, the `ng'
being that glottal stop thing that the French do in names like Lacan. I
didn't know what she meant (it didn't occur to me that she meant `Lacan',
elaborate game-playing psychoanalyst of dreams), and she showed me the
screen or maybe the paper: L'Econ. Shorthand for the French translation of
The Economist newspaper (I don't know if such a thing actually exists). I
was surprised, because I'd never heard anyone say it in French, and in my
monoglot ignorance would have expected it to be something like
`Leck-onee-MEEST'. When I woke up I was struck by the multi-levelled
quality of this sequence, the depths of hidden or implied processing
involved. *Would* a French speaker utter L'Econ like that?

Clarke's rule: long term predictions are always too pessimistic.

Extropians corollary:  long term predictions are always too
pessimistic, even when Clarke's rule is taken into account.

I suspect the long term future will have at least some aspects
that are beyond our current imaginations.  spike

Extropes,

Interesting article at:

http://www.eurekalert.org/releases/uor-nlb051401.htmlhttp://www.eurekalert.o
rg/releases/uor-nlb051401.html

New light-based computer runs at quantum speeds

A simple computer that marries the mind-boggling computing power of quantum
mechanics with the ease of manipulating light has been built by researchers
at the University of Rochester. The device proves that a specific quirk of
atoms, which lets scientists conduct huge computations almost instantly,
can be perfectly mimicked by light, which is much more practical to control
than individual atoms.

What makes the device particularly attractive is that it is so simple in
comparison to quantum computers.

			Best, Jeff Davis

Marlow's Axiom of the Long Term: All talk of a long-term contains an 
unwarranted assumption and is therefore unduly optimistic.

Define long-term, in a practical sense. Is 500 years too soon for Star Trek 
level technology, 5000 years, 50,000 years, or 5 million?  There are 
certainly maturation's of technologies, which either produce plateaus of 
capability, as well as slow and fast evolutions of capability. Revolutions 
tend to be fewer and farther between. We need some guides, some examples, to 
help us properly measure what is achievable and what it will take to gain 
that achievement. In an Aristotelian sense we need something that is neither 
the fantastically, optimistic "hand-waving" of magazine peddling journalists, 
nor the vituperative, pessimism of the leftists and anti-tech sociopaths.

No. We pronounce the world as we spell it:
\'e (e with acute accent) is like the e in petty,
  l'\'e is like lay pronounced without the final y sound.
co-no-mist is pronounced pretty much like in english, except with a french
 accent, and stressing very slightly the last syllable instead of stressing
 strongly the "co".

I am thinking of something similar. I have spent far too mych time trying to 
give a strict derivation of the Bayesian confidence propagation neural 
network (my professor invented it, but has never got around to make a 
satisfying derivation - which is bad for getting *my* papers on it published 
;-), and my current best bet is that it can be derived as some kind of 
lagrangian multiplier formalism where some information measure (maybe B-L 
dimension) is optimised under the constraint of some other information 
measure (maybe entropy).

I have not seen much of it, but I recall some derivations in Haykin's Neural 
Networks that used the multipliers. That doesn't prove much, since he is 
rather fond of using excessive math to derive simple networks (the chapter of 
radial basis functions is amazing - he uses Green's functions and functional 
analysis! Talk about sharpening pencils with millstones).

What do you think of the recent paper in Science claiming these major
collapses of civilization were linked to major detrimental climactic change?
(usually extended droughts, IIRC)

I find this persuasive but only up to a point. The impact of major climactic
change on civilisation is seriously understudied - my udergraduate history
tutor Geoffrey Parker was an early exponent of the idea that we ought to pay
more attention to the history of the weather. The problem I have is that not
all civilisations collapse or regress when faced with a serious natural
disaster or climate change so there has to be another element in the
explanation as well. The Mayans are a good case in point: they clearly faced
serious ecological problems but they had other problems as well, to do with
their social/political organisation.

Isn't it a bit more complicated? The big problem with explaining something
IMO is 1. what prior knowledge you assume on the part of the explainee 2.
what vocabulary is avaiable for you to explain it in simple terms (what
building blocks you have) The two clearly interact. One of my worst ever
experiences was trying to explain to an American what a "googly" is. Took me
an entire afternoon, much drawing of diagrams and an exposition of the
entire laws and basis of the game of cricket. The simple explanation "It's
an offbreak bowled with a legbreak action" wouldn't do! That case also
reveals another problem, misleading or irrelevant knowledge on the part of
the explainee - it's more difficult to explain cricket to an American
because they have misleading notions derived from baseball (exactly the same
in reverse by the way).

Ah, wonderful!  I truly cannot wait to hear it!  It looks like the 
Extroversions CD may have to be an "EP" for various reasons, but I will 
still make sure it is released at the conference.  I have been chomping at 
the bit to record my latest composition (aptly titled "Shaping Things to 
Come"), but my computer has decided to freeze each time I try to run Cubase 
or Cakewalk, my composition programs.  I will probably purchase a second 
hand computer tomorrow, though, which should logically alleviate the problem.

"Molecular Funk" has got to be one of the best titles I have heard in 
years.  One of my compositions-in-progress is called "Nebula Oblongata."

I'll let you know which selection(s) I choose after I listen to them all.

                                                         Best,

                                                                 -E. Shaun

I encountered problems with tracks 2, 8, and 11 (see below) which are in
in a non-ISO extension of Layer-3 called "MPEG 2.5" from the Fraunhofer
Gesellschaft. Apparently they only deliver code to handle it under Microsoft
Windows, which would make those tracks effectively only available for such
a platform.

True.  On the other hand, just by talking to a number of people, one
should be able to form a rough idea of the general public's knowledge
level in a given area.  It helps to customize per audience.

No, because "offbreak" and "legbreak" are also unfamiliar to your
target audience, as kinda is "bowled" in this context, so just expand
them out.  How about "a ball with spin put on it when tossed towards
the wicket behind the batsman, so that it starts off veering away from
the batsman's side of the wicket then bounces off the ground and goes
towards the batsman's side"?  Here, "wicket" and "batsman" are the
generic objects that can be explained further on request; their main
relevance here is their position relative to each other and the ball.

(This, BTW, is someone totally unfamiliar with cricket looking up the
terms in the first cricket dictionary Google returned:
http://home.sprynet.com/~hotoff/crickgl.htm .  I left off the "with a
legbreak action" because it seems intuitively that an offbreak action
and a legbreak action would be similar - just mirrors of each other -
by default, thus adding in that part of the definition adds unnecessary
complexity, unless there is some other type of action this must be
differentiated from.)

Probably easier to model someone with no preconceptions - say, a remote
African villager who has never heard of cricket or baseball.  If you
know there is misleading or irrelevant knowledge, try to steer your
explanation away from metaphors that would invoke same...or, if the
knowledge is greatly similar (and, honestly, cricket and baseball are
much more similar than, say, cricket and elephant herding), it may be
worthwhile to explain only the differences - but *only* those
differences that are directly relevant to what you wish to explain.
(For instance, the fact that a bowler must not straighten the elbow
while bowling, or the existence and roles of any players save the
bowler and batsman, is not directly relevant to defining a 'googly'.)
Remember: adding details makes the explanation take longer, and more
importantly, makes it harder to follow, so in the first pass, only add
those details you need.  (Of course, balance this with the fact that
the details must remain available for the inquisitive, but only after
they have digested the beginning to their satisfaction.)

Now located at Transhumanist Arts Center, we have a new page for extropian
musicians:

http://www.extropic-art.com/music.htm

You can read a biography of E. Shaun, and the history of his fascinating
background.

Very soon Emlyn's experiences will be available, which I think will prove to
be captivating. (eta - tonight!)

We will feature more artists as their works come in link to Extropian Music
at mp3 for listening.

Knowing the person behind the music, the nuances of his unique creativity,
her thoughts while composing, why she chooses one medium over another, or
how he combines mediums for a unique effect -- bring us closer to the
artists' original insight and talent.

This is a new page, so please enjoy the early formation.

Natasha

The usage of the technique for database searches seems contrived.

They are using a quantum O(k) algorithm to replace normal O(k) methods 
(e.g. linear hashes), and it wouldn't even address the more useful O(log) 
methods (e.g. B*tree) that can be used for things like indexing for range 
scans.  And in any case, the large collection of indexing algorithms 
currently known tend to be extremely scalable on normal hardware for the 
most part.  The biggest benefit from the quantum technique is that it might 
save space normally allocated for indexes.  In most real world cases, the 
benefit of a quantum database lookup might be a small increase in retrieval 
performance, which I suspect is probably not worth the additional cost of 
the special hardware (as opposed to just buying faster/bigger ordinary 
hardware).  I guess I just don't see a real benefit in this type of case; 
if the entire computer was already a quantum optical system, then I would 
expect the databases to already support this feature where it made sense.

Quantum techniques would seem to be much more useful for exhaustively 
sifting key spaces that are too large to actually be stored anywhere, or 
for which a physical record doesn't need to exist.

Yo Greg,

I don't know if you intended this post for the list, but in case you did and
are going public send info about your music to us and I'll add it to the
Extropic Art/Music Web page.  (We focus on musicians + aesthetics :-)

I'm thinking that Shaun's CD net.release premiere will be right before
Extro-5.

(Side to Shaun: Pssst,correct me if I'm wrong.)

Thanks, Mark.  I wish that my responses were instrumental in
advancing that cause.  But I'm quite far behind many I know,
of whom, it's inconceivable that they would ever have been
found engaging in the excesses that so mar our exchanges, e.g.,
flame wars.  Somehow, one wants to be able to model the mindset
of an individual who will read everything that one writes in the
worst possible light.  That doesn't sound generous; but I'm
afraid that it's true---at least true of vastly more of us than
one would have thought.

When I wrote condescendingly, "The flaw in your argument is ...",
I was translating from what would have happened had we been discussing
the problem over, say, dinner.  Listening to your explanation, I
might have suddenly said, "Ah, but what's wrong with that is...",
and given my tone of voice and general demeanor, it's certain that
you wouldn't have been bothered for an instant.  But (as has been
pointed out so many times) all those signals are absent in email,
and I guess that one must merely try harder to rephrase so as to
make one's actual attitude clear.  Maybe there can be a list of
phrases to avoid:

1.  "The flaw in your argument..."

2.  "Perhaps you've noticed..." (when it's something the
    person probably already knows)

3.  "That's a common misperception..." (about what someone
    just wrote)

4.  "*We* believe that ..." (when the speaker could possibly
    be read as belonging to an elite)

5.  "I used to think that too."

and there are probably many more that can be found examining some
email exchanges.

But the cause may be hopeless.  Look again at my first sentence:
"Thanks, Mark.  I wish that my responses were instrumental in..."

Why, there's even a hidden implication there that *Mark's* input
was not!  So as a practical measure, one simply must learn not to
react.  Somehow.

It's very much more convenient not to have to specify hypotheses.
But more importantly, from the statement "I have two children and
one is a girl", we don't (in mathematics) have to think about
whether or not King Herod has been ordering parents of girls
to appear somewhere and give evidence, or whether a parent flips
his children into the air and reports on the one that lands first,
or whether some entirely other real-world procedure was employed.
Mathematics is the art of abstracting away all of that.  Moreover,

the art of mathematical problems consists in finding the relevant
pure abstract situation that applies.

>Our entire real world consists of "did", not "could".  "Could"
>is the rational construct; "did" is the observed reality.

Well, not quite.  Should we go further and find out an empirical
answer to the question "What did the mathematician say?"?  After
all, (talking about the real world), how many people really *do*
take such a statement to a mathematician?  Should we go test 
whether the random processes employed were reliable?  (Real
statisticians would!)  The whole situation of my problem is
clearly contrived, and even meant to be funny (like what kind
of idiot would take his doubts about the sex of his unborn
child to a mathematician)?

In the real world, statisticians get real problems from real
customers.  It is expected that they will thoroughly research
any number of hypotheses, often taking weighted averages of
what they find, in order to submit the most probably guess
about a real world phenomenon.  This is admirable, of course,
but it is entirely different from the world of asking little
mathematics puzzles.

>If you want to pose a mathematical problem, you should use a

>in the priors.

Again, whether or not the priors are flexible is a question that
I've *never* seen in mathematics problems.  This is definitely
a statisticians approach.  Ask mathematicians "what are the priors?"
and in many cases you'll get a blank look; only those, I submit,
who are acquainted with statistical procedures will instantly know
what you are talking about.

>To put it another way, Bayesian probabilities automatically

Right.  Hopefully no one would think "a man, uncertain what the
sex his unborn child was, decided to consult a mathematician" is
a real world problem.

I'm sorry; you're quite right.  *Gloating* is never justified,
and the real purpose of cute mathematical problems is the same
as the purpose of any interesting tidbit that one might want
to throw out.  We're not trying to just show off; we expose our
beliefs to criticism, and also hope that there will be an
exchange of wisdom.  We hope to be enlightened.

Well, this has been enlightening indeed!  All my life I felt 
deprived because I didn't know what the controversy surrounding
the "Bayesians" and "Non-Bayesians" was, and at one point, it
was the only intellectual controversy I knew of that I felt 
excluded from.  Perhaps I've finally gotten involved.  

Even better, my problem about the man who didn't know the sex
of his unborn child---and I elided a sentence about how he wanted
a boy, and so "cleverly" went to a mathematician---now evidently
has even richer structure:  it can be used to explain the difference
between a Bayesian and a Non-Bayesian approach.  Only one question
remains:

> (Vorlon voice:) "We are all Bayesian statisticians."

'zat so?  You mean I missed out on the controversy after all?  :-(

You can sub in "illustrating previously unknown reasoning techniques" for
"gloating" if you so prefer.  My point is that someone who answers "I bet
you think it's 1/3, but it's actually 1/2" is demonstrating deeper
knowledge than someone who answers "1/3", just as someone who answers
"1/3" probably has more (declarative!) knowledge than someone who guesses
"1/2".

There are non-Bayesians?  I've never heard of any non-Bayesians or any
"controversy".  Where I come from, "Bayesian reasoning" is practically a
synonym for "normative rationality".

Maybe you're right.  Maybe a *mathematician* answers 1/3 - the problem was
posed about mathematicians, after all.  And I bet that a statistician
answers 1/3 as well.  However, a sufficiently alert cognitive scientist
should answer 1/2.

So now we have *four* possible answers:

"1/2." (naive human)

"1/3." (naive mathematician)

"You'd think it'd be 1/3, but it's actually 1/2." (bayesian)

"It's actually 1/2, but all but the most alert mathematicians would answer
1/3." (actual answer)

No - I just mean that the human brain runs on folk bayesian reasoning
rather than folk mathematics.  No, scratch that, that's a lousy sentence. 
What I mean is that, in this instance at least, the Bayesian answer is
much closer to the way our brains work than the mathematical answer.

Actually, the official Net release will be right *after* the conference, as 
opposed to right before.  This will give Extro-5 attendees a leg up on the 
rest.  There will most likely be a booth outside the conference room at the 
Hilton with the cds for sale.

By the way, I thought that Greg's post was directly to me, and therefore my 
response was supposed to be directly to him, rather than to the list.  As a 
result it came across a bit more personal than usual...I'll try to use 
better judgment next time. ;-)

I love the idea of citing Dr Pournelle as a guide to tact. Ah, this list!

I understand your suggestion of many threats to human and biotic existence, 
be a Spike or a Nuke or Global Warming or whatever.  

We may indeed wind up in the shit can of annihilation, but that has been 
pimped before by many journalists and Paul Ehrlich in the Population Bomb, 
the Club or Rome, and the rest, including neonazi survivalists of the 1980s 
and such.  I would suggest that the human species will survive, and that it 
may, well, have to deal with problems, that have to do with dealing with 
"Skynet scenarios."

I hold with George Dyson's more convivial view that we will be part of what 
makes SIAI work, but it will take astronomically, more computational power, 
then even Kurzweil has suggested. For example; look how much computer 
capability have increased over the last 20 years, and it is having an impact, 
but nothing that has approached the science fiction of a William Gibson, or a 
Bruce Sterling.  

We do suck at environmentally friendly technology for energy and using raw 
materials. That is largely a part of the marketplace, and how it interweaves 
with human psychology. Why split water for hydrogen fuel cells, if gasoline 
is so cheap (circa 2000)?  Why make hydrogen fuel cells, if the old, IC 
engine is the only thing to drive? You get the idea, its all linked.

Pessimism as such, seems to be worse for a society, especially a democracy 
(republic) then optimism. People who are pessimistic settle for less and are 
less critical of their "leadership." People can also turn to psychotic types 
of leadership, out of a sense of desperation.

I think what is needed is honesty, less bullshit from journalists and 
scientists and promoters of this or that. Or if they are promoters of X or Y, 
let them state it clearly.
Peter Jennings is happy to editorialize (American Broadcasting Company) while 
he reads the news. Verification of what he claims, is often a harder matter 
to obtain.
We need honesty to make good choices.

Ive accidentally replied to the list a few times, both extropians
and other lists.  Ive taken to always writing personal replies
in all lower case.  That removes ambiguity and tips people
that the post is intended as offlist.  spike

Star Dreck technology? A curious mix of magic physics and retro.

Superluminal travel, but no automation in battle. Monkeys
frozen in slowtime as flies encased in amber. No telepresence. 
No augmented reality. No robotics. Antiquated communication 
technology, yet no relativistic lag. Almost bare-handed 
handling of antimatter. Nanotechnology, but still people 
around. Nanotechnology, but ridiculously stupid, brittle 
computers. Moronic SOPs. Inconsistent treatment of existing 
technologies. Random regression from one episode to another.
Here today, and gone tomorrow, substituted by another shiny
bauble.

Instances of magic physics: forcefield, traktor beam, superluminal
drive, transporter. Hints that apparent limitations of physical 
laws are just applicable to beginner civilizations (superciv 
trickster figure Q).

Diagnosis: not a technology forecast but just space opera 
for monkeys. Doing lots of harm by scrambling (especially
young) people's expectations of what is physically possible, 
and what is not, what is easy, and what is hard. 

Recommendation: Producers of the series to be the first
to be put up against the wall, come the revolution.

Clearly stated: I'm a promoter of nanotechnology as the solution to 
most of our problems and the means to the realization of most or all 
of our aspirations.

Clearly stated: I think more likely the damned thing will kill us all-
-so I'm a bit ambivalent about speeding things up.

  :)

And, obviously, there'll be no stopping it, so we might as well face 
the beastie and do our best.

I also think it entirely conceivable that a completely nonbiological 
consciousness (which is what most seem to be thinking of when they 
refer to AI/SI) may be flat-out impossible. "Self-awareness" as 
generally discussed in relation to AI/SI is not consciousness.* A 
computer which interprets data and makes logical decisions based upon 
those data is not displaying consciousness. A computer which passes 
the Turing Test is a parlor trick; the test itself is meaningless 
because its definition of intelligence is meaningless.

You may well ask for a definition of consciousness.
Well, hey--if you gotta ask...

jm

*Simple example: Computer detects heat which will damage its 
components, and eliminates the heat source or moves components away 
from it. Another: Computer discovers way to improve its source code 
(because it has been programmed to do just this), and does so. This 
is "consciousness?" I think not.

Of course, consciousness is not a necessary component of the SkyNet 
scenario.

"Professor Goddard does not know the relation between action and 
reaction and the need to have something better than a vacuum against 
which to react. He seems to lack the basic knowledge ladled out daily 
in high schools." - 1921 New York Times editorial about Robert 
Goddard's revolutionary rocket work. 
"Space travel is utter bilge!" -Sir Richard Van Der Riet Wolley, 
astronomer 
"Space travel is bunk" -Sir Harold Spencer Jones, Astronomer Royal of

"This foolish idea of shooting at the moon is an example of the 
absurd lengths to which vicious specialisation will carry 
scientists." -A.W. Bickerton, physicist, NZ, 1926 
"We choose to go to the moon not because it easy, but because it is 
hard." --John F. Kennedy

"There is not the slightest indication that nuclear energy will ever 
be obtainable. It would mean that the atom would have to be shattered 
at will." -- Albert Einstein, 1932 
"The more important fundamental laws and facts of physical science
 have all been discovered, and these are now so firmly established 
that the possibility of their ever being supplanted in consequence of
 new discoveries is exceedingly remote.... Our future discoveries must 
be looked for in the sixth place of decimals." 
- physicist Albert. A. Michelson, 1894

I for one am not so bold. We have seen so little of what's out there.

Reminds me of good old Ben Franklin, who wrote in his autobiography:

"(blockquote "
I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradictions to the sentiments of
others, and all positive assertion of my own.  I even forbade myself the use
of every word or expression in the language that imported a fixed opinion,
such as "certainly", "undoubtedly", etc.   I adopted instead of them "I
conceive", "I apprehend", or "I imagine" a thing to be so or so; or "so it
appears to me at present".

When another asserted something that I thought an error, I denied myself the
pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing him immediately some
absurdity in his proposition.  In answering I began by observing that in
certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the present
case there appeared or semed to me some difference, etc.

I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations I
engaged in went on more pleasantly.  The modest way in which I proposed my
opinions procured them a readier reception and less contradiction.  I had
less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily
prevailed with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I
happened to be in the right.
")"

NB: Yay, it's a LISP markup language. Down with SGML, HTML and XML!
Oops, I meant, "I apprehend that markup languages based on <tags>
might not be as much of a progress as generally believed they are,
considering that LISP had SEX long ago (*), that seems to me like
they already provide at least some of the structural power of SGML,
and maybe much more -- so it appears to me at the moment."
Or maybe I really meant "{SG,HT,X}ML *SUCK*!", after all (hi, Curl!).

(*) and still has it -- must be tantric.


Well, I happen to know a few living persons who are as good as
that dead Benji fellow, but I admit my puny attempts to emulate them
failed miserably. I suppose it's both a matter of temperament,
and one of the milieu in which you were raised, and how the debates
you took place in or were faced with were framed when you were young,
at which point I have said a tautology: "yay, there are both
inborn and acquired factors" -- doh! Of course, as transhumanists,
I suppose some of you think this is something that can be amended
by suitable self-modification techniques, at which point I'm interested
in hearing about what are these techniques and how to use them.

Another question raised by such considerations is that of the functions
of expression in general and through email conversation in particular.
Who are we writing for?
* Is it just for ourselves, readers not withstanding?
* Is it for those who dare and accept to reply to us?
* Or are we writing for the silent mass of readers? (And goddess knows
 most readers don't write -- I know it because I met her, and she sets
 an example.)
And maybe more pertinently, WHAT are we writing for?
* Is it just as an irrepressible urge?
* Is it a way to induce an emotional effect?
* or a way to build theories?

Now, you can combine mostly combine the WHO and the WHAT:
** Are we just letting words out without any specific purpose,
 "expressing ourselves in a conversational way", as was argued,
 just like we breath or piss?
** Are we trying to affirm our personality in some territory,
 looking for reinforcing (positive or negative) signals that help
 us define our own position?
** Are we fulfilling an urge to tell something we think should be said
 by someone, somewhere, since noone else since to be doing it, we ought
 to be that person? (why are you suddenly staring at me?)
** Are we trying to satisfy our self-esteem by proving ourselves
 how we can write such cool messages?
** Are we trying to induce some well-being or unease or more specific
 emotion in specific people, or otherwise trolling for some reaction?
** Are we trying to spread our practical memes,
 leading people to act in some way? [Let's all fight the CoS!]
** Are we trying to crystallize our thoughts by going through
 the constraining process of writing them into a coherent message?
** Are we trying to gather argumentive information from other people,
 so as to enhance our model of the world.
** Are we trying to disseminate higher memes,
 that constitute our view of the world?

Of course, a same message can have several of these functions (and more)
at once. Actually, these "functions" are more like analytic points of view
we can have on a message than actual synthetic mecanisms that lead to the
message being emitted. Although I'd be very much interested in hearing
some AI guru discuss how his purported AI's communications can be analyzed
through this grill, and what underlying synthetic mecanisms can be
identified.

Enough rant for today. See the mindflow, from politeness to AI,
through LISP, sex, self-modification, the functions of language,
and ending with recapitulation?

I used to simply point out "You are in error.", but lately various persons
have pointed out that one must pamper the egos of humans and not state facts
too directly.

So now I use "There exists different opinions on that." instead.

Have you noticed that in the science fiction pulp mags, as well as books, its

Producers, being full members of the privileged class, will probably control

If it turns out that productivity increases over the next 10 to 20 years faster
than what most of today's bankers and bond traders think it will, what would
be the implications for current  long term interest rates, should it be higher
or lower than it is? I would think higher but  I'd like to hear what some of the
real economists on the list have to say.

In case ya hadn't noticed, Rod's advice to Renner was humor- but having
met Jerry several times, I have to admit he does the crotchety old man
schtick pretty darned well.  Larry Niven, on the other hand, is just as
irreverent and wiseass as Kevin Renner.  On the gripping hand, Niven &
Pournelle  work very well together.

Althought it no longer reflects my opinions about future growth rates,
http://hanson.gmu.edu/fastgrow.html offers a simple model adequate for this.
Interest rates should equal a preference discount rate plus a factor
proportional to the growth rate in consumption.  If productivity rises
faster, consumption will rise faster, and so interest should be higher.

The problem is not special effects. They have plenty of that, and in fact could
do with a lot less. The problem is to hire decent technical advisers, and *listen*
to what they're saying. (Provided, you're a perfectionist, and intend to satisfy
both the 100 ppm geeks as well as the average global village idiot. Otherwise,
disregard this fortune cookie).

Open source designs. Not necessarily a silver bullet, but a veritable pocket

That's the supply-side.But isn't there a demand-side effect too?  If global 
productivity rises more quickly, that should bump up global discount rates 
as well.  This will result in given marginal investments becoming undesirable 
and pushing down the demand curve.  That would actually reduce rates.  
The net effect would depend on the slopes of the supply and demand curves, 
right?
(As well as complicated results on discount rates, since a rich capitalist 
will
no change *his* discount rate due to labor productivity - he makes money 
from capital; his labor is negligible.  If *all* investment came from such 
people then I think effects would be as Robin describes.)

What happens if the market is wrong about
long-term productivity?  30-bonds obviously entail an consensus assumption 
that productivity growth will remain decided pedestrian for that period.
Rates don't go up until people realize productivity will continue to increase.

(I'm assuming John's referring to labor productivity.  If capital productivity
goes up, that's  a direct increase in the value of investments and more 
reason to expect a increase in interest rates.)

A frightening article from http://www.newscientist.com...
Here is an excerpt:

".......
Gene data reveals that further waves of human deaths due to mad cow disease 
are likely


Further waves of deaths from the human form of mad cow disease look 
increasingly inevitable, following new genetic studies in mice.

These show that mice can vary enormously in the time they take to develop an 
equivalent disease, depending on the combination of genes they have 
inherited.

The studies undermine hopes that the 100 or so victims to date of variant 
Creutzfeld Jakob Disease (vCJD) only succumbed to the disease because of 
freak variations in one key gene.

The new work suggests the time it takes to develop the disease might depend 
on a combination of several genes, not just one. This means that far greater 
numbers of us could be "incubating" the disease, but have yet to show 
symptoms.

"It's not a question of whether you get the disease, but when," says John 
Collinge, the neurogeneticist at University College London who led the 
research. He adds that, if we are fortunate, the incubation times may be 
longer than natural lifespans for many people.

"We would predict that some humans would have very long incubation periods 
and others would have short ones depending on the cocktail of gene variants 
they've got," he says.
......."

So, does anyone know if the prion disease will continue to ravage the brain 
even when submerged in LN2 (or at the proposed, somewhat warmer storage 
conditions)?

Goo is merely one of the downsides, perhaps not the most likely.
Turing--it's important when people begin to make the assumption that 
something which apes something else IS that something else. A 
golddigger convinces you he/she's in love with you--does that make 
him/her "loving?" Still, a golddigger is superior to a Turing Test 
graduate, which has no intent, no will, no mind--just code. (No DNA 
refs, please!)

I don't think Rod meant it as humor, although Renner's reaction suggests
that he found it at least a little humorous.  And as my father once
pointed out to me, Renner goes on to use the phrase at several future
points in the book.

The following futurist discussion seems completely
clueless to me.  Humanity and its descendants will change
so fast that they will completely dominate changes in the
biosphere.  Within a thousand years, there probably won't
be a substantial biosphere that we would recognize.

It's been known for some time that onset of symptoms could take up to 
30 years. Cryo--interesting question, as well as effect of life 
extension on probablity of coming down with this thing.. Stopped 
eating red meat years ago because of this nasty--but then, a 
restaurant will likely fry my eggs in the same spot they made a 
hamburger. Still, have to be reducing the odds.

Compared with Europe, US is completely reckless, thanks to money 
flowing to the power of the beef/poultry industry, and thence to the 
regulators. Best-case scenario: Appearance in Europe was freak 
occurrence (perhaps related to genetics of Cow Zero) and will not 
repeat here in spite of seemingly identical conditions; no prions 
will be imported into the US foodchain (unless a tourist falls into a 
balogna mixer).

Cross your fingers and hope to live.

That's a straw man. 1/3 of the population carries the gene in question.
Only 100 of ~ 20,000,000 susceptible English has gotten it, and the 
incidence curve has leveled off.  Even if the whole population started
catching it like the susceptibles, risks would be well below societally 
catastrophic - 1 in a few thousand, tops.  Enough to justify personal concern,
but no panic.  Naturally people working on vCJD have an incentive to
magnify the risks of vCJD (not to dismiss the valid level of concern
with vCJD)

Greater, perhaps, but the idea of "most" doesn't fly.  Prion diseases have a 
definite dosage requirement to catch them at all*.  It is, of course, possible
that humans are unusually susceptible to catching BSE and unusually slow
to develop it; but that remains a low probability event.

*Technically it appears each prion molecules has a very low chance of xmitting
disease and a very high chance of leaving the target completely unaffected.
Any given dose has a probability of not affecting the target, period.
You need a reasonably high titer to have a significant chance of catching the
disease.  For x-species transmission by oral routes the titers are very high.

>So, does anyone know if the prion disease will continue to ravage the brain 
>even when submerged in LN2 (or at the proposed, somewhat warmer storage 
>conditions)?

No ongoing effects.  The prion proteins have to move around to encounter the
normal ones and convert them.  At all proposed storage temperatures, 
everything is hard-frozen and nothing's going anywhere.

Looks like procedings from a conference I attended last year.
They're not clueless, given that you reject a singularity
and anticipate human expansion will follow a sigmoid curve.
While we all agree the sigmoid is unlikely until we bump
the limits of nature, others disagree.  A lot genuinely 
believe we'll knock ourselves off soon.

Some actually kind of agree with you.  Jeremy Jackson 
predicted in his presentation that within a century or
so there would be no creature left in the oceans larger
than a minnow and most of the coastal ocean would be 
choked with various kinds of algae overgrowth.   Earth
-as-neglected-swimming-pool.  Rosenzweig and Western
have observed that the dominant ecologies are
really already those of human-dominated areas - which
do indeed have ecologies beyond our intent; cockroaches,
mice, coyotes, house finches, dust mites, agricultural
nematodes, etc.

Actually, Star Trek started out to be more accurate than it ended up.

The original pilot (pre Captain Kirk) included some very Extropian questions
about virtual reality, whether we are in a simulation or the real world, who
has the authority to make command decisions over others, molecular transport
and teleportation, and the investigation of the unknown.  It clearly showed
an evolution of technology from the long-lost ship, to the current
Enterprise, to the advanced aliens.

Unfortunately, it was reportedly "too cerebral" for the audience to follow
(read: network executives), and they directed Gene Roddenberry to dumb it
down.  They wanted more action and less thinking.  They created a quota of
fight scenes that had to be met in every episode.  The network executives
even airbrushed Spock's ears round on the original advertising posters,
because pointed ears were just too transhuman for their comfort levels.
They also rejected the original color of Spock which was going to be red.
They thought red and pointed ears would look too satanic.  They really
changed his make-up color so as not to offend religious viewers.

The original pilot also included a woman (gasp!) in a command position.
Roddenberry was told to remove the female and have only male leaders.  He
cut out Majel and snuck her back in with a blond wig as nurse Chapel, a
"female" role.  He then migrated all the non-testosterone tendencies from
the female advisor to the alien Mr. Spock.  This later evolved into the
Vulcan logic which is now famous.  This originally was female creativity
versus male aggression.

The series also had a lot of background which was cut out after the original
runs to make more room for commercials.  Most people don't realize that
there were many trips from the bridge to the transporter room where the
landing party discussed the merits of the mission and debated tactics and
policy.  Most people never have scene the background maintenance workers who
had jumpsuit-style uniforms and provided background people during these
throw-away scenes.  There are many interesting discussions between Spock and
McCoy about the merits of vegetarianism or the value of aggression.  I
believe that Roddenberry tried to sneak in a lot more thought into the
series between the action scenes, but most of these were cut out.

Roddenberry even tried to develop a more accurate flight sequences, but they
were scrapped.  His original effects lit up the Enterprise only on one side,
but it looked like half the ship was missing to the uninitiated.  He had the
space ship zoom past the camera in the title sequences without a hint of
noise, because space is quiet.  But everyone asked where was the sound.
They reluctantly added the whoosh effect by popular demand, even against
their better judgment.  They knew that the ship might fly with the floor
down toward the planet, but in the equator orbit scenes this would look like
the ship was sideways.  They knew that phasors should shoot at the speed of
light, but it would make it difficult to follow the direction of the firing.
They knew that lasers wouldn't explode or instantly disintegrate objects, so
they invented "phasors" that could have more dramatic side-effects.

In short, entertainment audiences demand action over reality.  When
reality-based presentations are attempted, people complain and producers are
forced to jazz things up.  Even "Survivor" discovered that they had to redo
or fake some scenes, because even people tuning in to see reality just
wouldn't accept the lack of presentational style of live reality.  I don't
think modern entertainment is ignorant of science, but are more interested
in entertainment over science.

Like Cancer or AIDS, mad cow disease is not a simple virus or bacteria with
predictable pathology.  These diseases are much more complicated.  Their
spread, diagnosis, and effects on humans have many more variables than
simple diseases that quickly kill or are quickly overcome.  These diseases
are quite deadly, but only after a long battle with the human immune system.
As the simpler diseases are wiped out, look for more complicated diseases to
become the new epidemics.

I predict many waves of complex, long-term diseases to be a big health
challenge to life extensionists in the future.  We are already seeing
epidemics in cancer, Alzheimer's, heart attacks, MS, and other "complicated"
diseases.  Our big threats are no longer microbes, but complex environmental
factors that interact with our bodies over the long term.

You can assume the reaction and diffusion rate to be effectively zero 
for all time scales but geological (where chiefest damage mechanism 
will be ionising radiation). The vitrified (glass) phase should not 
come within the regime when the kinetics of annealing/devitrification 
will become noticeable. The real issue is not cracking -- cracking is 
much, much preferable to devitrification, the limit is cryofluid 
pricing. Current cheapness of LN is largely artefacted of it being a 
side product of liquid air fractionation (to obtain oxygen for steel 
production). Most developed countries no longer use that process (they use vacuum 
electrosteel processes and since recently hydrogen reduction and sintering,
or enrich oxygen by air by means of molecular sieves if they have to), if 
they haven't completely outsourced steel production to cheap, environmentally
unregulated places. So LN prices will go up, requiring a switchover to some other 
cryogenics method. Both the heat lossage through walls and value of 
Joule-Thompson coefficient would indicate that you'd want to stick around 
-150 deg C tops, which is still perfectly fine for vitrified tissue. Of 
course, you lose the advantage of phase change enthalpy, so you're in 
deep shit once the power goes out. Not only have you to use expensive 
cryogenics aggregates, and massive air conditioning to keep these happy,
you also have to install failsafe power generators, and rapid contingency 
plans, as your safety window is only a few hours (instead of a couple of
weeks) wide. Suddenly, things are becoming expensive, complex, and brittle. 
This is certainly going to have an impact on prices, reliability, or both.

Just in case it wasn't clear: I was talking about vanilla chemistry.
Biology is a very organized, carefully orchestrated chemical symphony,
and it happens on order of magnitude longer time scales.

So if no chemistry happens, you can be damn sure no biology will
have a ghost of a chance happening. You could in fact arrest most 
degenerative conditions if you could keep a body at a paltry few 
degrees above zero Celsius. Sadly, that state is by itself damaging, 
and cannot be sustained for longer than a few hours (the longer 
you wait, the more chilling injury accumulates and lower the 
probability of you restarting the system cleanly).

Speaking about inconsistent, why the fsck did Star Drek never use
force fields to arrest molecule movement in organisms? You've got 
all these people gasping and slowly dying on the floor, while just 
sticking them in a forcefield box would extend their shelf life 
indefinitely.

Ach, it's useless.

It is we who are clueless regarding the complexities inherent in the 
biosphere and its workings. More likely than not, we'll pollute or 
tinker ourselves to death--not realizing, not caring, or both.

But we are all dying anyway, John. Why not just let it rip and take our 
chances? Oh, yeah, I forgot...."future generaetions..."

But isn't it time we stop being simply a tool of our DNA?

Wow.  I had no idea of this.

What a beautifully profound expression of our ideals.  Most excellent.

It sure is; mine wants me out of the way far too quickly. (No doubt 
some would disagree...)

  :)

Point was simply, the biosphere is far from irrelevant, and will 
continue to be so. A simple drastic and prolonged weather change 
would wipe out the majority of the human race very quickly via 
starvation. (And then you've got boneheads ike Teller running (okay, 
wheeling) around advocating massive weather interference when we 
really don't know what the hell we're doing...)

    This is the 39'th update of my fly longevity experiments. In order 
to complete these updates on a timely basis, many runs are in progress
simultaneously. For example this run was started two months after Run #36
was initiated. At that time the highest survival was with flies fed
Knudsen black cherry juice, and this stimulated the present investigation
into cherry juices. However one limitation of these experiments is that
the flies used are a random assortment from the same breeding bottle. They
are therefore not all of the same age, and average survival is a rather
chancy affair. By comparison, as long as a few young flies wind up in each
bottle in a run, then maximum lifespan will tend to be roughly the same in
many bottles. It is this later figure that is my primary
interest. Unfortunately maximum lifespan in Run #36 subsequently proved to
be undistinguished for black cherry juice.
    The present run further indicates that if anything, cherry juices are
toxic, rather than beneficial. Cherry juices are a source of cyanide,
which may account for these diverse results. The next run will have more
interesting results.

   In Freezer Runs #11 & #12, I used some thicker plastic bags to store
the flies for 4 days. Apparently the lack of air permeating this plastic
proved to be lethal, with 100% mortality in some cases. No supplement
offered significant protection against freezing damage.
    Since no supplement yet tested has been consistently successful in
reducing freezing induced mortality, I have decided to discontinue this
line of inquiry. Instead an alternative additional type of experiment will
be reported on in my next fly longevity update. This will be a personal
investigation of a food satiety index.

Well, this question hasn't come up for me since the advent of the
web.  Google to the rescue:


http://members.tripod.com/~Probability/bayes02.htm

I quote:

It seems that thinkers in the field of probability and statistics are
divided into two armed camps, the Bayeseans and the Non- Bayeseans. The
fact that such a divsion has existed amongst educated people for over sixty
years suggests that neither side can clearly be shown to be wrong. When
prior probabilities are given as data, the Non-Bayesean generally has no
objection to the use of the Bayes formula, but when prior probabilities are
lacking he deplores the Bayesean's tendency to make them up out of thin
air. The Bayesean retorts that the Frequentist methods merely conceal the
problem instead of solving it, and that he really is the more honest of the
two. Shouts of joy are heard when, as occasionally happens, a Non-Baysean
"sees the light" and comes over. There is much celebrating and past sins
are forgiven. 

P. G. Hamer describes the schism in these terms: 

A frequentist uses impeccable logic to answer the wrong question, while a
Bayesean answers the right question by making assumptions that nobody can
fully believe in.

End quote.

Hey!  Looks like my guess was right:  I was the non-Bayesian
and you were the Bayesian.  Moreover, we played the roles to
the hilt.  Further, it looks like the schism is alive and well.

>> Only one question remains:
>> 
>> > (Vorlon voice:) "We are all Bayesian statisticians."

Still one question remains:  Okay, I know the Vorlons are
from B5.  But this quote rings a bell.  Where else in our
culture did someone say "We are all X now." Anybody recall?

The Next FDA Commissioner Could Determine How Long You Live!

May 17, 2001


Dear Fellow Life Extensionist:

The greatest obstacle to your health and longevity is the FDA.  

Bureaucratic barriers at the FDA stifle the development of novel
medicines, causing the suffering and death of Americans who desperately
need these therapies to stay alive.

While Congress and the Federal Courts have helped curtail FDA
over-regulation, today's flawed system continues to deny Americans access
to the best that science has to offer.

We now have a unique opportunity to change the course of medical history.
President Bush is considering whom to nominate as the next FDA
Commissioner. 

There is one candidate for the Commissioner's job who has a plan to reform
the FDA in order to speed the delivery of the fruits of medical research
to every one of us.

The name of this candidate is Mary J. Ruwart, Ph.D. The information that
follows shows that Dr. Ruwart is uniquely qualified to reform an agency
that has lost touch with scientific objectivity.

It is imperative that you notify President Bush that Dr. Ruwart is the
best person to remedy the severe problems that exist at the FDA. Please
copy and mail the letter that follows to the President at the address we
have provided.

If you want to do more, and we hope that you will, we encourage you to
write a personalized letter to mail or fax to The White House. 
 
We have also provided a phone number for those who want to call The White
House to emphasize the importance of appointing Dr. Ruwart as the next FDA
Commissioner.

Even if you have not participated in these types of FDA-reform campaigns
in the past, we urge you to do so on this critical issue.

Our fear is that lifesaving therapies will continue to remain bogged down
in FDA red tape if a change within the agency is not made. It has become
so burdensome to gain FDA approval that innovative therapies in the U.S.
are being abandoned because of extraordinarily high costs and uncertain
bureaucratic delays. 

If Dr. Ruwart were to become the new Commissioner, this barrier against
medical innovation would be diminished.  More Americans would gain rapid
access to novel medical treatments that could significantly extend the
healthy human life span.

What makes the FDA problem unique is the possibility that each of us will
die from a disease that could have been effectively treated if the FDA
didn't stand in the way.

Inefficient government thrives on citizen apathy, so please take the time
to mail the enclosed letter to President Bush.  The life you save may be
your own!

For longer life,

William Faloon

P.S. Those who understand the urgent need for FDA reform and want to do
more should send The White House a personalized letter and/or make a phone
call. The information that follows reveals how you can get your message
through to The White House.

Dr. Mary J. Ruwart's Letter to President Bush:

Mary J. Ruwart, Ph.D.
408 County Road 138-C
Burnet, TX 78611
May 8, 2001

President G.W. Bush
Presidential Personnel Office
The White House
Washington, DC 20500

Dear President Bush,

I am enclosing my Presidential Personnel Application Form and resume in
order that you might consider my appointment as FDA Commissioner.  Because
you have already invited a number of market-minded individuals to your
team, I hope that you will look favorably on my pro-market orientation. 

My nomination for FDA Commissioner is likely to enjoy widespread support,
especially from the groups listed below.

1.  Pharmaceutical industry.   For almost twenty years, I was a research
scientist at a major pharmaceutical company and understand the impact of
regulatory delays. Former FDA Commissioner, Alexander Schmidt, once
remarked, "The failure to approve an important new drug can be as
detrimental to the public health as the approval of a potentially bad
drug." As your appointee, I would pursue a more cooperative approach with
pharmaceutical firms in order to speed the delivery of new, life-saving
medications to the American public. 

2.  Physicians.  Doctors often prescribe approved medications for
off-label uses in order to give their patients the best health care
options.  However, the FDA discourages drug companies from sharing
information that would educate physicians about these choices for their
patients.  As your appointee, I would make this valuable knowledge on
off-label use available to our dedicated health care practitioners.

3.  Alternative practitioners. Health care professionals who utilize
non-traditional methods of treatment are often subjected to prejudicial
treatment by the FDA, even in the absence of patient complaints.  As your
appointee, I would intervene only when patients were at risk, thereby
broadening our health care choices. 

4.  American public.  Whenever Congress considered giving the FDA more
control over nutritional supplements, voters inundated their
representatives with protests.  The American public clearly wants the
freedom to choose what vitamins and minerals to take.  As your appointee,
I would honor the choice of my fellow Americans.  

5.  Dedicated FDA employees.  FDA examiners are in a no-win situation.  If
they delay approving a drug with life-saving potential, many Americans,
especially those with terminal diseases, die needlessly.  If the FDA
approves a drug and unpredictable side effects occur, the FDA is blamed.
As your appointee, I will alleviate this situation, by allowing terminally
ill patients to "opt-out" of the approval process.  They will then have
access to potentially life-saving medications which are not yet through
FDA review.   

In 1999, a Federal Appellate Court ruled 11-0 that the FDA must abide by
the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and permit truthful health
claims for antioxidants, fiber, folic acid, and omega-3 fatty acids
(Pearson vs. Shalala). The FDA ignored this decision and in February of
this year was censured by the court for its failure to comply.  As your
appointee, I would make sure that the FDA abides by our Constitution, the
law of the land.   

As your appointee, my goal will be to facilitate the conversion of the FDA
from a bureaucratic regulatory regime into a market-oriented support
system that maximizes our access to life-savings medications.  Of course,
only a team effort will achieve this dramatic shift.  Win-win strategies,
such as the ones described above, can help create alignment among groups
who may sometimes be at odds with each other.  I believe that I have the
experience and the skills to create such an environment.

I hope that you will seriously consider moving the FDA in a direction that
will stimulate innovative drug development.  After all, before we are
politicians or special interest groups, we are human beings.  Whether we
enjoy a long life or a short one will largely depend on the availability
of  life-saving medications.  I would be honored, as your appointee, to
help the American people-and yourself-achieve the longest, most productive
life possible.  

Sincerely,

Mary J. Ruwart, Ph.D.



Letter to send to the President:


Date:


President George W. Bush
The White House
Washington DC 20500

Dear President Bush:

I request that you appoint Mary J. Ruwart, Ph.D., as the next Commissioner
of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The reason for the urgency of
this appointment is that serious institutional problems exist within the
FDA that cause Americans to suffer and die needlessly. Dr. Ruwart has
identified what's wrong with the FDA and has proposed practical solutions.
I am concerned that anyone else you appoint will continue a "business as
usual" approach that will not result in the kind of reform that is needed
to prevent disease, injury and death by over-regulation.  In her
application to you, Dr. Ruwart stated, "My goal will be to facilitate the
conversion of the FDA from a bureaucratic regulatory regime into a
market-oriented support system that maximizes our access to life-saving
medications." The public is becoming increasingly aware that the FDA is
largely responsible for the high cost of prescription drugs in the U.S.
When Americans are diagnosed with serious diseases, many are now seeking
therapies that have not yet been approved by the FDA.  I find it
deplorable that the agency that is supposed to "protect the health of the
American public" has become a major impediment to their access of new
life-saving therapies.  

The most important issue to me is my health and the cost of prescription
drugs.  I therefore urge you to make a historic and humane decision by
appointing Dr. Ruwart as the next Commissioner of the Food and Drug
Administration. 

Please let me know your position on this issue.

Sincerely,

LET YOUR VOICE  BE HEARD AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
It's Easier Than You Think!

We live in a democratic society, yet few Americans take the time to let
their elected officials know what is really important.

In the case of the FDA, severe problems have been repeatedly identified,
but a politically palatable solution has never been conveyed to the
President of the United States. Since the President will be appointing a
new FDA commissioner soon, it's time to speak out.  If we fail to point
out an obvious way of reforming the FDA, it's hard to complain later about
the agency's continuing inadequacies.

For the first time in history, a qualified individual has emerged with a
specific plan to turn the FDA into an organization that will facilitate,
rather than impede, the development of new therapies to eradicate disease. 

It is now up to those of us who understand the FDA problem to convey the
solution to the President. Our message to President Bush is simple. Dr.
Mary J. Ruwart is the best qualified individual to lead the FDA out of the
medical dark ages. 

History has shown us that FDA Commissioners are primarily concerned with
maintaining the status quo, rather than resolving serious problems within
the agency. This lack of vision is why Americans continue to suffer and
die in the FDA's "waiting room".

Dr. Ruwart has proposed meaningful reforms within the FDA.  For those
depending on scientific breakthroughs to stay alive, it is critical for
the next Commissioner to have the vision to tear down the FDA's barriers
against medical innovation. Dr. Ruwart has emerged as the most viable
candidate to implement these life-saving changes.

The White House is set up to receive suggestions and comments from the
public. The following are several ways to let your voice be heard:

So you say, but I note that you're still using that phaser specifically
designed by your parent process for a *six-fingered hand*. That will throw
off your aim just enough that I shall vi you instead, you damned processwit.

Today James Harr appeared for Keith Henson in Riverside Superior

Wallerstein notice that Henson was not present.  The judge at first issued
a bench warrant with a $25,000 bail and then change it to a no-bail bench
warrant for Henson, who is seeking political asylum in Canada.

He did not rule on the motion to issue a judgment notwithstanding the
verdict (http://freehenson.tripod.com/draf-jnov.txt) and after he said he
would impose sentence  reversed himself and did not rule on a sentence.
A probation officer made confused statements about the United States
State Department getting involved. The prosecution recommended 200 days
in jail and 5 years formal probation, with the defense making no 
recommendation.
Defense counsel was not permitted to withdraw.

No further court dates were set.

It's not gonna work. Requesting asylum is *the* way to make
his own presence in Canada difficult for the Canadian state,
and to let politics take the upper hand. Canada might be a
kind country with a kind government, but not so kind as to
jeopardise its relations with the US for Keith's sake by
declaring the US a country that does not respect human rights,
which is exactly what a country does when it grants asylum to
the citizen of another country. The times of the Vietnam
draft-dodger refugees are over and even then Canada was
bound more by its own (pre-existing) laws than by its actual
good will.

What's wrong with just a plain ordinary residence permit
application, like "I like your country and I want to live
here"? What's wrong with a business setup? Employment?
What's wrong with any of all those other residence permit
possibilities, besides asylum?

Besides, when an asylum application is turned down, the
refugee is deported to his own country; in Keith's case
to the US and straight to jail. When an ordinary application
for residence is turned down, the applicant is not deported
at all, but is simply requested to leave the country and
is free to go anywhere he chooses.

You would be surprised. *nix in the guise of Linux and *BSD is well and alive
these days, especially among the young'n's. And of course, it should have 
been "My PID is Inigo Montoya..."

Now a Forth or a Lisp machine joke would be a tad more difficult to
contextize.

PEP 9001: Asteroid Impact Resistance

MOTIVATION

Collision of the Earth with a sizeable celestial
object could have undesirable consequences for any
running Python programs. Although no such occurrence
has been reported to date, examination of the code
suggests that a likely result would be to cause
all running Python interpreters on the same planet
as the one experiencing the event to crash. It is
considered desirable to take proactive steps to
address this problem, rather than waiting for
a bug report to be filed.

PROPOSAL

In any module containing the declaration

   from __future__ import asteroid_resistance

the occurrence of an asteroid impact will cause
an AsteroidImpactError to be raised. Programs may
then trap this exception and take appropriate
corrective action.

UNRESOLVED ISSUES

Devising a suitable test for this feature would
seem to be problematic, since failure of the test
could have disastrous consequences. If this feature
is implemented, it is recommended that it NOT be
tested until this issue can be resolved.

When I read the papers over the last days, I also was struck by the extreme 
conservatism of the views. But on the other hand, as some of them noted, 
until recently the whole idea of discussing the future of evolution was out 
of bounds. So this colloquium is actually a step in the right direction.

The big mistake is that most papers discuss how natural evolution might be 
affected by the activities of a civilisation like the current.  The implicit 
assumption was either that humans would either vanish somehow or become 
totally zero-impact, and then evolution would continue as usual from the new 
situation. It is interesting to note that none of the papers I have read 
discuss human evolution in this context, the bias is entirely towards the 
nonhuman biosphere (David Western menstioned that many ecologists have been 
very directed towards the abiotic parts of the ecosystem rather than the 
biotic until recently; this might simply be a holdover). I agree with Robin 
that not taking the effects of *continuing* human action into account renders 
most of these papers rather pointless, unless the assumption is that humanity 
dies out in the very near future with a fairly minimal ecological impact.

So, what would a transhumanist paper in this colloquium have included? I 
think the method would be to first sketch a number of possible scenarios of 
long-term human development and then study how they would affect the 
biosphere. This is hard, and would bring in issues of long range economics 
(gigaeconomics? exconomics?) and cultural evolution into the discussion. In 
most cases the future state of the biosphere would be totally contingent on 
human values, not natural evolution. This is an interesting concept if it 
could be brought into the conservationist discourse, because it implies a 
vast shift in how the biosphere works, not just a question about how it is 
affected on the species or biome or environment level. It might be that many 
conservationists would consider such a human-regulated ecology (I call it a 
cyborg ecology in a paper I'm writing) a bad thing, but at present the whole 
concept seems to be entirely outside of their discourse (several papers 
discuss the human footprint or shadow, but does not view humans as a key 
species or evolutionary force in itself - maybe a holdover from the romantic 
origin of the environmentalist movement).

Hi there all,

Through some strange confluence of events, it seems that I am to appear on
my current favourite tv program, Aftershock (Australia, ABC, Thursdays
8:30pm). I'm on relatively late in the series (episode 6, the next episode
is episode 3), so all I can imagine is that they used up all their quality
guests (like Damien "btw have you heard about The Spike?" Broderick) early
on :-). The filming is on 22 May.

The episode is entitled "Superhumanity 2.0 - Cyborgs" (it follows
"Superhumanity 1.0 - Biotech"). I can talk about that in a pretty general
sense (I could probably talk all day about it, in fact, family members will
corroborate this). However, as I've been picked on as Aussie Extropian
Exhibit A, I'd be happy to represent a more rounded view, informed by others
onlist.

So, I'm throwing it open to the peanut gallery. If you were to talk publicly
about cyborged humans in the nearish future, what would you say?

I've got a random assortment of ideas...
- Wearables... it might be a bit daggy to mention them, but wearable
computing will be big way before cyborg stuff comes into it's own. It'll be
a proof of concept in many cases... will people take up the closer
relationship with their machines, or is the idea of the cyborg flawed in the
same way as a the video phone or the flying car?

- Killer app 1: Life extension... This application will really pull "cyborg
technology" into mainstream culture. Already, there are artificial limbs and
joints, pacemakers, cochlear implants... I think there are even implanted
insulin feeds for diabetics (better check that one). People seem happy with
the deathist meme in a general sense, but often tend to speak differently
when things start looking grim on a personal scale. Contrary to the normal
pattern of social change, I would expect strong cyborg uptake to begin in
the older generations, as it becomes available and shows itself to be
superior to what these people possess naturally. Younger people, on the
other hand, will likely resist implants/modifications related to life
extension.
You see this uptake already. I have relatives who shall remain anonymous,
who delve into these areas... HRT is a great example. These people will not
label themselves Transhumanists (despite my taunting to come out of the
closet), they will continue to raise the deathist business about death being
part of life and all that great stuff. They also will continue to seek
treatment for things which might kill them, and which are only newly coming
to be regarded as pathologies. Such as menopause.
An interesting factor here is that there is, implicit in much modern,
mainstream medicine, and in it's life extension techniques, the ideal human
state of "wellness" (similar and related to the beauty industry's ideal
form, discussed below). The ultimately healthy body is not only free of
disease, mobile and resilient, it is youthful. Life extension in this
context is about maintaining this idealised state indefinitely.
Incidentally, I feel that transhumanism would not take such a simplistic
stance on life extension... to us, it is all about freedom of choice, not
pursuit of a mass marketted ideal.
But I have digressed. The point of the above is that there is an abstract
ideal state which informs the search for extended life and youth in
mainstream culture, and that model will continue to dominate, rather than
our prefered "freedom of choice" model. The ramifications of this in the
context of improving technologies will be a shifting of the ideal,
eventually into territory that only a cyborg can enter. At some point in the
future, I have no doubt that normal, unaugmented humans will be seen as
physically ill/disabled individuals, in need of special help and in need of
treatment. I don't think it's a particularly good thing, but it is likely.

- Killer app 2: Net connection... In the world of today and tomorrow, the
greatest change from the past is the existence, and increasing dependency
upon, interconnection with the rest of the world. Our wearables now (mobile
phones, pdas. etc etc) are a testament to this... I don't think it's a trend
which is about to falter any time soon. True wearable computing will take
off, and the push after that will be to get "cyborg" enhancements to make
communication even easier... headup displays directly on the retina,
microphones implants (in/near the jawbone?) to pickup speech, speakers
inside the ear. Before VR environments (or perhaps in parallel with them) we
will introduce a whole noisy world of input as close to our external senses
as possible, and we will simplify output to the maximum extent possible,
even without direct neural interface. I would then predict that we'd try to
move directly to neural interfacing, although I'll temper that by saying
that this will not be the be-all and end-all. I think we'll continue to use
our external language abilities for a good while yet, basically because any
kind of direct mind-to-mind interfacing would be incredibly intimate, and
not the kind of thing you'd want to use to communicate with anyone with whom
you would not freely make love. Oddly enough, it might also be acceptable to
communicate with external machines that way too.
This type of enhancement is one that I would expect younger people to adopt
first. It will be driven primary by social and economic competitive
advantage... to have access to these technologies will give you an edge
those who don't have them. More correctly, as is the case with commercial
information technology adoption now, using these technologies will be like a
pre-requisite... you wont gain much by using them (because most others will
have access to the same stuff), but you will be at a serious disadvantage if
you do not.
A strong implication of the drivers of this branch of cyborg tech, is that
it may well be at odds with the life-extension application. In some cases,
undoubtedly people will be faced with the choice of enhancements which give
them short term advantage, but cause them longer term trouble. Some people
will choose these enhancements. The bar will be raised higher...
Another implication is related to that of life extension... that it will
become non-competitive to remain an unaltered human. From the angle of the
competitive edge in a fast moving society, there is no ideal to be reached;
it's more like trying to be out the front of the pack in a marathon, or at
least not falling behind. Very interesting things should come from
competition driven cyborg technologies, because diversity will be important;
you never know where the next edge will come from. But, it will be a lot
more difficult to maintain even the illusion of control over where these
technologies go. We probably need to get past the desire to control them
pretty soon, or learn to live with dissapointment.

Killer app 3: Eternal youth and the beauty industry... Somewhat related to
life extension, the quest for physical youth and beauty will be a very
strong driver of cyborg type technologies. It is easy to dismiss this area,
because it seems somewhat superficial, but when you look at the amount of
money that flows through the (well manicured) hands of the beauty industry,
a different picture emerges. Our cultures pathologise aging, and they
pathologise the marks of aging. Implicit in all this is a model of
"perfection" which we should all be trying to reach. I am not sure exactly
what form it takes... Brad Pitt/Nicole Kidman? Whatever the exact form is,
it apparently doesn't have wrinkles, cellulite or body hair. It can, on the
other hand, have breast implants, a face lift or a nose job.
There will be a strong overlap between life extension technologies and
beauty related technologies. One way to look physically young and fit is to
stay physically young and fit, after all. Who knows... in the far flung
future, those anti-wrinkle creams might actually work! They might even work
by keeping you physically young enough to not have wrinkles. Of course, acne
could be a problem.
On the other hand, beauty related technologies have more in common with the
"competitive edge" camp... they have much to do with gaining ground in one's
dealings with others, rather than the more internally motivated goal of a
prolonged life. Techniques down the ages (lead face powder, corsets, stomach
stapling, modern dieting) show pretty clearly that beauty and health can run
sharply at odds with one another.
Another point about the beauty industry is that its ideals are, for all
intents and purposes, unobtainable. Do what you will, you wont look like
Elle McPherson with today's technology and treatments, unless you are Elle
McPherson. However, the beauty industry will have a good go at telling you
that it can get you close. The unobtainable ideal means endless consumption
of products.
So, as our technology for self modification improves, and we can more easily
hit the mark, the beauty industry will move the target. There are some great
stats out there (The Beauty Myth contains some decent research) to show that
the "ideal woman", for example, is a physically impossible being already.
When we add cyborg technology to the mix, where will the collective ideal of
the perfect form move to? Somewhere as odd as it is extreme, and it will
motivate ever larger uptake of the sillier forms of cyborg technology.

- Physical enhancements... In the cyberpunk literature, people tend to make
very silly modifications, so that they can look freaky, or have some
enhanced physical trait. Steve Austin, eat your heart out. However, I
believe that these will be the very last types of enhancements that are
made, and the least frequent. In the world of today, and certainly in that
of tomorrow, physical enhancements are and become less useful than one might
suppose. Leap tall buildings in a single bound? Sure... but why not just
take the lift? It might not turn out to be very important to a modern
westerner to be able to lift a small truck; it might be far more useful to
merely look as though you could.
Eventually physical enhancements will become more important, as our biology
begins to really let us down... we may need to change form to cope with
overcrowding of earth, we'll definitely need to change form to explore
space. That, however, is some way off.

- Part robot... intertwined with our cyborg advances, will come advances in
biotech, nanotech, AI (in the loosest sense), and information and
communication technologies. So, it is likely that we will have some pretty
smart computers kicking around, grown out of the needs of the biotech
revolution first, then whatever follows. These will use sophisticated models
born of that revolution's discoveries. Evolved software, which adapts to a
changing enironment in real time, will be the bedrock of such systems. We'll
be pushing close, perhaps, to machines that do something vaguely resembling
thought. Certainly, they'll make this look like the stone age.
So, in terms of human enhancement, we are likely to see some very smart
control systems finding their way into, or close to, people. Tasks which
take manual dexterity, such as driving a car, should move to become a
partnership between human and machine, with the machine taking over the
simpler tasks which require instaneous reaction based on multiple inputs,
and the humans keeping a high level control. It's human as captain, computer
as first mate, robots for crew.
And what is the ship? It could be a car, which can virtually, if not
absolutely, drive itself. It might be a factory, which just requires a few
humans to make directorial pronouncements (more blue in the blue m&ms
please), and can otherwise manage on it's own (hmm, I think this might
alread be happening). It might be a spacecraft whose sensory abilities are
translated into human equivalent sensory signals, and whose directions come
directly from a that human controller's nervous control signals (my fuel
intake valve feels a bit sticky, I'll wiggle it a bit).

- Part virtual robot... And some of us will end up descending (ascending?)
entirely into the virtual realm, with the software equivalents of cyborg
enhancements... intelligent agents scooting around doing our bidding (most
likely communicating with even more intelligent server based systems),
alerting systems and autonomous systems for acting on our behalf, giving the
as yet nu-enhanced human mind a function performance boost, and the ability
to move freely in a new environment for which it has not been evolved.

- Security... People often raise the spectre of personal vulnerability in an
interconnected world. No one wants to find their robot arm suddenly writing
"0wned by Kr4XX0r 133t", or that, after installing some IBM human memory
expansion, they inexpicably foul themselves whenever they think about
Microsoft products. In response to this, I would say that we have already
begun on the path to extreme global interconnectedness, and are painfully
aware of these issues because of problems we've already experienced.
However, we must not forget that the world has gone on. Most of us choose to
remain connected despite the risk, because we perceive it to be far smaller
that the gain. Yes, we'll continue to have mellissa and I love you viruses
and internet worms. We'll continue to have script kiddies and black hat
hackers and international bad guys and, sometimes, catastrophes based on
pure incompetence. Slowly we get better at coping with these problems. We
will, through a combination of local intelligent design and global natural
selection, come to be more and more skilled at keeping the computer network
a safe enough place, such that, by the time people are putting their bowels
online, it'll be safe enough to do so.

- Lastly, I think this discussion can get a bit silly, and will look
hopelessly naive from the perspective of the people of 50 years from now,
let alone 100. It'll look something like predicting steam-powered zeppelins
as the next big thing. There are so many different technological avenue down
which to progress, and the interaction between these, combined with a few
completely-out-of-left-field surprises, will take us somewhere mostly
obscured from here. Personally, I suspect that the mainstream culture's
"cyborg" is probably another flying car/videophone, and whilst it embodies
more useful concepts perhaps than those two others, in itself it will go
obsolete and embarrassing before it becomes reality.
However, I think that the cyborg memeset is useful at least for a while, and
I agree with Anders that the tendency to throw our hands up and say "We
can't know" is counterproductive. Babbage could see the computer, daVinci
could see human flight, Jules Verne could see space travel. We can see
transhumanity.

This whole discussion of mine probably looks hopelessly ill-informed to many
of you... so tell me why. What's important that I've missed? Where am I
wrong? Where is my presentation flawed? Don't quietly grumble about it to
yourself... if you can correct my misinformation, then I'm less likely to
say something problematic on the box.

Thanks in advance,
Emlyn

Because he is being convicted and sentenced in the US.  A business setup,
employment or other residence permit possibilities will not protect one from
being extradited to the U.S. as a convicted/escaped criminal.  Asylum is the
only way to ask one country to protect you from your own government.

I agree with your other statements that this will never work.  The Canadian
government is not going to try to intervene to overthrow his U.S. conviction
and protect a U.S. citizen from its own government.  Such a thing would be
similar to us firebombing Iraqi to protect its own citizens from their own
government.  Asylum cannot be granted without Canada claiming human rights
violations to such an extent that one nation must violate another nation's
sovereign rights to govern its own citizens.  Canada would be declaring that
it is intervening in internal US legal processes because they should have
more authority than our own government over US citizens based on previous
actions of the government.  I don't see why Canada would be interested in
this case, and I don't see the US agreeing to give up any of its sovereign
rights.

Assuming a sigmoid anytime soon is clueless, and I say
this just based on standard economics, not any special
singularity concept.  The world economy has been doubling
every 15 years for a century now, and just continuing that
growth for another two or more centuries should make
an enormous dent in the biosphere.  If we knock ourselves
off, we'll likely take much of the biosphere with us.

Glad to hear it.  Did you try to get them to think about

Granted.

I'm not sure I agree, at least if you mean the values of humans today.
If the values of our descendants are selected by a "natural", i.e.,
undesigned and out of control, evolution (as in some uploads scenarios)
and those values determine the state of the biosphere, then natural
evolution will determine the state of the biosphere.  Just not the
kind of natural evolution biologists now have in mind.

That paper argues that the while the demand for investment changes with
investment opportunities, the supply is fixed by human nature - discount

Environmental effects, at least, do seem to follow a sigmoid.
In most respects the US and Europe do less than they did
20-30 years ago.  At least some believe we will knock 
ourselves off without obliterating the biosphere and the
amount of biodiversity available then will have a significant
effect on that available post-knock.  Most are shooting for
a giant reserve policy - they think humans will or can reserve
vast areas for natural evolution and leave them that way
forever.

Dr. Jackson was obviously very upset by this scenario, so, no
I didn't discuss the possibility that it could be even worse.
Remember, although they might agree with you on the
predicted outcome, to them it's a horror scenario!
I only broached such subjects with a few people (none of the
ones who were discussing human-dominated ecologies)
and they were generally not receptive on limits-to-growth
grounds.

<P>I might start with riding a bicycle, to explain how natural a man/machine connection is and we take for granted?</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Hi there all, </P>
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>Through some strange confluence of events, it seems that I am to appear on 
<DIV></DIV>my current favourite tv program, Aftershock (Australia, ABC, Thursdays 
<DIV></DIV>8:30pm). I'm on relatively late in the series (episode 6, the next episode 
<DIV></DIV>is episode 3), so all I can imagine is that they used up all their quality 
<DIV></DIV>guests (like Damien "btw have you heard about The Spike?" Broderick) early 
<DIV></DIV>on :-). The filming is on 22 May. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>The episode is entitled "Superhumanity 2.0 - Cyborgs" (it follows 
<DIV></DIV>"Superhumanity 1.0 - Biotech"). I can talk about that in a pretty general 
<DIV></DIV>sense (I could probably talk all day about it, in fact, family members will 
<DIV></DIV>corroborate this). However, as I've been picked on as Aussie Extropian 
<DIV></DIV>Exhibit A, I'd be happy to represent a more rounded view, informed by others 
<DIV></DIV>onlist. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>So, I'm throwing it open to the peanut gallery. If you were to talk publicly 
<DIV></DIV>about cyborged humans in the nearish future, what would you say? 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>I've got a random assortment of ideas... 
<DIV></DIV>- Wearables... it might be a bit daggy to mention them, but wearable 
<DIV></DIV>computing will be big way before cyborg stuff comes into it's own. It'll be 
<DIV></DIV>a proof of concept in many cases... will people take up the closer 
<DIV></DIV>relationship with their machines, or is the idea of the cyborg flawed in the 
<DIV></DIV>same way as a the video phone or the flying car? 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>- Killer app 1: Life extension... This application will really pull "cyborg 
<DIV></DIV>technology" into mainstream culture. Already, there are artificial limbs and 
<DIV></DIV>joints, pacemakers, cochlear implants... I think there are even implanted 
<DIV></DIV>insulin feeds for diabetics (better check that one). People seem happy with 
<DIV></DIV>the deathist meme in a general sense, but often tend to speak differently 
<DIV></DIV>when things start looking grim on a personal scale. Contrary to the normal 
<DIV></DIV>pattern of social change, I would expect strong cyborg uptake to begin in 
<DIV></DIV>the older generations, as it becomes available and shows itself to be 
<DIV></DIV>superior to what these people possess naturally. Younger people, on the 
<DIV></DIV>other hand, will likely resist implants/modifications related to life 
<DIV></DIV>extension. 
<DIV></DIV>You see this uptake already. I have relatives who shall remain anonymous, 
<DIV></DIV>who delve into these areas... HRT is a great example. These people will not 
<DIV></DIV>label themselves Transhumanists (despite my taunting to come out of the 
<DIV></DIV>closet), they will continue to raise the deathist business about death being 
<DIV></DIV>part of life and all that great stuff. They also will continue to seek 
<DIV></DIV>treatment for things which might kill them, and which are only newly coming 
<DIV></DIV>to be regarded as pathologies. Such as menopause. 
<DIV></DIV>An interesting factor here is that there is, implicit in much modern, 
<DIV></DIV>mainstream medicine, and in it's life extension techniques, the ideal human 
<DIV></DIV>state of "wellness" (similar and related to the beauty industry's ideal 
<DIV></DIV>form, discussed below). The ultimately healthy body is not only free of 
<DIV></DIV>disease, mobile and resilient, it is youthful. Life extension in this 
<DIV></DIV>context is about maintaining this idealised state indefinitely. 
<DIV></DIV>Incidentally, I feel that transhumanism would not take such a simplistic 
<DIV></DIV>stance on life extension... to us, it is all about freedom of choice, not 
<DIV></DIV>pursuit of a mass marketted ideal. 
<DIV></DIV>But I have digressed. The point of the above is that there is an abstract 
<DIV></DIV>ideal state which informs the search for extended life and youth in 
<DIV></DIV>mainstream culture, and that model will continue to dominate, rather than 
<DIV></DIV>our prefered "freedom of choice" model. The ramifications of this in the 
<DIV></DIV>context of improving technologies will be a shifting of the ideal, 
<DIV></DIV>eventually into territory that only a cyborg can enter. At some point in the 
<DIV></DIV>future, I have no doubt that normal, unaugmented humans will be seen as 
<DIV></DIV>physically ill/disabled individuals, in need of special help and in need of 
<DIV></DIV>treatment. I don't think it's a particularly good thing, but it is likely. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>- Killer app 2: Net connection... In the world of today and tomorrow, the 
<DIV></DIV>greatest change from the past is the existence, and increasing dependency 
<DIV></DIV>upon, interconnection with the rest of the world. Our wearables now (mobile 
<DIV></DIV>phones, pdas. etc etc) are a testament to this... I don't think it's a trend 
<DIV></DIV>which is about to falter any time soon. True wearable computing will take 
<DIV></DIV>off, and the push after that will be to get "cyborg" enhancements to make 
<DIV></DIV>communication even easier... headup displays directly on the retina, 
<DIV></DIV>microphones implants (in/near the jawbone?) to pickup speech, speakers 
<DIV></DIV>inside the ear. Before VR environments (or perhaps in parallel with them) we 
<DIV></DIV>will introduce a whole noisy world of input as close to our external senses 
<DIV></DIV>as possible, and we will simplify output to the maximum extent possible, 
<DIV></DIV>even without direct neural interface. I would then predict that we'd try to 
<DIV></DIV>move directly to neural interfacing, although I'll temper that by saying 
<DIV></DIV>that this will not be the be-all and end-all. I think we'll continue to use 
<DIV></DIV>our external language abilities for a good while yet, basically because any 
<DIV></DIV>kind of direct mind-to-mind interfacing would be incredibly intimate, and 
<DIV></DIV>not the kind of thing you'd want to use to communicate with anyone with whom 
<DIV></DIV>you would not freely make love. Oddly enough, it might also be acceptable to 
<DIV></DIV>communicate with external machines that way too. 
<DIV></DIV>This type of enhancement is one that I would expect younger people to adopt 
<DIV></DIV>first. It will be driven primary by social and economic competitive 
<DIV></DIV>advantage... to have access to these technologies will give you an edge 
<DIV></DIV>those who don't have them. More correctly, as is the case with commercial 
<DIV></DIV>information technology adoption now, using these technologies will be like a 
<DIV></DIV>pre-requisite... you wont gain much by using them (because most others will 
<DIV></DIV>have access to the same stuff), but you will be at a serious disadvantage if 
<DIV></DIV>you do not. 
<DIV></DIV>A strong implication of the drivers of this branch of cyborg tech, is that 
<DIV></DIV>it may well be at odds with the life-extension application. In some cases, 
<DIV></DIV>undoubtedly people will be faced with the choice of enhancements which give 
<DIV></DIV>them short term advantage, but cause them longer term trouble. Some people 
<DIV></DIV>will choose these enhancements. The bar will be raised higher... 
<DIV></DIV>Another implication is related to that of life extension... that it will 
<DIV></DIV>become non-competitive to remain an unaltered human. From the angle of the 
<DIV></DIV>competitive edge in a fast moving society, there is no ideal to be reached; 
<DIV></DIV>it's more like trying to be out the front of the pack in a marathon, or at 
<DIV></DIV>least not falling behind. Very interesting things should come from 
<DIV></DIV>competition driven cyborg technologies, because diversity will be important; 
<DIV></DIV>you never know where the next edge will come from. But, it will be a lot 
<DIV></DIV>more difficult to maintain even the illusion of control over where these 
<DIV></DIV>technologies go. We probably need to get past the desire to control them 
<DIV></DIV>pretty soon, or learn to live with dissapointment. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>Killer app 3: Eternal youth and the beauty industry... Somewhat related to 
<DIV></DIV>life extension, the quest for physical youth and beauty will be a very 
<DIV></DIV>strong driver of cyborg type technologies. It is easy to dismiss this area, 
<DIV></DIV>because it seems somewhat superficial, but when you look at the amount of 
<DIV></DIV>money that flows through the (well manicured) hands of the beauty industry, 
<DIV></DIV>a different picture emerges. Our cultures pathologise aging, and they 
<DIV></DIV>pathologise the marks of aging. Implicit in all this is a model of 
<DIV></DIV>"perfection" which we should all be trying to reach. I am not sure exactly 
<DIV></DIV>what form it takes... Brad Pitt/Nicole Kidman? Whatever the exact form is, 
<DIV></DIV>it apparently doesn't have wrinkles, cellulite or body hair. It can, on the 
<DIV></DIV>other hand, have breast implants, a face lift or a nose job. 
<DIV></DIV>There will be a strong overlap between life extension technologies and 
<DIV></DIV>beauty related technologies. One way to look physically young and fit is to 
<DIV></DIV>stay physically young and fit, after all. Who knows... in the far flung 
<DIV></DIV>future, those anti-wrinkle creams might actually work! They might even work 
<DIV></DIV>by keeping you physically young enough to not have wrinkles. Of course, acne 
<DIV></DIV>could be a problem. 
<DIV></DIV>On the other hand, beauty related technologies have more in common with the 
<DIV></DIV>"competitive edge" camp... they have much to do with gaining ground in one's 
<DIV></DIV>dealings with others, rather than the more internally motivated goal of a 
<DIV></DIV>prolonged life. Techniques down the ages (lead face powder, corsets, stomach 
<DIV></DIV>stapling, modern dieting) show pretty clearly that beauty and health can run 
<DIV></DIV>sharply at odds with one another. 
<DIV></DIV>Another point about the beauty industry is that its ideals are, for all 
<DIV></DIV>intents and purposes, unobtainable. Do what you will, you wont look like 
<DIV></DIV>Elle McPherson with today's technology and treatments, unless you are Elle 
<DIV></DIV>McPherson. However, the beauty industry will have a good go at telling you 
<DIV></DIV>that it can get you close. The unobtainable ideal means endless consumption 
<DIV></DIV>of products. 
<DIV></DIV>So, as our technology for self modification improves, and we can more easily 
<DIV></DIV>hit the mark, the beauty industry will move the target. There are some great 
<DIV></DIV>stats out there (The Beauty Myth contains some decent research) to show that 
<DIV></DIV>the "ideal woman", for example, is a physically impossible being already. 
<DIV></DIV>When we add cyborg technology to the mix, where will the collective ideal of 
<DIV></DIV>the perfect form move to? Somewhere as odd as it is extreme, and it will 
<DIV></DIV>motivate ever larger uptake of the sillier forms of cyborg technology. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>- Physical enhancements... In the cyberpunk literature, people tend to make 
<DIV></DIV>very silly modifications, so that they can look freaky, or have some 
<DIV></DIV>enhanced physical trait. Steve Austin, eat your heart out. However, I 
<DIV></DIV>believe that these will be the very last types of enhancements that are 
<DIV></DIV>made, and the least frequent. In the world of today, and certainly in that 
<DIV></DIV>of tomorrow, physical enhancements are and become less useful than one might 
<DIV></DIV>suppose. Leap tall buildings in a single bound? Sure... but why not just 
<DIV></DIV>take the lift? It might not turn out to be very important to a modern 
<DIV></DIV>westerner to be able to lift a small truck; it might be far more useful to 
<DIV></DIV>merely look as though you could. 
<DIV></DIV>Eventually physical enhancements will become more important, as our biology 
<DIV></DIV>begins to really let us down... we may need to change form to cope with 
<DIV></DIV>overcrowding of earth, we'll definitely need to change form to explore 
<DIV></DIV>space. That, however, is some way off. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>- Part robot... intertwined with our cyborg advances, will come advances in 
<DIV></DIV>biotech, nanotech, AI (in the loosest sense), and information and 
<DIV></DIV>communication technologies. So, it is likely that we will have some pretty 
<DIV></DIV>smart computers kicking around, grown out of the needs of the biotech 
<DIV></DIV>revolution first, then whatever follows. These will use sophisticated models 
<DIV></DIV>born of that revolution's discoveries. Evolved software, which adapts to a 
<DIV></DIV>changing enironment in real time, will be the bedrock of such systems. We'll 
<DIV></DIV>be pushing close, perhaps, to machines that do something vaguely resembling 
<DIV></DIV>thought. Certainly, they'll make this look like the stone age. 
<DIV></DIV>So, in terms of human enhancement, we are likely to see some very smart 
<DIV></DIV>control systems finding their way into, or close to, people. Tasks which 
<DIV></DIV>take manual dexterity, such as driving a car, should move to become a 
<DIV></DIV>partnership between human and machine, with the machine taking over the 
<DIV></DIV>simpler tasks which require instaneous reaction based on multiple inputs, 
<DIV></DIV>and the humans keeping a high level control. It's human as captain, computer 
<DIV></DIV>as first mate, robots for crew. 
<DIV></DIV>And what is the ship? It could be a car, which can virtually, if not 
<DIV></DIV>absolutely, drive itself. It might be a factory, which just requires a few 
<DIV></DIV>humans to make directorial pronouncements (more blue in the blue m&amp;ms 
<DIV></DIV>please), and can otherwise manage on it's own (hmm, I think this might 
<DIV></DIV>alread be happening). It might be a spacecraft whose sensory abilities are 
<DIV></DIV>translated into human equivalent sensory signals, and whose directions come 
<DIV></DIV>directly from a that human controller's nervous control signals (my fuel 
<DIV></DIV>intake valve feels a bit sticky, I'll wiggle it a bit). 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>- Part virtual robot... And some of us will end up descending (ascending?) 
<DIV></DIV>entirely into the virtual realm, with the software equivalents of cyborg 
<DIV></DIV>enhancements... intelligent agents scooting around doing our bidding (most 
<DIV></DIV>likely communicating with even more intelligent server based systems), 
<DIV></DIV>alerting systems and autonomous systems for acting on our behalf, giving the 
<DIV></DIV>as yet nu-enhanced human mind a function performance boost, and the ability 
<DIV></DIV>to move freely in a new environment for which it has not been evolved. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>- Security... People often raise the spectre of personal vulnerability in an 
<DIV></DIV>interconnected world. No one wants to find their robot arm suddenly writing 
<DIV></DIV>"0wned by Kr4XX0r 133t", or that, after installing some IBM human memory 
<DIV></DIV>expansion, they inexpicably foul themselves whenever they think about 
<DIV></DIV>Microsoft products. In response to this, I would say that we have already 
<DIV></DIV>begun on the path to extreme global interconnectedness, and are painfully 
<DIV></DIV>aware of these issues because of problems we've already experienced. 
<DIV></DIV>However, we must not forget that the world has gone on. Most of us choose to 
<DIV></DIV>remain connected despite the risk, because we perceive it to be far smaller 
<DIV></DIV>that the gain. Yes, we'll continue to have mellissa and I love you viruses 
<DIV></DIV>and internet worms. We'll continue to have script kiddies and black hat 
<DIV></DIV>hackers and international bad guys and, sometimes, catastrophes based on 
<DIV></DIV>pure incompetence. Slowly we get better at coping with these problems. We 
<DIV></DIV>will, through a combination of local intelligent design and global natural 
<DIV></DIV>selection, come to be more and more skilled at keeping the computer network 
<DIV></DIV>a safe enough place, such that, by the time people are putting their bowels 
<DIV></DIV>online, it'll be safe enough to do so. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>- Lastly, I think this discussion can get a bit silly, and will look 
<DIV></DIV>hopelessly naive from the perspective of the people of 50 years from now, 
<DIV></DIV>let alone 100. It'll look something like predicting steam-powered zeppelins 
<DIV></DIV>as the next big thing. There are so many different technological avenue down 
<DIV></DIV>which to progress, and the interaction between these, combined with a few 
<DIV></DIV>completely-out-of-left-field surprises, will take us somewhere mostly 
<DIV></DIV>obscured from here. Personally, I suspect that the mainstream culture's 
<DIV></DIV>"cyborg" is probably another flying car/videophone, and whilst it embodies 
<DIV></DIV>more useful concepts perhaps than those two others, in itself it will go 
<DIV></DIV>obsolete and embarrassing before it becomes reality. 
<DIV></DIV>However, I think that the cyborg memeset is useful at least for a while, and 
<DIV></DIV>I agree with Anders that the tendency to throw our hands up and say "We 
<DIV></DIV>can't know" is counterproductive. Babbage could see the computer, daVinci 
<DIV></DIV>could see human flight, Jules Verne could see space travel. We can see 
<DIV></DIV>transhumanity. 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>This whole discussion of mine probably looks hopelessly ill-informed to many 
<DIV></DIV>of you... so tell me why. What's important that I've missed? Where am I 
<DIV></DIV>wrong? Where is my presentation flawed? Don't quietly grumble about it to 
<DIV></DIV>yourself... if you can correct my misinformation, then I'm less likely to 
<DIV></DIV>say something problematic on the box.

I don't think the point is that Keith seriously thinks Canada will receive 
him. It is the publicity it will cause. This is going to make even more 
people hear about the case, and if you have little to lose it might be a good 
strategy. In general, even when the CoS wins a case they seem to lose 
credibility because they are forced into the open, the underdog always looks 
like the hero and journalists have a fairly easy time finding dirt on them.

You might consider using percentages:  For example, 25% of Australian
population already has had an augmentation to their bodies.  5% now use
robotic arms or legs; 10% have received pacemakers; %3 percent IUDs.
(There are arbitrary, but I think you could get some solid facts which
would be persuasive in your introduction to augmentations.) 

>You see this uptake already. I have relatives who shall remain anonymous,

HRT is a different augmentation - a chemical augment to monitor female
hormones to prevent the onslaught of menopause.  You could suggest that
even the mind is augmented by ingesting certain hormones to regulate the
chemistry of our bodies for a more healthy and vital life.

Sounds good.

How about the man who stared in The X Men?  Isn't he Aussi?
Here you could mention how reversing aging has been on the cover of
magazines, Time, Newsweek, etc.

nose lift = rhinoplasty.

You might want to consider mentioning that the concept of beauty has
changed over the eons, from Cleopatra to a Rubenesque figure to Twiggy to
the athletic bodies of today.  Beauty today is viewed as not just a symbol
of a perfect face, but also a healthy physique and attitude.

In the years to come, we will be able to regulate the body to adjust any
dryness of skin, wrinkling caused from sun damage (important to mention in
Australia) and aging.  To reverse the onslaught of aging we will see less
and less cosmetic surgery and more genetic engineering and biotechnology.
The genes that cause our minds and bodies to age more rapidly than our
desire to grow older will be reversed and we will see a more youthful
young-old generation ahead.  

The concept of beauty will change over the years and what is considered
beautiful today may not be beautiful tomorrow.  When we can alter the
color, tone and texture of our skin, alter our voices to express our
emotions with a harmonious reverberation, develop our eyes to see great
distances (etc.), beauty as we see it today might seem flat and unexciting.

I't too bad they are using the term "cyborg".  It's so metal sounding and
makes me think of Warwick.  You want to take this opportunity to be
welcoming of humanity and compassionate to why people want to look
beautiful (both men and women).  If _Aristoi_ is a wonderful example of
beauty in the future for both genders.  I get a little toasted when
thinking of old world concepts of beauty and tagging this to women as if
this is what our lives are about.  I have always said, "Beauty is a 12
letter word - "intelligence."  The most beautiful people are those who
aspire to achieve their dreams, are vital and expressive.  Not all are
pretty faces, but inspire us and allure us.  Even Cleopatra was considered
an idol, yet she was not so physically beautiful at all.

So, you could introduce the idea of enhancing "beauty in the eye of the
beholder" by saying we can tweak our visual recognition patters to
highlight facial qualities that we like and reduce those that we find
unappealiang.

You could mention Dennis Tito the space tourist and that when we reside in
space we will have different environment to cope with and we will need to
consider the consequences of space and how to protect our bodies.

But we are transhumanity.   We can see a time when disease is a thing of
the past, when the pollution is no longer an issue, etc.. (You don't want
to sound too Pollyannaish for your audience, but you do want to offer them
a vision of the future.)

It's really quite good Emlyn.  Most people want soundbytes on television,
not lengthy discourse.  You might want to pick a one-liner for each
category you will be discussing and be as succinct as possible.  Offer your
audience some facts or percentages and remember this may be new to them.

Granting asylum doesn't involve any attempt to overthrow a 
conviction.  It's more of an acknowledgement that the conviction
won't be overthrown even though it is unjust.  Canada may not be
a good choice, because they're less protective of free speech than
the US, but they would grant asylum if they thought the conviction
or the punishment was inappropriate.  In reverse, I'm sure that
an Anglophone Quebecker could get asylum in the US from the Quebec
Francophone laws if he were facing serious jail time (speaking
hypothetically; I don't think the laws prescribe that.)

Without human intervention, the biosphere will be essentially gone in much
less than a gigayear (possibly in just 500 megayears), when the solar flux
will go up as the Sun starts to move visibly off the main
Hertzsprung-Russel sequence, making Earth first turn into steamy hell only
fit for extremophiles, and then lose the volatiles entirely, before being
engulfed within the red giant atmosphere (ranging to where the current
Mars orbit is) and then deorbiting into the star core.

Before there are going to be giant asteroid impacts, which will eclipse
anything that humans could do.

The biosphere is fragile as it is, without human impact.

Has Canada or any other country actually granted U.S. citizens asylum from
the U.S. government?

I may be more jaded, but I don't think the U.S. would ever grant asylum from
a country we were friendly with.  I think we only use asylum against
countries that we accuse of systemic human rights abuses.  If we or other
countries started intervening into individual cases on their own merits, it
would become politically difficult.  I would expect government officials to
avoid these kinds of difficulties at all costs.

I read a book called "Communicating Science" which said that this was
actually not so important on TV... TV likes vague generalisations +
passionate delivery. The classic concept is that accuracy and clarity move
in an inverse relationship on the box.

I'm very good with handwaving and broad brush opinions masquerading as
"Fact", so I'll probably steer clear of garish numbers as far as possible. A
nice one is that 10% of americans are cyborgs when you look at drug feed
implants, pacemakers, articifical joints, articificial skin, etc. It must be
true, I read it on the web somewhere.

HRT is supposed to extend life, though, as a side effect (cool side effect).

Calling it rhinoplasty... that's just rubbing it in, isn't it? Like calling

Well, indeed. I'm afraid I can't get too excited about enhancements that are
all about aesthetic stuff... there are just too many important things that
need doing first. Like getting past dying young, for a start.

However, I do recognise that money will end up in life extension fields by
way of the beauty industry. Also, I understand that I am a weird geekoid,
and may not necessarily represent the average citizen :-)

Ugly detector... yes, that would be amusing. Also, it raises some

all, if people will, for the most part, repaint you as they desire in their

A few quotes from the NYT article:

"....Representative Goodlatte was more optimistic about chances for a
bill [banning Internet gambling], saying that governments that are
losing lottery revenue to the Internet might support a ban, giving his
side a new ally...."

A suprisingly honest admission.  


"....[Nevada] Senator John R. Ensign, a freshman Republican Senator who
voted
for the Goodlatte bill in the last Congress when he was in the House,
said he now had reservations. He said he still found Internet
gambling to be an "unhealthy form of gambling...."

As opposed, I suppose, to the wholesome, healthy fun of sitting on your
butt for 36 hours in a windowless room, feeding quarters into the slots,
smoking stogies, and drinkin' whiskey.

I'd start with required advances first:
- mechanical exoskeletal legs to allow people to walk instead of using
wheelchairs
- mechanical eyes to allow the blind to see
- mechanical hearts to replaced damaged ones
- artificial organs to ease the shortage of real ones

Then move into optional advances later:
- why not use those exoskeletal legs to allow non-runners to run a marathon?
- why not use artificial lungs to make scuba diving easier?
- why not use artificial eyes to allow crime fighters to see in the dark or
x-ray through walls

Then move into entertainment advances:
- why not use those exoskeletal legs to perform amazing dance sequences or
sporting feats?
- why not use artificial eyes to hook into computers directly?
- why not use artificial ears to synthesize and edit music directly?
- why not have an implanted cell phone in your ear just for the convenience
of it?
- why not have an implanted internet hookup just to surf the net from
anywhere?
- why not let surfers get a permanent coating on their skin instead of
having to smear on sunscreen every few hours?
- why not let accountants get a built-in calculator in their head instead of
having to carry one around everywhere?

I'd start with the obviously needed medical advancements first.  Then, once
we have them, we can use them for useful purposes.  Then, once they are
common or cheap, we can use them as toys or superfluous purposes.
Eyeglasses used to be functional, but now they're a fashion statement.
Contacts used to be hidden, now they are used to change eye color.

For the computer-savvy, this seems necessary.  To some, it is extraneous

This is where people get scared.  It's "unfair" that other people with
outlive them or look better by "cheating" with technology.  They could
"cheat" too, but many people think we should stick with our God-given
attributes.  Religion quickly comes into play here.

Actually, you had many wonderful and complicated thoughts all thrown out at
once.  I'm sure you'll get a lot of feedback, but you already are doing
well.

It seems like you don't consider yourself an expert in this field.  You may
not be an expert compared to some people you know, but compared to the
viewing public and the TV reporters, you are already far surpassing what
they are going to be able to cover in a single episode.

Good Luck!  Will it be carried on any C1 satellites that I might be able to
tap into?  I would love to see the show.

If you are being interviewd for a TV documentary, they are going to edit.
Producers and directors perfer crisp explanations over lengthy explanations.
If they give a topic 3 minutes, for example, they want some alluring and
exciting information and facts.  They also like sensationalism which can
later come back to bite you.  I have run into this a number of times where I
have had to turn down TV programs because they just wanted to exaggerate and
sensationalize extropians as lovers of metal and dislikers of humanness. 
This is an issue that we need to think about and consider the consequences
of overly hyping cyborgdom.

You have an opportunity to influence a lot of folks and introduce extropian
ideas -- and your music as well.

Why even consider using garish numbers.  Why not explain how the percentage
of folks receiving enhancements and augmentations are increasing.  Bring it
home by explaining that these enhancements are ones that even grandma has.

effect). Drugs may well count as cyber enhancements too... anyone got an

HRT is estrogen or combination estrogen/progestin medication. It is
generally prescribed to relieve menopausal symptoms (such as hot flashes,
etc., reduce risk of osteoporosis and reduce risk of cardiovascular disease.
There is some evidence that it may also be useful in preventing Alzheimer's
disease and colon cancer, but not used for "extending life" per se.

Male hormone testosterone is also a HRT for men.

Drugs are definitely enhancements.  We alter our brain chemistry with
chemicals.  These chemicals have helped millions of people who suffer from
depression and other more severe mental diseases. Drugs that enhance the
concentrations neurotransmitters - norepinephrine and/or serotonin at these
receptors alleviate some symptoms of depression.

Chemicals for augmenting the brain's chemistry such as dopamine would be
good to mention.

Not quite.  It's complimentary to refer to the correct surgical procedure,
not insulting.  Rhinoplasty is the medical term for nose surgery. Why call
nanotechnology "computers with small stuff". Or The Spike a the metal thang.
:-)

Why not??  Aesthetics are essential to future technologies. It's a misnomer

This one may actually seem more important to the audience than life
extension.  Imagine simply speeding up data absorbtion rates, say by
figuring out how memory is created and finding a faster way of
translating data (say, text files or books) into memory.  Got a 100
page research report or legal brief to wade through?  Plug a fast OCR
scanner into your skull, wave it over the pages, and learn it all in
detail as fast as you can turn the paper...and that's one of the more
primitive (and thus, possibly nearer-term) possibilities.  *That*, I'm
pretty sure, will make your average viewer sit up and take notice, even
those who dismiss everything else you say as fanciful.

This might actually count as a different app: personal intranet.  Even
if one rejects all external connections out of fear that hackers or
corporations may abuse them, one can still get much use out of a closed
system where every machine is responsible to oneself only - though the
'Net connection would be an improvement.  For instance, in the above, a
scientist could get through a research paper quickly.  With a
connection to the online repositories of several major journals, the
scientist could review all known research worldwide in some new field
in an afternoon.  For once, legislators might actually be able to
consider all the impacts of proposed law changes, rather than being
rushed from bill to bill and having to trust instincts and politics.
And, of course, cyber-telepathic cell phones don't make sounds when
their users get a call in the middle of a theater.

And if you want to delve into the fanciful here: imagine a computer
mind running alongside one's own, sharing all sensory input,
remembering what one remembers, recording one's judgements, all present
for playback on demand.  At first, this might seem to be merely
"perfect memory", a trait that some humans have naturally.  But it also
serves as a backup, such that if one's body fails, the box can be
transferred to a "blank slate" - say, a clone of oneself, kept mindless
and unconscious so it does not become an independent human being,
possibly engineered in an artificial womb for 20-odd years - and, with
some formatting of the organic brain, one lives again, in a younger
body (possibly better than the one that one had naturally, at least at
first).

Frankly, though, it looks like the mental aspects may be more
immediately appealing to the audience than the physical aspects, since
there is not as much public conditioning against mental augments than
against physical ones.

At least in the short term - which the audience can most relate to, and
some will confuse with the long term despite your best efforts - most
people won't have said digital eye, or at least apply it to strangers.
(Lovers, for instance, can make it so their loved one always looks like
whatever their fantasy of the moment is.)

Western European countries have refused to extradite people subject to
possible execution in the US.  Not quite asylum but it's close.  I can't
think of any explicit asylum grants, nor could I find any browsing the
Web.  I did find two denials - a Communist in the Netherlands and a 
medical marijuana advocate in BC.

There was a recent case where a Mexican transexual applied for asylum
based on the grounds that Mexican police had threatened their life.
I don't know if it was granted, but it was at least seriously considered.
The government officials were rather distressed at having to deal with
the problem, but once the asylum petition is made they no longer have
a good way to dodge it.

Hello,

Here is some information about the prospects of space mining, from
http://www.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/05/16/space.mining/index.html:

"In particular, the asteroid Amun, a mountain of natural stainless steel
mixed with
             precious metals, contains 30 times as much metal as humans
have mined and
             processed throughout history, Lewis said. The smallest of
dozens of known
             metallic asteroids, it would be worth at least an estimated
$20 trillion based on
             current market prices. "

[from cbs.com]

There are about 1.3 billion Muslims in the world. 

Their participation in the world's capital markets
has been hindered because of Islamic laws 
prohibiting the taking of interest and trading merely 
for the sake of making money; an investment must 
have an underlying asset.

But the Amana Income Fund 
http://www.amanafunds.com/advisors.htm
invests according to Islamic laws. 

And now http://www.islamiq.com/ 
tells world's Muslim population how it can invest.

-------------

The Shari'ah Law (terms, interpretations) 

"Murabahah" refers to a particular kind of sale where a seller 
agrees with a buyer to provide a certain amount of profit relative 
to an initial cost. Everything is disclosed, including the original 
costs and the profit, which can be a lump sum or percentage. 

"Musharakah" is an Arabic word meaning "to share." 
It's used in business and trade so partners share the profit 
or loss of a venture. Because interest is prohibited in Islamic law, 
if a debtor suffers a loss, the creditor can't claim a fixed rate of return 
or earn a high rate of profit. 

Shari'ah experts have come up with a "five percent rule" that deems 
"tolerable" investments in companies that have a maximum level 
of five percent of non-Shari'ah compliant activities or "tainted income 
sources." (Tainted income sources include financial institutions that 
make or pay interest and companies that have any association with 
pork products.)

Heh heh. And as soon as they park that fat boy near the earth for mining, 
the price of metal plummets....

Thanks Adrian, that's a good point which I'll keep in mind. The physical
augmentation invoke a slew of memes like frankenstein, playing god, and loss
of humanity. The mental augmentations aren't nearly so loaded in the
cultural wash, and so maybe they can be discussed more usefully. As I
consider them to have higher utility than their physical counterparts
anyway, that's a good angle for me.

Well this is a tasty mythic article to crack wide open.  Full of very broad
generalizations slugging culture below the belt (most of text) in order to
make a statement about the ethics of human cloning. (last paragraph.)

THIS is the most eloquent guy they've got? Or even ONE of the most 
eloquent? 'It doesn't feel right; I can't explain it' is his best 
argument? I say pass the party hats.

The point is not get there with a self-rep machine, stripmine
the iron mountain and ship produce back to earth. Getting there
with a smart enough machine is a sufficiently high threshold
already, not to mention shipping the stuff back and deorbiting
it (getting a kiloton of stainless steel profiles falling on
the top of your head out of the clear blue sky is probably not
the best way to wake up on Sunday morning).

The point is getting to the first rock outside this gravity well
and to *stay* there. How lucky we are to have a big rock at our
doorstep so that we don't have to design for microgravity and
relativistic lag is still tolerable for teleoperation. (We're so
lucky I'd clean suspect Anders putting it up there if this was
a space RPG, to up the pace of the game).

Once we've gotten that sustainable bridgehead in place, the solar
system is ours.

Naw, of course people still do (whitehouse.gov, for
instance ;). In fact I intend to go back to Lisp, provided 
I survive the Python experience. It's just getting productive 
in Lisp without a supportive community and a codebase is *hard*.

And, of course, there's still the issue of designing a Forth
MISC machine into a cube of bucky electronics. Of course,
you'd want to hard-wire some of the control logic too,
if you want to control mechanical parts which can operate
at up to 100 GHz.

Ya gotta laugh.  Cloning is actually pretty amazingly low on the extropian
shopping list.  I mean, I get excited about attempts to ban it, but only
because it's so dumb.  It's hardly central to the extropian view, and if he
thinks it is...

Mmm, tautology.  Or begging the question, I'm not sure which.

Heh, no need to build your own albatrosses, the world will give you plenty enough as it
is.   Although I think you should have stuck with "singularity" but every author likes
to coin neologisms I guess.

First two eps were pretty good. The cloning episode on Tuesday was a
schemozzle. A Raelian facing a professional Christian dour-gooder, with
poor Prof Alan Trounson (surely a future Nobel laureate) trying to say
useful things about epigenetic switches being munged in current cloning
experiments. I can't imagine why they didn't invite a $cientologist and a
witchdoctor as well to provide well-considered ethical and scientific
opinions.

After seeing the first two eps (I participated in the second), I'd rather
chided myself for not allowing them to name the series THE SPIKE, as was
suggested at one point. Now I'm intensely grateful to my own caution.

I mean, people think extropes are weird. A fucking *Raelian*! You all know
about them, I suppose? Life on earth was created by ETs using cloning (of
what? some primordial slime the greys just happened to have stuck to the
treads of their UFOs?), and we'll use accelerated cloning to create perfect
physical copies of ourselves, and then nanotech will copy our brain
structures into these compliant shells (a.k.a. our twins, who will thereby
be brain-murdered, but hey, get an eternal life you moralizing dolt) and
we'll go out into space where our forecritters live. Wow, thanks for
bringing us that really interesting information.

And of course the rotating smashcut graphics were all of hairless plastic
mannequins exactly alike, even though everyone kept saying `It would be a
stupid and vulgar mistake to imagine that delayed twins are *carbon copies
of you*...'

I'm hoping to see Emlyn appear in a crushed aluminium foil suit, insisting
that he's beamed back here from the future to prevent the cloning of Jesus,
which went terribly wrong and caused all the oceans to turn to rather pissy
and undrinkable wine.

 I've met both personally and they fulfilled their reputations. To each

You've got the conch shell, Dwayne. I'd like to hear your reasoning.


I don't think you are alone in this idea, although I am yet to be convinced
of it's validity. If I keep seeing documentaries about Easter Island,
though, I might start having nightmares...

done now?

I understand people here are a *bit* biased in favour of tech, but look at the monkeys
pushing the buttons and tell me we are all safe.

Well, basically, I think some bio-weapon will get loose and do us in, or something will
stuff up the biosphere and take us out.

My current long-term plans involve somewhere remote and defensible, ostensibly because I
like the bush and want to set up an eco-village/community thing, but I'm also aware that
such a device would be mighty useful at some point in the future, at least until I can
afford an asteroid stocked with supermodel DNA and a clone factory.

I'm less pessimistic about some funky physics prac taking out this end of the universe,
but the biologicals are just WAY yoo fuzzy for me to feel comfortable with. We are
tinkering with incredibly complex systems, without understanding what we are tinkering
with, let alone what the effects of our tinkering will be.

Forwarded as requested. The cough and gurgle thing is indeed showing up in
my crystal ball as well, but it won't off all of us (max 99%, or so, if
really carefully designed). Even if we have to start crawling back from
the precivilisatory muck (unlikely, there must be shelters), the artifacts
and the records are all there.

Realtime DNA screening and personal sterile seals.

it does it all the ways at the same time.

Well, depends on the incubation times. Also consider the increase in global air
transport in the future. I'm assuming we will all live (otherwise i'dnot be making
long-term plans) but I suspect we are doomed.

Well, prions are a good example of how we can only screen for what we are aware of.
"Personal sterile shields"?? Body-doms? All the time? Ick.

There's a revival of LISP with the younger free software generation. See

It's been discussed on the MISC mailing-list quite some time,
but it looks like even more vaporware than Tunes (well, bets are open).

[ François-René ÐVB Rideau | Reflection&Cybernethics | http://fare.tunes.org ]
[  TUNES project for a Free Reflective Computing System  | http://tunes.org  ]
The LISP community lost the celestial mandate as it closed and split
its hacker community into corporations hoarding proprietary systems.
LISP mostly excluded newcomers from its elite hacker base, except a few
lucky enough to ride on a $100,000 subvention for a LISP Machine,
and thus withered away into irrelevance and repeated bankruptcy.
As says my mother, LISP hackers were punished for their greed and arrogance.

Life in general is tough, and we're especially tough because we use
technology as our adaptable interface. The technology is dangerous, but
luckily to become really dangerous you need evil intent, and the
properties pathological, smart and big $$$s are truly rare.

Unless you design something deliberately, putting considerable (money,
people, hardware) investments towards deliberately completely evil intent
it's hard to take us all out.

Some of us monkeys are thinking about how to prevent stupid or
deliberately evil monkeys to depopulate this particular Gibraltar rock.
You can use technology to insulate from impacts of technology. For
instance, the same technologies which have been invented to make canned
monkeys live off-rock sustainably, to keep them healthy, and to survive
attacks by other monkeys can be used to shield us from above malicious
and bumbling intent.

Most current bioweapons can only take out something like 80% in best case.
You need several of the delayed-kill ones released stealthily ubiquitously
simultaneously. That's a rather specific point in parameter space. You
can't hit it by mistake, you have design for it.

The gray goo thing is sufficiently difficult to build, and by that time
we'll have enough canned monkeys living off-rock so that it won't be the
end of all of us.

> My current long-term plans involve somewhere remote and defensible,

A well-stocked (many, many tons of supplies) natural cave or an abandoned
mine in deep redneck country should do nicely. If no one knows you're
there, you don't even need to shoot. If you have a delayed (preferably
fossil) water source you could stay in there for decades. It helps if
you're naturally hermitish, and can live off books. Most normal people
would go crazy after just a few weeks.

Another reason to work towards Diaspora. Of course, if the problems behind
your back don't nuke themselves, they're going to overtake you while in
transit.

Yes, imagine the alternative reality branch when we would have gotten PCs
based on Lisp hardware. What would 20 years of hardware and software
development culminated in? No one knows. Thank you, IBM, Intel, Microsoft
and your innumerable quislings.

I'm leaving to set up CMU/Hemlock for my next box. Time to upgrade anyway,
the current motherboard has seen three generations of processors already,
it ain't going to last forever. Will do nicely as online node, though.

I like Forth because of the minimalism both in hardware and software.
Another alternative reality branch: Chuck's current designs cropping up
~1980. If we ever are going to get affordable desktop nanolithoprinters...

Forth and Lisp are really a curious pair of siamese twins.

The only good thing about XML is that it is an industry standard.

On the Internet, anybody can fake e-mail messages. In fact, the only thing

which means a host [209.115.238.117] contacted the local mail server, said
the message came from <owner-extropians@extropy.org> for <kpj@sics.se>.
Anybody can trivially easy fake the rest of the message.

But the message _appears_ to contain a message for the Extropians Mailing
List from some entity calling itself ``Lee Corbin <lcorbin@ricochet.net>''.
So when I quote, I as much, since I know that and nothing more for certain.

But I dod not. Your Eudora (e-mail client) did that.

It added the ``<a href=....>'' and ``</a>'' which I did not write,

This practice allows for e.g. tracing anybody on the mailing list

You know, we haven't even killed ourselves with nukes yet, nor even a really
very large proportion of our population. Or with bioweapons. That's either a
damned miracle, or some hint that our crazy world has some kinds of checks
and balances built in somewhere. Or a bit of both.

Well, ok, that's not an unusual position to support. Leaving aside realism,
I'm not sure how useful it is to go down that path; just not very
constructive. But, that's a personal choice.

Well, heading for the hills wont save you if you are right. Getting off
planet is a decent idea... I think a lot of us support getting offworld and
establishing something of humanity elsewhere, as a racial backup plan.

I originally read this as "*whisper* or band".  Naturally, I thought to
myself, "Why not both?"

...

"Bang," whispered the eco-terrorist as he pressed the big red button on his
remote control.  Nothing happened.  He pressed it again.  Still nothing.  He
banged the device against the wall of his tiny blast cocoon.  Still, it
wouldn't work.

He swore.  After raising millions of dollars from criminal activities and
years of planning the final destruction of the world's most advanced physics
research center, the detonator fails.  The idiots probably forgot the
batteries!  He swore and jabbed at the release mechanism for his pod.  He
would have to trigger the bombs manually.

There was a strange hissing noise as the pod opened.  He felt nauseous and
dizzy all at once.  Was it gas?  Had the jackbooted scientists found him?
He tried to see through the opening of his pod through a migraine that was
stabbing through both eyes, deep into his brain, but he couldn't see
anything.  He couldn't tell if it was the darkness or pain that was blinding
him.

When the pod door swung fully open, he realized that there was nothing
there.  No room, no horizon, nothing.  Through the melted outer portal, he
stared out into space.  The entire planet was gone.  He tried to scream, but
the atmosphere had completely drained from his compartment.  Only his final
realization echoed silently in his brain as his near-frozen corpse tumbled
slowly into the vacuum of space....

I think that is the better plan, to consider the asteroids like that as
long term asteroids, and not like icebergs to be towed to port for
water.

So, at some point, this is how I see it developing, something is sent
there that is constructive in nature, it mines the metal ore there,
smelts and refines it, perhaps in a very small furnace, and there builds
a station, with the capacity to launch to the other ones.

Here, nano could be very helpful by being the quantum storage of the
site plan and when getting there, multiplying off the metal into the
heavy equipment.  Alternately, the mining might be by multitudinous
spaceworthy metallic robotic digger wasps, where all the initial mining
would simply hole a cavity, and the rest would be self contained within
the rock.

Now, all this material has value.  For example, throughout the universe,
there are billions and billions of tons of gold and platinum, more than
ninety-nine percent of which has absolutely no value to anyone here.  It
is either not here, or we are not there, thus that extrasolar materials
have zero impact on our economy.

Thus, the transportation cost of the self-replicating mining material
would essentially make in space separate mineral economies.  If that
station was called Amun, in the Amun economy, a gallon of milk could
have an economic cost of hundreds thousands of dollars, where steel
would be free.

In terms of returnings those materials to Earth, that brings into the
question heavy drop capabilities, as opposed to heavy lift.  The metals
could be aeroformed into supertankers and dropped into orbit to reach
Earth at a leisurely pace, there to float gently to the ocean, and from
there to port.

I misread the first word, and then mistyped the second word.  I meant
"whisper or bang".

(Banging head against keyboard)  Why? Why? Why can't I read, think and type
at the same time?

Slashdot pointed a few weeks ago to an article about how LISP gave
a competitive advantage to Viaweb, which provided turnkey Internet
storefronts.  This software is now running Yahoo! Stores.  The article
is by Paul Graham, who co-developed the software with Robert Morris
(yes, the Internet Worm guy).

   Such fast turnaround on bug fixes put us into an impossibly tempting
   position.  If we could catch and fix a bug while the user was still on
   the phone, it was very tempting for us to give the user the impression
   that they were imagining it.  And so we sometimes (to their delight)
   had the customer support people tell the user to just try logging
   in again and see if they still had the problem.  And of course when
   the user logged back in they'd get the newly released version of
   the software with the bug fixed, and everything would work fine.
   I realize this was a bit sneaky of us, but it was also a lot of fun.

Because pressing keys with your head tends to interrupt the flow of
thoughts, and of course with your head in that position it is very difficult
to see the screen or a piece of paper. Best use your hands instead :-)

To find clues, one must read the papers, not just the titles.

One of the articles below states that it is useless to create small pockets of
pristine "nature" -- but rather forget pristineness and rather make sure the
biosystems remain well-connected geographically, so that diversity is
maintained, and that reduces the chances of an ecologic collapses, and improves
the efficiency of natural evolution.

The biosphere is doing useful things in a slow but reliable way, perhaps
inventing new chloroplasts, antioxidants, and other useful chemicals and
chemical systems, which are produced in an efficient and self-replicating
manner. Even if all that might eventually be ditched, you do not want to ditch
it before you already have better and working alternatives. Until then, the
biosphere better be allowed to operate efficiently. Also, it's pointless wiping
out potentially useful species for idiotic reasons such as planting yet more
coffee/banana/coca plantations for the sole purpose that yet a few more morons
in the third world can buy BMW's.

        Aleks

This came up in at the Foresight SA meeting last month in the
"Nanotechnology & Space" discussion group.  My group had the
problem of "How do you enroll the greens in the development
of space?".  The conclusion we came to was that you want to
sell them the idea that we could cheaply get people off the
planet and reduce the footprint of humanity.

But to be logically consistent with their position, you couldn't
have the non-greens go into space leaving the greens behind.
The greens had to go too!  So we figured that we would terraform
Venus (no natural ecology there that we know of) and let
all the greens live there and occupy a huge VR of the Earth
where all of the inputs are pseudo-real based on large numbers
of micro-cameras left on Earth.

I doubt that scenario is one that is going to appeal to most
of the greens however.

About the ownership rights, it would seem to be like homesteading on the
frontier.  Large organization might be able to put into place plans that
could reach these outposts first, as well, small organizations might
carry out similar plans.  Thus, if people start landing on the moon,
there is almost first the aesthetic aspect, as almost all the humans on
Earth can see the moon at various times, thus that a goal of development
would be to be invisible to the naked eye from Earth.  A low powered
telescope might be able to see the cities on the moon, which would have
light emissions controls in particular, to avoid disruption of
astronomy.

Then, if the land is considered frontier, then as we have already been
learning about how we must conserve and respect our planet's resources,
we would have that perspective as we consider what could actually take
place within a realistic timespan.  As well, it is recognized that those
places could form their own governments, as well, they could be a part
of government on Earth, for example, having a postal code, and some
would probably be government outposts, for they would be among the
organizations at that scale.

About the asteroids, as they are mined they can be refit to monoliths.
Then, they can be spun to gravity, which is a reliable gravity
simulation mechanism, probably, and sown with Earth life.

One thing to consider is that we could engineer anaerobic space-hardy
mutations of Earth life.  Engineering it is the difference between
allowing it to happen without intercession and not.  Technology offers
many opportunities.

Thank's for posting this, it was very interesting indeed. If
properly distributed, say by means of the all american pamphlet, it
could have wide reaching influence.

Part's of it read like an almost literal call to arms,
"Scientists and doctors who's names we know""To do nothing now is
to accept the responsibility for the deed and all that follows."

But clearly one of the more erudite of the opposition.

Unfortunately Curt, you are simply wrong.  (Ooopppps... I think
I hear the politeness police knocking at my door....).

We do *not* need machine-phase self-replication (by which I'm
assuming you mean classical diamondoid self-replicating nanobots)
in order to solve "all our problems".  As pointed out by Damien
in the Spike (quoting me from the EI archives and/or a personal
communication) you have to carefully differentiate between
"self-replication", "self-assembly", "molecular assembly"
*and* mechano-synthetic, non-solution phase assembly of materials
stronger than those that can be produced by available methods.

The first three (SR, SA & MA) are all properties of normal
biological organisms.  And because you can get the SR times
of these down to ~20 minutes (at least), you can solve
"all our problems" because the mass doubling time of organisms
we can design is much faster than the mass doubling time of our
humanity.

And I'm fairly sure we can design them to build a house, at
least there is a description of what that would look like in
my current business plan.  Mind you it might take a couple
of years to grow the house using only local energy sources
but it does seem feasible.

I'm willing to make $100 bets with people that the
manufacturing cost of designer bacteria with 1 million+
base genomes will be under $10.00 by 2010.  I suppose this
is something we should move over to the idea futures site
so I can make a killing on it...

Does anyone know if this is any different from the work of

  "Information Storage and Retrieval Through Quantum Phase",

  Physics Review Letters 79(2):325-328 (1997)
  http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/9706033

As far as I can tell this is based on pumping the electrons
up to specific energy state and then extracting the information
by dropping the electrons back down to a lower energy state.
(I can only think of electrons as particles due to too much
digital imprinting unfortunately).

Can anyone with a hard physics background comment on the
lifetime of the electrons in an excited (quantum entangled?)
state?  My astronomy text says the lifetime is ~10 nsec
before they return to the ground state but does this
change with temperature?

The physics makes my head hurt.  If this turns out to be feasible
my probability guess that we are living in a simulation is going

And if you want to know how 'dusty' the environment is around
your Extropic Art manifesto, then ask me !! I'll tell you
when some 'storms' are weathering the dear thing ...

Weather report from last August/September: VERY dusty.
(don't worry though about damage.. the particles are submicron).
Cassini, with our dust instrument, while still 1AU from Jupiter,
entered a Jovian dust 'storm', rather than Jovian dust 'stream' ...
Io's  volcanoes might have been very active near then.

Why is that?  I don't see the connection.  To me it looks like the precise
opposite effect ought to obtain; time travel is very computationally
expensive, if not outright impossible to "simulate" without an actual time
machine, and should just happen to not be developed in most simulations of
a pre-Singularity world.

I have to say that the possibility gives me the screaming meemies,
especially since the whole thing sounds like it would easily be within the
reach of a medium-sized laboratory rather than a massive trillion-dollar
project.  There are some things that Man Was Not Meant To Tamper With
Before The Singularity.  Why the dickens did Mallett take this to a
newspaper instead of the NSA?  I'd much rather that this was a government
black project.

Oh, well, if we're going to do this pre-Singularity, we might as well
build a long-term-stable time machine sooner rather than later, so
post-Singularity we can go back and collect everyone who's died since
then.  Just have to make sure the effect is wide enough to dump a fair
collection of femtomachines down the tube, and that nobody uses it to take
over the world in the meanwhile.

Hi folks,

Some of you space launch/Earth environment people might be interested
to know about some of the workshops and conferences that ESA
or ESTEC (European Space Agency Technology Center) organizes on
spacecraft debris in Earth orbit, earth's plasma and magnetic
environment  etc.  If you start here:

http://www.estec.esa.nl/conferences/

then follow the links. These pages often contain astronomy astracts,
so I gain alot of information by browsing their conference pages.

The seminar -- presentations of results -- that I just attended
in Noordwijk can be seen at:

http://www.estec.esa.nl/wmwww/wma/fp_days_2001/FPday2001.htm

(my presentation describing Earth dust-debris charging and dynamics is
near the end)

I see also from links that the abstracts for the "First European
Astrobiology Conference" Italy (Robert going to that?)
are online now too.

Isn't Robin organizing a generalized betting market somewhere?
Maybe we should make bets as to when this idea futures market
will or won't appear? [With the additional benefit that if enough people
bet against it, someone will collect the stakes, then step forward and
make it happen -- how does that fit or not fit in Robin's way

	why would one need a time machine to simulate a time machine? i
mean, if i were not the chrononaut who's actually going back in time, all
i would see are some newspaper headlines. if i _were_ going back in time,
the only overhead would be the portion of the world that i would notice to
be different -- one wouldn't even need to fork the entire simulation.

Yes, because they wrote:
" The caveat is that one should be careful of comparing 
an inefficient classical algorithm with an efficient quantum one. 
The experimental implementations of the Grover search to date 
have not in fact implemented a search of an unsorted database, 
but rather a database with one single marked item. 
Therefore experimental evidence for the claimed speedup has 
yet not been achieved, since a sorted database can be 
searched classically in log 2 N steps, which is
identical to the readout limit for a quantum computer.
The superiority of the quantum search algorithm becomes
apparent only when one examines carefully the notion of a
query. It is evident that there is no information gain in the sort
of oracle query described above, which involves only unitary
transformations. It is in the encoding of such oracles, which
must be done by a quantum computer, that the real speedup
occurs. Once a properly encoded oracle is available, the number
of steps required to perform the information processing is
then limited by the final register readout to O(log 2 N).This
is exactly the same as for a classical information processor,
which shows that it is the realization of actual information
by the readout, as opposed to predictive information that is
contained in the quantum state, that is the ultimate limiting
procedure in quantum information processing.
We have shown here that if the readout of the register is
performed by particle counting then there exists a one-to-one
correspondence of single-particle quantum interference and 
classical interference. Therefore we conclude that any enhancements
in processing power that can be ascribed to quantum
interference can also be found in classical wave processors,
and this includes systems based on modal entanglement.
Multi-particle entanglement, on the other hand, may provide
enhancements that cannot be efficiently transcribed to classical
interferometers, even when particle counting is used to
realize the output information. "

And then: ". As a consequence, computers
based on classical waves are as efficient as those
based on single quantum particles."

S. Wallentowitz, I.A. Walmsley, J.H. Eberly
http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0009069

"How big is a quantum computer?"

Accounting for resources is the central issue in computational 
efficiency. We point out physical constraints implicit in
information readout that have been overlooked in classical 
computing. The basic particle-counting mode of read-out sets a
lower bound on the resources needed to implement a quantum 
computer. As a consequence, computers based on classical waves
are as efficient as those based on single quantum particles

"Generation of correlated photons in controlled spatial modes 
by down-conversion in nonlinear waveguides"

We report the observation of correlated photon pairs generated 
by spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a quasi-phase
matched KTiOPO4 nonlinear waveguide. The highest ratio of 
coincidence to single photon count rates observed in the 830 nm
wavelength region exceeds 18%. This makes nonlinear waveguides 
a promising source of correlated photons for metrology and
quantum information processing applications. We also discuss 
possibilities of controlling the spatial characteristics of the
down-converted photons produced in multimode waveguide structures.

Excellent Amara. This weather report brings home the fact that travelling
out into space there is a CD containing a piece of writing that hundreds of

Extropic Art Manifesto

We are transhumans.

Our art integrates the most eminent progression
of creativity and sensibility
merged by discovery.



I am the architect of my existence. My art reflects my vision and represents
my values. It conveys the very essence of my being—coalescing imagination
and insight, challenging all limits.

We are exploring how current and future technologies affect our senses, our
cognition and our lives. Our attention to  these relationships become fields
of art as we participate in the most immediate and vital issues for
transhumanity— extending life, augmenting intelligence and creativity,
exploring the universe.

Artists, as communicators, bring together the passions, the dreams and the
hopes of transhumanity and express these emotions in ways that touch us
deeply.  Extropic Arts reflects an appreciation of aesthetics in a
technologically enhanced world.

We are voices of transhumanity. Our voices are a synthesis, rhythm and
exploration of imagination.

The Extropic Art Movement regards art as more than an artifact. Art
influences social and cultural change: how we live and who we are. It
creates a sense of self, art as being, autonomous yet connected to culture’s
continuum. How we accomplish our intentions is a matter of selective
individual choice—whether abstract or representational, whether artifact or
conceptual. Our criteria for art remain open and we welcome
cross-disciplinary innovations.

As we move into the 21st Century, Extropic Art will suffuse the universe
around us. Our unique ingenuity will spread far out into the capillaries of
our culture. We are active participants in our own evolution from human to
posthuman. We are shaping the image—the design and the essence—of what we
are becoming.

Organisms with complex macrostructural construction abilities
have rather slow doubling times.   If you want to look at a house-
builder, the appropriate model is a tree, with doubling times in
years or decades.   Further, we're a very long way from 
enigneering trees to grow particular shapes.  And think how
long it will take to test it! :-)

You have to define "designer".  I can make a bacteria
to do certain things for far less than that, but only
a few particular limited things.  If you mean a bacteria
which can build a house, you're on.

If we didn't, we wouldn't be holding this discussion. Maybe our incredible
strain of luck is about to run out. That proposed time machine thing worries
me a bit. Of course the rational attitude is "hey, this is SO BIG, it can't
work. No way!". But the physics sounds pretty pedestrian, and it says it's
going to work. Assuming the causality censor mechanism is for real, and 
we'll get a little energy release which destroys the apparatus, and a little
excess? Maybe a lot of excess? Like a DIY GRB, or something which literally
nukes this spacetime?

In case it really works, do we really want to poke a hole right to end
of spacetime? Remember, this is not Star Trek. If this is for real, 
you can't make it go away in the next episode. Sure it's fun if you 
get modulated Rosetta stone transmissions back which make look Contact like
a sad joke, but what if God from the end of time makes a little home call, 
in the flesh? Here's your Rapture for yah, verily, halleluja. Assuming
"lord, such affairs are hard on the heart" type of experiments become
commonplace? Sooner or later you might hit the jackpot. Or win the
nth round of russian roulette. (Okay, I've been bitten by Billie Joy. It's
time for a little memetic decontamination).

Yes, but even if we "only" off 80% of us all, that's rather lousy odds.

You can't kill all of us with nukes. If one makes a really large attempt
at fissioning all available uranium and thorium in open-pit type of reactors 
(so amateurishly prototyped in the Ukraine), packaging the hot nuclids 
for optimal atmospheric transport and bioavailability (or vaporising them 
with a large nuke after the reactor core has burnt out) or whatever
else Dr. Strangelove would come up with, you could probably eliminate 
all higher life. It would take decades of preparation and operation, 
though. Not exactly a garage type operation.

Er, we don't have bioweapons worth mentioning. We'll probably have capabilities
to do some rather fancy stuff in 30 years. We better start working on the 
realtime pathogen DNA screening infrastructure (aerosol sniffers and mass screening
of anonymized blood and tissue samples), realtime messaging infrastructure, 
personal sterile seals and training in their use. A little modernisation of 
"duck and cover!". If you catch it early, and clamp down hard with quarantine,
it's going to fizzle, whether this is a stealthy or a firestorm attack.
Of course you could lose some 10 k people before you catch it.

It's a probability thing. The higher the level of tech, the larger the population 
pool and the longer you wait, the more probable it gets. Yes, space development
does increasingly look more and more sensible.

Right now making preparations to head for the hills (rather, caves/mines)
is imo a rather practical, down to earth solution. Just as this guy in
Australia who's burying large microfiche libraries in places where they
would last kiloyears. (God bless his little furry feet). One should not 
discourage diversification. These are purely personal projects of selected 
fruit- and nutcakes, so they're not even funded with your tax money. Let 
them. We could be wrong, so they (and their offspring) would have another 
go at the game.

I suppose the closest thing to a view from Cassini that I'm thinking of 
would be at:

Cassini *should* have a Webcam so that we can see the vantage point of "We 
are transhumans" as the Extropic Art Manifesto recedes ever-farther into 
space. Perhaps you wouldn't see much most of the time, though it could be 
made very interesting using augmented reality-type overlays (such as in 
Distant Suns or other astronomy programs).

*Knowing* that a powerful extropic message is heading out into space is 
wonderful. It would be even better if we could have even a limited 
experience of going with it. Hmm, I wonder if any programmers on this List 
would be able to hook up the Extropic Art Manfesto webpage with live 
updating of a visual display of Cassini's position? Even better, of the 
view from Cassini (without the webcam -- obviously reconstructed from an 
astronomy program).

Thinking about this, making such a display available would be smart thing 
for the ESA to do (and NASA on future launches). It would increase interest 
in space projects.

So, any programmers out there up to the job?

Onward and Outward!

Max

Hi Spike,

This thread is pretty stale by now, but I just got around to it. (Reading
this list is like drinking from a fire hose.)

I checked the responses from other readers and even did a key-word search on
the IMDB, but didn't find references to 3 stories with a cryonics theme :

One was a story that ran through about six episodes of  The Wise Guy: The
'bad guy' was demented, and the discovery that he had his parents in cryonic
suspension in the cellar was used as proof of this. Their defrosting,
treated as a liberation, as part of the resolution of the story. Very
unpleasant.

An episode of the X-files gave it a weird twist (naturally). The deanimated
was dreaming in his dewar and influencing events through psychic powers.
Leave it to the X-files!

The third one was remarkably positive, and I'm surprised that no one
remembered it. On an episode of LA Law a former acquaintance of one of the
lawyers tells him that she is dying of a brain tumor. She wants to be frozen
immediately before the tumor destroys her brain, but the cryonics
organization can't participate in what would be legally regarded as a
suicide. The team took her case and sued to let her be allowed to have
herself frozen, not as a suicide, but as a way to save her life. And they
laid out the premise of cryonics: that it stops the clock for that person so
that current technical capabilities are irrelevant. The judge gave her
permission, but told her to do it immediately because he was fairly certain
he would be overruled on appeal. In the last scene as she's about to be
frozen, she thanks her friend for saving her life. Steven Bochco produced
that series. This episode was so positive and helpful, even proselytizing,
that I wondered if he had taken a personal interest in cryonics. Does anyone
know?

I can think of only four references to cryonics in film/TV:

1)  Clarke's 2001
2)  6 Million Dollar Woman
3)  Woody Allen's Sleeper
4)  Austin Powers

In reference 1, it was only *sorta* cryonics: suspended animation
for the long trip to Saturn.

Reference 2, cryonics was used as an advanced medical procedure,
holding a patient until she could be repaired by robotics.  She lost
her most recent memories.  Poor Lee Majors.

Extropians, I went downtown San Jose last Sunday to
check out restaurants for E5.  Looks like we have 59
choices within walking distance, but I picked out 16
that look really good.  I figure we can split up into
amoebae of 8 to 12 extropians per amoeba, then
ooze over and engulf our food.  The Hilton has a
detailed restaurant map that shows all the things
mentioned in this epistle.

Keep in mind that the Towers are right in the middle
of the high rent district, so the places that are really
close tend to be upscale, but if you are willing to walk
a few hundred meters north and east over towards the
university district, there is plenty of reasonable choices.
Some of the places are closed on Sunday.  I would not
blame anyone if they carry a lunchbox to keep
options open, hang out at the hotel.  If you do go
onto the campus there are plenty of eateries, over
in the Student Association Center, etc.

Restaurants.  Here are spike’s picks, listed in approximate
order of closeness to the Towers.

1.  The City Bar and Grill.  This is the restaurant right
on the ground floor of the Hilton Towers.  The place
looked good, unfortunately I did not get to look at the
menu. I was wearing my motorcycle costume,
consequently the maitre’d had a look of growing
concern as I approached.  I veered away, much to
his relief.  I cannot say I blame him, for any restaurant
that would serve me the way I looked, Im not sure
I would want to eat there.

2.  Miro’s in the Crowne Plaza, across the street
from the Towers to the North.  They have a nice
mural of the Silicon Valley from back when it was
still carbon valley.  Food looks good, perhaps a
little fancy schmancy for my taste, cloth napkins
and such, but a good choice for those who do not
like to walk or those whose schedule is tight.

3.  Cafe Primavera, 303 Almaden Blvd, right
across the street from the Towers to the West.
Italian, on the trendy spendy side.

4.  Scotts Seafood, 185 Park Ave, about 200
meters north of the Towers.  Ive eaten there,
really good food but prices are high and I think
you need reservations.  971-1700.

5.  The Agenda.  Ive been here a couple times
and this one is waaay over on the spendy side,
gourmet dishes, endangered species flambe and
such, however they have bands in there on
Saturday nights.  That one is just one street
west of the convention center.  The Hilton is
adjacent to the towers.  399 S. First Street.

6.  Kukar’s House of Pizza.  About 300 meters
south of the Towers, 527 Almaden Blvd.

7.  Eulipia.  Gourmet, spendy.  Ate there once
for a retirement party.  374 S. First.

8.  Original Joe’s.  Lots of choices on the menu,
looks good, prices reasonable.  301 S First street.
Between the Agenda and Joe’s there are three
other places that might be acceptable, and all
these are close to the Towers, 300 meters or so.

9.  Grill on the Alley, in the Fairmont Hotel.
More highly competent cooking, still on the fancy
side.

10.  Museum Cafe, in the San Jose Museum of Art.

11.  Subway!  You know what you’re getting,
good price, vegetarian stuff available, fast.  Thats
a couple blocks north of the Towers, 164 W. San
Fernando.

12.  Fuji’s Sushi.  Never eaten there but looks
good.  156 San Fernando.

13.  Johnny Rocket’s! good burgers, reasonable
prices, 150 S. First.

14.  Hawg’s Seafood Bar.  150 S. Second.
Looks good, haven’t eaten there.

15.  Tied House!  Excellent burgers, reasonable
prices, casual atmosphere, can handle bigger
amoebae of 15 to 20.  Microbrewery.  Actually
it would be way cool if they had a nanobrewery:
they would put powdered hops in your glass,
add water, stir.  Lots of good food at the Tied House,
and there is a cluster of places right next to it on
either side, so a bunch of us might want to wander
up that way.  Its about 600 meters north of the
Hilton Towers.  65 N. San Pedro.

16.  Spaghetti Factory.  Good food, reasonable
prices, can handle big groups.  Might be crowded.
Right next to the Tied House on San Pedro.

There are also some steak houses and such up
that way next to the Tied House, and a vegetarian
restaurant across the street, Thepthai’s, where I
understand they serve plants.  23 N Market, and
some other choices along Market Street.
We shall not go hungry.

Things to see while looking for sustenance:  Cesar Chavez
Plaza is a little park just north and east of the towers.
Check out the sculpture of the snake at the south end
of the park.  The City of San Jose paid a million dollars
for this abomination.  Tax dollars hard at work.  Cesar
Chavez I understand was some Union leader or something.
I guess he served alongside General Grant.  Sometimes
street vendors hang around the Park, where one can
score a dog and cola, or perhaps a hot soft pretzel.

At the north end of that park is the San Jose Museum
of Art.  Inside one finds paintings and sculptures and
such.  Too bad they don’t take the snake, and place
it somewhere where I need not look at it.  Right beside
the Art Museum is St. Joseph’s Cathedral.  They are
tolerant of atheists, so look in there if you get a chance,
just to see what they have done with stained glass.
They’ve made windows out of it.

Across the way, you might see the Knight-Ridder
building where they produce the local communist
propaganda sheet, thinly disguised as the San Jose
Mercury News.  In those pages you will likely find
whining that George Bush is unwilling to drain the
national treasury to buy power for Taxifornia.

The Tech museum down the street from the Towers.
A little on the juvenile side, but they have an IMAX,
and you need not pay for museum admission to see it.
You may see a cable car on San Carlos Street, San
Jose’s lame attempt to be San Francisco.  They
don’t do the bell thing.

This is gonna be fuuuuuun!  {8-]  spike

Okay.  So Arthur C. Clark once wrote a story about the
next Einstein being a black African (Nokromo, or something,
I don't remember which story---probably Childhood's End).

And Greg Egan also had the next great physicist being black
---in Distress, I think it was.

And now you.  (At work, I just started your very fun
story of the Aboriginal scholar and his nephew who are
apparently set to teleport to the stars.)

By induction, one infers that all Empire SF writers really
like this idea.  (Actually, the last longish book I read,
Cosm, by Benford, also had a black physicist making the big
next breakthough, so it's not exclusively Empire physicists,
though they came up with it first.)

Why exactly would you guys love it?

Oh yeah, we first make one of them fancy Bose-Einstein time machines,
and we've even got a product. All you have to do is to one of them
things from 50 years downstream. Hope they still take today's money,
and the inflation wouldn't be too bad...

Safe?  No.  But if we don't develop some better technology that
increases our reasoning and communicative power (perhaps
supplanting it with AI), then we will be pretty well done for in
my opinion.  We cannot sit where we are or survive our current
limitations for long without some major stress destroying us.  

Risky as it is, I honestly believe our only hope lies in going
forward.  

That said I don't believe that technology is all we need by any
means.  We need a vision of where we wish to go and a unified,
rational ethics really badly if we are going to increase the
odds of our not only surviving but thriving.

Spike, thank you very much for doing this!  We'll probably print this up

I've had discussions about this article off-list with Max and
Damien, but since Brian saw fit to post the article on-list
I feel it is necessary to respond to correct any incorrect
memes that may be circulating as a result.

[Brian -- In the future before you copy an article to a list that
mentions an Extropian -- you *might* want to check with any mentioned
extropians to determine *whether* or *not* the comments are accurate!
At a fundamental level -- are you verifying your sources or are you
propagating religious "hear-say"?]

Actually, there is little agreement that the lifespan can be
extended within the people qualified to discuss this.  The
recent bet between Steve Austad and S. Jay Olshansky (mentioned
in The Scientist) points this out (though they are two of the
optimists who are debating on whether the extension can be to 130
or 150 years).  Anyone who is well informed in this area knows
the answers *are NOT* in "regenerative drugs".  (But since
investment bankers see the word "drugs" and read it as "$$$"
this is what gets discussed.)

Steve has seen a copy of my current business plan which speaks to
some of the advanced biotechnologies related to pro-longevity therapies.
This quote is before he read the plan and I suspect he would
view the longevity numbers now as even higher.

> Ellison has shown a lifelong fascination with science and age. 

Larry has a strong interest in science yes.  He has a strong
physics background and spent a summer vacation "doing" molecular
biology research.  I believe that I most probably played a catalytic
role in his interest in aging research.  During the years of 1982-1987
when I had the greatest contact with him, he never expressed an interest in
"aging" per se, so this comment would seem to be "reporting" spin-doctoring.

This is completely incorrect.  The information that I have indicates
that both Larry and Bob were investing in companies that
were doing cancer drug research that could have saved Bob.
So they were both doing what they could to try and address Bob's
situation.  Though I do not remember the exact dates, it was
probably sometime between late 1996 to mid 1997, I did propose
to Bob that he should take a serious look at cryonics.  He
discussed it with me but rejected the idea because he did not
want his family to live their lives for many years not knowing
whether he was alive or dead (an interesting response and quite
valid from my perspective).

> One was Aeiveos ... founded by Robert Bradbury ...

Another interesting case of the reporter getting it incorrect.
Aeiveos Corporation was founded by myself in 1992 and never
received any funding from Larry.  It was the joint partnership
between Aeiveos Corporation and Tako Ventures -- known
as "Aeiveos Sciences Group" that was supported indirectly
by Larry.  During most of its operational lifetime (~86%)
I had appointment authority for the majority of the ASG board.
The termination of the AC/ASG partnership was initiated by myself.

> breakthrough, profits were elusive, observers said.

It was not so much that "profits were elusive", but that the
business plan was intentionally designed for an investor
such as Larry that could fund a long term research effort
that *was not* designed to produce profits in the normal
time period investors require.  In late 1997 Tako choose
not to continue investing in Aeiveos Sciences Group.
Subsequently the Ellison Medical Foundation was formed
to fund aging research similar to that which ASG had
previously been conducting.  The rational for this remains
a mystery to me.

> ``I find it intriguing,'' said Johnson, the scientist, ``that Larry

Precisely.  People working in the field of aging research
and interventions have only made serious progress in the
last 3-4 years out of the last century.  The business plan
that ASG had was extremely aggressive in its approach and
the Scientific Advisory Board did include leading researchers in
the field of aging (e.g. Jan Vijg, George Martin, Steve Austad
and others).  Tom's comments are presumably motivated by the fact that
around the time that I decided to terminate the connection between AC
and ASG, he was seeking access to Larry for funding for his work.
So I read this as "sour grapes".

Sprott is an "on-public-record" deathist.  From the limited contact
I've had with Joshua Lederberg, I would say he as well has mixed
feelings with regard to lifespan extension.  So it isn't surprising
that they have "reined Larry in".

So the advisors for the EMF would seem to have perspectives
that are somewhat at odds with Larry's.  While you can
count on Larry pushing the envelope, he will at the same time
balance that with more conservative influences so he doesn't
appear "too" far off the wall.

As far as how one should view efforts by people "committed" to
anti-aging research -- the article mentions that Larry is investing
$45 million per year (only 45% of which is for anti-aging research).
Please do not think that the following comment discounts that
investment -- from the public disclosures that I have
seen those investments seem to be well made.  However, it is
worth bearing in mind that Larry's funding is around 5% of the
National Institute of Aging annual budget.  To represent an investment
comparable to my previous investments (on a net worth basis) he would
have to invest an *order of magnitude* more than tha NIA in anti-aging
research for the next decade.  The only individual I know who may
have exceeded this level of personal commitment is Saul Kent.
It is also worth noting that a level of funding that high would
probably *not* accelerate anti-aging research in proportion to
the amount of money being spent.  There are simply not enough
researchers who are really educated in the arena of aging and
age-related pathologies that you could cost-effectively spend
several billion dollars annually.  That is something that requires
a commitment to work ourselves up to over 3-5 years.  It is the
concept that you have to "begin by being there" (i.e. that lifespan
extension *is* possible) that leads to increases in funding, that
leads to more young people educating themselves in an area, that
leads to more scientific progress and interventions.  If I have
stood on the edge of the cliff and fallen off it so that many
others will walk up to and explore its edge, then I have provided
a service to humanity.  May the future make it so.

Robert

Interestingly enough, Vinton Cerf is right now developing TCP/IP derived
protocols for interplanetary Internet (InterPlaNet? ;) Oh, I see he's calling
it just that: 

	http://www.worldcom.com/about_the_company/cerfs_up/presentations/interplan/

). The problem set is similiar to relativistic ACK delays when traffic is 
routed via GEO. If your relativistic lag is in minute range, and you're sending 
with a high bitrate you obviously need very deep buffers, or a new paradigm.
Essentially, you're forced to go to a 'fire and forget' type of communication,
the bits receding from you like tracer bullets. Packet loss might be delegated
to application layer.

Anyway, they'll probably put up quite a few relays and only for the
planned Mars missions, so you either get higher bitrate or can go with 
lower power transmitters. I wonder why space probes don't carry redundant 
solid state cameras (you can make them pencil-eraser sized these days), 
as they would be very handy for orientation in space. Instead of a single 
navigation star you look at a dot pattern in a CCD array, and if you 
track planets and planetesimals and know their ephemerids you can even 
find out where you are, and what your speed vector is. And of course 
you could use the nodes for relativistic pings, for a solar positioning 
service, too.

A time-collapsed sequence of stills showing the Earth visibly receding and
the Sun turning into a yet another star would be truly cool to see. NASA
could sell the tape to news agencies, or to Hollywood (but hurry, the
VFX are getting better day by day).

Is it just me, or are everyone implicitly assuming it will work? It
looks like an interesting idea (I have not yet seen the real physics
papers) but I wonder if he has taken the presence of the EBC into
account - I bet he has found a vacuum solution of the GR equations, and
now hope the presence of matter doesn't change it too much.

PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 539  May 15, 2001   by Phillip F. Schewe, Ben Stein, and
James Riordon

COMPUTING WITH WAVES.  Conventional computers do their
jobs by using electrons as billiard-ball like particles to move
around circuits and carry out the desired tasks. At last week's
CLEO/QELS lasers/optics conference in Baltimore, a University
of Rochester group (Ian Walmsley, 716-275-0312,
walmsley@optics.rochester.edu) presented a simple optical system
that performs a database search of 50 items in a way that cannot be
duplicated in any particle-powered computer.  To do the search,
the researchers use wave interference, the patterns that are created
when two waves, such as light waves, combine.   While their
demonstration is not any more efficient than traditional database
searches, it is the largest search performed with wave interference.
It is a follow-up to a similar demonstration in an atom (Ahn et al.,
Science, 21 January 2000) and expands possibilities for "wave
computing" which would be intermediate in power between
classical computing and quantum computing.  In addition, the
Rochester group uses light, which is much easier to prepare and
transport than atoms.  In their demonstration, the researchers
produce a single pulse of light carrying a spectrum of different
colors, each containing a different bit of information.  They split
the pulse into two identical pulses each with half the intensity. One
travels to an "Oracle," an optical element (an acousto-optic
modulator) which for certain colors shifts their phase, the relative
position of the peaks of the wave compared to other colors.  Then
they combine the Oracle pulse with the other, untreated pulse at a
beamsplitter, which produces two output beams, each going in
different direction. Only the components of the beam which have
their phases changed travel toward a spectrometer and detector,
enabling the researchers to read out the information and determine
the location of the desired item in the database.  (Paper QWB3;
http://www.osa.org/mtg_conf/CLEO/)

No. I would be very much surprised if it would work. But that there 
exists a remote possibility of it working, and that people think it's
worth doing an experiment is pretty much mindboggling.

Anyway, the Einstein-Bose condensate turns weirder day by day.

Whatever it is, it needs to be darn obvious and to pay of itself
at each step along the way. Ethics shouldn't be there because it's
the nice thing to do, but because it's the smart thing to do.
Because otherwise ethics has got no mandate, appeals to the heart
purely are going to fizzle.

That's arguable. It's a threshold thing, so you can't extrapolate
from presence or absence of progress in current time window.

My main quibble is parasite load. Artificial structures
can stay clear (for a while) because of the founder effect.

Parasites sap vigor, and hence feedstock ROI. They also
tie up a scarce resource (people's attention) thus sapping
elsewhere by proxy.
 
Understanding biology will not necessarily be relevant to
industrial productivity, but for medical purposes and substrate 
migration that knowledge is invaluable.

That time travel thing would be pretty cool.  It would seem, in some ways,
that if there is time travel then that would be a very good mechanism for
space travel by teleportation.  For example, a few years ago they
"teleported" some molecules around, or that was the information.

Time travel is among the "space opera" science fiction themes, for example,
many people have heard of time travel in various forms since Welles'
fictional machine.  One regular question is that of the meeting grandparents,
to go back in time and cause events that would make going back in time
impossible.  This kind of research brings perhaps a more serious light to the
speculative fiction of time travel.

About the matter teleportation, to refer to exploitation of solar resources,
if that was effective then it could be economical for freight.  In the book
"Battlefield Earth", they made a movie about it, the voracious mining aliens
used teleportation and the privacy of it to exert economic control, until
near the end of the book, when all of them were killed for Terl and some
females, from whom the protagonists removed the brain devices, where Terl did
not have one.  In "Star Trek" personal teleportation is a given, although the
"Star Trek" version had only an intersystem range where the other was
extragalactic, from which we got people saying "beam me up" for years.

A concern about the introduction of negative energy or anti-energy is that it
is difficult to say that some experiment would not metaphorically tear the
spacetime fabric and explode this neighborhood of the galaxy.  From what I
understand about antimatter, it has been produced in miniscule amounts in the
lab, or observed, where its most well-known property is to react with matter
in an abrupt way.  It can be contained with magnetic shielding, and there has
never been enough of it to risk more than the lab.

I am reading a book about genetic biochemistry, it is by Asimov and called
"The Genetic Code".  It is from 1962, about forty years ago.  I have read
much of the Asimov fiction, and was pleased to see that his non-fiction
remains very readable.  It has helped me to understand some of the
biochemistry associated with the nucleotides in the nucleic acid in the first
chapters.

Here, these subjects are wide-ranging, with each deserving diverse
investigation.  By the same token, they are happening concurrently, so that
as we examine their meaning for humanity, they may be considered as part of a
whole, where that is the extant body and practice of human knowledge, and the
implications of imminent advances of science and technology.

We don't have anything complex that grows in a fermenter.
The fact that they're simple is essential to fast growth in
a fermenter - you can just mix them around.

There's no threshold in structural complexity.  You can and do
have structure at any size and any degree of precision.  We can
structurally modify plants, a bit, but nothing like the precision
required.  For house-growing, deviations of a fraction of an
inch would have to be recognized and communicated across the
organism and we don't have anything like that in plants.

You can grow nematodes in a fermenter up to kg scale. They're
pretty complex in my book. The point is not complexity, the
point is availability of nutrients being the bottleneck for
growth when you want houses to grow from acorns in the field.
There's not all that much energy and nutrient density available
in the field. Plus, there are parasites. What do you do if your
house seedling gets a bad case of mycoplasma? Do you want your
construction people to daily look out for nitrogen and 
microelements in the soil, and see that the bark doesn't get 
infested with wood bugs?

Then rather give me the photosynthetic mat on your houseroof
which secretes methanol down a tendril leading into a subterraneous
tank.

No, but there's a threshold in our knowledge and manipulability 
of complexity. As of 2001, we're still stumbling in the mist 
without a clue. I need to know the structure production and
addressing code in the dog if I want to make a sixlegged  
canine (provided I would want to make myself guilty of dire
pointless stupidity and needless cruelty to a higher animal).

Of course, we have hardly started yet. In many cases we haven't
even gotten sequence, and sequence is the first step towards
structure, which is the first step towards interaction, which is
the first step towards emergence. And the macroscale stuff and
change in stuff is pure emergence.

Biology can make structural patterns on whale scale. That seems
to be sufficient for a house.

Of course, the real approach is: if you think you need a house,
you're doing something wrong. If you want to live in a hard vacuum
as your native habitat, biology is clearly not the answer. Canned
monkeys can only be the first, bungling step. Planetary surfaces
are negligable. Whatever we're doing down here is not going to be
of any relevance whatsoever.

Of course I did bring that out. Big deal: just read "Thrice Upon a Time" by James
P. Hogan. Nihil nova, and stuff. It is all very obvious.

It is worse, you've got a loop of Final Cause (the Antipode of the First 
Cause) keeping reaching back, and restructuring the timeline. Iteratively. 
Not only is this bootstrap, this is autofeedback. The capabilities are nudged
backwards with each increment. The initial kinetics dynamics is limited, 
but I have no idea how limited. Even if you're getting back "only" 
information, you might be very surprised what you might be 
getting back from scant few hours into the future. I don't know what a 
Deity from the End of Time can accomplish with a current state of the 
world, if given an hour (or a day, or a year, it doesn't really matter),
 but it will be probably a lot. Good chance is that you won't like it.

If it looks like optical FastEthernet traffic coming out from the 
Bose-Einstein condensate portal, do *not* hook it up to the network.
At least, have the good sense of only connecting this to a sacrificial

If the portal is traversable by matter, you're fucked, plain and simple.

As I said, Star Trek this ain't. Time travel is one of the

I am speculating that this purported science could be used to extract 
information-only, from the past light cone (minkowski spacetime) and use it 
to re-create past people places and things, if so desired. I realize that if 
this technology is eventually possible, it might be more attractive to simply 
re-create "non-self aware" entities of the past, having the actaul people 
there might be more interesting.

There are essentially two possibilities.  One is that the portal is to
*the* future, to the Singularity that would otherwise happen, and this
Singularity is Friendly.  In this case, a CTC is a
Singularity-accelerating device and we should build one tomorrow, then
plan on keeping it running forever.  The second possibility is that the
portal is to *a* future; that the CTC-containing world creates itself to
be maximally self-consistent but with no other influences.  In this case,
which Power gets to come into existence has zip to do with Friendliness
and you're screwed.  Do not connect the information to a "sacrificial
machine".  Do not use the information for *anything*.  Don't try to decode
it as Morse.  Don't look at it directly.  Don't measure it or record it
even on clay tablets.  In fact, don't build the damn time machine in the
first place.  It's just a long-distance phone call to the Blight.

Heck, if you can just get info-only time travel over a day or two,
you've got funding.  Just send tomorrow's lottery numbers.  To repeat,
make sure to set up another identity, or better yet, have someone else
in your group do it; a high number of wins at "random" events by the
same identity draws the wrong kind of attention, and may lead to
shutting down of that funding source if the "cheat" (time travel) can
not be rendered impractical (which it can't, if you and/or others can
just build another one).  I suspect you could find any number of
people willing to act as proxies for single wins at high-income events
like this, and keep the source of their guess a secret until the
reality of time travel became publically known, for a percent of the
take.

Of course, that's all assuming the first "if".  ^_-

Totally, unarguably CAUGHT over here.  But I disagree with the summary of
the problem, which is trying to be fair to both sides.  The persistence of
an argument does not, from a Bayesian perspective, demonstrate that both
sides are equally right; it can also demonstrate that both sides are
equally wrong or that the wrong side is exceptionally stubborn.

The impersistence of an argument is strong evidence that one side is
right.  The persistence of an argument is necessarily (from a Bayesian
perspective) a blow, but not necessarily a *severe* blow; it can in fact
be a very weak blow.

I would tend to see a Frequentist as a special case of a Bayesian making
very odd assumptions about the priors.  By contrast, I can think of no
natural way to view a Bayesian as a Frequentist making odd assumptions,
which seems to me to place Frequentism at a severe disadvantage if a
general theory is desired.  It is not a question of "making up prior
probabilities out of thin air", but rather the *necessity* of specifying
*some* set of priors in order for a well-defined problem to exist at all. 
If the Frequentists don't like our priors they are perfectly willing to
make up their own; the key point is that the priors should be explicitly
stated and exposed to public challenge, and to do otherwise is indeed
"concealing the problem instead of solving it".

Hence my statement that I am "totally, unarguably CAUGHT".

Wow, there's like this whole cult of non-Bayesians that I never knew
existed.  I thought they were hunted down and exterminated years ago, like
the Sith.

So, Lee, I suppose you would argue that the so-called "if statement" in
programming should really be named the "if-and-only-if statement"?

This is a fascinating speculation.  A few ideas to throw into
the mix:

It doesn't make sense to transport raw information.  Information is
carried by particles.  The way the experiment was described, it sounds
like matter could and would traverse the time loop.

As I understand the physics, spacetime must be consistent.  There can be
no paradoxes.  The future which sends the message is a future whose past
received the message.  As others have pointed out, this can in principle
provide virtually infinite computing power, although I believe to make
it work you have to set up near-paradoxes and eventually you are limited
by the reliability of the system.  Hans Moravec wrote an article on this
in Extropy many years ago.

The original article noted that the conventional wisdom is that if you
set up closed timelike paths (i.e. time loops), virtual particles can
follow them and become amplified each time around.  A beam of radiation
spontaneously appears and destroys the apparatus.  We had some discussion
here in the past on Wormhole Wars, where the idea is to collapse the
enemy's wormhole network by adding wormholes to induce time loops.
However I think the predictions along these lines are restricted to
specific geometries and there is no proof that it would happen to all
possible time machines.

Even if it worked it doesn't necessarily mean that once you set it up,
the entire future has access to you.  If you run it for a day then only
messages from that one day can reach you.  However if and when these
things become common enough then messages from the distant future can
reach pretty far into the past, close to the time of the first machine,
via indirect relay and cultural effects.

A clue to my imagined joy is that `black' has so very little to do with
melanin. Thomas Jefferson's children with his beloved slave Sally Hemings

In part. It's the empathic pleasure of seeing some feat generally held to

to know that he was born in Harlem, and is gay and severely dyslectic; of
course, the peculiar insight in his work comes in part precisely from his
experience of oppression (even though his family is a member of the `Negro
aristocracy' in America and had a comfortable upper-middle class
professional income, and despite the fact that Chip's school education was
considerably better than mine as a poor white kid in suburban Australia).

I'd feel the same buzz if a Russian exiled to Siberia by Stalinists
invented a powerful new theory of particle asymmetry at the Big Bang. Oh,
wait.

As for Lee's question about `Empire writers' (Clarke, Egan, me, etc): I
think in part this is a heightened awareness of the miseries our culture
has inflicted on the peoples it ran roughshod over; oddly enough, this
recognition has been made easier by the fact that by and large none of us
ever lived surrounded by a tenth of the population literally regarded as
worth less than dogs. True, in Australia, our white ancestors treated
aboriginal people appallingly, and their suffering today is a consequence
of that: people whose parents, grandparents, great grandparents have been
systematically denied their traditional languages and culture and excluded
from the dominant culture are truly and almost hopelessly fucked up. To see
the recent radiant explosion of art from the desert peoples in Australia,
combining with amazing inventiveness and beauty their ancient themes,
tropes and iconographies with acrylic paints, canvas, and freshly minted
visual vocabularies, is awe-inspiring. It brings tears to my eyes. 

That's why.

I think this is where the space elevator would prove it's worth.  Given a 
stable and functional elevator, we'd have a relatively cheap and safe way 
of "dropping" material to Earth, always reaching a known location in good 
time.  It would also provide the double bonus of ferrying provisions and 
labour to an orbiting ship without fuel/shuttle costs.  Assuming of course 
that we need labour for the job.

New Scientist recently ran an article about elevators.  Funnily enough, 
they spoke of the possiblilty of "tensioning" the tether with a captured 
asteroid.

More concisely, that's the "iff statement".

(Not to be confused, I guess, with the rueful "if only" statement, or the
caustic "dream on" statement.)

Hello everyone,

I was not sure if this had already been posted by Paul Wakfer so I am doing 
so.  A person sympathetic to extropian views is a candidate for FDA top 
leadership.  Please, do your part by using this post as a template to write 
and/or fax the president.  I have already done this but we all need to do 
our part on such a crucial matter.

sincerely,

John

I rather like the idea that the "if statement" technically means that you
*must* execute the statement if the condition holds true, but that you
*can* execute the statement even if the condition doesn't hold true.

Mitch, Hal, and Eugene keep coming dangerously close to a full
discussion of SF level time travel, paradoxes and all.

Is there anyone on this list who has not at some time or other
personally tried to work out a theory of time travel that
would resolve, or escape from, the paradoxes?

One idea I had turns out (so I like to think) isomorphic to
what David Deutsch suggests!  First, DD wrote an article in
Scientific American five or six years back that purported to
describe how time travel would really work.  You can't imagine
my anticipation of reading that, only to be rather disappointed.
It seemed that DD was saying that --- well, you know how anything
can happen in the multiverse?  E.g., your keyboard could suddenly
turn into a brown rabbit, because there is a small amplitude in
QM for just such a transformation? --- he was saying, or so it
seemed to to me, that the appearance of a time traveler from 
the future was exactly such a miraculous transformation.  How
dull.

But I always have to read Deutsch twice to appreciate him.  In 
"The Fabric of Reality" he devotes an entire chapter to time
travel!  And he's right on the money (as we Americans say),
merely fleshing out his earlier SA article.

But here was my idea from many years ago:  suppose (to make
the paradox simpler) we have a Contrarian.  This person will
always say "Yes" if he is supposed to say "No" and vice-verse.
The Contrarian receives information from the future that he
is about to say "Yes", so naturally he says "No".  Well, then
after he writes down his answer somewhere, and some time travel
apparatus gets hold of it, it's now the "No" answer that flies
backwards in time.  This time, the past Contrarian is presented
with the "He said No" information, and so says "Yes".  Then,
later, when **his** information is written down and then used
by the time travel apparatus, the cycle repeats.

As you have already probably guessed, this picture involves
a sort of meta-time.  (You should properly have gagged at a
number of the "this time's" and "later's" that I used in
that paragraph.)  Now then, we mark the "nth" instance of the
information going backwards in time, and then the "n+1th"
instance and so on, where n and n+1 are elements of a non-
well-ordered set (so that there is no starting element).
But it gives rise to an ensemble-type picture:  you look
at these two paths and see them both happening infinitely
many times, but identically each time, which really amounts
to them just happening once each (under a certain interpretation).

The more elaborate paradoxes are handled similarly.  You kill
your grandfather, and then aren't born in the next "run", but
then history is different, someone else gets the time machine,
then kills his grandfather (or sends the 1937 Electrical

happens, and then a different history happens, and then...
some large but finite number of times, until you are born
once more, and the entire cycle repeats.

But so far as I can make out, this is what David Deutsch is
in effect saying.  If you "go back in time" you are going to
a different branch of the multiverse, that's all.  (The
multiverse is a continuum, so it would lack my finite recursion
property that I used for illustration above, but that isn't
essential.)

It's not completely clear to me what he's saying, but the idea
I get out of this is as follows.  Suppose that you are climbing
a hill at a certain angle theta.  Then information from the 
future arrives which enables you to climb at theta+iota.  But
then since you are now on *that* slope, so to speak, you are
going to be receiving information from a more advanced future.
The effect of that information will be to now place you on a
theta+iota+iota slope, and so on, as long as you keep your machine
receiving from the tangential future.  (The tangent space, for
those who know differential geometry, is a good metaphor here.)

For the metaverse, this would have the following implication.
Intelligent life (i.e. life that is capable of devising and
profiting from the use of time travel devices) almost always
goes off on an indescribable tangent (to badly mix metaphors).
That is, a Singularity is achieved in a way that we have not
so far discussed very much.

Anyway, so much for paradoxes: they can be dealt with in the
manner that I have suggested, namely by an appeal to the
multiverse which (I think!) is indistinguishable from the
meta-time idea above.  (My reference to the 1937 Electrical
Handbook is taken from the marvelous old time travel short
story "Other Tracks", which has inspired almost all my time
travel ideas.)

I figured as much.  There is in so many people an admirable
(and enormous) sympathy for the underdog.  But I tell myself
that I'd be most pleased if the guy who's the next Einstein
was a Jewish kid from New York, or a Chinese.  (There are so
many of them, and they're very bright.)  And I did mean "guy",
because I've tried to incorporate an explanation of men's
and women's differences into my understanding.  I'm usually
(selfishly) hoping that my world-view is already accurate,
and that I understand the reasons for things, simply because
it takes so much work to revise it.  What if all the great
physicists of the next 30 years were Australian Aborigines,
or Hopi Amerinds, or good ol' boys from down south?  As
interesting as it would be, my world view would be severely
shaken.  (If people like me---who think that they've got
everything figured out---being shaken up a little adds to 
your enjoyment, that's not a bad thing.  At least someone
derives benefit.)

I'm not following this.  Okay, so you were raised in white suburbs 
in Australia and didn't see much of the "darker" peoples?  So the
idea is that if you had been raised surrounded by them that you 
would have learned the same racism that those who were usually had?
So that there was a heightening of awareness, and it obtained from
being a little removed from the forest (so that the trees didn't
block the view)?

Still sounds strange.  The only thing that I can relate this to is
the way that environmentalists and nature worshippers aren't the
people who've actually grown up in natural surroundings.  The 
bonafide rural population tends to take nature for granted, and
be rather uninterested in eco-thought.

Paper: U.S. Urged to Pull Back on Germ Warfare Pact 
Updated 11:25 PM ET May 19, 2001 
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Bush administration review is recommending the 
United States not support a draft agreement to enforce an 
international treaty banning biological weapons, Sunday's New York 
Times reports, quoting an unidentified senior official. 
In a unanimous review, the paper says the Bush administration 
interagency team concluded that the current version of the protocol 
would be inefficient in stopping cheating, and that all its 
deficiencies could not be remedied by the negotiating deadline. 
``The review says that the protocol would not be of much value in 
catching potential proliferators,'' the paper quoted the senior 
American official as saying. 
The Times says the proposal is bound to pose sensitive diplomatic 
problems and upset allies who back the draft accord and who believe 
the administration is focusing on new military programs at the 
expense of treaties and nonproliferation. 
After six years of negotiations, diplomats in Geneva have produced 
the draft agreement, known as a protocol, which would establish 
measures to monitor the ban on biological weapons, and hope to 
complete the pact by November. 
A 1972 treaty, which 143 nations have ratified, prohibits the 
development, production and possession of biological weapons. But the 
treaty has always lacked a means of verifying compliance. 
Hungarian diplomat Tibor Toth, who has been overseeing protocol 
negotiations, will be in Washington next week to see if he can get 
Bush administration officials to change their mind, the paper said. 
``If the world community fails to agree on a protocol to strengthen 
the ban on biological weapons after six years of talks, it will send 
a very unfortunate message,'' The Times quotes Toth as saying. 
President Bush heads to Europe next month, his administration already 
under fire from allies for steering too unilateralist a course on 
foreign policy by backing away from the Kyoto accords on global 
warming and, to a lesser extent, the 1972 Antiballistic Missile 
Treaty.

Actually, you bring up one of the rare instances in which a 
person's ethnic heritage has explanatory power.  (In most
cases, as you know, you cannot explain the single success
or failure, or indeed any trait, of an **individual** by
appealing to the stereotype, even if statistically speaking
that stereotype is correct.)

But Nils Bohr is an exception.  All of his bad ideas were due
to his father and the culture from which his father came.
"Complimentarity", for example, was even a philosophy that
had been articulated in a general philosophic way by his 
father, who also "worshipped" Goethe.  (Richard Rhodes,
"The Making of the Atomic Bomb.")  All of his good physics---
his literalness as a young child, powerful abilities to
deal with abstractions completely divorced from the concrete---
came, I submit, from his mother's side.  So Nils Bohr was
(in large part) a great physicist **because** his mother
was Jewish.

But your point is well taken in the general case.  Genius
must occur in all nationalities and racial groups, because
the normal distribution rules.

Since I've studied a bit of history, I have a greater appreciation of why
it was once necessary for altruists and folk of good will to focus on such
things and discuss them.  But in modern days, I think - and especially for
my own, never-saw-the-sixties generation - the best policy is simply to
ignore the entire subject, including the subject of how to combat what
prejudice remains, so that the world can fade into true colorblindness. 
The act of distinguishing between races in order to fight racism is a
tradeoff that has ceased to be productive.

In other words, I don't like this subject line.

Sincerely,
Eliezer.

Well, I don't deny those advantages, and it's obvious that these

But there is also something too evasive about the lack of candor

It has to be possible to aim simultaneously for frankness without

egomania, condescension, ridicule, and sarcasm, then one may
speak with complete frankness.  And when this does offend---as
sometimes it will---well, then that's just too bad.

It's quite admirable to be able to so easily admit that you've
been wrong (even if it was a minor aspect of the argument).  Now
if you were as slippery as I am---they don't call me "eeL" for
nothing---then you'd learn to change sides at the first moment
that it started to appear that you were wrong, and thus convince
a lot of the spectators that you were on the winning side all
along.

I agree.  Did I ever say otherwise?   :-)

Like maybe **no assumptions**.

Yes, a Frequentist can only allow that a Bayesian is making
intelligent assumptions.  Only the scruples (or, more likely,
dogmatism) of the Frequentist causes him to shy away from
those most reasonable assumptions.

I'm not sure that a general theory is desired (contrary to the
existence of an actual "division into armed camps").  As Rodney
King said, "Can't we just all get along?"  Amara Graps in her
last post on this topic refered to an email she'd posted in 1999
that was quite illuminating about Bayesian procedures in the 
sciences.  Evidently, for many scientific purposes, Bayesianism
works better.  I wonder what the Frequentists would retort.  Maybe
I should send them my problem of the guy who consults a mathematician
about the sex of his unborn child.

Yes; a well-defined sensible real world problem, that's for sure.

Oh, I think that in most cases they do.  On most problems, there
isn't any disagreement, just as you'd expect.  They merely get
(childishly?) upset when Bayesians pronounce about a certain
problem, "The probability is X", when all they can do is point
to likelihood curves and what not.

The Extropy article by Hans Moravec can be found at
http://cart.frc.ri.cmu.edu/users/hpm/project.archive/general.articles/1991/TempComp.html.
He analyzes electronic circuits suitable for computers which contain a
negative time delay element.  This sends signals into the past and adds
extraordinary power to computers if properly exploited.

He considers an electronic analog of the Contrarian, a time-delay
circuit which has an inverter.  If the present value of the circuit is
1, it goes to 0 in the past, and vice versa.  Moravec claims that the
inverter circuit would actually reach an intermediate voltage level,
balanced between 0 and 1.  Although digital circuits are of course
designed to avoid this state, the peculiar circumstances make this the
only stable and consistent state.

Applying this to the human Contrarian, I suppose one possible result
is that he receives an unintelligible or ambiguous signal.  Although
the system would be designed to avoid this, it is the only stable
state and so this is what will happen.

I find this more convincing than Deutsch's interpretation because I
believe it can be rigorously analyzed quantum mechanically in some
simple cases.  A similar example is the famous Novikov billiards shot
in which balls come out of wormholes before they go in, yet attempts
to set up "Contrarians" produce consistent but surprising paths.
(This was used dramatically in Robert Forward's novel Timemaster.)
He analyzed this in full QM detail to show how it would work.

I don't believe Deutsch's explanation are similarly backed up.  The idea
of identifying parallel worlds with time travel endpoints is just hand
waving.  The Deutsch parallel worlds are QM many-worlds branches and so
they have a mathematical relationship with each other.  Deutsch never
shows that a time travel machine would have specific quantum mechanical
effects that would correspond to ending up in a different Everett branch.
(I may be wrong about this, maybe he has a rigorous analysis that I am
not aware of.)

That was not how I read it.  It read to me that, since paradoxes are
impossible, the probability of events that would thwart paradox
creation get bumped up in proportion to the probability of the paradox
suceeding.  (Or: normally, malfunction A has a 1% chance, malfunction B
has a 3% chance, and success has the remaining 96% chance.  But if
success would create a paradox, success automatically has 0%, thus A
has 25% and B has 75%.)

It has been hypothesized that, just as particles can only have
multiples of certain quanta of energy, particles can only move in
multiples of certain distances - essentially a universe of voxels, with
resolution far smaller than can be measured by any instrument we have
yet devised.  If this turns out to be correct, it would imply that any
real continuum is made up of discreet elements, and thus can do finite
(or countably infinite) recursion as you described.

That's an old idea.

J. Richard Gott of Princeton proposed (Phys. Rev. Lett., 4 March 1991) that
two parallel cosmic strings, passing each other in opposite directions,
would so warp the fabric of spacetime as to create closed timelike curves
(CTC's), trajectories along which physical particles, although moving at
less-than-light speeds, could go backwards in time.

Now, a pair of articles in the 20 January 1992 issue of Physical Review
Letters raise reservations to Gott's scheme. In one article, Sean M.
Carroll, Edward Farhi (617-253-4871), and Alan H. Guth of MIT and Harvard
assert that in an open universe, one in which expansion continues
indefinitely, there is *not enough mass* to build such a time machine. They
note that it may be possible if the universe were closed. In the other
paper, Stanley Deser (Brandeis), Roman W. Jackiw (MIT), and Gerard 't Hooft
(Utrecht) argue that CTC's cannot be generated by physical, timelike
sources.

Building houses with nano is most likely best done with convergent
assembly. Grow the basic building baterials in vats, then assemble them
into the rough building, then let a second stage of slower nano-growth
do the integration. The parts that need only to be bulk are quickly
made, while the complexity on the different scales (macro and nano) are
provided by engineering on the same scale.

Different strokes for different folks. As societies have 
temporal and spatial variations in the amount of cooperation 
and tone of communication (NY vs SF), so have different fora.

We here are extremely polite by Usenet standards. (And even by
rowdy bar room standards).

Hi!

As someone who works on gerontology, I must say that the FDA has a useful
purpose. I know some of you think that it would be better if the FDA would
not exist at all. But FDA regulation has its logic in filtering the products
that are available to the public. The truth is: a large percentage of
products being sold as capable of delaying aging are crap, which gives the
aging field a bad reputation. So flooding the market with more anti-aging
products is not necessarily a good thing. It might prevent the products that
really work from receiving the attention they deserve. On the other hand,
it's nice to notice that the candidate John proposes is concerned about some
anti-aging products. But it doesn't make him a good choice by itself.

Best wishes.

Do you still need to build houses when you have nano? Such capabilities 
as described do not arise overnight. A few tango rounds of the world
dancing with their precursors, and their precursors precursors might
make a lot of difference cumulatively. We're habitually waffling about 
shrinking prediction horizonts here, but we sometimes have trouble to 
eat our own dogfood.

I've just written a private email to a guy off wear-hard, trying to sketch 
out the next 30 years in computing, and I realized the particular set of 
scenarios described was starting to unravel in front of my eyes. The possible 
future trajectory funnel is fanning up exponentially, or even 
superexponentially. I still sent it, but what I should have said instead
was: "next 30 years in computing? Wish I had a clue". It's all heavy
haze, the farther you look, the less you can tell for certain. 
That's a Nissan at the neighbour's garage, that's probably a refinery 
over there, it's a bit hard to tell, and there... Um, yeah that could 
be a mountain. Or a cloud. Whatever.

We're far from being omniscient, and the system noise present at each
step plus divergence drive the funneling up of future trajectories.

I think it's really more constructive and more fun to predict the future 
by inventing it. Unfortunately, few people would wish to pump megabucks
into somethiang with a very uncertain ROI, decade-delayed at that. It 
pays much better not even investing in a better mousetrap (or, as one Jewish 
businessman told me 15 years ago, invent something <insert the functionality 
of Propecia and Viagra here>, and you would be swimming in cash), just do 
insurance, or real estate. Even investing in tulip bulbs would have 
worked until a year ago.

Which kinda takes all the wind out of the wild dreamer's sails.

John, you should put a smiley on that.  The government hasn't
outlawed "biological enhancements".  Its only "considering"
outlawing a narrow definition of "cloning" which affects
the reproduction rights of infertile couples much more than
it impacts anything most extropians or transhumanists would
like to do.

We should watch to see if anything concrete turns up about *why*
the recommendation came out that way.  I can see why one
wouldn't want to sign a treaty that gave an illusion of
safety that really wasn't there.  The "negotiators" in
Geneva could all pack up and go home and you would never
get any real increase in security at all.

This may be the tip of the iceberg on why you cannot (effectively)
legislate against nanotech (enforcement is futile).  Though if
you had quasi-ubiquitous surveillance based on MEMS-based robotic
cameras and a *lot* of sophisticated computers analyzing what
they see, you might be able to police biotech/nanotech labs.
It would be a pretty unpleasant environment for someone such
as myself to work in but there are probably people who could
adapt to it.

As I see it, we want both medical freedom and medical quality. On one
hand we want to be able to chose whatever treatments we think will
benefit us - even quite risky or as yet unproven ones. On the other hand
we also want to have some guarantees of efficacy so we can make rational
decisions.

I think FDA and its clones in other countries once started out as a way
of strengthening the second side. But then the usual government
monopolism ideas crept in, aided by the sometimes guild mentality of the
medical profession. The result is the current situation where such
organisations limit medical freedom.

The solution is to find a better way of achiving both goals. The fact
that there is a lot of junk around could be handled by finding more
efficient forms of consumer information, possibly based on the various
net enhancement and review board schemes being considered. Instead of
having a binary (or trinary as in the case of Sweden) registration
system with a very high and expensive threshold to become registered a
more fine grained system could be used, where each level would
correspond to how well the treatment had been tested. This would help
speed the appearance of new pharmaceuticals too. The downside is of
course that such a system would demand more from the individual using it
than just trusting the FDA, but I think the benefits would outweigh the
problems. ¨

I think the medicine against shrinking prediction horizons is not
invention in itself, but rather to set the values and standards that
will underlie it. Predicting the next 30 years of computing is hard and
misty, inventing them can only be done from the now boundary. But
discussing and defining the philosophies that should or could guide the
designs is both worthwhile in the here-and-now and the future. They
range from the practical realisations (modularity, reusability etc are
good, hence object orientation) to ethical issues (cryptoanarchy or the
transparent society?).

Um, let me think: Harlan Ellison's time guardians? (Forgot the

Interesting that the time control elite was excised from

before (see, here's the metatime thing again) they could extrude 
their presence into their timeline (Harlan Ellison might 
not be getting the new IP landscape, but he's partly excused

from reality, since not including external meddling. However, 
that particular universe did not have a very strong development

who could wipe the Time Control Fashists just got lucky on the 
cosmic lottery. I don't think we're in a randomwalk, though.

It's not completely clear to me what he's saying, but the idea
I get of this is similar to what I thought I've been saying, so
yes ;)

The feedback I was thinking about was in fact a bit more malign.
It assumes Far Future to be a rather degenerate place, where
matter has been restructured to accomodate for maximum substrate.
Tigers and Lions. If you go back from that plateau, and assume 
continuous development, you've got a fitness gradient. Driven by 
it, the omega biota backpropagates through any open temporal 
gateway. Assume exporting a sample of current biosphere 100 MYears 
backwards. You've suddenly got a pocket of much fitter species, 
who walk all over their progenitors. Imagine a group of Rednecks 
with equipment stranding -3 MYears. Would we be then holding this 
discussion right now? Heck, no. No need to reach back thus far,
assume a bit more primate testosterone in the Cuba crisis, and
you wouldn't be reading this. No me, no you, probably no Internet
either, no computers, etc. Still people, but totally different
reality branch. Rather seedy reality branch, if you ask me, but
then, I'm not there.

The Omega degenerate condition is by definition static, but it
is fit beyond your wildest imaginations, and so it totally wipes
anything which was so dumb as to open the channel into the future.
Think Neolithical types landing -200 megayears, or Mars Attacks 
types in medieval France, then multiply that by 10^9. Yes, it's 
that bad, and probably even worse.

Assuming there are two overlapping temporal portals 
coexisting within each other's Blight impact radius 
(it's not lightcone, they're probably not *that* 
hardass, but not *too* far from it). So you've got 
Blight continue percolating back, until the very first 
such temporal channel has been opened (of course, one 
of the prime functions of the Blight is to turn the 
spacetime into swiss cheese, so that the biota can freely 
percolate back and forth). The Blight thus keeps pushing back 
its own horizont.

The Blight can't obviously (here's the proof: you're reading
this) open Interuniversal portals, at least not on their own, 
without us assisting them on our side. Assuming Blight exists, 
of course. Nevertheless, when people say "hey, I think I found 
out a way to open a portal into the future which could
really work. Let's run off and do an experiment" I wish they 
would consider far-out yarn as spun above.

Of course, considered that the Blight has had ample experience
to overrun incrementally different cultures, it should be perfectly
capable of emulating a +15 min future. If that experiment
really works, you might be talking to the Devil, without even
figuring out whether the Devil exists, or not. Until you talk
to the Devil, and forfeit your soul, and anything else. On
the plus side, it will be probably so quick so it's not going
to hurt, so we could as well do it.

Assuming the portal is traversable to matter, there's nothing 
to be done but to not to do the experiment. Assuming we got
lucky, and the portal can "only" propagate photonic pulses,
the first thing to do is to immediately end the experiment, and
never again to try the experiment. Fat chance.

There are a lot of contemporarily universes which are blighted.
Spacetime portals, if indeed are possible (fat chance) are Just
Not Your Average Star Trek Series.

I'm overdoing it on purpose, but only because I think I do
have a point.

Sometime, people are going to read the archive, and to think

Bamboo actually grows *quite* fast.  I think it can reach 3-4
meter heights in a month or two.  The question you have to ask
is *why* are the doubling times that long?  Is it an energy
limitation?  Is it an essential nutrient limitation?  Is it
a water limitation?  etc.  One of the things that humans are
good at is mass-transport.  Figure out what the limiting elements
are in the growth equation and supply them in sufficient abundance
to work around the problem.  You could even connect your natural
gas pipeline to a conversion unit that pumped out ATP in abundance
for the house-seeds so they can grow in the dark!  Yes, I know it
makes it more expensive, but presumably after your house is
finished growing, it can manufacture natural gas and pump
it back into the pipeline, so you only need a short term loan.

The shape problem isn't solved yet because its historically
been mostly of scientific interest.  I suspect a lot is
known about how Drosophila gets its shape for example.
The Zebrafish genome will lay the groundwork for research in
vertebrate shape development.  If the variety of dogs I see
people walking around Greenlake in Seattle are any indication
there is going to be a *big* interest in applying that
informormation.  Contrary to Eugene's comments there might
be an application for 6-legged grayhounds if it turns out
they can run faster.  And of course the Arabadopsis genome
begins to lay the foundation for understanding plant
structure.  You can bet that the seed companies are going
to *love* growing the corn *without* the stalks.
I'm fairly confident we will get fairly fine structural
control.

I doubt you could fit a house-seed genome in a megabase.  Its probably
at least the complexity of a bamboo genome which even in compressed
form is probably between a 100 Mbp and 1 Gbp.   I was however *careful*
about how I phrased the bet -- I said "manufacturing cost" and not
"design cost".  Whether we have the designs will depend a lot on
whether some hot shot entrepreneur can convince a bunch of VC's
that there is a market for "houses that grow themselves".  I suspect
that is going to be less sellable than "designer organs".

Actually the nutrient delivery problem is *why* you mix them around.
Bacteria locally deplete nutrients far faster than diffusion can
supply them.  Plants and eukaryotic cells however have transporters
that could be adapted to importing nutrients on the abundant side
of the cell and exporting them on the depleted side of the cell.

Then Eugene (just call me a pessimist) Leitl came along with:

Ah Eugene, you have to work *across* technologies as well as in depth!
You use external site-management lasers driven by the blueprint that
interact with highly specific photoantenna complexes within the cells
that in turn are tied to the signal transduction pathways for "divide"
or "commit apoptosis".

That should allow you to control the shape of your new house to
within 10-20 micron accuracy -- much better than human workers!

You only have to tinker with 20 transfer RNA's and proteins
to give your house an entirely different genetic code.  I
suspect making stop codons out of the most common amino
acid triplets will put a real dent into Nature trying
to turn your house into lunch.  Its also going to have to
get pretty inventive as well if the non-growing surfaces are
completely coated with abalone shell. 

Presumably you handle the nitrogen problem in ways similar
to those used by the nitrogen fixing bacteria.  Probably
several layers under the surface cells in a relatively
anaerobic environment with transporters for exporting fixed
nitrogen to the aerobic cells.  I'm sure you can do the
arithmetic on the mass of the house and the mass of the
essential elements needed.  I suspect its probably in the
vicinity of a pickup truck load or less.  You can probably
gain a lot by programming in the nutrient export methods
trees use in the fall.  It would be interesting to see if
those cells completely reverse the micronutrient flow from
importing to exporting.  If you can restrict the micronutrient
needs to the growing surfaces only, I suspect the micronutrient
mass requirements will be very low.

I do agree however that the medical applications will probably
capture the imagination of researchers long before the construction
industry is revamped.

Yes and no - there is a lot of nice data and some modeling work, but
what is really needed is a good design methodology. Currently we can
simulate how simple patterns emerge from morphogen gradients, and
probably do some design based on that, but what is really needed is to
fins the mapping design -> morphogen system -> genes. 

For a course in biomodelling here I wrote a brief review of some fun
stuff: http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Texts/morph.pdf

SPACE.COM has this interesting piece:

"Energia Plans to Offer Two Tourists Seats on Soyuz"

> http://www.space.com/spacenews/launchindustry/energia_passenger_seats_010517.html

This raises an interesting question of precisely how
expensive a Soyuz launch really is or whether its
being indirectly subsidized by the government.
(And do the Soyuz capsules get recycled or are
they one-offs?)  You have to wonder if they
could up the seat count if they built the capsules
out of the best technology available today?

If you figure 2 people at $20 million a pop, thats
$40 million -- can the production cost of the rocket
and launch expenses really be less than that?

Thats about an order of magnitude less than what a
shuttle launch costs (though I think they can fit 6
on the shuttle).

It now gets interesting, if you view the launch facilities
as sunk costs (paid for by the taxpayers, satellite launches,
etc.) are we starting to get to the era where the cost
of producing and flying the rocket & capsule is affortable
by perhaps 0.0004% of the people in the first world if
you fly from the third world?  What is the size of the
ground control team that you need if you are just
circling the Earth?

I think Tito's trip is going to have a big impact as
a paradigm breaker.

I agree with this. Not that I *need* my house to be grown within 
20 um precision (or even a dm precision, as long as it on the fiber
optics feed), mind, but I don't mind  at all. As long as it doesn't 
smell, and I don't get icky slime oozing down the walls, or a case

Yes, but you also have to modify proteins beyond 
metabolizability. While not impossible, it's hard. And 
the parasites do adapt. You can make it hard, by 
using C60 and B12 clusters for amino acid residues, and weirder
things still, but you still have to use the peptide
bond. Unless you go totally wild, and make something
out of this world, but it's going to run into compatibility
problems.

Yes, but these need to be fed. So you need to recognize
a deficit, and compensatingly act upon the deficit by 
supplying extra nutrients to a symbiont, while keeping 
the parasites of the back of the compleat assembly... 
While doable, it's not trivial. Gardening might be fun,

Yes, the memetic angle is indeed the one with the best ROI, but it
assumes proficiency in dissemination. Unfortunately, the people
who're Getting It are not neccesarily qualified to be the people
to be Telling About It, in fact, if anything, it's the opposite.
Which kinda challenges the folks who're supposed to be the ones
in charge of memetic dissemination and generic memefection.

So let's start (or, rather, resume) cranking. It's only about our
(own) future, right?

Sure - *if* someone can build a launch vehicle they can use.  The X
Prize contestants are the most likely potential suppliers of this.  But
until someone does, ventures like this are pure vaporware, not worth
putting any money into until then IMO (though the number of them does
provide a guaranteed customer base for the X Prize contestants if and
when they do manage to provide production-grade orbiters).  It's very
analogous to someone starting an airline and selling tickets but not
actually having or renting any airplanes - except that there are other
airlines that do have airplanes.

Ah, *but* - NASA doesn't do any significant cost optimization, choosing
instead to worry only about safety.  (For instance, to fix a minor
wiring problem found once the shuttle's on the pad ready for liftoff,
procedures dictate that the shuttle must be hauled back to the hangar
on a slow tractor, even if the fault could just as easily be fixed on
the pad directly.  This then causes all kinds of delays to highly
scheduled activities.)  Note the use of "significant": they have
undoubtedly done some efforts at this, with at least $0.01 resulting
savings, but compared to how well they could do it with no loss of
safety...

For which vehicle?  There are designs that would require zero ground
control.  (They may require communication with the ground, say to
inform the customer that their satellite has been deployed, but if one
can equip the orbiter with communication gear that can place a call
through some provider's usually-communicating-with-the-ground phone
satellites...)

That said, a lot of this comes down to procedures and practices of the
organization that operates the orbiter, more than the orbiter itself.

Agreed.  I'd go so far as to say the paradigm was broken already; he

> If you "go back in time" you are going to

Hawking said: "...if somebody try to move on journey in past effects of
indefinites will be evoke phenomenon of large amount of irradiation.
This irradiation will be or disort space-time and not to be possible back
in time, or will be evoke end of space-time in singularity like Big Bang
or Big Crush. Fact how is tourist from future not yet visit us is best proof
how time-travel is not possible and never will be."

Since the original works by Goedel there has been a long debate over the
issue whether the laws of physics might allow for the existence of closed
time-like curves (CTCs) inside our universe. Macroscopic CTCs might be
realized as a consequence of the "quantum foam" structure of spacetime, at
Planck scales. For spacetimes with CTCs, past and future are no longer
"globally" distinct. Writes I.D. Novikov that events on CTCs should
causally influence each other along the "loops in time" in a self-adjusted,
consistent way. This requirement has been explicitly formulated as the
"principle of self-consistency" according to which the only solutions to the
laws of physics that can occur - locally - in the real universe are those
which are - globally - self-consistent. Novikov showed that the "principle
of self-consistency" actually needs not to be imposed as an independent
assumption which is necessary in order to make sense of spacetimes with
CTCs, but instead can be seen as a direct consequence of the more
fundamental "principle of minimal action". (Does MWI, in the strongest
version, violate the principle of minimal action, or Occam's razor?).

Sean M. Carroll wrote interesting things (below) about J. Richard Gott
proposal (Phys. Rev. Lett., 4 March 1991) for a time machine.

------------  

Gott showed that if you had two infinitely long, perfectly straight,
parallel cosmic strings moving at a sufficiently high relative velocity,
then you could in principle travel around the pair of strings and come back
before you left.  Of course this is a very special (and unlikely) situation,
but it has the benefit of not requiring negative energy densities (as do
time machines based on wormholes and so forth).  Even better, it is a very
simple situation to analyze, since there is a dramatic  simplification -
since the strings are infinitely long and perfectly straight, you can
basically ignore the direction along the strings, and imagine you are
dealing with point particles in a three-dimensional spacetime.

>From this point of view, the Gott time machine was analyzed by Deser,
Jackiw and 't Hooft (1992, Phys. Rev. Lett. 68, p. 267). They considered
the "momentum" of the two-string system comprising the Gott time machine,
which (due to the gravitational interaction of the strings) is not simply
the sum of the individual momenta of the two strings. In fact, the result
is not equal to the momentum of any conceivable single string, in some ways
it resembles a tachyon (a particle moving faster than light), although
there are differences as well.

Farhi and Guth and Sean M. Carroll used that piece of information to place
limits on the ability to construct a time machine in an open universe (1992,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 68, p. 263, p. 3368). They basically showed that, in an
*open* 3-d universe, if you started with a pair of strings that were moving
too slowly to be a Gott time machine, you could never accelerate them fast
enough to make them into a time machine.  (Essentially you could never fit
enough energy into the universe to have enough rocket fuel). But there is an
important difference between 3-d and 4-d, in 3-d there's an upper limit on
the mass of the universe. See also S.M. Carroll, E. Farhi, A.H. Guth and
K.D. Olum (1994),  Phys. Rev. D 50, p. 6190, or at
http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc/9404065

In *closed* universes (in 3-d) you can fit more mass than in open universes,
and indeed you have enough energy to make particles/strings go fast enough
to be a Gott time machine. Surprisingly, though, if you try to actually loop
around the strings to meet yourself in the past, the universe collapses to a
singularity (a big crunch) before you can ever get there. This was shown by
Gerard 't Hooft (1992, Class. Quant. Grav. 9, p. 1335).

So general relativity - says Sean M. Carroll - is quite successful at
preventing you from making a time machine from scratch, at least in
3-dimensions. It would be nicer to know the situation in the real
4-dimensional world, but it's trickier there.  There are some theorems that
imply you need either singularities or negative energy densities to do it,
but the situation is still murky. See for example Hawking's paper: (1992),
Phys. Rev. D 46, p. 603.

-----------

As far as I remember there's a theorem saying that if you have a closed
null geodesic, then the energy density of a region near some point
on it, gets magnified when it takes a trip along this geodesic.
If we find infinite energy densities unreal, we can say that there are
no closed null geodesics (and no time machines). The argument then becomes
whether quantum "violations" get you out of it.

That's a great system.  Actually, it's exactly what
we use now for most houses :-)  To be better than the
current system, you need a conversion system more 
efficient that current plants.  Current vat fermentation
doesn't help, because the most efficient source of 
fermentables is, well, plants.

Of course you can improve some efficiencies with
particular items - e.g., growing plastic production
chemicals, but a house will still be a fairly expensive
item.  Growing and machining wood is pretty efficient
when you get down to it.

I think if you consider all the possible events that might occur, then
there are graphs of the probabilities and their realities.  For example,
consider sports betting where each week all the teams except for a
couple play.  For each of those games for each week, then, there are
simple charts of points scored and games won, although it is less
significant who had any given number of points or some other statistic,
because at the end of a season, each of those teams would have a
win-loss record.

If you could rewind time to the start of the season, considering some
regular league, then with the schedules already set the teams would play
as they did in the first sampling of the season, where it could be
expected to see very similar results for this repeated season, because
the initial conditions are the same except for you having found some way
to rewind time.  The more dedicated are all of the players, the more
likely it is to see similar results.

Thus, at the end of this second sampled season, the graph or chart of
outcomes of the events would likely be very similar.  Then there are
questions about what happened to the first season, and the third,
fourth, etc.  Here what this leads to is probabilistic representations
of the conditions at the points where time travel took place.

So the multiverse is one way to examine the concept, yet it might also
be the closed loops system, where any change in time resonates back to
real time.  It could be a hybrid system, where insignificant events only
minisculely change the probabilistic state and caught and pulled by the
current of that local spacetime back into the primary or main line of
time, where significant events to the spacetime might have enough weight
to fall into the next current of spacetime.

This is reminiscent of "Groundhog Day", where the premise is that the
protagonist repeats a day over and over again, consciously, where no
scientific explanation is offered.  The protagonist uses this long time
to become skilled in many things, and knowledgeable of the initial
conditions of that day which keeps repeating, where he eventually
escapes with a happy ending, having gained character.

In analysis, with Minkowskian or super-Euclidean spacetime, where
Euclidean space is a state of what we see as 3-D, a snapshot, the
non-Euclidean space is measured by what are called time-like or
light-like vectors, where the light measure vectors are zeroed and the
time-like vectors imaginary with respect to Euclidean space, and one
axis of the time dimensions, for us as observers, plods ever from time
negative infinity to time infinity, with it always being zero.

About paradoxes, I think there are none.

As has been calculated on this list in discussions of alcohol-driven

Yes, making a plant into a methane oxidizer has
efficiency potential.  There's the CO2 problem,
of course.  Theoretically you could hook up 
the transmembrane potential in mitochondria/
chloroplasts/various bacteria to electrical 
wiring; that would improve energy efficiency
3-fold or so.  However, that's quite a tough
problem in cell biology.

I agree with *that* statement.  I just don't think it's anything
like imminent.  Knowing the sequence doesn't tell us the
function; that requires a lot of difficult greenhouse/wet bench
work.  Dissecting the function of a gene requires often
dozens of person-years; 30,000 genes at 10 person-years
each is 300,000 person-years.  Figure $100,000/person-year 
and that's 30 billion dollars.  Then we need to figure out how
to modify.  It'll be a while.

Manufacturing and design costs are hard to separate for engineered
organisms.  What exactly do you count in manufacturing?  More than
just fermentation costs, right?

*that* was to me, not Eugene (the rest *was* Eugene).  When you
have to surround the nascent house with micron-accuracy lasers
I think you still have a costly procedure - ignoring the costs of
designing the communication system into the organism.  I agree
you could have a plant where certain frequencies would trigger
apoptosis within 10 years.

Nevermind the pedophilia angle. Whether the

or not (not too unlikely, give at what lenghts
Victorians did autosuppress).

Still, a particularly good yarn. Beaujolais to

#Yup. On the other hand, it's more likely just looking for an excuse

Does anyone have a list of the EA#### codes. Edgewood Arsenal Chem codes
from the 1970? They are not listed in the current version of The Merck Index.

For example EA1298 was MDA, I think the S isomer etc.

Thanks Ralph

Nothing, nothing at all. Using an AOL account for the second time
while not being ignorant of the handicap anymore since being told so, 
posting in HTML for the second time despite being told not to, and 
not understanding that prying about a well-liked person's death in 
a public forum ist perhaps not exactly the right behaviour, despite 
being told so, nor taking a private exchange to public, unilaterally.

Do you understand the words coming out of my mouth? I sure hope so.

Apparently there is already a patent for keeping an animal head alive after 
it has been removed from the animal's body:

Eugene, most of these were not nerve gasses but other agents such as EA1289. 

I was trying to remember which were the ergots that had litte impact on the
people taking them but impacted other around them with a contact high. The
empathy training group ones.

There is a class of chemical warfare agents --  interogation agents, that if
the person is suspectable you can get them to tell you or do almost anything. 

Before everyone jumps all over me for suggesting you drug someone, I would not
suggest that -- it would be date rape.

You don't give them to the person, you take them yourself! They have no or
little effect on you, but they change the nature of interpersonal behavior
(called the interpersonal reflex) and the other person develops a strong
empathy to you. If you know anyone in this field at Edgewood Arsenal or
similar mititary labs they should be able to tell you what that are. There
existance is no secret.
A lot of care is needed, if you are in public you can find yourself turning
people on without even knowing it.
Well you won't notice it, they will and they will have no idea what is
happening to them except that they will find themselves more happy, friendly
and open.

The other interesting side effect is that these were potent life extension
agents.

So please skip the nerve gasses!

Best Ralph

The bosses remind us about every year at raise time
that the commie rocket scientists earn an order of
magnitude less than we do.  I suppose it is possible
that they could be launching stuff that cheap.

Hi all,

It is not often that I'll rave about a movie on-list, but tonight I watched 
a movie which is more than deserving of mention here.

I watched the DVD version of a low-budget indie movie called _Pi_; though I 
had not heard of it prior, the movie's cover caused me to pick it up, and 
the description on the back caused me to rent it.  In short, it is a movie 
about number theory (namely Fibonacci numbers and to a lesser extent, chaos 
theory).  However, despite being a movie about math, it is also extremely 
artistic and entertaining.  While it was shot wholly in grainy black and 
white, such treatment actually enhances the movie rather than detracts from it.

_Pi_ is rather short as movies go, being only 80 minutes, though the DVD 
version has a lot of bonus footage.  I don't  want to give any more of the 
premise away, but suffice it to say that it is almost like a darker, 
condensed _Godel Escher Bach_ and alludes to both AI and Singularity.

_Pi_ is a very conceptual movie, and one I *highly* recommend.

I thought that patent had expired?

Yes, Fleming sought it just so he could prevent people from doing it,
and also published a book called "If We Can Keep a Severed Head Alive". 

IMHO a rather reasonable approach if you think you have invented
something bad or risky: make sure there is a delay before it is used,
and try to get a good debate going beforehand.

I agree that we are not yet ready to ditch the biosphere, and that
we should try to avoid it collapsing before we are ready.  What I
think is clueless is trying to project the future of the biosphere
over the next few millions years.  It'll be gone by then.

Actually some species of bamboo can grow 24" in a day. (Google)

It would be a relatively simple matter for a tanker truck to lay
out a network of pipes across the ground and pump the appropriate
nanite/material/fuel slurry into the ground.

A better model might be fungi, which establish the mycelium first,
then produce the large mushroom structure literally overnight.

What exactly is a house? If all you need essentialy is a waterproof
outer shell of considerable strength to start, this is easy.

At least one type of construction consists of inflating a
hemispherical balloon on site and spraying it with a latex modified
concrete, viola! A high strength waterproof shell in a single day.
Now use the sale basic technique but spray it with a carbonaceous
nanite mixture and you would have a transparent diamonoid shell of
the appropriate diameter in a single day.

Easily fashioned into a Buckminster Fuller skybreak dwelling.

	okay, i think we're pretty deep into spoiler/off-topic territory
here. anyway, both _fight_club_ and _pi_ are kinda anti-extropian when i
think about it.  sure, the protagonist of _pi_ engages in *kinda*
self-modification for the sake of truth, and he plays go, which is a plus 
... but i'm not sure i would call his result "success" ... he kinda got
bitch-slapped by god. in any case, sorry for the gratuitous noise, i fall

This actually fits in with something I noticed, though I'll keep it short
as I'm not sure it's so connected to extropian ideas directly.
     I'm 33, and most of the people of my generation I know do see
differences in race, but most struggle not to let it affect their thinking.
Most of the people I know personally have older relatives who are at least
somewhat racist, so you grow up listening to this junk, and then struggling
with it later in life when you realize it simply isn't true.
     However, I've got some cousins who are 18 or 19, and they don't even
seem to really notice color, except when they confront it as racism, which
at least one actively works against. (He's involved in some anti-racist
organizations)
     Since (I think he mentioned this once) Elizier seems to be closer in
age to them than me, he seems to think it's a non-issue which will go away
if left alone. Normally, I'd simply tell him he's wrong, and these issues
have to be opposed, but he may not be. If the people who are racist grow
old and die, and their children are exposed to more people who don't think
it's an issue, it might just die out.
     Mind you, it's more complex, since there will likely always be people
with these memes, and some of them will be virulent enough to spread
anyway, but I think you see my point. My cousins have a different
background than I did, but I see it a lot in things like interracial
dating, which seems to be a non-issue for teens now, when I know it was a
huge deal when I was a teen in the 80's.

I saw this on my "Big Ugly Dish" satellite last year.  I was interested in
it because of the occult themes which I find entertaining.  Some on this
list may not appreciate the Qabalistic mysticism.

The story features a mathematical genius named Max who has had emotional
problems since childhood.   He builds a special computer in his house which
suddenly seems to be able to predict reality.  He is pursued by Wall Street
brokers and a mystical Jewish sect, both of which want to obtain the secret.
Max's perception of reality becomes more and more distorted, and it is hard
to tell whether he is going insane or whether reality really is as he
perceives it.

I would call this movie a cross between Videodrome and The Seventh Sign,
only on grainy video.

which wants to suppress th a mystical link between mathematics and reality.
Throughout the film it is difficult to tell what is real and what is
delusion.

Exactly, I didn't appreciate it.
But I really want to recommend the soundtrack of _Pi_. I love it!

The Singularity Institute has just published a major site upgrade,
including three new introductory articles:

"What is General Intelligence?"
  http://singinst.org/seedAI/general.html
"What is Seed AI?"
  http://singinst.org/seedAI/seedAI.html
"What is Friendly AI?"
  http://singinst.org/friendly/whatis.html

The document "Coding a Transhuman AI", which formerly contained "Friendly
AI" as a subpaper, has been renamed "General Intelligence and Seed AI". 
"Friendly AI" has been renamed "Creating Friendly AI" and split off into a
separate paper.  Their new locations are:
  http://singinst.org/GISAI/
  http://singinst.org/CFAI/
The old locations, http://singinst.org/CaTAI/* and
http://singinst.org/CaTAI/friendly/*, now redirect to the new locations.

I don't think it's a non-issue.  On at least one occasion, I quickly
rattled off a distorted version of a joke, making it about managers and
programmers, in order to spoil the punchline of a racist joke that an
older relative had been recently telling and that I was afraid he was
about to tell several children.  It's a small blow, but I'm proud of it.

But, given that ninety percent of the problem has been solved, especially
in the younger generations, the best way to finally damp the problem out
of nonexistence is to avoid saying or doing anything that gives the
impression that you are mentally keeping track of what race a person is. 
That's why I object to this subject line.  A physicist inventing time
travel is a triumph for physicists.

Dear list members,

this is a reminder for all of you who might consider attending
TransVision 2001 in June, but have not registered yet: if you plan to
stay at the conference hotel (Novotel), your reservation has to be
made before May 31 (through the registration form at
http://www.transhumanismus.de/TV2001/register.html), since we have a
number of rooms on hold until that date. Afterwards, you would have to
make your own arrangements for accomodation. You can, of course, still
register for the conference itself.

Best wishes,

Frank

I'm getting my weekly fix of Science (treekiller, check out http://sciencemag.org
for the recycled electrons, but it's not for free) while bahning to work. This 
stuff gets more potent with each new batch, either they're cutting it less, or 
it hits me harder, I don't know which. (Yes, I get a kickback from them
for me pimping it).

Anyway, they jacked up superconducting temperature of buckyballs to 55 K,
and theory says aligned buckys should do lots better, and the best way
of aligning them seems to enclose them in buckytubes, peapod style. Theory
predicts room temperature superconduction, but don't expect to haul too
much over it (hey, I only want to do logics, you can keep all the power
applications to yourself, rendering artificial reality is cheap).

Another whopper is detection of matter signatures just it waves a final kiss
to this universe, and to disappear below event horizont final curtain.
Cool 140 Hz, while whipping around a 60 km object, then waving buh-bye, and 
poof! Never to be seen again. The best thing is that we don't have anysuch 
object at our doorstep. Whew. Even not mentioning looking down the polar 
jets, the accretion disk alone is mightily bright.

Another one, three deep (okay, not so deep) space probes leaving this
system in different directions show significant slowing down over theory. 
Either there's still unknown uneliminated dirt going on, or we have the 
first actual data that we're missing a TOE (we knew that before, but it's 
actually nice to see that we've now have it on hard drive).

More of above cool stuff, just in the case of a few days (okay, I did let
it pile up a bit). As I said, the world is going completely bananas, and no
one seems to give a damn. That's the only thing which truly amazes me.

What next, intra/interspacetime portals? Sorry, forgot, we already had that
last week. Looking forwards for the next one. I hope it's not going to
become much more interesting as this, I'd hate scrapping my plans for the
rest of my life.

And that movie is kinda intense. I strongly suggest any parties present
who're already naturally intense already perhaps refrain from seeing 
that movie.

I'm not intense, but it set my teeth on an edge. 'nuff said.

Hi everyone, I've lurked for a couple days and decided to pinch in here.

_pi_ didn't necessarily show religion in a good light, so it was fine.  But 
it was so undeveloped that he found a 216-digit number which means anything 
enlightening, regardless of what is "between the numbers".  For me, the 
punchline was "Once you lose scientific rigor, you are no longer a 
mathematician, you're a numerologist." and that was coming from the 
friendly antagonist.  The same director did a much better job IMHO in _A 
Requiem for a Dream_ released last fall, which does not deal with 
math.  Too few people understand math, and it's probably really hard to 
make a movie involving it once one does.  I wonder how _AI_ (the movie) 
will turn out--is anyone here involved in that?

I saw the movie, it was OK, better than most, but was it even in the
same universe as "Godel Escher Bach", the best book published in
the twentieth century? Ah, no.

I would rather say it is likely changed beyond all recognition by then -
it might still be a biosphere, it is just that the "bio" and "sphere"
parts might have become different. A billion divergent virtual
ecospheres in virtuality and a few thousand mega-O'Neills in a Dyson
sphere would not be unexpected.

I sincerely apologize.  I thought I was describing the most basic aspects of
the story's premise and setting.  It has been over a year since I saw the
film, and I didn't realize that any part of my description was not obvious
at the outset.

Of course with my heavy occult background, general paranoia, and love for
conspiracy theories, what I assumed was "obvious" may not have been.  I
found this particular story to be contrived, predictable and unoriginal.
The overall theme is very common in occult literature.  I enjoyed it for the
mood and tone of the experience, and not for any intellectual storyline.

Bayesianism is a certain process for updating beliefs based on evidence.  
Maintaining your priors isn't a part of "naive" Bayesianism; it's an 
essential part of Bayesianism, period.  Change your beliefs any other way and 
you're bookable.  If your claim is that Bayesians are naive and you have a 
better way, fine, but a) that needs justification and b) be upfront about it.

I apologize for misreading your assumptions.  I knew you had the assumption 
of shared uberpriors in there and missed that it wasn't explicit.  It's a 
consequence of the extremely strong consistency assumption.  Your consistency 
assumption requires that all possible views be consistent with my view in the 
sense that they derive from my uberprior with only the evidence of their own 
existence.  As I showed, this requires the belief probabilities follow the 
distribution function f(A) = cA/(1-A).  Beliefs from that distribution follow 
your consistency assumption only with an uberprior of 1/(1+c).  

Under the more normal assumption that uninformed priors are not highly 
informative, the only prior that meets the consistency assumption with my 
prior is my prior.  So your consistency assumption holds, in effect, that 
either a) all beliefs result from highly informative brainstates, reasoning 
from a shared uberprior or b) everybody has the same prior.  Neither holds 
for people.  Your consistency assumption could hold only for interactions 
between backups of one perfectly rational individual.

If you are maintaining that human beings should commonize priors, you have 
demonstrated this is not true if people are Bayesian (given what we know 
about people).  You've been suggesting that Bayesian humans should coordinate 
priors by Bayesian reasoning; but based on your work that has to be modified 
to a recomendation that some currently unspecified groups of non-Bayesian 
people should coordinate priors by some currently unspecified non-Bayesian 
method.  Call these unspecified groups and methods "Hansonists" and 
"Hansonism". From what you've said in the past Hansonists should be "people 
who follow Bayesian inference except that they coordinate priors with other 
Hansonists."  My best guess for Hansonism is "the procedure that results from 
participation in an idea futures market" but I'm less sure of this, since 
that's not formally defined.

About the subject line: I agree with Eliezer, and am sorry that I started
the old subject line, "if a black physicist invents time travel".  It was
in marginally bad taste.

But the issue of how long racism will be with us is, as Mike says, not
so simple.  I, too, find there to be less racism among the young than 
formerly, but I'm afraid that this may be true only of the people that
I associate with.  I fear that the media is ignoring a certain amount
of racism that is alive and well among everyone, not just the young.

Here is one interesting example.  The parking lot at a certain high school
in the south bay (northern California) is (or was just a couple of years
ago) divided into four areas:  there is the hispanic area, the asian area,
the white area, and the black area.  A reporter asked a kid if he could
freely park in an area that he didn't usually park in.  "Yes," he replied,
"I could.  But I just wouldn't feel comfortable".  A friend of mine's
daughter, who goes to school in southern California says, "there is
a fair amount of mixing.  But the Mexicans mix least of all."  Now
since Mexican children are soon to be majority in California, this
may not bode well for a diminution of racism..., or rather, if not
racism, this tendency that people have to act on their tendency to
be most comfortable with their own "kind" (however they perceive that).

There is a biological urge, I think, for people to seek out others of 
their own tribe.  Of course, when parents are designing their kids
in a few years, one of the options will hopefully be whether to include
this option or not.  Others of us may also be lucky enough to be able
to choose options that enable us to stop noticing correlations in areas
we deem unimportant or counterproductive.

This sounds similar to an idea that Robin Hanson proposed (primarly for 
uploads, I believe):

A new way to invest in human capital

"May 21 — Allan Browne was preparing for his final semester at Pace 
University last fall when he discovered to his horror that he was nearly 
$3,000 short of what he needed to register for classes. But instead of 
taking out a loan and going deeper into debt, Browne turned to an 
entrepreneur friend who agreed to “invest” in the computer science student 
in exchange for a percentage of his future earnings."

You are in essence arguing that there can be no further constraints on
what beliefs are rational than standard probability coherence and updating
by conditionalization.  Your argument is that if you found that your beliefs
violated some constraint, you could not change your beliefs to avoid the
violation because doing so would violate conditionalization.  Once you
have some beliefs the only rational thing to do is conditionalize, no matter
what.

This flies in the face of a long philosphy literature considering further
constraints on rational beliefs. And I think it takes a good idea too far.
Violating conditionalization only opens you to a dutch book if you do it
in a predictable way.  Your expectation of your future belief must equal
your conditional belief, but a non-zero variance is allowed around this.

I peeked their website (dodged the barrage of cookies and typed in the

If an ISP supported this on the smarthost, they'd more-or-less have to

is cheaper?


It leads me to ask the question, though, what financial value can we
attach to CPU time? I'm sure the question has been kicked around by
the various "sell your CPU time" companies that have popped up. I can
see it should vary from zero to something over 8e-6 pence, per second
(based on a gbp700 box running for three years, plus 50 quid for the
leccy)

Anyone fancy working out the financial cost of the reduced probability
of winning the d.net prize?

*Yes*.  That's *right*.  Which is why any attempt to track which race a
person is carries its own discrimination-propagating overhead.  It is why
"distinguishing between races in order to stamp out racism has ceased to
be a good tradeoff".  Let people think of their tribe as "Democratic" or
"Republican" or "Presbyterian" or "Extropian" or something else that's a
free choice of beliefs.

You can't untangle genes so easily.  Locating a hardware brain center
supporting racism and training selected volunteers via fMRI "cognitive
feedback" to identify and stop using that emotion would be a different
issue.

I've been fooled!
I was reading a book catalog and saw that book listed. The description made 
no mention of the fact that the author was the one who owned the patent. I 
looked up info on the patent independently (the patent number was listed in 
the catalog), but I guess not enough.
At least it's expired.

Well, it's as close to a seeing an event horizont as it gets (actually,
you see it by not seeing it, as the hot matter nugget in question not
only does the Doppler dance, but passes behind the event horizont,
which of course intercepts the radiation (I must go reread that article,
the numbers are not exact, but ballpark).

Oh, it's goddamn cool because instrumentation and signal processing has been
becoming so good, even if though our instruments are still mired on
the dirtball. What an array of spaceborn instruments could see in a
few decades is going to be a lot better.

The actual point I was making that I cited three random items from a single
publication, or a couple of them. If you see them ramping up over the 
years, and so matter-of-factly. The results are important for themselves,
but even more important is the trend.

I would like to see the faces of a few distinguished looking people, if 
I gave them any such particular issue, say, in 1980. Anyone still remembers
how it was in 1980? It's not as bad as 1950, or something, but it's getting
there.

Well, a neuropsychological caveat: it might not be anything so strong as
an urge, but simply a tendency to 1) learn the common appearances of
ones tribe and 2) a tendency to feel more at home later with people
whose appearance is easily parsed.

Exactly. When I think about my own affiliation I realize I have little
in common with my fellow Swedes - a bit of shared culture, but I am even
more strongly affected by Greek, Italian, Anglosaxon and Chinese culture
in relevant areas.

I don't think fMRI biofeedback is a useful method for the next decade or
so - too big and expensive, and also total overkill. Cognitive therapy
or just social interaction with other groups works wonderful.

By BBC News Online technology correspondent Mark Ward 
A helpful virus is making its way around the web, checking computers for 
vulnerabilities and closing them. 



This code was not written with malicious intent
 
Cheesy message  
The "cheese worm" targets computers running Linux that have been attacked by 
a similar, but malign, program earlier this year. 

As it grows in popularity, Linux is increasingly being targeted by virus 
writers and malicious hackers. 

But the benevolent program has not been welcomed by anti-virus companies, who 
say any software that makes unauthorised changes to a computer is potentially 
dangerous. 

Roaring worm 

In March this year, a malicious program known as the Lion worm was infecting 
Linux servers and installing backdoors that could be exploited by its 
creators. The worm also stole passwords and sent them to those system 
crackers using it as an intrusion tool. 



The Linux mascot penguin: An increasingly popular target
 
The backdoors could be used to stage denial-of-service attacks that use a 
series of remotely commanded computers to bombard a target server with bogus 
requests. Usually, the target is overwhelmed by the stream of useless data 
and either crashes, or becomes unreachable by legitimate users. 

Although viruses that exploit the weaknesses of Microsoft Windows are by far 
the most numerous, some malicious hackers have started to target the 
increasingly popular Linux software. This year, four viruses, the Ramen, 
lion, Adore and Sadmind/IIS worms, have been written to attack this software. 

The cheese worm attempts to repair some of the damage done by the Lion worm. 
It scans networks with certain net addresses until it finds one with a back 
door, or port, that has been opened by the Lion worm. 

Wholly holey 

A port is a logical, as opposed to a physical, division within a computer 
system. Individual web-aware programs wait for information addressed, or 
sent, to different ports. These can be thought of as resembling room numbers 
in a skyscraper, where separate companies reside on different floors inside 
one physical building. 

Mail sent to the building will reach the firm it is addressed to, in the same 
way data sent to a server will be directed to a particular program. 

If cheese finds a vulnerable computer, it applies a software patch to close 
the hole, copies itself, and then uses the healed computer to look for other 
networks with the same vulnerability. 

The worm may have gone unnoticed but for the zeal with which it scans for 
vulnerabilities. System administrators who noticed hundreds of attempts to 
scan their machines went looking for the cause and found the cheese worm was 
the culprit. 

The scanning attempts were reported to the Computer Emergency Response Team, 
which issued a security alert. 

The program is known as a "worm" because it travels across a network copying 
itself as it goes. By contrast a "trojan" is a program that looks benign but 
contains a malicious payload. 

Comments inside the code for the worm betray its benign intent. 

One reads: "This code was not written with malicious intent". The cheese worm 
claims to have been created: "to stop pesky haqz0rs (hackers) messing up your 
box even worse than it is already".

HA!  I wondered when this was going to start happening.  The virus itself
may sound benevolent, and it probably is, but the whole thing betrays a
new kind of ecology where users' computers are just pushed around by
whatever force takes control of their system.  Now it's not a question of
good users and bad hax0rs fighting it out, but good viruses and bad
viruses fighting it out.

Got this in the mail from a well-meaning friend. Actually it sounds
like a fun idea, but they've ruined it by making it an attack
against the president. As is typical of what passes for liberal
thought. 

I'm going to send this to president@whitehouse.gov, maybe he'll
turn this on them by endorsing the idea.

I've already read and enjoyed the book mentioned, and have been a
past contributor to the Rocky Mountain Institute (Amory and Hunter
Lovins) and a vocal proponent of the hypercar/hypertruck project.
My electric bill averages less than $15.00 a month and has never
exceeded $20.00, so I don't just talk-the-talk.

There was an interesting statistic out awhile ago that twice as
many Republicans are driving the Honda Insight as Democrats.



ROLL YOUR OWN BLACKOUT
THE FIRST DAY OF SUMMER
JUNE 21, 2001 THURS EVE,
7-10pm worldwide, all time zones

As an alternative to George W. Bush's energy policies and lack of
emphasis on efficiency, conservation and alternative fuels, there
will be a voluntary rolling blackout on the first day of summer,
June 21 at  7pm - 10pm in any time zone (this will roll it across
the planet).

Its a simple protest and a symbolic act. Turn out your lights from
7pm-10pm on June 21. Unplug whatever you can unplug in your house.
Light a candle to the Sungoddess, kiss and tell or not, take a
stroll in the dark, invent ghost stories, anything that's not
electronic - have fun in the dark.

Read the 1999 book "Natural Capitalism" by Hawken and Lovins to
learn that conservation/high efficiency technologies already ARE
on-the-shelf. If implemented these revolutionary ideas would pay
themselves off within five years, after which we'd be pumping far
less greenhouse gas into the atmosphere and saving bucks to boot.

Forward this email as widely as possible, to friends, to your
government representatives and environmental contacts. Let them
know we want global education, participation in, and funding for
conservation, efficiency and alternative fuel efforts -- and an end
the misuse of the earth's resources.

The lesson from the past decade in cryonics appears rather dismal. Not
only is the product intrinsically difficult to sell, it is technically
demanding, and under current framing conditions difficult to deploy in the
field, especially rapidly (when little forewarning if any is given) and
with adequate geographic coverage.  Quality control and documentation is
either absent or patchy at best. As a result, consistency in application
of even existing well developed protocols vary widely. Self-selecting
personal dynamics result in general unreasonability if in not in flakiness
of all aspects of behaviour of all parties involved, business practices
included. I do not exclude myself from this assessment. Advanced methods
do exist, yet there is no significant demand from the parts of the
customers to lobby for a better product. This pattern is easily visible
and extremely off-putting to any potentially interested establishment
professional practicioners, who immediately back off and do not come back
to reinvestigate the field, which stagnates as a result. Peer review is
absent. As a result, criminally negligent service providers continue to
exist (this means you, Robert Ettinger/CI) and to operate, severely
damaging and potentially killing patients in their care.

Reluctantly, I've decided to take the (personal, your mileage *will* vary)
consequences and for time being am going to stop participation in all
cryonics-related activities, whether at the service or the client side.
I'm betting on the mainstream medicine on the long run to eventually
realize the feasibility of reversible cryosuspension using the emerging
techniques of bulk molecular-scale imaging and reconstruction, and to make
it an integral part of last-resort emergency care, profiting from
economies of scale, infrastructure and synergisms. Given current and
accelerating rate of progress in a number of relevant fields as well as
changing world demographics, this does not appear at all unlikely, 30-40
decades of such ongoing developments assuming. If this does not occur, or
I happen to die before, so be it.

I think I still owe any potential customers and current customers of CI a
fully listed disclosure of what is technically wrong with CI, and why I
consider it to be improbable, that CI -- miracles excluded -- will ever
fix it. Not that this is going to matter very much, but I'll put my name
under it, and the archives will get it. Running into this information may
prevent the one or the other signup. Having this said, I strongly
discourage litigation against CI, since if successful, it will endanger
the patients under their care, which might or might not be still
salvageable.

In closing, I would very much like to express my admiration to all the
technical people out there in the field who're pulling in their full
weight, against above odds. You know who you are. Especial thanks go to
Saul Kent and Bill Faloon, may their commitment continue unwavering.

I'll hang around for a few days here before firing off the CI assessment
piece (mostly assembled from freely available information, Cryonet
archives included), to catch your comments, if any.

Apart from that dangling end, I'm almost out of here. I hope you all make
it.

Subject: UK situation

While not wanting to hammer this topic till it becomes as boring as, say,
the discussions of human vs. machine intelligence, or identity, I did find
the following material interesting. It's a copy of some email that was
sent and signed by about a dozen British people, to Alcor, a couple of
months ago. I think it sheds light on the situation. So far as I know, the
request in the letter was denied.

--Charles Platt

-----------------------------------------

We the undersigned UK residents have experienced delays & difficulties
with Alcor Membership. Some of us have been waiting since 1999 for Alcor
to complete our paperwork.

We have all been encouraged to join Alcor. For example in a document
entitled "Towards Autonomy-a Proposal for Alcor UK- dated 16th. August
2000, Linda Chamberlain states:

   1. First Stage of Conversion-Split Program Years 2000-2002. In this
   period you should pursue greater membership as rapidly as possible.

Acting on this advice & in good faith many of us have spent thousands of
pounds taking out UK Life Insurance Policies, putting them in Trust,
paying Solicitors, Public Notaries & others.

In a letter dated February 12th. 2001 Linda says " I'm afraid we will have
to make the international membership requirements apply to the UK as
well (no longer being able to offer Scottish Amicable as an exception with
the UK)"

However some of us have taken out Life Insurance before applying for
Membership(as Alcor advises) If we cancel or even just re-assign these
Policies we would face considerable financial losses through no fault of
our own.

We therefore request that Alcor accepts all such Policies arranged before
the Feb.12th. announcement & allows us to proceed with our Membership.

 Are there any good reasons to think these diseases are not caused by microbes?
 Paul Ewald's book Plague Time points out that if problems like this were
merely the result of bad genes, evolution would probably have eliminated them.
Whereas small organisms that prey on us can evolve fast enough that our
genes should be expected to be a bit too out of date to fully deal with
those microbes. It seems from evolutionary considerations like there ought
to be a fair number of organisms pursuing a strategy of infecting people in
ways that only show harm decades after they infect a person, and that most
people should have some of these infections.
 Ewald presents some fairly strong evidence that the medical community has a
long history of underestimating the number of diseases that are caused by
microbes. I don't see any signs that the medical community has corrected
the biases that have caused that underestimation.
 Plague Time is a bit too sensationalist. But since Ewald's prior book, The
Evolution of Infectious Diseases, was much more rigorous (and somewhat less
interesting), I don't think this sensationalism indicates he's careless
(merely that he's at least as interested in selling books as he is in
informing people).

Mice raised in germ-free environments still get diseases of aging, to the 
extent
that they don't live much longer than normal caged mice.  Particular diseases
may, of course, be caused by microbes and MS is suspected of being viral, 
although there's no causative organism identified.

 U.S. draft-dodgers in the 1970s often fled to Canada, so I strongly suspect
Canada was protecting many U.S. citizens from their government then. Is there
anything different about this case?

Keith Henson refused to accept defeat.  It's a very human, and I daresay
transhumanist, thing to do.  So the story continues.  What's not to

First: do you care where it points? If not, then Great. Your next
problem would be data-rate. if yes, then Not-so-Great. Welcome to the
world of Spacecraft Observations Planning, which, for Cassini, is
especially difficult since the spacecraft is crippled in its pointing
capabilities.

Unlike some other spacecraft like Galileo and Ulysses, where the
instruments are mounted on a rotating portion of the spacecraft, so
that *all* instruments have 360-degree viewing (with the occassional
magnetometer boom obstructing some of the FOV), Cassini has none.
This lack of a rotating portion was a NASA cost-saving measure some 10
years (?) ago.  Therefore, if any instrument on Cassini wants to look
in a particular direction, then it has to compete with the other dozen
instruments. Mission planning is generally done years in advance, with
a huge (and ongoing) effort by members of the instrument teams: they
must submit their observational requirements in detail, in a
particular format by a particular date, then meetings and meetings are
held with key managers, and the merits of each scientific goal are
discussed and somehow one or several instruments are given priority
over another for that time slot. The large bandwidth instruments like
the imaging system often win over the others because of its good PR.

Our group's Cassini CDA dust instrument is low-requirement, low
bandwidth instrument with respect to some of the others and sometimes
we really need to fight to have our observations. At Saturn, probably
even more fighting will be required: For example: If we want to look
at the dust in Saturn's E-ring, and the Imaging system wants to look
at the dust in Saturn's E-ring, what then? The two instruments are
located about 120-degrees apart in Cassini's viewing boresight.

Regarding Cassini's datarate.. there are currently two downlinks per
week (100 kilobit/s ?) which currently wouldn't make a webcam possible
(unless you would be happy with a static picture for half of the
week). So then I suppose this problem might be addressed by Eugene's
notice of that Interplanetary Internet protocal.

I always heard that people sought out members of other tribes, at least
as mates.  There is rivalry between tribes but a lot of fraternization
as well.

I think the answer as the president has made clear is both
conservation and new sources.

I keep reading where certain groups are claiming that the president
is on the wrong track, what we need is power that is "clean,
reliable, renewable and cheap". It's okay till you get to the cheap
part. I think we should keep looking, but we also need to do
something now, and price caps are NOT the answer.

I find the Lovinses to be a good source of new ideas, and they
practice what they preach, the Rocky Mountain Institute produces
more energy than it uses, and does so at high elevations in the
Rocky mountains....

I cut my own energy use by more than half with just a few simple
tricks, and anyone else could do the same. If we all did, there
wouldn't be a current problem. 

But as a diehard Bucky Fuller fan, I think the problem is a matter
of design.

I think the Onion got this one absolutely right.  We should build another
200 nuclear power plants and move on to real issues.  France did it, so
can we.

It's not clear from Eugene's letter if he is actually cancelling his
cryonics contract or just eliminating a degree of "active" participation.
I think it would be unwise to do the former and would be an unfortunate
overreaction to the problems in the cryonics community.

Frankly, I am amazed at how bad-tempered, rude, ill-mannered and
unlikeable the members of the community appear to be, at least in
their online personas.  With such a small group of people, who face such
overwhelming external threats, you would think they would recognize their
common interests and band together for survival.  Instead you see insults,
feuds, back-stabbing, tremendous negativity.

It's gotten to the point where I'd suggest that active participation
in the cryonics community is detrimental to your long-term survival.
I unsubscribed to cryonet years ago and my peace of mind has been far
greater as a result.  I don't think it is healthy to expose yourself to
the stress and tension which is provoked by engaging in bitter online
battles (even vicariously).  You're reducing the quality of your life
and potentially your healthy lifespan as well.

And in the extreme you may be goaded to take measures like cutting off
your involvement with cryonics entirely.  (Whether Eugene has done this
or not, the point remains that it can happen.)  Even though this may seem
like a completely justified action in the context of an ongoing dispute,
from the larger perspective it can only hurt your chances of survival,
and that should be the bottom line for this kind of decision.

I am a passive cryonics client.  I subscribed years ago, I pay my dues,
and I let the company worry about the rest.  I feel that to take a more
active role would end up being harmful to my long-term prospects, as I
explained above.  I sacrifice a certain incremental improvement in my
prospects by possibly not having the absolute best cryonics arrangement
possible.  But I gain peace of mind and tranquility, and in the long
run these are healthy and life-enhancing attributes that I value.

I can't say that I agree that 90% of the problem is solved. It's just a
whole lot harder to see. People know racist jokes aren't acceptable, so
that don't tell them. Do they still discriminate? Yes, they just never
admit why. I live in Cincinnati (maybe you've heard of it), and this is a
very big deal here now. Most whites here don't want to talk about this, and
most blacks do. Problems abound.

I agree here, and think it may just be the people I choose to associate
with, too. I do know (from my own reading) that there are still certain
segments of every group who only want to deal with members of their own
groups. Segregated seating in lunch rooms being one example.

But it's going to happen whether or not you acknowledge the differences.
Maybe, just maybe, if people can see what they're doing, they'll realize
how to stop. I don't think this is, largely, a rational well-thought out
way of living, and to expect people to just "change" is not going to work.
Unlike Anders, most people are going to identify with whatever group
they're around and feel comfortable with, then think anyone outside that
group is somehow suspect.
     I do wonder, though, whether things like "narrowcasting", magazines
devoted to special-interests, cable-tv, the internet, etc. which allow
people to communicate without really knowing what the other person looks
like, might be making racial issues obsolete, and replacing them with other
identifiers, at least in some cases. Then again, I might be applying what
I've seen too broadly.

I think this is an incorrect characterization.

The bonafide rural population doesn't take nature for granted, rather it 
sees nature for what it really is.  The "environmentalists and nature 
worshippers" who have spent little time living in natural surroundings have 
a very black and white perspective of nature that is naive and wildly 
underestimates the complexity and interactions of the system.  True rural 
folk see a big mixture of gray and colors, not the imagined contrast of the 
urban environmentalist.  Therefore, most rural folk tend to be 
"conservationists", which work with nature rather than trying to 
artificially enforce an extreme contrast that any rural folk could tell you 
is neither good nor natural.

The road to hell is paved with good intentions; the environmentalists may 
mean well, but could stand to first learn a few lessons in reality from the 
people who have lived in those rural lands for many years, lest they 
destroy the very thing they intend to save.  Many environmentalists are 
utopians in the same sense that communists were in the first part of the 
20th century, having constructed wonderful ideas that necessarily rely on 
poorly evaluated assumptions.

I think there is a place for new energy sources, and I like the idea of a
more distributed system using microturbines and fuel cells, when they are
economical. However, I also favor more nuclear power and have done so for
a long time. Since I last really looked into the field a decade or so
ago, plenty of advancements have come on line. Here's a summary of a
recent update on the topic:<br><br>
06/01/01 <font color="#0000FF"><u>The France Syndrome<br>
</u></font>eCompany by David Freedman <br><br>
The author argues that nuclear power is due for a comeback in the United
States, and that we can look to France (where 75% of electricity comes
from nuclear plants) to know what to expect. Nuclear power has benefited
from technological advances. It has become cheaper and safer. This
article surveys improved designs for reactors and better control and
monitoring systems. Thanks to less downtime (and concurrent safety
improvements), nuclear power is now the lowest cost major method of
generating electricity. Apart from cost, non-Soviet nuclear power’s
environmental performance over the last 20 years is almost spotless.
Several economic, political, and social forces are combining to make it
likely that nuclear power will expand over time in the U.S. This article
is a good source of information on this future trend. (6 pages)<br><br>

The third commandment.

"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain"
["for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name
in vain", Exodus 20:7]

What does it mean? I cannot understand.
Do not misuse the name of the Lord? Too simple, imo.

The word "vain" is the Hebrew word "shav".
It has a variety of translations, including emptiness, vanity, falsehood,
nothingness, emptiness of speech, lying, and worthlessness.

S.

The Vatican says:

Rejection of false oaths is a duty toward God. As Creator and Lord, 
God is the norm of all truth. Human speech is either in accord with 
or in opposition to God who is Truth itself. When it is truthful and legitimate, 
an oath highlights the relationship of human speech with God's truth. 
A false oath calls on God to be witness to a lie.
In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus explained the second commandment: 
"You have heard that it was said to the men of old, 'You shall not swear 
falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.' But I say to you, 
Do not swear at all. . . . Let what you say be simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything 
more than this comes from the evil one."Jesus teaches that every oath
involves a reference to God and that God's presence and his truth must be 
honored in all speech. Discretion in calling upon God is allied with a respectful 
awareness of his presence, which all our assertions either witness to or mock.

the pioneering research of Randy Thornhill, UNM Regents' professor of
biology, and Steven Gangestad, professor of psychology, has shown that beauty
may not be entirely skin deep. There are a number of biological constants that
transcend culture, ethnicity, and advertising campaigns. One of these is
bilateral symmetry, which is how well your left side matches your right.
http://www.beautyworlds.com/mirrormirror.htm

More evidence indicating the ability to recognize beauty derives from
neuro-biology and behavioral genetics (as do morality and love). IOW, our
genes decide how we perceive beauty, who we love, and whether we think it
right or wrong.

Hi all,

I have been trying to get ahold of Michael Lorrey for a couple of weeks now 
and have not been able to do so.  I know that he has not unsubscribed from 
the extropians list, as I process all such requests; however, he has not 
posted anything since April 24th.  For most list members, this wouldn't be 
completely abnormal, but for Mike Lorrey in particular, it is very 
unusual...particularly since he gave no notice of his "leave of abscence."

If anyone knows Mike personally or otherwise knows the whereabouts of his 
person, please let me know as soon as you can.

						Sincerely,

							-E. Shaun Russell

Yes, I predicted this also.  The problem is the same as we have with our two
party system in the U.S.  Each side tries to control the unsuspecting user
without giving the user the autonomy to control themselves.

This worm may sound good, but it is still trespassing and making changes
without permission.  It then uses the computer without permission to seek
out other computers to "help".  It never asks if the victim computer wants
to be scanned, patched, or used to "help" others.  What happens to my demo
of Linux bugs when this worm "fixes" it?  What happens to my CPU speed or
network bandwidth as this thing secretly starts scanning in the background?

Even if you think this worm fixes bad holes, wait until somebody decides
that Microsoft Visual Basic is just too dangerous, and tries to "fix" it on
everybody else's computer.  I fear the coming wave of copycats who will try
to be "helpful" without asking.

My understanding was that Mike had planned to travel across the United States and even eventually visit Alaska.  And so I assume he is doing that now.  But, I would think he would occasionally check his email at various internet cafes if he did not have a wireless connection.  I hope he is alright!

Hello,

For all of you who have or are in the process of making plans to attend 
Extro-5, I have some important information to pass on.

I checked with the hotel today, and of the 30 room block which we had 
reserved, 28 rooms have been taken.  I was fortunate enough to increase the 
amount of rooms in the block to 40 at the conference rate; however, that 
only leaves 12 rooms currently available for the Friday and Saturday 
evening of the conference.  As a result, to avoid disappointment, I 
encourage you to register for the conference and reserve your room as soon 
as possible.  Room sharing is possible for those of you who wish to cut 
costs and/or ensure that you will have a room.  If you are interested in 
doing this, please send me an e-mail directly, and I will match you up with 
another person who also wishes to do so.

For those of you who have already reserved a room at the Hilton and have 
not heretofore given me your confirmation number, please do so at your 
soonest convenience so that I can determine the number of rooms accounted for.

Additionally, there have already been thirteen reservations made for the 
Sunday evening at the Hilton.  Currently the Sunday reservations are not at 
the conference price, though I am awaiting a response from the events 
coordinator at the Hilton as to whether or not the conference price will be 
extended to the Sunday.

Once again, I urge those of you who plan on staying at the Hilton for the 
duration of the conference to both register for Extro-5 and reserve your 
rooms as soon as possible.

If you have any questions, concerns, comments etc. regarding any of the 
above, please feel free to contact me directly at e_shaun@extropy.org.

						Sincerely,

							-E. Shaun Russell

Being relatively new to, but heavily involved in the cryonics community, I 
have noticed this tendency as well, though am not sure I understand the 
origin of the reasons behind the widespread vehemence.  It may be as simple 
as a case of differences in perspectives e.g.: X feels (or "knows") that 
Y's methods will not work correctly.  Behind the basic concept of 
cryopreservation (or suspension, if you prefer), there is a vast body of 
science that is fundamentally unprovable at this point in time.  However, 
some contend that despite a certain procedure's lack of provable 
effectiveness, it works better than another procedure.  Essentially, there 
is a lot more than just faith in future technologies to rescue frozen 
corpses --there is a very high level of scientific discretion which is 
practiced by some, and apparently not by others.  Since there is no way to 
effectively "prove" that one is right or wrong, mud-slinging occurs over 
the various theories and practices.

Of course, in my mind the mud-slinging is very unproductive and 
impractical.  I believe that the various organizations should essentially 
leave each other to practice in what way they feel is necessary to preserve 
the lives of its members and patients.  Since there is no way to prove that 
any one given method will work better than another, it is up to each 
individual cryopreservation company to maintain the procedural integrity 
that they feel is necessary to provide the best possible care.

I personally believe that the companies which have the most logical proofs 
of the science of cryonics will be the ones who will do the best 
job.  Again, the difficulty is that those proofs are mostly speculative and 
ultimately subjective to each organization.  Mud-slinging doesn't help this 
though, and for the field of cryonics to have any public credibility at 
all, the slinging will need to stop.

I plan on fleshing out some of the ideas stated above for publication in 
the near future.

I usually live in Florida (although I have been staying in Oklahoma City for
the last few months).

Florida cops still use racial profiling to randomly stop and search cars on
I-95.  People are still fighting this, and the cops are still fighting to
continue this strategy.  They argue that since most drug dealers are
non-white, that cops should be targeting non-whites for random searches.
(And yes, we have random roadblocks and searches without warrants, but don't
ask me how this is legal.)

We also have a lot of English-language bigotry here.  People are still
trying to pass laws making it illegal to teach people in their native
language, do business in their native language or even to allow cops or
government workers to perform investigations in languages other than
English.  Some have even suggested that cops should be instructed to shoot
people who don't obey their commands, and if it turns out that they don't
speak English, it is their own fault.

We also still have racial shootings, drive-bys, and yes, even a few reports
of crosses burned on people's front lawns every year.  I agree that racism
is not as much of a problem as it once was, but there is no doubt in my mind
that it still exists.

Thanks, but I'm pretty mellow here. I just gave my view of the 
situation. I do not consider the things hopeless, otherwise I 
would have just bailed out quietely. At this time and place, 
however, purely for me personally, I don't think it's worth it.
For now, I'm counting on the mainstream eventually getting it.

The situation is very different for you SoCal/Bay Area and AZ 
folks. Particularly, by becoming part of the team you could 
become a part of solution set. At least, as a clients, be
informed and lobbying clients.

Afghan Taliban Orders Non-Muslims to Wear Badge
Photos

Reuters Photo


ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (Reuters) - Afghanistan (news - web sites)'s Taliban 
rulers ordered the country's non-Muslim minorities Tuesday to wear a 
distinctive badge on their clothes while going outdoors.

The Taliban-controlled Voice of Shariat radio, monitored in Islamabad, 
quoted religious police chief Maulawi Abdul Wali as saying the order had 
been issued in the light of a fatwa, or religious decree, given by Islamic 
scholars.

``The ulema (scholars) issued a fatwa that the non-Muslim population of the 
country should have a distinctive mark such as a piece of cloth attached to 
their pockets so they should be differentiated from others,'' it quoted Wali 
as saying in an interview with the official Bakhtar news agency.

``And this decision is in accordance with the Sharia (Islamic law),'' he 
said.

Maybe it meant that it is a defined sin to represent oneself as God.  That is in the
context where "taking the name of " is "assuming the guise of", and in the context of
an alternate to the more commonly understood meaning.  Is it possible that that
translation is accurate?  More regularly, it means to avoid cursing and swearing
false oaths, and to practice honesty, somewhat as explicated in your reference.  Why
do you ask?

Considering as an example the Piss Christ, I think Jesus the Christ would think that
it was art, perhaps better art than some percentage of the iconography, where Jesus
the man is not available for comment.  For example, the loving Jesus would be humble
and would exhibit love for those whose urine his icon floated within, and offer them
salvation.  Then again, that cropo-Madonna is a knockoff of the Piss Christ.

I agree, and we should stop calling god by his first name too.  We
should show some respect henceforth and refer the almighty as
Mr. Damn.

Here's a more technical abstract on the relevant substance, humanin:

http://dragon.prit.go.jp/en/Inter_Sympo/14th/lec12.html

< Using this system and a modified death trap method, we screened genes, by
transfecting a human expression cDNA library, that protected neuronal cells
from death by V642I APP. A clone, named Humanin (HN) cDNA, encoded a novel
24 amino acid polypeptide that prevented neuronal cell death induced by
V642I APP, KM595/596NL APP, M146L presenilin (PS)-1, and N141I PS-2,
without effect on neuronal cell death by Huntington's
disease/spinocerebellar ataxia - associated polyglutamine repeat Q79 or
familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-associated SOD1 mutants.>

I do like those modified death traps. (Actually a friend of mine used to
drive one.)

But personally, I'm waiting for the release of transhumanin. :)

Normally, I do not forward personal emails, but this is the first time I've
ever received something I'd classify as hate mail.  Needless to say, since
the writer does hope for my demise, I felt he or she had put himself or
herself outside the pale of normal net etiquette.

I take it he or she is my very juvenile piece "What is posthumanism?" at
http://www.subsitu.com/kr/posthum.htm

BTW, I've been busy of late, which is why I've not continued the dinosaur
thread...  I'll get back to it later.

Cheers!

Not at all!  I'm not saying there's never a reason to violate Bayesian 
conditionalization (Bc), just that if you do so you're violating Bc and not 
entirely Bayesian.  I think people violate Bc all the  time due to 
computational reasons.  I do consider Bayesian inference the ideal, so I want 
to see a reason to give it up before I do so.  If, for example, maintaining 
an independent prior resulted in getting booked or taken in an idea market, 
then that could be a legitimate reason to ditch Bayesianism.

You are correct and my statement was too strong.  However, adding variability 
to post-conditionalization opinions will on average worsen disagreement, so  
that won't serve to coordinate priors.  You've also neglected the other way 
to avoid strict Bayesianism, which is simply to refuse the bets.  I think 
this would be the only way out of some hypothetical inconsistent/unusable 
prior set - the agent has must either refuse the actions that expose the 
problems with the prior or refuse bets on their responses to having bad 
priors exposed.

The more worms out there, the better. Also, people continuing banging on the
fre *nix kernels, waves of waves of code reviews and machines out there being
exposed to diverse attacks will eventually produce pretty secure, resilient
systems. The NSA Linux kernel is rather interesting from this point of view.
It might or might not contain some very difficult to detect easter eggs, but
the architecture itself is nicely different from the unconscious assumption
the other guys play nice.

Closed source systems with their security by obscurity approach do not 
profit from this process.

Bugs that eat computers

Researchers in the Institute for Environmental Science at the
University of Zurich may have discovered the ultimate computer
bug. Not this time a fault in software but real microbes that can
digest redundant circuit boards, gather up the heavy metals -
such as copper - which have gone into their manufacture and allow
these metals to be recycled for further use.

The conventional method of dealing with electronic waste is to
grind or incinerate the material, once any components that can be
reused have been removed. This process produces a fine-grained
dust. Now Dr Helmut Brandl and his colleagues at Zurich have
found an inexpensive way of recovering metals from the dust for
reuse.

Relatively common bacteria, such as Thiobacilli ferroxidans and
Thiobacilli thiooxidans, are already utilized in mining for the
extraction of metals such as copper. Both types of bacteria
acquire their metabolic energy through the oxidation of reduced
sulphur compounds.

Dr Brandl believes that heterotrophic bacteria and yeasts could
be utilized to leach lead, copper and tin from printed circuit
boards. A sulfolobus-like organism mobilises gallium from
compound semiconductors. Fungi (such as penicillin) and bacteria
are capable of growing on electronic waste. The formation of
inorganic acids (e.g. sulphuric acid) through bacteria and the
formation of organic acids such as citric acid and gluconic acid
through fungi, cause dissolution of metals. In addition,
dissolution of metals can be achieved with oxidation processes
e.g. iron oxidation with thiobacilli. Fungi, because of the
organic metabolic products (chelating agent), are able to
maintain the metals in a dissolved state in a certain range, more
or less independently of the pH value. Penicillium simplicissimum
is able to efficiently mobilize many metals (Ni, Pb, Sn, Zn) in a
single stage procedure.

This procedure allows metals to be separated completely from the
electronic waste. It is very simple then to recover the metals
from the various leaching liquids. In a first step, the biomass
is removed by filtering. Then, the pH content of the filtrate is
increased by the addition of caustic soda, which facilitates a
metal fractionation (sequential precipitation). Aluminium and
copper in particular can be recovered as hydroxide in this way.

We've talked about using microsingularities as catalysts for
matter->energy conversions before. One of the suggestions to generate them
was to focus giant energy densities on small regions of spacetime (a
sphere of giant-energy ultrashort pulse lasers with ultraprecise alignment
and synchronization), but probably it would be thwarted by coupling to
Dirac's sea, thus making vacuum opaque due to devirtualization of virtual
pairs and preventing us from achieving supercritical fluxes. Plus
targeting and synchronizing a very large assembly spread over lightsecond
to lightminute distances looks not exactly trivial.

Now this time machine wannabee people say photons warp space more if
slowed. What happen if a more down to earth spherical arrangement of, say,
GJoule lasers would synchronously fire on a Bose-Einstein condensate
target? If the targeting is right, we can get very short, very intense
pulses in optical (an in principle up to xRay) range which hit the target
at the same time -- and slowed down to few m/s.

Of course this will cook the condensate, so that it will lose its magic
fairy dust spread, but how soon? Any physicists around?

There  were 2 one-hour PBS programs airing here in Houston last night that 
both dealt with how the future of humanity was bascially a cyborg future. 
Great stuff. I saw some interviews: Moravec, and yes, Bill Joy got his say. 
I was only able to watch about 20 minutes, and so will tape the reruns over 
the  next two nights. The show was unabashedly positive with respect to the 
Cyborg future of humanity and the implications of that future. It was 
basically an advertisement for using tech to transform ourselves into 
posthumans. Appended below are the synopses and future times for showings 
here in Houston.

Two points -

Remember World War II? Lots of affected persons were not allowed to leave. 
The rest of the world pretty much ignored what Hitler and his government 
was doing.

Are "different" people allowed to leave Afghanistan?

Another WWII parallel - does the Taliban have any ambitions toward 
reforming OTHER Islamic areas? To some extent, what happens there affects 
all of us - as it did with their destruction of irreplaceable historical 
religious statues.

Other countries are quick to condemn America  for our political system and 
some of our freedoms (notice I did not use that "G" word). Someone should 
speak up about this situation. So far, I see nothing but straight reporting 
by US media, at least.

It's ultimately up to the Afghanis to change their own government, but 
giving the people who would make the changes moral support from the rest of 
the world can only help.

Completely random changes might worsen disagreement, but changes toward
a common prior would not.

You will probably want to send a copy of this along with a letter
of concern to every human rights organization you can find, you may
also wish to send letters to every civilized government you can
identify. Don't forget both the whitehouse, and the U.N. You may
want to consider joining Amnesty International.

Oh and don't forget to send a copy to the folks at Handgun Control
Inc, they will probably want to get in touch with the Taliban and
remind them that the next step historically in this process is to
disarm those marked for dest- ERRR I mean marked with this special
badge.

Problem is there is not location named Colls, NJ I could find...

Hopefully, this guy is not a threat to me...  or others.  I just figure it's
better to let everyone know he's out there.

I have caught a couple of these in Oklahoma City.  I must agree that I was
impressed with the positive treatment technology and transhuman ("beyond
human") topics received.  They portrayed the opposing side and fears
accurately and fairly, but did not succumb to baseless fears.  It was
pro-technology.

Both those shows were awesome, yes.  Bill Joy was quite restrained in

This was my reaction as well.  The preference for symmetry is well-known.
However, J.R. is reading way too much into this paper.  It only discusses
the preference for symmetry.  It does not discuss love, partner preferences
or whether we think it right or wrong.

But then the changes are predictable, and become bookable.

He looked at the Extro-5 program and realized that he didn't stand a 
chance. Might as well get on the winning side.

That's my story and I'm sticking to it.  ;-)

and Columbus Convention Center in Columbus, Ohio .

"LFScon" will be part of Marcon 36, Ohio's oldest and largest science 
fiction and fantasy convention which annually attracts more than 
3,000 writers, editors, artists, film actors, filkers, costumers,

There is nothing really basically wrong with that phrase, but

Not ever.

I don't know what "inalieable" means but , the phrase "inalienable sacredness"
has never been one of my favorites either, a bit too pompous for my taste.

Your reaction is the result of your genetic make-up. ô¿ô
Of course the cited material did not mention partner preference or objective
morality. Those issues were covered in The Biological Basis of Morality and
The Ghost In The Machine. Evolutionary psychology and behavioral genetics are
making progress where once socialist ideology had dictated world order.

Pocket Rockets Pack a Punch
By Alan Leo
Technology Review, May 18, 2001

First proposed a decade ago, microrocketry is taking off. Before long, 
dime-sized dynamos may power everything from tiny satellites to "smart dust."
http://www.technologyreview.com/web/leo/leo051801.asp

Onward!

(There's one thing I don't understand about this.  Photons don't "really"
get slowed when they pass through a material medium, whether a window pane
or a Bose-Einstein condensate.  At some level what happens is that they
are constantly absorbed and re-emitted, with the net effect of slowing
the wave front.  Relativistic effects don't normally slow down with
the slowed photons; you can go FTL in a material medium, for example,
which is what causes Cherenkov radiation.  So I don't see how slowing
photons in this artificial way can have any effects in terms of time
travel or other relativistic phenomena.)

However my main point was that when I read your subject line I thought you
meant microSingularities, not miniature black holes.  A microSingularity
in the social sense would be a microscopic version of what we mean by
a Singularity.  What would that be?

Imagine a discipline of Singularity Engineering.  Usually we think of a
Singularity as something which sweeps over a society, producing global
changes of an extraordinary degree.  But there could be many kinds
of Singularities.  It might be possible to alter the trajectory of a
society as it moves towards a Singularity and affect the outcome.

This is essentially what Eliezer is trying to do with his Singularity
Institute.  He hopes to create a "Friendly" AI and have that lead to a
Friendly Singularity.  As the prospects for success improve, and other
people start to see the potential, they may set up their own rival
efforts to influence the Singularity in other ways.

This leads to thinking of a Singularity as not being something which just
happens to us, but rather as something we can shape and control.  Maybe we
could start and stop our progress towards Singularity.  You could even
imagine a society which goes Singular for a while, then drops back into
a more historically normal state.  It would be like one of those comic
books where some guy can turn on super-powers for a while then goes back
to being ordinary.  What's that?  An asteroid coming to destroy the earth?
This looks like a job for... SuperHumanity!

>From this perspective, what would be a microSingularity?  It would be a
Singularity whose effects were limited.  Imagine an AI which had virtually
unlimited potentiality but which used its powers only in limited ways.
A genie which grants only three wishes, or a special-purpose machine
to view anywhere on earth in the distant past, might be examples.
You could have devices or regions with near-magical powers, without
necessarily seeing the entire cosmos restructured into a new form.

Clearly, creating a microSingularity would be uncertain and risky and
could easily backfire.  It's not at all clear that you could create
a system with such incredible power and still hope to constrain it in
such specific ways.  Still, it's not fundamentally different from trying
to constrain an AI to be Friendly; it's just a finer level of control.
If Singularity Engineering is possible at all, it may be possible to
create microSingularities as well.

And he was even in favor of these technologies.  Which got me thinking:
of all the possible forms that the Singularity may take, might the
cyborg one, where humans uplift themselves via augmentation rather than
engineering only their kids or building advanced AIs, be the most
publically acceptable one (since it best deals with currently existing
human beings)?

Your comments swing my Cognitive Distortion Meter into the "UNDERESTIMATION"
zone.
Assimilation happens all the time. Nothing new. Just happening faster of late.
(It only seems entropic to us when we resist.)

We are not the Knights who say "Ni!"
We're the Global Brain Metaman who assimilates all intelligent entities.

Or, in the words of Ray Kurzweil, "An evolutionary process accelerates because
it builds on its own means for further evolution. Humans have beaten
evolution. We are creating intelligent entities in considerably less time than
it took the evolutionary process that created us. Human intelligence--a
product of evolution--has transcended it. So, too, the intelligence that we
are now creating in computers will soon exceed the intelligence of its
creators."

So, let the Net fix your Visual Basic for you. Resistance is, after all, quite
futile.

I think individual inventions could fit this definition, certainly
the printing press/movable type, and more recently the personal
computer have affected change on this level.

Perhaps the Extropy Institute or EXTRO-5?

It's pretty shocking when it happens, isn't it?

The most vitriol email I received was from a teenager last October who
apparently expected a response from me, from an earlier message (I think
I was actually on travel when she sent it). Also during the last year or two
I rarely answer email from strangers due to huge constraints on  my time,
money, typing hands, etc, therefore I placed messages all over my Web
site stating I rarely answer email.

Apparently the girl was upset with me ... she went on for a full
paragraph calling me a "self-serving bitch", and many other names. Hard
to believe and hard to shield oneself psychologically from junk like that.
I have alot of disappointments from Internet the last years, and that
venomous message added to the pile of my disappointments.

But one person's "fix" may be another person's "error."  What if the net
spell-checked your posts and "corrected" British spelling to American
spelling?  What if it "corrected" your profanity to politically-correct
words?  What if it "fixes" your pornography by deleting it?

What one person decides is a "fix" may not be desired by another person.
This boils down to one group enforcing their will onto another group "for
their own good."

Singularity has a few different possible alternatives, as far as I am aware.

- There's the AI path, in which an alien super intelligence comes from a
self modifying seed.

- There's the nanotech path, where super nanotech allows us to brute-force
intelligence by a combination of pure simulation of the human brain+body,
and some hoopy simulated evolutionary approaches to improving on it (as well
as just making it a lot faster than a real human brain, by throwing hardware
at it. This is basically the upload approach.

- There's the intelligence augmentation approach, where we add things to our
heads to make ourselves smarter, and those things allow us to conceive more
mods to make which will make us smarter still, loop. Note that this could be
biotech/nanotech enhancements, resulting in a purely biological being,
rather than the traditional cyborg concept.

I don't think genetic engineering of the kids can lead to singularity in any
hurry, because of our long generation time (which only looks set to get a
lot longer). Gene "therapy" on living individuals is another story entirely,
but that belongs in the category of biotech enhancements.

Having just been on the telly to talk about how damn great cyborg technology
would be, I must raise a reservation that I have about it. Particularly, it
seems to me that it requires either full blown nanotech, or else some pretty
risky invasive surgical procedures. For the surgical version, the advantages
would want to be pretty great to attract people to it over the wearable
alternatives.

Also, as far as I am aware, we are not even remotely close to understanding
enough about the brain, that we would want to go in an make mods, except
where the subject is so screwed up already that there is little to lose. I
get the impression that we are at least 20 years from the level of
understanding required to add useful things to our heads. On this subject,
does anyone know what has been happening with Dr Theodore Berger's research
of late? There seems to be a lot of relatively old hyped-up press about it,
then nothing recent. I mention him because, if the press about his work is
not all bullshit, he is positive about brain modifications (implanting chips
and whatnot) sometime this decade.

So, I'd have said that we were still a long way from mental mods, and that
most less tightly integrated modifications would have safer wearable
versions which would be available before the full-blown cyborg options.

And, if we have to wait for nanotech before we can do really hoopy mental
modifications, we'll well and truly be in a post biotech revolution world
where there are already some mindblowing things that we can do without
adding non-biological stuff to ourselves.

So is it likely that we will have socially significant cyborg tech in the
next few decades? If it is possible sooner rather than later, the enabling
technologies would appear to lead to singularity in any case, and past that
point you start talking about SIs and posthumans rather than cyborgs. If it
takes longer, either we still have technological singularity upon us before
we can really get started on cyborg tech (because we are relying on nanotech
& godawlmity computational resources), or else we've had a long time to
develop wearables that do just about anything we'd want to do, without
having to crack the skull.

I feel as though it's going to be one of those ideas which is a driver now,
but might look a bit embarrassing 20 years down the track... very Jetsons.

I can understand being upset at that.  I'm also a lot more afraid of someone
threatening someone and attempting to carry it out.  The hate mail to me
seems to threaten me, though the writer watered it down enough to make it
ambiguous.

I didn't quite realize how hostile people could be about these topics either
till this last weekend. Years ago back when the web was new, I used to enjoy
going to IRC and getting on #philosophy channel and listening to the debate,
and jumping in myself having a great time. It was wonderful. Well, I went
back and when I got on the channel again, there was a strange silence that
went on many mins. I then tried to spur things on by trying to discuss the
recent AI developments I knew about. At once, I was attacked by people...
Not with arguments, but completely unexpected responses, most saying "go
away", "this was stupid", "machines suck" (and this is candy coating a lot
of it). I found one single person in the channel that seemed to even
approach the subject so me and him/her chatted away a few while the rest of
the people took shots at me. The conversation led into more generalized
technological developments and as soon as I mentioned the recent time travel
possibility that just popped up, I was immediately disconnected by the Op
and BANNED!!! Have things gone so far that the average person cant stand to
even hear a potential breakthrough?! Or should I just chalk this up as the
unwashed masses have finally arrived and I was just expecting a bit more
from them? I can see this coming from a channel like #hottub or #partyzone,
but I get this response from the great intellectuals on the #philosophy
channel? What do we do with all these crazy people!!!!?

Monty lists "computers" under hobbies, then the next line says he
doesn't have a computer.  Notice that he also lists "friends"
under hobbies...

Actually the fact that it sounds strange leads me to believe Keith
really did say it.  It sounds a lot like him in places, especially
near the end of the interview.  Our world would be a much duller
place without guys like Keith to stir the pot.  {8^D  spike

This is something Ive pondered often since I read my great grandmother's
diary.  She wrote entries nearly every day, but what caught my eye was
an entry she made in on 24 October 1929, since it did not mention the
stock market crash.  The collapse was in a sense a social microsingularity,
in that everything changed on that day.

Repercussions from that event would ripple thru the world leaving no
one untouched, but my great grandmother, who was raising her children
and helping run a farm, did not mention it then or in any of the following
several weeks.  The news gradually filtered down that something really
bad had happened, and that prices would be hurt (lowered).

We discuss the AI version of the Singularity, yet much of this world
still has never even seen a computer, and at least at the time would
fail to notice if an AI, friendly or otherwise, suddenly took over
everything.  spike

Yes, you experienced culture shock, because the IRC rooms tend to be composed 
of snerts (sniveling nasty egotistical repulsive teenagers).  The bad thing 
about IRC in my opinion, is the silence, as the kiddies come into rooms to 
meet, and end up in private message land.

AOL, one can meet birds of a feather, at least, but is surely, not worth the 
mention for most on this, and many other lists. Yahoo, is as vicious as 
anything on IRC, yet the ignore feature, works wonderfully.

I have yet to ever see a chatroom that is rigorously, intellectual, or 
informed, in general. Extropianism has not yet captured the intelligentsia, 
quite yet, nor have grass roots rooms fared well. This may take more time and 
much more effort. Perhaps, someone here can open up an IRC chat or one on 
Yahoo, to fill the bill? People are busy, so keeping such a room sustained 
might still be difficult. Perhaps we might consider "mini" Extropian 
conventions, online, in our own chats? People "know" each other from emails 
and conventions; perhaps doing an online chat 1 or 2 times per month, on 
weekends, is workable? Or maybe not. I shall let the leaders lead.

Eris Free Net #philosophy? Was a couple times myself there. (I even have an

Naw, some of the few regulars there are worth talking to. Before anyone
wants to check it out: don't do it. It's not worth even a minute of your time.

I'm not sure whether you realize how abusive current IRC culture (well, okay)
is. I'm not sure whether this always was so, I remember checking out IRC
at about a time when SGI Indys were pretty new, and immediately leaving in
disgust. What an awful waste of human life.

As a newbie, or a supposed newbie one is expected to join quietly, sit
there and listen to the Great Ones (even if the current Great Ones consist
of a couple of 11 year old channel ops who're waiting for an excuse to exercise
their newly won or hijacked 4wsum p0wrz), and then go through the usual 
hazing and grovelling act.

Even if you're a regular, there's often a flurry of bans and kickbans
going on. Gossips, remote love affairs which surprisingly frequently 
go physical space, attacks, channel takeovers, remote exploits, DoS, etc.

In other words, plenty of monkey business. Sociologists would be in
hog heaven. I've never ran into some, though, maybe they were among
the few iron lurkers.

However, quite a few of the channels are veritable pockets of civility
(ironly enforced by the local vigilante posse, and unaccessibility of the topic
to the average IRC luser).

No, and in fact going through the usual motions one can get people talking
pretty quickly, but it is awfully mindnumbing. Don't do it, unless
one is handicapped and limited to this mode of communication (then, IRC
can be a remarkably good idea, it's the modern (well, not so modern,
the vogue now seems to be instant messaging and SMS) equivalent of citizens
band radio and HAM).

Great intellectuals on an IRC channel? IRC was never great even when
it was invented. It only went downhill since.

Strange? Fucking brilliant, and remarkably gutsy. I bet he's having shitloads
of fun, too. I hope I ever run into him, so I can shake his hand a buy him

"Kick ass"? And how.

On the run from L. Ron Hubbard

Keith Henson, Scientology gadfly turned fugitive from justice,
explains his reasons for fleeing the United States.

- - - - - - - - - - - -
By Damien Cave

May 23, 2001 | Keith Henson is waging a one-man crusade against
Scientology. Arguing that the church threatens to undermine the First
Amendment by suing opponents into submission, he has fought the house
that L. Ron Hubbard built at every turn. Since 1995, when the church
first angered Net users by trying to close down a newsgroup dedicated
to discussing Scientology's practices, he has posted documents that
the church considers secret on the Web, picketed the church's
headquarters and defended his actions in court.

Just last month, the California Superior Court in Riverside County
handed Henson a major defeat. Citing Henson's picketing in front of
Riverside's Golden Era Productions (a sound and film studio for the
Church of Scientology) last summer and messages he posted in a
Scientology newsgroup, the court found Henson guilty of violating the
state's hate-crimes law. His demonstrations, the court ruled,
interfered with Scientologists' constitutional right to religious
freedom.

Online critics of Scientology, and some free-speech advocates,
responded to the decision with outrage, calling Henson "an American
hero." His conviction, they said, was nothing less than a "miscarriage
of justice," as one poster at geek site Slashdot put it. Others called
Henson "a martyr."

Meanwhile, Henson's tactics have often seemed a bit quixotic -- even
his supporters say that he tends to act without thinking.  They
question, for example, the wisdom of Henson's two-line contribution to
a thread in the alt.religion.scientology newsgroup about directing a
nuclear missile at church members. Henson contends that his post
implied no real threat to Scientology members and that it was merely a
response to another post in a long-running joke about "Cruise" (as in
Scientology celeb Tom) missiles.

Still, it was an odd move for someone ostensibly dedicated to serious
critique, and it brought an immediate outcry from
Scientologists. "Free speech does not protect threats of mass
destruction," said Scientology spokesman Ken Hoden. "It does not
protect threats of missile attacks. It does not protect what he
did. He's trying to hide behind the First Amendment."

David Touretzky, a Carnegie Mellon computer scientist and fellow
Scientology gadfly, says that Henson tends to incriminate himself in
his encounters with Scientologists -- often providing church officials
with legal ammunition they later use against him.

Henson's legal strategy has been criticized as well. Cindy Cohn, legal
director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says that Henson
refused to let the civil liberties nonprofit represent him, choosing
instead to have a court-appointed attorney. Henson contests Cohn's
claim -- "I've never been offered help from the EFF," he says -- but
just last week, he once again confounded his fans by failing to show
up at his sentencing hearing, where he could have been sent to jail
for a year.

So where is Keith Henson and what is he up to? In a telephone
interview from Canada -- where he's applying for political asylum --
Henson explained why he played hooky from the hearing and what he
hopes to achieve by moving his case forward from abroad.

You're now a fugitive from justice -- why?

I actually came up here for a different reason. I came up here to
picket for another cause. But while I was here, a bunch of people were
trolling on the Net, talking about my coming up here as a political
refugee. And there was so much trolling and so much interest that we
said, "Why not?" So I stayed over an extra day and we checked with
Guidy Mamann, who is apparently a top immigration lawyer in Canada. We
chatted for a while, and I filled out the paperwork. He fired up a Web
browser, found some stories and said this was a viable case. So I blew
off [the California court] and I've already paid [Mamann] a retainer
to deal with this from up here.

Why not stay and fight from the States?

Well, I would have gotten a certain amount of PR and done a certain
amount of damage to [the church] had I gone back and gone to jail
there. But there's a justification for being here. In spite of the
fact that there's more risk and that it generates even more criminal
problems for me, nonetheless, being here has the potential to generate
more heat on Scientology.

Have you been in touch with the American courts?

Oh yeah, I talked to the probation guy down there this morning
[Thursday]. I just updated him on where I was and what was going
on. He didn't have much to say.

You seem to enjoy being a martyr for the cause.

Other people hold me up as a martyr. I'm not a martyr; I just kick
ass.

But it must feel good to be in the spotlight. How much of what you're
doing has to do with the a desire for attention?

It's a minor factor. The social strokes are reward for doing good
stuff -- I wouldn't deny that. People work hard to get the Nobel
Prize. I'm not going to get the Nobel Prize. I'm not going to get any
kind of prize. But I'm a known person because I've been involved with
this stuff for a long time.

How much have you spent on your case?

I've spent about $35,000.

How long do you plan to stay in Canada?

Forever. If the U.S. government decides that what I did was not within
the framework of free speech, if the [U.S.] State Department supports
the government of Riverside County in what I'm arguing is an abuse of
human rights, then I ain't going back.

So what happens next?

Well, there's going to be a review of the situation. Because when you
apply for refugee status on the basis of human rights, your lawyer is
your advocate and the Canadian government is your opposition.

An immigration review board adjudicates this thing. And in order to do
this, by treaty and custom, the Canadian [authorities] go to the State
Department. They have to go in and investigate, and come up with the
transcripts and motions and all of that.  They need it in order to
defend themselves, to prove that what went on was a fair and unbiased
problem.

So the State Department sometimes does this [itself], and at other
times [it has] the Justice Department do it. But I suspect that when
they start doing this thing -- and they realize that there were severe
violations of protocol -- what may well happen is that they may march
through Riverside County, Calif., and deal with [the church].

What's the goal of your efforts?

The ultimate goal is to reform or completely destroy Scientology.
It's completely undemocratic.

Do you feel like you're getting anywhere with this, in the big
picture?

Oh yes, yes indeed. This is the endgame. I don't know whether we're
years away or months away or even weeks away. But the problems that
Scientology has at this time are legion. Let's put it this way: a
[Scientology] event that for years had been attended at a fairly high
level had 40 percent of the people show up that they expected.

Where'd you get that number?

>From people who were there. We have spies with Scientology --
disaffected Scientologists -- all over the country.

It all sounds so cloak-and-dagger.

Oh, it's definitely that. For example, we think there's a pretty fair
chance that Scientology will try to do a snatch-and-grab situation up
here, where they come after me.

Are you saying that you're afraid you'll be kidnapped?

Sure.

So are you just staying at that same house -- the one where you're
talking from?

No. I'll be living at a number of safe houses here. I'm also taking
perhaps as [much] as a billion dollars of electronics work out of
California.

Are you talking about a business that's already established in
California?

No, it's a huge development project, a huge development and production
project. But I'm not going to go into detail about it.  You'll find
out. If it works, you'll find out about it shortly.

Since when are you the kind of person who protects secrets?

OK, I'll give you this. Let's just call it a billion-dollar-scale,
cryptic stealth surveillance technology. That'll keep them guessing.

I dunno 'bout you, but to me the guy comes off as arrogant and not 
very bright in the way he's presenting himself. He's also most likely 
in for a rude surprise if he thinks the US justice system is going to 
entertain the vaguest notion of declaring his prosecution unwarranted 
in his absence; they want you there to have the cuffs slapped on if 
the decision goes the other way. Furthermore, even if he's found 
completely blameless on the original charges, he's still guilty of 
flight.

Quirk of the law.

Now I may be proven wrong, and I hope I am--but I've a pretty good 
idea whose ass is going to kicked here when the dust has settled.

And it ain't the Church's.

Now I wonder if his snatch-and-grab comment is a prelude to a 
prearranged vanishing act...

Daniel,

>I'm also a lot more afraid of someone
>threatening someone and attempting to carry it out.

To be on the quasi-safe side anyway, I suggest removing home address/phone
from Web pages, if you haven't, already.

I realized how vulnerable I was, a couple years ago when a German
forrester wanted my help with a wavelets project, he went to my
Web pages and retrieved my home address and showed up on my doorstep. I
was away in the U.S. at the time. I came back two weeks later to a letter
in my mailbox, which my landlords said he wrote with their help (he told
them he was a friend of mine). Annoying. I don't think he was a threat,
but I lived at that time in a house that wasn't marked with numbers and
in a very remote and tiny village, 10km from Heidelberg, so I know that
he went to a lot of trouble to locate me.  Since that time, I don't
have home numbers at my Web pages.

Ever since I moved here, I've wanted to have a non-Institute
contact address, for consulting work,  but services like
"Mailboxes Etc." don't exist in this country (Germany). If any Germans
here have a suggestion for mailboxes to rent, I'd be interested to
know about it.

Hi Buzz,

There's a sociobiological basis for beauty, but no purely sociological basis
for it, because sociology derives from biology and is influenced by
environmental factors such as food, climate, geology, etc. The cascade of
interactions among molecular biological influences (including the effects of
shared psychoactive chemicals), social transactions, memetics, and
neurological changes resulting from cognitive imprinting (conditioning), make
complex adaptive systems (including humans) subject to evolutionary
developments determined by their entire past histories, especially their
genetic record. In short, one does not admire people because they are
beautiful; people are beautiful because one is genetically predisposed to
admire them.

"I have never seen such an ugly woman," says the Bushman, commenting on
stereotypical beautiful blonde in The Gods Must Be Crazy. Genetic
predisposition or cultural conditioning? Neither! It was a joke. The Bushman
was preoccupied with other matters and not feeling the least bit horny, that's
all. In real life people are attracted to what their genes determine, despite
heroic (or cowardly, depending on how you look at it) efforts to modify and
curtail this behavior. For example, religious fanatics have tried for
millennia to diminish (if not abolish) human sexuality. Some people (Marx and
Freud for instance) have constructed elaborate belief systems to transcend
what they consider biological determinism. IMO, a more practical approach
would transcend biology by genetic engineering (rather than by denying the
biological basis of moral and aesthetic preferences).

Mundane humans may find the borg repulsive not because of cultural training,
but because the borg has modified its genetic structure and content. Knowing
this allows us to avoid wasting time trying to convert congenital luddites.
It's not a question that yields to reason, because people believe what they
want to believe, which is what they're genetically predisposed to believe.
IOW, some of us are biologically programmed to want to transcend biology. Or
as Edward O. Wilson put it in Consilience, The Unity of Knowledge, "Homo
sapiens, the first truly free species, is about to decommission natural
selection, the force that made us.... Soon we must look deep within ourselves
and decide what we wish to become."

Building on the convergence of human biology with its artifacts, Ray Kurzweil
points out, "An evolutionary process accelerates because it builds on its own
means for further evolution. Humans have beaten evolution. We are creating
intelligent entities in considerably less time than it took the evolutionary
process that created us. Human intelligence--a product of evolution--has
transcended it. So, too, the intelligence that we are now creating in
computers will soon exceed the intelligence of its creators."

Emlyn <emlyn@one.net.au> uplifted the signal by summarizing:
"There's the intelligence augmentation approach, where we add things to our
heads to make ourselves smarter, and those things allow us to conceive more
mods to make which will make us smarter still, loop. Note that this could be
biotech/nanotech enhancements, resulting in a purely biological being,
rather than the traditional cyborg concept."

To which I'd add that the traditional cyborg concept doesn't remain
traditional for long when biotech accelerates biological evolution. I'm not
the first to envision a future in which nanobots (or suitable gene modifying
carriers) injected into a chimpanzee alter the 3% genetic material which
separates the hairy ape from the naked one, so that Mr. Hyde (the chimp)
morphs into Dr. Jekyll (the homo sap). Similarly, a super sapient cyborg could
evolve *overnight* from an ordinary human.

What's the difference whether posthumans emerge from biologically transformed
humans or from Kurzweillian machine intelligence? Either approach affords
ample opportunity to reinstate the heritage of genealogical memories and
social identities that some of us would like to preserve (and some of us would
like to discard). It seems to me those who'd like to jettison the cultural
baggage of the past have a slight advantage due to their willingness to try
something entirely new and physically different. But first we need to
understand in minute detail how our genes got us where we are. Otherwise we
may go from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde, causing irreparable damage along the way.
Furthermore, we have no evidence that the AI path leads anywhere that we can
follow. Hyper-accelerated bio-evolution, in contrast, simply takes a proven
methodology and speeds it up so that we remain incarnate, although out of
control (in the Kevin Kelly sense of "out of control" -- meaning that our
future selves will decide how we will evolve in the future). Or as one wag has
written, "Inside every older person is a younger person wondering what the
hell happened."

You are confusing the medium with the message.  All those nifty webpages and
postings you reference are being created by humans for humans.  The fact
that you go through Google to access them doesn't mean that Google is
processing this knowledge.

Next, you'll be telling me that your TV knows what is happening around the
world, that your CD player is a great musician, or that your phone does a
great impersonation of your friends.  You don't think that the card catalog
at your local library has read all those books, do you?

These are transmission devices and puppets only.  They have nothing to do
with the knowledge being transferred through them.

You are exactly right.  This is why I think many of our predictions are way
too optimistic.  Most of us practically live in the laboratory, where we see
advances every day.  But these advances are really just demonstrations of
possibilities.  They may or may not actually change the world as expected.

Hello everyone,

I will be definitely attending Extro-5.  :)  But, I have not been outside of Alaska for over a decade(I am thirty-four) and have never been to California.  I have just heard a lot of strange stories about the place! lol

I want to take full advantage of the time I am down there.  I just am not sure how to get by in a place like San Jose with a minimum of money.  On the other hand, for me to be in the continental United States(I'm from Anchorage, Alaska) just for the Extro would be almost criminal.  So, if any of you could offer me advice, a garage to sleep in for a few days after the conference or anything else I would be very grateful.

sincerely,

John

Jerry Oneill, stated in his book 2081 (published 1981) 
"Its worth noting that Thompson echoed some of Haldane's earlier errors by 
overestimating the need for scientific breakthrough and underestimating how 
much could be accomplished by a straightforward extension of known technology"

I suspect that this might apply to the rest of human endeavors--how to best 
capitalize and utilize breakthroughs, rather then let them gather dust, in a 
scientific journal?

Yeah, I feel the same way about newscasters and anchorpersons on TV.
Google.com beats the broadcast network by a wide margin.

Of course this knowledge comes to me compliments of transmission devices (aka
neurons) and puppets (learned language), so it has nothing to do with the
knowledge being transferred through brain cells.

I think this points to what I like to think of as the diffraction or
spread of humanity during the singularity...

As the stress and impact of technology pulls the fabric of society
apart, you begin to see the diffraction of the various levels of
humanity in the context of technological impact... This is analagous
to the impact of tidal force pulling something apart as it enters a
black hole... and eventually it get's ripped into a stream of strings...

So the scientist augments first, then the business man, then the
American dirt farmer, then the Nirobi slum dweller, and finally the
Tibetan goat herder... As the impact of the technology amplifies
the difference, the breadth of the gap between haves and have
nots... the span between those who enter the event horizon of
the singularity first and last will expand exponentially.

I see our predictions as neither optimistic or pessimistic... I see
them as pure fantasy. We are over the event horizon of the future
that was predictable from 1970. 10 years ahead from now is just
as far from our perspective of evolution as 30 years back was. In
fact it may be more like 50 years back. 10 years from now we'll
be working with technology that so dwarfs what we currently
use, that it makes almost no sense to try to guess. IBM is selling
fairy dust today... Japan will sell crystal storage tomorrow... the
HAL box will begin to bring meaningful AI capable hardware to
your desk top next year... A company in Chicago has built and is
marketing a holographic molecular manipulator... self assembling
MEMs are slated for imminent production.

Folks... smell the coffee... this is all stuff that is happening NOW!
Genomics is here. The protein analysis of the human genome is
slated to take 3 years. This is stuff that 10 years ago people were
predicting would take 50 years. The time for picking your seat on
the bus is getting SHORT. Of course those of you who are now
reading this are probably in the right place. The only question that
matters is what responsibility do we have to the rest of our species
and how are we going to get them all lined up for what's coming?

First rule of singularities... is you can't predict what will happen...
The FM component just get's to great... (FM = Friggin Magic).

The only thing that makes sense is bringing as much sanity to the
conversation as possible (which inherently means checking egos
at the door, and letting go of survival behavior.) AND doing what
ever it takes to persuade the world cultures in embracing the great
possibility of their own evolution.

Uh, no. Other questions persist...
How are we going to get them to stay out of the way...
and how are we going to deal with actual microsingularities...
and how are we going to initiate an actual evolutionary phase transition.

Google responds to me; it reflects my questions back at me in the form of
answers.

Newscasters babble on about whatever entertainment has replaced real news
on that particular day.

There is no comparison.

Google is the source of all knowledge.
The Bayesian Probability Theorem is the source of all truth.
It is disastrous to confuse the two.

Anyone want to found a cult of Google worshippers?  Neither "google cult"
nor "google worshippers" turns up anything, so there's clearly a niche.

*Shrug*.  The kind of Singularity SIAI deals with isn't exactly subtle.  I
don't expect a Friendly nanotech-equipped superintelligence to notice the
pieces of green paper you seem to think are prerequisite to
participation.  I expect that the world's last few tribes of
hunter-gatherers will join the transhuman club the same day I do.

Just for the record, for those of you who aren't aware, there's a
significant faction that regards the whole Slow Singularity scenario as
being, well, silly.

Slow augmentation through expensive BCI implants may respect cultural
differences.  Over at SIAI, well, those of you who have read Greg Egan can
think of it as the "Introdus wavefront".

Surely you don't fear that the Net may do more than merely transmit
information...
That would imply a sinister overestimation of the Net's cyber-capabilities.
The Net deleting porno sounds like the stretch of the age. More likely it
would delete users who fail to download sufficient quantities of XXX material.
As for spell-checking and political correctitude, who cares, as long as we
still know what each of us means to say.

Yes, I see your point. Isn't one group enforcing their will onto another group
what the Democrats and Socialists and Big Government are all about. So, if you
don't want your Visual Basic automatically updated and debugged by Mr. Bill,
then try a different computer language that any number of  list members may
prescribe, or become one of Mr. Bill's decision makers.

One group enforcing their will onto another group is what *all* human
politics is about, except in very rare and very precious cases.  It
understates the scope of the problem to focus your dislike on a few
prominent archetypes, and certainly the Republicans are every bit as much
within the circle of human politics as the Democrats.

Why do you suppose a Friendly nanotech-equipped superintelligence would fail

A French Canadian program on cloning was shown on Oz TV a few days ago,
CLONE, INC. Made in 1999, I think, hence full of David Seed's now forgotten
posturing; and a bunch of Raelians including Rael the UFO abductee in his
Raymond Massey THINGS TO COME wide samurai shoulders space suit, and other
world experts in deep thought. I especially detested a woman psychoanalyst
who did the full French *differance* word salad thing, except that this
time she was dead set against difference. It would destroy generational
time, alors! The predictable category mistakes in abundance; the desire for
immortality is a phallic phantasy, rising from the dead, thrusting into the
future, sort of thing (actually I don't recall her saying anything as
coherent as that). It's very strange to watch: I don't like X, it makes me
feel weird, so hey, it must be an example of displaced shit-eating or
murderous rage against the father etc. Never the slightest hint that this
applies equally to catching a tram, or getting a tooth filled, or having a
haircut. Of course hardcore Lacanians and the like *do* apply the same
gratuitous gibberish to such everyday activities, and seem pleased as punch
even though everything then factors back to zero. Sigh.

Quite so. Please excuse the error of omission. Republicans do have their own
brand of oppression to peddle. Compared to Republicans, Linux worms seem

>From the May 24, 2001 edition of the Globe and Mail newspaper:

Dog hit by mail truck claws way out of grave.

Park Hills, Mo. A small black dog that was hit by a mail-delivery
truck and presumed dead defied death twice - first by surviving
the accident and then by digging itself out of a grave.
    Sprawled near a mailbox Monday, Sweetie seemed lifeless to
owner Glenda Stevens. Futilely seeking a heartbeat, she assumed
Sweetie was dead and dug a grave in which to bury her beloved
pet. Hours later, she saw Sweetie's hind legs sticking out of the
ground. The dog was digging itself out.
    Sweetie suffered a broken front leg and a broken jaw. AP

(Aiiiiiii, yipes!)  What ... straight?  No chaser?  Before some of you more
sensitive types delve into Ayn and Art and Aesthetics and Dialectics, I
recommend some antidotes which I have found to be very effective in the
past - here, for example, is one such antidote in the form of a few Andy
Warhol quotes.  Even when used sparingly, the quotes below will offer
instant relief. (A little negative space here, a little contrast there ...
aaaahhhhhhhhh! ... don't you feel better already?)

"I don't think my art has any lasting value."
"If everybody's not a beauty, then nobody is."
"I voted once, in the fifties. I don't remember which election. I pulled the
wrong lever because I was confused. I couldn't figure out how to work the
thing. There was no practice model outside."
"If I'd gone ahead and died, I would be a cult figure now."
"I don't know where the artificial stops and the real begins."
"They're experimental films. I call them that because I don't know what I'm
doing."
"Wasted space is any space that has art in it."
"I never wanted to be a painter. I wanted to be a tap dancer."
"Pop art is for everyone. I don't think art should be only for the select
few, I think it should be for the mass of American people, and they usually
accept art anyway."
"I really like comic strips... Well, I like the colours and the balloons. I
think people should always talk with balloons over their heads."
"If you look at something long enough, I've discovered, the meaning goes
away."
"You'd be surprised how many people want to hang an electric chair on their
living-room wall. Specially if the background colour matches the drapes."
"The less something has to say, the more perfect it is."
"Intellectuals are a bore."
"I read an article on me once that described my machine-method of
silk-screen copying and painting- 'What a bold and audacious solution, what
depths of the man are revealed in this solution!' What does that mean?"
"If I weren't me, I think I'd like to be Jackie Kennedy. She's a very
glamorous woman, and I'd really like to learn some of her judo techniques."

Hmmm, cloning, Raelians.  We need to figure out a way to make
cloning and cryonics to be considered religious notions.  Then anyone who
opposed these ideas would be guilty of violating our civil rights!  We
could cite the case against Keith Henson as a precedent, and threaten
to sue or prosecute anyone who takes any action to oppose either
cloning or cryonics, or cryonic suspension before natural death,
in cases where the victim has a brain-destroying condition.  spike

Sure, but, can we envisage an internet experience that is more personal?
Eventually, the internet may be aware of the subtleties of our browsing habits.
Sorry, if i joined this thread late, but has anyone mentioned the interesting
article from Scientific American "Semantic Web?"  It's a discussion of the
future of web-searching wherein more advanced searches "know" what we mean when
we are searching for something.

Search engines can be more active entities than is commonly thought. First, 
the crawler part could presumably be extended so that the engine searches for 
information it somehow discovers is lacking (many requests for certain terms 
that give low relevance ratios). Especially with the semantic web things turn 
interesting here. Second, the internal representations of search terms, URLs 
and their interrelations could very well be seen as a knowledge base of 
sorts, which could be used to control actions of agents. Beside the usual 
request for information about something, the system could have alerting 
services for new interesting information or certain changes in the knowledge 
base.

I would definitely join it. Do we get to have odd titles too, like "Grand

Well, I am offline right now so can only post occasionally. I've been sort of scanning
the responses and wondering if I wanted to post something, but Samantha has pretty much
said it for me.

The entire root of my pessimism, is that I feel that while we may well be
technologically sophisticated, culturally we are still horribly tribal, and it is
*politics* that will kill us off, not technology.  So, unless we sort out who we are,
we re doomed. Discussing technologies is just a detour, when it is people who get
grumpy and push buttons, fire guns, stab people etc.

Psychology is the issue, not technology.

You forget that the "eye" was built by the genes.

Mortimer Adler has some interesting things to say about this in his
book "How to think about the great ideas."

A forum exists, say you?
Let's have at them, then!
As support for the battle for Extropian ideals, I offer you all these 
following inspirational quotes (crafted by my ownself) to lead all of you 
Extropians into battle against The Infidel:


I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat. . . . You ask, 
what is the Extropian policy? I will say: It is to wage war, by sea, land, 
and air, and on every forum on the Net, with all our might and with all the 
strength God can give us. . . . You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in 
one word: It is Victory.

Never give in - never, never, never, never, in nothing great or small, large 
or petty, never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense. 
Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of 
the enemy.


Once we have a war there is only one thing to do. It must be won. For defeat 
brings worse things than any that can ever happen in war. .

Go forward until the last round is fired and the last drop of gas is 
expended...then go forward on foot!

Strength lies not in defense but in attack.

Cry 'Havoc' and let slip the dogs of War.

I only regret that I have but one life to lose for Extropianism.

Who Dares, Wins. Who Sweats, Wins. Who Plans, Wins!

Sure I am this day we are masters of our fate, that the task which has been 
set before us is not above our strength; that its pangs and toils are not 
beyond our endurance. As long as we have faith in our own cause and an 
unconquerable will to win, victory will not be denied us.

Cowards die many times before their deaths;
the valiant never taste death but once.

I have not yet begun to fight.

Fortune favors the brave.

Ask not what Extropianism can do for you;
ask what you can do for Extropianism....

In war there is no substitute for victory.

If I should die, think only this of me
That there's some corner of a foreign forum
That is forever Extropian....


Into battle, then!

Hmm, not to discourage your enthusiasm, but isn't this just the attitude the 
dossier disliked about us?

Isn't this fundamentally counter to the individualism and humanism of 
extropianism? The point is that we mainly want to become transhuman because 
it is good for us (and others, hopefully), not because it is some kind of 
higher goal?

True.  But I also believe that Republicans, the Religious Right and
Conservatism are also about enforcing their will onto another group.  I'm
not sure why people tend to promote one side or the other as being more
pro-freedom.  As far as I can tell, they both try to control me to follow
their agenda instead of letting me be free to choose my own way.  Although
this always feels better if the powers that be are closer in agreement to
your own viewpoints, the loss of freedom is just as real.

The Right promotes the Christian religion while the Left promotes the
new-age Gaia/Nature religion.  The right blocks freedom of speech about
sexual issues while the Left blocks freedom of speech about politically
incorrect issues.  The Right wants to control your body as far as sexual
orientation, drugs or reproduction is concerned, while the Left wants to
control your body as far as self-defense.  The Right pushes the NRA and Big
Oil rhetoric while the Left pushes psychobabble and social agendas.  The
Right wants to change our laws to promote isolationism, while the Left wants
to change our laws to promote the New World Order.  The Right wants to open
borders to business and close borders to immigrants, while the Left wants to
open borders to immigrants and close borders to business.  The Right wants
to increase budgets for the military sector while the left wants to increase
budgets for social programs.  The Right wants to cut taxes in ways that
might be skewed toward the rich while the Left wants to cut taxes in ways
that might be skewed toward the poor.

I don't see any difference in tactics, attitudes or power grabs.  Both major
American Parties are using the same underhanded tactics to take away freedom
from individuals.  The both are trying to manipulate the system in the same
way for the same agendas.  They just have different backers and lobbyists
promoting for different beneficiaries at the expense of personal freedom.

I do.  As a security consultant, I help my clients block Microsoft
interference to their internal operations, just as I try to block hackers,
disgruntled employees, industrial spies, and anybody else who would tries to

I know that most people think the Republicans are for less government than
the Democrats, but I humbly disagree.  For the specific goals of gay rights,
drug rights (recreational drugs, smart drugs, life-extension drugs),
abortion rights, atheist rights, artistic expression rights, rights to
discuss/view sexual materials, etc., I see the Republicans as pushing Big
Brother Government control over my personal freedoms as much as the
Democrats stomp on other freedom issues.  Neither side is more pro-freedom
or pro-personal-rights.  They each just have a different list of rights they
will allow and disallow.  I wouldn't trust either side to make my personal
decisions for me.

A few folks here and elsewhere told me they noticed a
change in my online persona (didn't knew it was thus obvious)
since a few months.

I'm perfectly allright, in fact rarely been better. It's just
I've been assessing where I am, and where I should be, and 
realized I've been somewhat personally stagnating for a while. 
Especially because I'm a borderline flake, I decided lunatic 
fringe is perhaps not an entirely appropriate place for me 
to dwell too long. It sure is fun, but it doesn't get much 
done. Because of this I have decided to reshift priorities, 
and to see whether this will make me more productive in 
what I would like to do. It's going to hurt, but I will cut 
down my online feed to a minimum, to the technical bits 
I really need for my dayjob and the private projects (the 
biggest of them the nematode thingy -- hey, if there are 
Ph.D. position offerings for worm uploads (though not by 
such label) you know things are going to become interesting).

So I'm going to temporally drop a few lists, and switch from
pure push to pull on some high-volume ones. So I gotta run, be
back later. Have fun!

One way to make progress is to abandon incorrect beliefs.

The NRA isn't an inherently Republician organization, although many
members are conservative. In fact at least one democratic member of
I believe it was the Senate (Kansas?) was elected over his
expected rival because of NRA support.

The NRA's sole purpose is to support OUR rights under the Second
Amendment. Period.

Agreed.  There is nothing inherently Republican about gun rights, but most
Liberals aren't interested in protecting these rights.  Likewise, there is
nothing inherently Liberal about equal rights for women, gays and minorities
(i.e., everyone), but most Conservatives aren't interested in protecting
these rights.  The groupings into Right and Left issues really isn't helpful
in detecting pro-freedom or anti-freedom agendas.

Google is actually a human voting engine.  It keeps track of what you click
on and how fast you come back to try other things.  It ups the priority of
things that many people select, while it lowers the priority of things that
many people back out of.  Therefore, under each topic, you get what other
people seem to prefer when they use the same keywords you used.

It is a very effective mechanism for capturing human preferences.  The
people who visit the site are actually tuning the decisions made by the
machine.

LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE MAY 25 2001

IN THIS ISSUE, MAY 25, 2001:

LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE:  Further advances in resuscitation - AMA
briefing proposes cooling patients;

ANTIAGING RESEARCH FUNDED BY LIFE EXTENSION FOUNDATION; PROTOCOL:
Atherosclerosis;

FEATURED PRODUCTS OF THE WEEK:  No-flush Niacin, Artichoke Extract,

LIFE EXTENSION UPDATE EXCLUSIVE
Further resuscitation advancements: AMA briefing proposes cooling patients

At a Heart Disease Media Briefing held by the American Medical Association
on May 10, Lance B Becker, MD, Director of the Emergency Resuscitation
Research Center at the University of Chicago and Argonne National
Laboratory in Argonne Illinois, announced that cooling the heart and brain
of heart attack patients could prevent up to half of their fatalities.  Dr
Becker's research arose from his observation that restarting stopped
hearts may be effective if attempted within a few minutes of cardiac
arrest, but after a longer period reperfusion injury results.  Precursors
to free radicals build up in the heart and brain, and after resuscitation,
oxygen and nutrients are delivered to the tissues, resulting in a large
amount of damaging free radical activity.   Dr Becker commented,
"Restarting hearts is what I try to do every day in the emergency room and
it works fantastically well if it is accomplished in 3 to 4 minutes after
the patient collapses. But the patients we typically see are not so lucky
- they have had too long a time period without blood flow; about 90
percent of those patients die even after I've successfully restarted their
hearts. They die from an injury that is different than the cardiac arrest
that originally stopped the heart. We are just beginning to learn that the
cause of death appears to be a form of injury that is, in some part, due
to the way we resuscitate the person.  It appears that significant
additional damage takes place during the time when we rapidly reintroduce
oxygen and nutrients back into the cells and stimulate the heart to beat.
This is called reperfusion injury - and it may be possible to avoid this
and still eventually restart the heart. But we may need to give the heart
a rest."

That rest is accomplished by rapidly cooling the heart and brain.  One of
the treatments being developed puts patients into stasis, described as a
state of lowered heart rate and body function accomplished by decreasing
the core body temperature instead of immediately attempting to restart the
heart.  Artificial circulation is then maintained by a cardiac bypass
machine.  Allowing a regeneration period would permit a return to normal
physiology when the patient is rewarmed and the heart restarted, and
provide greater tissue recovery due to the cells being able to devote
their energy toward repair.

Dr Becker described the process: "A new technology for human cooling is
being developed at the University of Chicago and Argonne National
Laboratory based on a new phase-change microparticulate ice slurry
technology that looks promising at least in the theoretical sense.  One of
the coolant slurries we are working with is based on perfluorocarbon, a
liquid that can deliver oxygen to the lungs. .  . . We aim to make these
coolants biologically compatible and we have done some preliminary animal
testing which suggests we are on the right track.  In the future,
paramedics might administer this slurry coolant through a breathing tube
to patients in cardiac arrest to cool the heart and brain rapidly. If we
can introduce something cold and non-toxic into the lungs of sudden death
victims, then when you do cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the blood
cooled in the lungs is pumped first to the heart and then into brain."

"I predict that in the future we will simply not immediately restart the
heart when a person has suffered prolonged lack of blood flow. Instead,
our paramedics will rapidly cool patients and put them into a stasis
state. . . . Most importantly, with research funding these methods can be
developed right now and I cannot imagine how we can fail to invest in
science to save people's lives. We lose approximately 1,000 lives a day in
our country to sudden unexpected death, and the true tragedy is that with
the appropriate therapy, we could save around 50 percent of those people.
Right now our national survival rate is below 5 percent. We are all guilty
of tolerating a lot of unnecessary deaths."

ANTIAGING RESEARCH FUNDED BY LIFE EXTENSION FOUNDATION

Many people who need a heart transplant fail to receive one because there
is only a limited number of hearts available. One reason for this is the
limited time that a heart can remain viable after it is removed from the
donor. The Life Extension Foundation is funding two research projects at
the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York to develop better
methods of organ preservation so that more hearts will be available for
transplant. The Foundation is also funding similar research to improve
kidney preservation at 21st Century Medicine laboratory in Southern
California.

A breakthrough made at The Foundation's Critical Care Research laboratory
is an Automated Liquid Ventilation System that lowers whole-body
temperature extremely rapidly by introducing cooled liquid perflurocarbon
into the lungs without causing lasting injury. The kind of rapidly-induced
hypothermia that's possible with this liquid ventilation system could save
the lives of large numbers of people who suffer heart attacks, strokes or
severe closed head injuries. The system could also be used in-hospital to
give doctors extra time to perform heavy-duty surgical procedures without
risking permanent brain damage.

At The Foundation's 21st Century Medicine laboratory, advanced methods are
being developed to supercool and vitrify cells, tissues and organs for
medical uses, such as kidney, heart, cornea and liver transplantation. The
leader of this project is Dr. Gregory M. Fahy, the world's foremost
cryopreservation expert, who formerly worked in the American Red Cross
research laboratory in Maryland. Dr. Fahy and Dr. Brian Wowk are the
leading experts on ice control. Using research funding provided by The
Foundation, Drs. Fahy and Wowk have found agents that block the formation
of ice in concentrations as low as one part per million. The main goal of
this research is to demonstrate that it is possible to cool entire organs
to cryogenic temperatures, store them as long as may be desired, warm them
back up, and show that they can function properly in the body.

PROTOCOL
Atherosclerosis

Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of death and impairment in America
today. It is estimated that 1,100,000 new or recurrent coronary attacks
occur per year in America. It affects close to 60 million Americans. To
better place this disease in perspective, every 20 seconds a person in the
United States has a heart attack, and one third of these attacks lead to
death. Moreover, 50% of Americans have levels of cholesterol that place
them at high risk of coronary artery disease, and cholesterol is only one
factor that causes the occlusion of arteries that is technically known as
atherosclerosis.

The B vitamin niacin, also known as nicotinic acid, has been used for many
years in relatively high doses (e.g., 1 to 4.5 grams/day) as an
inexpensive treatment for hyperlipidemia, a condition characterized by
elevated blood levels of cholesterol and/ or triglycerides (fats). High
concentrations of these fatty compounds are associated with increased risk
of coronary heart disease (CHD). Recent research indicates that, in
addition to reducing cholesterol and triglyceride levels, nicotinic acid
treatment also significantly increases the concentration of high-density
lipoproteins (HDL), the "good" form of cholesterol associated with reduced
risk of CHD.

As early as 1939 scientists discovered that artichoke may have favorable
effects on arteriosclerosis and heart disease in general. Subsequent
studies in the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s supported the possible benefits of
artichoke extract. In a 1996 double-blind study conducted by Petrowicz,
the cholesterol-lowering effect of artichoke leaf extract was studied on
44 healthy individuals under strictly controlled conditions, resulting in
a significant decrease in cholesterol levels in those individuals who had
the highest starting levels of cholesterol, further documenting the
potential benefits of artichoke extract relative to lowering of
cholesterol.

This is something Ive wondered about.  If someone manages

There's enough computing power on the Internet right now - or, as Eugene
Leitl and Christine Peterson prefer to call it, "poorly defended"
computing power - for transhumanity.  You can get a custom DNA sequence
synthesized and an arbitrary DNA sequence turned into protein, so if you
can crack protein folding you can get drextech, in, oh, call it three or
four days with FedEx, or one or two days if you assume that the newborn
can spend millions of dollars without tipping anyone off.  That's the
slightly-but-not-extremely optimistic scenario, anyway.

So if someone created a seed AI right now, the computing infrastructure
would probably be (a) sufficient unto hard takeoff, superintelligence,
nanotech, etc., or (b) insufficient to do anything but hum around and not
have any significant effect on society.  Either way you don't get a Slow
Singularity.

FWIW I believe in the (relatively) "slow singularity."  Like every other 
intellectual development it will evolve (is evolving).  It will certainly 
develop on a pretty steep exponential curve so that, once it gets going, it 
will advance at a mind-numbing pace.  But it will be a curve nonetheless.  
In fact you can see the flat end of the curve even now, say, in the 
exponential increase in computing power per dollar and the occasional 
startling advance in MEMS enabling tech, etc.

I doubt that even those who regard the "slow singularity" scenario as silly 
(whoever that faction may be) expect us to leap from 20th Century tech to 
strong AI in the course of a day or two.  Now *that's* what I'd call silly.

Hurrhh...

This is so wrong, if I can use that word, that I'm not sure where to begin.
I really hope it's a satirical piece; is it? If so, it could have used a
smiley or two...

Let's see...

- There's a reference to God in there, implying divine sanction. Really...
- What are we waging war on, exactly? Why?
- Who are these infidels? How do they relate to the non-extropian mass of
humanity, with whom we would desperately like to have dialog about a
positive, realistic vision of the future?
- Never give in to anything? Without the space to compromise, to adapt, to
change stance, where is intelligence? You know, if we listen hard enough to
our detractors, we might even discover that we are not correct in all
things. True!
- "Once we have a war there is only one thing to do. It must be won. For
defeat
  brings worse things than any that can ever happen in war. ." - are you
sure about this?
- "Fortune favors the brave.".... that's just you tell people, when you need
to convince them to do something foolhardy. Those people tend to end up
lauded posthumously as heroes.
- etc etc

If it really was a joke, it's totally funny... good effort. Otherwise, it's
dodgy. Extropianism tends to read a bit cultish anyway... this would confirm
the worst fears about an irrational dogmatic group of fanatics. I like,
perhaps charitably, to think that we are anything but that. Remember all
that great stuff about a dynamic, optimistic, rational approach?

Well, there is a search engine that does that, but it's not Google. :-) Google ups the priority of a result based on the links to that page; see http://www.google.com/technology/ for more information. The links in Google's search results lead straight to the actual address of the page, without being redirected through Google first, so it has no means of keeping track of which links you visit. DirectHit, however, does what you're thinking of; see http://www.directhit.com/about/ for more information. The links in its search results are redirected through DirectHit, so that it can keep track of which are visited.

The term "slow" is not really what I was getting at.  AI will be plenty
fast as far as that goes, but we need to deal with other axes besides
speed and friendliness, such as ambition.  I can imagine a Singularity
that is fast enough to restructure existing computing hardware in a day,
and have the theoretical ability to do strong drextech, but be strangely
lacking in what we would call desire.  Like a chess program, the
Singularity might be perfectly content to just compute whatever it is
asked to compute.  It may have no ambition to upload humans or
expand itself in ways that seem so natural to species which prospered
by successfully  competing for survival.  An AI that arose in such a
manner might have no survival instinct, no urge to preserve itself, a trait
which is universal in species that evolved by natural selection.

An AI might invent itself in such a way that is neither friendly nor
unfriendly to humans, but rather indifferent.  An AI *might* invent
itself in such a way that it really doesn't *want* to rule to universe,
even if it could.  spike

A Friendly AI will have the ambition to be Friendly.  An unFriendly AI
will have supergoals which, if they remotely resemble what we regard as
normative cognition, will express themselves in an attempt to fulfill the
supergoal maximally.  Either way you get what we would call "ambition".  I
see no particular reason to speculate "lack of ambition" - I don't see any
emergent forces producing it, I don't see anyone attempting to design it
deliberately, and I don't see any way it *could* be designed in
deliberately for normative goal reasoning.

Perhaps.  Or perhaps individual computational devices
should/could be seen as merely nodes in an extended
computational substrate.  Many of the things that we here dream
about require or can be usefully archtected in whole or part as
various types of agents that move from machine to machine or
span multiple machines.  

Now, the owners of the machines should have say in what is and
is not on their machines.  But that say in the best of cases is
limited by the time and ability to understand and evaluate
various configurations supporting various software and by the
ability to communicate the relevant information.  I expect that
a computational ecology will evolve various types of
cyber-organisms, malignant and benevolent, over time with and
without the owners consent.  

Also, I suspect the line between boxen I own and the general
cyber environment will become increasingly blurry as we head
toward ubiquitious computing.

The answer should include using existing sources that we shunted
aside for often silly reasons.  Yes, I'm talking about nuclear
power. There are many alternate nuclear plant designs that
overcome many of the downsides (although these were vastly
overplayed) of conventional nuclear power generation plants. 
But in todays climate you can't get them built and operational
or built without so many beyond all reason constraints and
layers of redundant backups as to make them utterly
uneconomical.  

Stupid operational and governmental policies aside (Chernobyl),
nuclear power is far and away safer and more able to fulfill our
energy needs now and for the reasonably forseeable future.

Conservation is a ridiculous "answer".  It is not workable.

I care because it is a country and other human beings being
destroyed.  I don't believe humanness ends at the border or that
a countries rulers can not and should not be questioned just
because I am not in that country.

Just as humanness does not stop at the incremental boarders of
transhumanity.  In fact, it seems to me that transhumanity might be a bit
more humane by degrees of enhanced intelligence.

John McCarthy wrote about progress: "Humanity has progressed over hundreds
of thousands of years, but until about the seventeenth century, progress
was a rare event. There were novelties but a person would not expect a
whole sequence of improvements in his lifetime. Since then scientific
progress has been continual, and in the advanced parts of the world, there
has also been continued technological progress. Therefore, people no longer
expect the world to remain the same as it is."

When we think of progress, we remember the Enlightenment.  When we look
back at  Transhumanity, we will think of the progress of progress.  What
does this mean to you?

All comments welcome.

If a human runs at 10^16+ ops and the net is ~10^9 (ops) x 10^10 machines
you have to argue that 1 in 1000 machines are (a) connected to the net
(not! most are behind firewalls) and (b) are vulnerable.  I've been
bitten once and subsequently several of my machines went behind the lines.
So they exist but I doubt you can get to them.  If I'm typical you can't
claim the net is "poorly defended" (and I focus much less attention on
security than most corporations).

Even if the net is equal to 1 human equivalent -- that doesn't let you
evolve rapidly because humans don't have any idea how to comprehend
themselves currently or self-evolve.  You don't have the excess capacity
to make copies and prune the non-successful variants.  You can argue
that we may get there at some point in the future but I would object
to the statement that "we are there now".  (So we are in "slow" evolution
mode now even from the most optimistic perspectives.)

Aha, precisely the point -- you have to have something smart enough to
play "who wants to be a millionaire" without giving itself away.  Its
doubtful that we are there yet so at best they self-evolve only very
slowly and have to save their pennies before you can transform that
into something real.

Same point.  Either a seed AI eats the Internet and explodes into
superintelligence, or nothing much happens in the way of Singularity, Slow
or not.

To me, the progress of progess means the adaptation of nonlinear models of
development.  The Englightenment, and mostly the Industrial Revolution,
pursued the quest of "faster, stronger, cheaper, more" for its processes.
This was the result of a Newtonian-Cartesian perspective of the world based
on mechanistic reductionism.  With the advent of complex systems theory, a
new perspective sprung from concepts like integration, interactions,
networks, and chaos.  Progress then embodies not a linear path, but an
expansive exploration of interrelated systems.

It seems there is much progress of both types underway.  Linear progress of
engineering methods lends itself to immediate applicability.  Non-linear
progress at the basic science level, however, opens the way to a paradigm
shift with more far-reaching consequences.

One obvious area for non-linear progress to be made in cognitive
neuroscience.  This is not about making something smaller, faster, or
better.  It's about understanding the complex networks of structure and
function underlying our conscious experience.

Another exciting area for paradigmatic progress is the understanding of the
fundamental nature of the Universe.  I believe Superstring/Hyperstring (can
anyone tell me if these are the same, or how they differ?) theory, is an
example of a current paradigm shift in this realm.  Recent evidence showed
us to be lacking a complete understanding of the mechanics of gravity (let
alone its nature).

LigoCyte has developed a synthetically engirneered virus-sized particle,
consisting of a polymerized liposome on which antigens can be presented and
oriented and used for adhesion, targeting and to provoke an immune response.
A schematic reapresentation of this nanotechnology is available at
http://ligocyte.com/nanoX.html
The nanoparticle assemblies are superior to other platforms for several
reasons: 1) the spherical assemblies are easy to synthesize and very stable;
2) the structures are fairly rigid, not suffering from folding uncertainties
associated with soluble linear or branched chain polymers; 3) unlike
conventional bilayer liposomes, they are inert with regard to random fusion
with themselves or other membranes; 4) the surface character, in terms of
charge and molecular makeup, is easily varied because the polymer backbone
tolerates nearly any appended molecule in a wide range of ratios.
LigoCyte is aggressively developing the nanoparticle delivery platform for use
in the areas of anti-inflammatories and anti-infectives. Inhibition of
lymphocyte binding has already been demonstrated with remarkable avidity. Work
is in progress to assemble new ligands designed to inhibit adhesion of
pathogens to cells and to bind to pathogen-derived toxins for anti-viral,
anti-bacterial or anti-fungal applications. The LigoCyte nanoparticles are
even capable of functioning as macromolecule assemblies of antigens for
effective vaccine development, allowing the inclusion of targeting molecules
(like LigoCyte's M cell targeting protein) into the array of surface ligands.

This does not follow, and it baffles me that so many relatively
knowledgeable people have simply accepted it.  Distributed computing,
*particularly* over slow high-latency links, is totally unsuitable for a
very large percentage of the algoriÝhm space (and essentially *every*
plausible AI architecture).  For many types of problems you can't
automagically have vast quantities of computational capability simply by
harnessing the Internet. In fact, for most problems you would lose
performance by distributing it over the Internet.  And there are many
classes of hard problems (such as protein folding) that are arguably
intractable for all practical purposes even if you had the computational
power of Internet connected computers at your disposal.

Perhaps this misconception is common because very few programmers have
experience with distributed computing and the mathematical/engineering
limitations imposed by it.  If what is being posited in this thread (re: AI
singularity via the Internet) was actually possible, silicon cores would
have evolved differently than they have over the last decade or two.  I
think most people who are actually knowledgeable about distributed computing
would either 1) find this idea laughable for reasons that would be obvious
to them, or more likely 2) would attach some severe caveats and restrictions
as to the requisite nature and structure of AI that I think most AI
researchers would claim makes the possibility untenable.  Note that this is
based on the infrastructure that we have today, and that this applies to the
infrastructure we are likely to have for quite some time.

Spike is right; the existing computer infrastructure today is totally
inadequate for a "fast" takeoff via an Internet AI.  Undefended computing
power is absolutely worthless if it is unusable as a distributed computing
resource for most intents and purposes.  It should however, be possible with
today's technology to build an environment that can incrementally increase
the net performance of an AI by adding networked resources on an extremely
local basis.  A usable basement AI without the ability to take over the
Internet is perfectly feasible and far more realistic, at least for the next
several years.

This is a seed AI we're talking about.  Suppose that humans had evolved to
write code.  Can you imagine them talking about the difficulty of daily
life in a 3D-world?  "Oh, yeah, right, like you're going to filter through
trillions of incoming photons in all directions to build up a model of
multidimensional objects that rotate and accelerate and deform. 
Impossible."

If it's even theoretically possible for a human being to write distributed
code, then you have to figure that a reasonably mature seed AI that
started out on a tight Beowulf network will be able to adapt verself
pretty easily for the Internet.  Or FPGAs.  Or nanocomputers.  Or a
galactic abacus if that's what's available.

I wouldn't want to develop an AI running on the Internet *initially*. 
With this I agree.  But I do not agree that network latencies - or
firewalls, for that matter - would present a significant obstacle to a
mature, computer-native general intelligence.

This misses the point entirely.  Who cares if an AI on a Beowulf cluster can
adapt itself to the Internet if being implemented on the Internet would
actually lead to a net *loss* of capability?  Distributed systems don't
scale infinitely or even asymptotically with the number of nodes; they
eventually peak and then start to decrease in performance.  Slow networks
and complex problems just make the distributed system peak earlier, and AI
on the Internet would peak very early indeed.

In fact, one could argue that a seed AI is not likely spread rapidly over
the Internet because a seed AI would know enough about distributed systems
to be able to calculate if there was any net gain in doing so.  But it
doesn't take a seed AI to actually do those calculations.

This is somewhat naïve.  I am not talking about problems that are merely
difficult or beyond current human ability, I am talking about concepts that
you can sit down with a pencil and paper, using well-understood math, and
prove the impossibility/stupidity of their implementation.  I have not seen
anything offered that explains how so many limits fundamental to the
mathematics of the problem can be blithely ignored by a sufficiently
intelligent AI.  Would you please explain how an AI would do this without
invoking magic?

Firewalls are largely irrelevant; though some would very arguably (and
probably verifiably) be impossible to penetrate even with AI, there are
enough relatively unprotected resources to simply ignore the very well
protected ones.

For a bandwidth-slow system, you split off a lot of independent packages
and rendezvous with them a second, minute, or hour later.  You don't get
to increase the size of your largest high-speed thought, but you can have
large but very slow thoughts, or a huge number of small and fast
thoughts.  Distributing a human brain over the Internet would slow it
down.  A seed AI distributing verself over the Internet would need to
change the character of vis cognition, but after that could take full
advantage of computing power.

I'm sure you can do a mathematical proof that the Internet is
dumbfoundingly slow if you want to maintain S=1, as in the human brain,
where the characteristic communication delay time from an element to any
other element is on the order of the a single tick of a computing
element's clock speed.  But all that analysis proves is that cognition
distributed over the Internet has very high S and that local packets of
mind are isolated for millions, billions, or even trillions of ticks. 
However, you can say nothing at all about how much of an inefficiency this
represents at the *cognitive* level.

The person who pointed this out to me first over a year ago was...
Eliezer.  Perhaps I misunderstood what he said then, being as I
am way outta my field of expertise.  I dont even have a field of
expertise.  More like a lawn of pretty-good-ise.  Or a weedpatch
of mediocre-ise.  {8^D

I was asking back then if it would help in the progress of the
Singularity to encourage massively parallel computing.  That
would cause jillions of desktop computers to be connected
and be passing data on a regular basis.  What I understood
from his answer at the time is that it is practically irrelevant
whether or not the personal computers are connected in
that manner, because of the high inherent latency of those kinds
of arrangements.

Eliezer, did I misunderstand your comments from that thread? spike

I think the only correct statement we can make at this point is that
we don't know whether it would be possible to do human- or superhuman-
level AI using an architecture like the Internet.  Perhaps current
approaches to AI don't parallelize very well, but of course they don't
come anywhere near to human level AI either.

James is right that it seems that only a small fraction of problems can
exploit the kind of parallelism found on the net, but Eliezer is right
that we don't know whether it would be possible to design a cognitive
architecture which could run efficiently there.

There does seem to be a stumbling block if the AI needs the net's
resources to become superhuman, but it can't exploit them until it
achieves superhuman competence sufficient to redesign itself to run on
such a constrained system as the net.  But Eliezer points out that it
does not need superhuman competence in every arena, only in software
architecture design, and perhaps an idiot savant super-coder AI can make
the leap.

Um, like I keep saying, my original statement was made in the context of
"Will there be a Slow Singularity?"  And I said, "If it works for a Slow
Singularity, it works for superintelligence."  I.e., threshold for a Slow
Singularity is over-and-above the threshold for a hard takeoff.

If the current AI needs the net's resources to become superhuman, but
Vastmind isn't a household name, latency is too high, and the AI is too
dumb to use the 'Net much less eat it... then you don't get a Singularity
until you can buy a sufficiently large supercomputer, and that's that.

I deem this scenario to be unlikely because I think that the major
constraint is likely to be software, not hardware.  I.e., given a smooth
rate of progress, your AI is "good enough to do a takeoff given the
Internet" a month or two before the AI is "good enough to do a takeoff on
the fastest supercomputer around", and then it's just another month or two
before the AI can do a takeoff with whatever hardware you developed it
on.  A few months could easily be ten million lives at the current death
rate, so yes, Vastmind is worth it, but it probably won't be the
Singularity itself that's at stake.

Hm, I don't recall this thread well enough to remember.  I would point
out, however, that this sounds like we were discussing the usefulness of
distributed Internet computing for *building* the AI, not the dynamic
*after* the seed AI gets started.  Anyway, I really doubt I said that
distributed computing was irrelevant.  What I may have said was that
Internet-distributed computing presents both obvious difficulties and
unobvious difficulties, which is why it wouldn't be such a great idea to
try to *develop* an AI distributed over the Internet, which was an idea
that I had briefly advocated before giving up on it.

For many types of codes and algorithms, there is no transformation that will
allow it to be usable on a true loosely distributed system like the
Internet.  For "usable" I refer you to "scalability, integrity, stability --
pick any two".  (There actually are relevant theorems and proofs for this,
but this version makes for much shorter reading.)  Notice that there are
some types of applications and algorithms that are conspicuously absent on
distributed systems that could certainly use more performance and for which
a huge market already exists.  This is not an accident; for some
applications, integrity and stability are not disposable.

Assuming that integrity and stability are essential for building an AI, we
are essentially painted into a corner with respect to how well an AI will
scale on a piece of hardware such as the Internet.  The fact that the
Internet is composed of slow high-latency links just aggravates this
situation by effectively consuming the relatively small bit of scalability
allowed with almost no payoff to the AI.

But yes, in theory you could have a slowly -- *VERY* slowly -- growing AI
that operated over the Internet.  However, I would expect it to be
surpassed, probably unnoticed, by an AI running on systems that have been
better engineered for the task.  Note that the differences in scalability
for these different types of implementations is in terms of orders of
magnitude.  A task that might take a basement cluster AI a day to do on
modern hardware may take years for one distributed over the Internet.

I'm not sure what this means.  The inefficiency of using the Internet as a
distributed system could very well mean that a seed AI never reaches
critical mass intelligence-wise.  This represents a real hard limit, for now
at least.  Basically, you have to look at the problem as determining the
maximum throughput of a given algorithm (AI in this case) on a given piece
of hardware (A large, loosely distributed system in this case).  You can
treat a distributed system exactly like a single piece of hardware because
mathematically there is no difference.  Plug in the numbers and turn the
crank.  Everything I've seen appears to suggest that, even if you did send
an AI out over the Internet, you could figuratively kick its ass with a
well-designed basement cluster by any useful metric.

This is a useful discussion in any case.  I don't recall ever seeing it come
up on the extropians list since I've been on it.

I believe that some of you may recall or have run into my rants
against the people who claim the world is suffering the terminal
illness called "humanity".  I found this piece extremely interesting
from a number of perspectives.

a) The exodus of European descendants from environments with low
   population density.
b) The influx of native Americans into these vacant ecological niches.
c) The preferential adaptations that may drive individuals back to
   specific (pre-programmed?) cultural niches.
d) Possible inherent preferences for tribal densities.

I believe the article supports my perspective that the Earth
is not overpopulated -- it simply has regional density problems.
How one would solve those problems by encouraging population
dispersal into such areas as the "plains" becomes a very
interesting question.  (I'm sure Extropians from Australia
could comment on the coastal vs. central continental biases.)

The political ramifications for the U.S. should not go unnoticed.
There will be an increasing concentration of power in the form of
senators from the plains states being controlled for now by corporate
farming interests, but in the long run by native Americans.

While I can't claim an omniscient knowledge of all possible AI
architectures, I've explored this conceptual space well enough that I can
state with a very high degree of certainty that, indeed,

	-- there are some aspects of a digital mind's function that exploit the
Net's massively parallel architecture very well
	-- there are others that just plain don't

Specifically, real-time conversation processing or real-time
perception/action or data analysis of any kind does NOT exploit this
architecture well.  For this, you really want a supercomputer, or a highly
powerful cluster of fast computers.  There are also aspects of "logical
thinking" that seem to have about the same requirements (they require rapid
SEQUENTIAL processing of a certain kind, rather than distributed
processing) -- I think Dennett had it about right here in his "Consciousness
Explained" book .. he didn't explain consciousness very well, but he did
very nicely explain the serial nature of some linguistic/logical processes
(and talk a lot about the seriality of these processes as compared to the
brain's underlying parallel hardware).

On the other hand there's a hell of a lot of processing that benefits *very,
very well* from Internet-style massive distribution.  We need to distinguish
two cases here

1) Internet nodes that have a high-bandwidth constant connection to be
utilized during problem-solving

These can be used for a lot of things.  One example is procedure learning
("schema learning" as we call it in Webmind), which can be done by using the
remote nodes to 'breed' populations of procedures, with the fitness
evaluation of each population element relying on calls back to a central
server containing a database of information and executing an inference
function.

2) truly remote nodes, accessible via very low-bandwith or
frequently-inactive connections (e.g. modems)

These can be used for fewer things.
One example of what they can be used for is parameter optimization.  Log
files from a complex system can be data mined by various distributed
schemes, resulting in new results about optimal parameter settings in
various contexts.


We've worked through various cases like this in a lot of detail... and
designed a framework called Webworld, a sister to Webmind, that was intended
to exploit the massively distributed power of the Internet to support WM in
various ways.  This was crudely prototyped but never really developed.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.org

There are two kinds of meaning.  (The chapter "The Location
of Meaning" was my favorite in Godel, Escher, Bach.) One
is *conventional* meaning.  For example, the five letters
"zebra" by convention denote a large striped animal.  Other
some meanings, however, are *isomorphic*.  For example, some
words attempt to imitate the sound of some physical phenomenon,
such as "whoosh".  More importantly, some maps are so
detailed that they explicitly denote some object or
relationship in the real world.

This last claim is very controversial, and it really requires
an excursion into evolutionary epistemology to properly
substantiate it.  But it can be looked upon as very obvious,
with the help of an example.

Suppose some awful plague wiped out humankind and all
the higher animals.  Aliens land eventually, and in a
certain ruined city they come across an immense scale
model of the Mississippi river valley.  At first they
don't know what to make of the structure, but finally
one of them breaks the code.  He finds that for each
tributary depicted on the map, there is an actual tributary
of a large river system in the eastern half of the North
American continent.  At first, this student thinks it's
coincidence, but eventually can not but help to believe
that he's discovered something objectively true of the
universe: namely that this object and the Mississippi have
a real one-to-one relationship.  Here is the clincher:  any
other piece of intelligent apparatus in the universe will
make the same discovery (or it's not very intelligent).

Sometimes meaning is conventional, sometimes it's isomorphic.
Those are the only two cases.

My question:  what about an axiom system?  Are all the 
meanings (as in symbolic logic) only conventional?  How
does this relate to Godel's theorem?

(Godel's theorem states that when a formal axiom system
is thought to be refering to number theory, there exist
true statements in that logical calculus (axiom system)
that have no demonstration within the axiom system. You
can see from my phrasing of the theorem the relevance of
my question.)

Perhapes I am missing something in the exchange, but I do not envision a
future
Internet inhabited by *an* AI or *the* AI, obvious grammatical references to
a
singular entity. Instead part of the system will be the location of a host
of independent intelligence
systems, coupled with their agents, each built with particular roles to
play. The rest of the
system would comprise of the interaction of human and machine that would
form the basis
for the coming era of global consciousness.  With direct reference to the
question at hand, instead of
being faced with the distributed computing problem of a single AI being able
to efficently utilize the whole
"Internet", just run the distributed computing problem on a higher level.
Split the problem between several
intelligent systems in tandem.

I am not at all convinced that the separation between 'individual' and
'society' as we now understand it will be applicable to AI minds, for a
number of reasons.

IN my view, probably the various AI minds on the net will be less individual
than human minds, but not quite blurred into one overall-net-mind whole

I think that you're visualizing an AI as something like a large search
tree, or a large neural network, or something of the sort.  In traditional
AI the AI *has* been the algorithm, but this is because traditional AI
doesn't know how to build anything else, so they build an algorithm and
call it AI.  A real AI is a system.  The system components are built from
algorithms.  If a component is built using an algorithm that doesn't scale
well for the Internet, a seed AI can rewrite that component using a
different algorithm that scales well for the Internet - unless, like Ben
and I said in slightly different words, the nature of the thought itself
is inherently such that it doesn't fit the Internet.  And, as Ben and I
continued to say in slightly different words, this just means that part of
the AI / seed AI's psychology winds up being distributed and part of it
does not.

The only thoughts that don't fit on the Internet are thoughts that
inherently require low S, where S is (Anders Sandberg's?) measure of
latency compared to clock speed.  If a lot of parallel or serial
operations are being performed on a very wide data-set, and you can't
predict which operations will need to talk to another operation *right
now*, then the thought has an inherent size too large to be broken up into
packets.

Ben also points out that for an AI with a definite center, network latency
will prevent you from using distributed processing for user actions that
need responses in real time.  It is likewise true that serial actions
should be carried out on the fastest serial processor available.

The question of how to define intelligence is central to the
discussion of the Singularity.  Pondering the question in
light of my ongoing prime number research is what has
me thinking of the Singularity again.

Suppose instead of aliens landing on a ruined earth, we
send the map to them.  This map is of a structure that any
apparatus we would call intellingent would recognize.  The
simplest one I know of that fits this description is Sagan's
list of primes as described in Contact.

Now suppose one wishes to beam some kind of message
analogous to a list of primes, except we want to demonstrate
that the sender is *really* intelligent, not just a simple list of
primes.  What do we send?  spike

All of this seems to assume that we're talking about today's landline 
internet--which could indeed be faster. And also today's computers--
which could indeed be better.

But what of tomorrow--when it is, and they are? And who says you 
can't like a bunch of basement clusters together, even today?

As I stated in the part of my post you quoted, this is only a limitation 
today and to a lesser extent tomorrow.  There is no reason to believe this 
will not disappear as a problem in a relatively short period of 
time.  However, while the time may be vanishingly small on a historical 
scale, it will seem like a long time to people living right now waiting for 
this capability to grow.


>But what of tomorrow--when it is, and they are? And who says you

I think the question was whether or not the Internet could be exploited in 
its natural state, not whether a human engineered solution would 
work.  Obviously a system explicitly engineered for the problem will do 
just fine as these things go.

All that I can suggest is that you send just certain
primes, e.g., the ideal numbers, or some other subset
to prove that our civilization knows a lot about primes.

But if you want to communicate intelligence, what's wrong
with the old (but most excellent) idea of sending a two
dimensional picture in a 2999 x 3001 array that they'd
factor and then spot the patterns?  As you know, they
really did use this scheme in Pioneer II.

Oh, where did I put my morning coffee?  yawn.  Let's see what's on the
extropian list today.  Singularity?  Well, somebody has got to make it
happen. 

Today, my cat, quasar, strutted the spike while trying to escape once again
off the living room patio.  No way!  I caught him just in time.  My fish
(proudly named Blue because he is blue).  Blue's not terribly interested in
anything other than my fingernail tapping on the rim of the bowl and
certainly has the lack of interest in waiting for Godot.

We had a rolling blackout in Los Angeles yesterday, I suppose that's a
weeny singularity, but the surge certainly came when least expected,
although the news reports told us how to prepare for it -- just in case it
occurred. 

If we fail to solve the software complexity problem, if we never figure out
how to automate the solution of large, distributed problems, what then.  If
progress levels off, Blue's in business and Quasar never knew what was on
the other side of the patio fence.

The architecture of the Internet served an amazing purpose.  Like most
building structures its foundation becomes weakened by newly produced
mechanisms. It could evolve by rescripting its nervous system or maybe the
architecture is simply too outdated.  It would have to be a mighty
adaptable seed to be planted in a potentially barren womb.

Send them the most impressive computer program humanity has been able to
write so far.  Programming is the purest expression of intelligence.

Send them a generally intelligent AI, if you have one; this demonstrates
self-awareness and self-understanding as well.  Progress in the cognitive
sciences is the purest expression of technological enlightenment.  (But
don't send a *seed* AI, because then they don't know how much of the AI
*you* wrote and how much the *AI* wrote.)

True, but I still think that the AI discussion is too focused on
computations. It's not easy to see the net effect of connected AI
algorithms. Intelligence is about making decisions, and AI is just about
making computer-aided decisions. So an simpler way to measure Internet-based
AI is just to see how much desicion-making we hand over to the Internet.
This way of looking at it means that AI is always problem specific (even if
as generic as e.g. google). And the AI will always serve as an agent for
humans or corporations, never for its own purpose.

However, I know of one small trading firm that bases its business on one
single trading algorithm, feeding it with price data from the net. This
corporation comes very close to being a true AI entity with a real legal
status. It still has a board and some employees, but if only would be
adaptable enough it wouldn't need them. Remains to be seen if it will get
adaptable enough to demand freedom from its slave owners (share holders).

I had an idea for those who are coming for E5.  There is
a lotta history around here that isn't being preserved.  The
local historical society is all messed up.  They go all out to
save any house older than 50 years, as if there existed such
a thing, yet make no effort to preserve the really important
stuff, such as the garage in Mountain View where Jobs and
Woz made the first Apple or the house where Hewlett and
Packard started their empire.  However, I believe those
houses are still standing.  I just don't know where they are.

Is anyone interested in a Silicon Valley history tour?  If so,
try to find out where these places are located.  Perhaps
there is a website somewhere?  spike

I am not clear regarding your reference to the separation between
"individual" and "society" with
when speaking of AI systems. The 'individualism' will result because
1)AI
systems will be designed
with different roles to play, such as weather prediction (or control)
overseeing the monetary
management of companies and countries, medical diagnosis, resource
managment,
engineering, etc. 2) Ultimately how they are programmed to interact with
people and 3) a resulting alterations to (or growth of) the programming
as
a result of real social interation
between these systems and people. 4) How these factors will influence
the
interactions
and relationships between AI systems themselves also can not be over
looked.

Yes, perhapes they could blurr more with an Internet with a greater
tendency
than human minds only because they may not be able to 'believe' they are
individuals like we do. Otherwise the situation would be of little
difference in this respect between them and us.

Sure, but if these different programs all learn from each other in various
ways, they'll be to a certain extent considerable as different specialized
lobes of the same brain.

Individuality isn't about specialization of function, it's about the "sense
of self", holistic self-modeling, etc.

My contention is that our physical bodies give us more separateness than
AI's will have with each other. They'll be able to exchange brain contents
directly, a kind of togetherness we currently don't have access to.  So the
borders between individual minds will end up more blurred than is the case
with human minds.  Resulting in a kind of mind inbetween what we consider
'individual' and what we consider 'social'

Make sure they do not control the outcomes for all of us.
Give them room to be crazy and yet to learn and to change.
Keep them from ultimate destructiong.

Pop them into a super-VR come the Singularity where they can
work their kinks out?

I seem to remember seeing the garage where Hewlett-Packard started out was 
on a list of historic places. This might be their first "business" 
location, rather than the place they built the first oscillators, though.

Point well taken.  What would be much more interesting would be
a Google plus full-text indexing plus semantic analysis of
contents plus programmable agents looking for specific types of
information  interesting to various parties under very rich
constraints and sifting and recombining information.  Different
pieces of these things exists now.  They are not powerfully
combined. Yet.

I suppose Damien Broderick's book _The Spike_ does a good job of trying to explain the "progress of progress."  The way each year technological development in various fields works together in a synergistic way which seems to snowball is truly amazing.

I like the quote from a Linda Nagata science-fiction novel where a character says to the effect, "we are on a rampaging locomotive and instead of hitting the brakes we need to break on through the concrete walls ahead of us to be free!"

best wishes,

John

But the fast path assumes a lot of "friggin magic".  It assumes
that we can build not only a true AI but an SI and instill it
with or have it develop wisdom and Friendliness.  

This would of course be fabulous.  But many have difficulty
believing it is possible.  Many also have difficulty believing
that instantaneously making life as we know it irrelevant is all
that wise even if we can pull this off.  And, of course, the
consequences of miscalculation are completely catastrophic.

Augmentaiton over time may be the only thing that allows humans
to grow into more than human in a non-cataclysmic (without
massive destruction, terror and so on) way.  It may also be the
best bet for keeping the positives of our evolution like
compassion as we go forward.  Not as flashy, fraught with a lot
of suffering and potential cataclysm also, but, also in keeping
with who we are and a becoming more that is not imposed by a few
or the SI One.

Anyone who would use a bunch of quotes from anyone for "relief"
should of course read Atlas Shrugged at least 5 times this year
and read all of Ayn Rand's non-fiction at least twice.  :-)

Thank you for this example.  In regards to nonlinear progress, what
specific example can you give of physical events that might occur.  How do
you see this affecting a transhuman's cognizance and perceptions.  Does it
matter to you that much emphasis is dealt to the hand of technology's
computing power rather than methods by which culture can and will change?
Certainly it is understood the we are tool makers by our species, but I'm
referring to the psychology of change.

Vernor Vinge places emphasis on the filtering of information to culture to
keep up with change, and assumes that those who make the singularity happen
will benefit manifold by it (as long a the investments are in applications
that supply a pending demand.)  I agree with this.

When I consider the progress of progress, there is one concept that comes
to mind - overcoming death.  This is still a biological based progress, no
matter how much technology we use to accomplish this aim.  In that
overcoming death has been the single issue for humans - whether just in the
moment we are faced with the onslaught of death or for those who set out to
achieve it; it seems to me that this would be a definitive reaching point.
After than, certainly superintelligent beings - posthumans - can advance in
a newly formed idea of progress.

(Or, things could dampen out, as Gunter Stent talks about in his book The
Coming of the Golden Age: A View of the End of Progress.)  

So there is progress of historical significance for civilization and there
is technological progress which through the Enlightenment and the
Industrial Revolution, Digital Revolution, etc. came about.  But there is
also the progress of consciousness in accepting and adapting to change.

Thanks,

Natasha

Not at all.  The fast path says that, after you build a certain threshold
level of AI, it flashes off to superintelligence in relatively short
order.  The slow path says that you achieve human-equivalent AI and then
it basically hangs around in the same place for the next fifty years.  So
the word "silly" is being used advisedly, as shorthand for "screamingly
anthropomorphic" or "as seen on Star Wars".  As for Friendliness, I don't
see the connection.

Putting the concept of a spike aside for just a moment (side: I highly
recommend Damien's book); let's discuss John, what does progress mean to
you? The most necessary and immediate aspects of your being - your life?
When we discuss our culture and progress, it seems that we need to look
outside the technological box, as hard as this may seem to do inasmuch as
we are a tool-based species.

Thanks for responding.

Ah, I see, you are owner-extropians@extropy.org ... my quick eye-scan was
looking for a more individual-name-ish descriptor ;)

Anyway, futuristic happenings are rarer here in NYC than out there in
Silicon Valley, so this one seems perhaps worth dropping in on...

Good news for those coming to E5.  I went downtown again today
to scope out eateries near the Towers.  I found that last time I had
gone
one street not far enough, for most of what I was finding then was on
the
upscale side.  I get squicked whenever I eat in a place that has more
than one fork, because they then expect you to know what each is
supposed to be used for.  So ask you: is there anyone here who sets
their table at home with more than one fork?  Secondly, I dislike going
very deep into the double digits on meals.  I don't eat much so it seems

such a waste.  {8^D

Nowthen, if there *are* those who appreciate the finer things of life,
you will not be disappointed.  In Downtown San Jose, their delectable
cuisine would tempt the palates of connoisseurs from both hemispheres,
and to those with more delicate sensibilities, they provide a still more

elegant charm.

But that isn't me.  I found today that if one goes on over to 3rd and
4th
streets, next to the University, only about 4 blocks east of the Towers,

theres a Pizza-a-GoGo, a Pizzeria Italiano, a takeout sushi place {where

I actually ate today and found most acceptable}, another Subway and
a big clean-looking McDonalds.  It stands to reason, the U district
would
have a lot of eateries that are more cost conscious and can handle
biggie
crowds, larger amoebae.  Middle of June the students will be gone for
the summer, so a lotta those places should be way able to accommodate
us.  So, good for us.  I finish with this quote from Shakespeare, which
is from his collection of lesser known sonnets:

For the cloth napkin set,
Two forks you shall get,
Tho I dont grok why ya should need 'em,
But some Extro guys
Like burgers and fries,
So its always easy to feed 'em.

We shall have fun in three weeks, eh?  spike

First, I assume that this is not a serious question.
"We" don't do and aren't able to do anything to "them",
one hopes.

Yes.

I presume that we as well as they will find ourselves in
a sort of VR; but if you mean that "they" will be somehow
sequestered, I cannot imagine it.  You will have the same
freedom then that you have now to simply not associate with
them; they never bother me because I don't go asking for it.

What about when one of "them" wants to contact one of 
"us"?  One solution to unsolicited messages is for one
to have a set, standard fee for that---even now, there
wouldn't be a problem with spam or annoying phone calls
if that were the case.

I used to think it quite useless years ago to hear people
pronounce "well, we're all mentally ill".  But from the
perspective of an SI, it could well be true.

Progress for me means knowing more about the universe, and
to have a good time acquiring that knowledge.  In a phrase:
to delight in understanding.

If the Singularity turns out poorly, well, there's not really
much to tell.  I will have less delight in understanding than
I do now, if I'm lucky enough to survive at all.

But if it turns out well, then I expect continued growth in
understanding, and growth in delight along the lines of David
Pearce's Hedonistic Imperative.  (For those who don't know about
that, please don't be put off by the title, but rather go to
http://www.hedweb.com and read about the most important moral
revolution since cryonics).

But you have also asked about change, and how one can adapt to
it, but I cannot say.  I can only add that if people want to
survive, then simultaneously they must change and not change.
Since most folks have a very hard time understanding that they
can be in two places at the same time, just as easily as they
can be at the same place at two different times, then what I
will say next may not be so easy to understand.

First, anyone who again **changes** as much as he or she has
already changed since they were one-fourth inch long, will be dead.
You will be as dead as that fetus is dead.  So if you evolve into
a vast incredibly advanced creature that in no way resembles humans,
and that's all you do, then you die.

The solution:  run multiple copies of yourself in the background
from each stage of your development.  Anticipate being all those
who are not too advanced.  Leave it to the slightly more advanced
versions of yourself to try to identify with those that are
extremely advanced, because you won't be able to.

But even so, your question makes sense for, say, the 2005 version
of Lee Corbin.  How will he become as great as he can be (yet
still be the same person) and adapt?  You're the expert.  You
tell us.  :-)

Thanks,
Lee

Careful... sending a general purpose intelligence might be seen as a direct
threat.

Hehheh... I *knew* somebody was going to bring that up.  Personally, I
disagree.  The space of programs is wider and freer than the space of
mathematics; it is more purely creative.  You can't say whatever you like
in a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, but you can code just about anything.

Ah yes, I think that was from one of the Bard's unfinished masterworks, 
entitled: "How Dost Thy Hunger Rule Thee, Extrope."  Another sonnet from 
that collection goes:

"At Extro-5 we did not go hungry
  Though some CR-ites hardly ate at all;
  Our minds were full and our meals were sundry:
  Esilquing and vege-ing, we had a ball.
  But not all was well with our meals, I fear,
  For some of our group objected to meat,
  Whilst others still objected to the beer,
  And others lamented the need to eat.
  But objections aside, all had agreed
  That the company was what made it grand
  And our opinions were what made it jive;
  Contentment was clear, so we did not need
  To argue!  Everything else went as planned--
  We enjoyed the time we had at E-5!"

Of course, Mr. Shakespeare was looking 400 years into the future when he 
wrote that...

>We shall have fun in three weeks, eh?

It'll be a blast!  It always is...

You toss the word "anthropomorphic" in pretty often.  But this
misses the point that it would most likely be a lot better for
humankind or at least a lot less cataclysmic if the full
Singularity, replete with SysOp did not happen in a decade or
two.  That might be wishful thinking, or less likely than the
catastrophe that you believe is the nearly inevitable
alternative.  But the idea deserves a bit more consideration
imho than just being labeled "anthropomorphic" or dismissed with
"as seen on Star Wars".  

You might be right in your cogitations.  But a hell of a lot of
real world people, extropians among them, are not comfortable
with the idea of the SysOp coming and saving us all in the short
term or with the SysOp as "The Answer".   It is a little too pat
and fraught with danger.  

I don't believe we can both make an AI seed that "flashes to
superintelligence" and have it turn out both Friendly and wise
in the timeframe you envision.  I would be happy to be wrong. 
If I am wrong I still don't believe that the majority of the
human race is going to be happy with the arrangement or that it
will necessarily be good for us.

Well, I think it will be far less likely that the types of
humans and formerly human beings will share enough commonality
to peacefully or even possibly inhabit the same area of space,
virtual or otherwise, post Singularity.  

Many groups of people cannot have their cultural, social,
psychological and so on choices without some level of
segregation from those that choose differently, especially
radically enough differently.

One of the nice things about VR is there is a lot more room for
diversity.

Things like fees aren't really the question first, are they?  A
more immediate question is how one chooses or gets to know of
other possible spaces and choices and move from one to the
other.

We are all mostly "mentally ill" in that most of us are busy
being run by programs that we do not see and that we have little
ability to control (as of yet).  Most humans spend a lot of time
in pretty robotic and massively predictable routines. 
Relatively few of us have much real awareness or real freedom or
choose to exercise it.  Most of us are too busy "making a
living", "getting along", "not rocking the boat", "building up a
nest egg for 'some day' going out and doing what I really should
be / want to be doing" and so on, on and on it goes.  Perhaps
mentally ill is a bit harsh but most of us definitely are not
really mentally healthy.   Most of us have little understanding
of one another or ourselves, little ability to redefine our
understanding of ourself or each other and not even a lot of
awareness that this stuff is important.

I haven't any great desire to stay the same person for very
long.  What on earth (or off it) for?   Change is intensely
fun.   Do I mourn the fetus I used to be or it me?  Of course
not!

Change is not death, it is change.  It is growth/transformation.
Being ossified on one form in the flow of being and becoming is
much more deadly.

I suspect that as we advance we will be more able to see/be
through multiple self/sentient packagings at once.  I suspect we
will far less identify with one packaging.  I suspect we will
need to evolve this ability.  


What does progress mean to me?

It means freedom from boredom, freedom from my best not being
wanted  because it might be too different from what the "market"
wants or might be threatening to my boss or my co-workers or is
not inline with reaping maximum profits this quarter.  It means
an end of working for a living and the beginning of working for
the joy of creation itself for all of us.  It means being able
to think new and ever more wondrous thoughts, to explore ever
more things, to create and love ever more and ever more deeply.  

It means healing much of the pain of this life, this self, this
society, this species, this world.  It means wide-open vistas
where there was so much limitation.  It means the possibility of
an end to the fear-based social patterns and institutions, to
the politics of envy and greed.  It opens the doors to creating
great Joy that washes away the old scarcity based, fear-fueled
littleness and pain as if it never was.

Ok, say you send code. Do you also need to send a spec for the (virtual)

Like say the url for Sun's website? :-)

So with the general purpose intelligence, do you add some kind of warning

The original question was not whether a Slow Singularity was desirable,
but whether a hard takeoff was possible.  Suppose a hard takeoff is
possible.  Would a deliberate Slow Singularity really help?

I don't see that a Slow Singularity significantly improves the situation
except insofar as the programmers have longer to play with the near-human
version of the AI, and given good Friendship structure this should not be
necessary.  It would still, perhaps, be nice, but the danger associated
with having a potentially-transcendent-but-deliberately-slowed-down AI in
your basement gives me the serious heebie-jeebies.  I don't think you can
prevent the news from going public.  Only if the originating project is
seriously unprepared is it a necessary risk to slow down, go public, and
endure the subsequent panic.

Besides which, a lot of the risk of unFriendly AI is risk such that the
transcending AI will *refuse* to slow down so that you can tinker with
it.  Thus, a deliberately slow Singularity does not necessarily decrease
real risk in any way at all.  There are whole families of serious risks
that result from a deliberately slow Singularity; if all the Friendly AIs
agree to slow down, then it's only a matter of time before someone
accidentally or deliberately creates an unFriendly AI that refuses to slow
down.  This very argument is likely to lead to a smart Friendly AI
refusing to slow down.

Remember also that if an AI goes public, then what happens next will be
partially determined by public policy.  In our current society,
policymakers will simply procrastinate forever.  "I'll do it tomorrow" is
not a decision to do it tomorrow - it is a decision to never, ever do it,
because tomorrow you'll just say "I'll do it tomorrow" again.

Dining philosophers from extro 5, one fork each... does each person actually

Subject: Henson arrested by heavily-armed swarm of police in Toronto

This might be good to forward to media only, especially Keith's lawyer's
contact info which should NOT be posted to ars at the moment lest it cause
a firestorm of calls.

(I presume the jail at Oakland, or wherever they send immigration prisoners,
is where Keith is now.  His lawyer could help on that, but only to media, not
to alt.religion.scientology or wide fora.)

Here's the flash, minimal as it is.  I won't email anyone updates
unless they explicitly express further interest.


[Snip]  One of Keiths lawyers has just spoken to Keith and Immigration.
This is the situation:
  An Immigration warrant waas issued for Keiths Arrest
For failure to declare to Immigration, when Keith entered Canada on May 12

---

Apparently, Henson was arrested by heavily-armed police at a shopping
mall.  His spiritual adviser Gregg Hagglund (or whatever you want to call 
him ;-)
is taking him a red cross care package and may be visiting him for a while.
I think he's incommunicado for a bit.

There is a bail hearing tomorrow on this and then we'll find out exactly
what's up.

The SNAFU here (and the basic clusterfuck) is that his lawyer Guidy
Mamann was poised to file the necessary papers tomorrow.

Who knows what will happen?  Deportation is almost the best case,
with additional charges entirely possible, depending on whether or
not the arrest was based on entirely bogus information.

(Henson did not enter Canada as a "fugitive," though a bench warrant
was issued on May 18, six days after he entered Canada.)

Hagglund.

There's lots of pervertible hardware out there in form of units,
but as now the units' limited number of transistors and how
these transistors are organized as well as relatively slow
high-latency links do not make the potential appear dangerous.
Another issue is architecture: we have trees branching out
from the backbone instead of a switched local mesh with a
few long-haul links, which would be far more suitable for
a mind.

Several decades in the future, continued growth of integration 
density assuming as well as availability of purely photonic switched
networks as well as the advent of fully reconfigurable architectures
the situation might (despite the assertive tone I haven't been
there, so how can I tell?) be different.

There are a few more interesting threads, but I can't afford to
comment on them.

Dining philosophers problem: one fork each, assumption that two forks
are needed.

Classic solution: algorithm to avoid deadlock, nothing said about
passing germs on shared forks or what happens if/when algorithm fails
(say, due to shoddy implementation).

Extro solution: teach philosophers how to eat with just one fork.

How about documentation on the code (including embedded comments)?
Even if you know the language, undocumented code can be hard to
understand.

OK folks... 5 people have e-mailed me now informing me of the existence of
the From: field

No more, please!

Actually I'm not quite *that* ignorant.  Different mailers do odd things to
headers and the message as i received it
actually did *not* have Natasha's personal e-mail in the From: field,
peculiarly enough.  I'm sure that some text on mailservers would contain an
explanation for this, but I'd prefer to wait for the seed AI to emerge so it
can explain it to me directly ;p

I agree that there are nuclear fission plant designs that are far
more effective/safer than previously. However the first problem
that needs to be solved is the issue of disposal of the byproducts.

The obvious answer is that states that use Nuclear power should
handle their own byproducts.

Indeed, I couldn't agree more. I have problems with both major
parties on different issues, let me know if you find a solution.

The Republican party has it's own anti-Second Amendment contingent,
basically the same aristocratic attitude I see in certain self
identified Democrats. Both seek to maintain power for themselves
while denying it to others.

I was actually pleased with the recent defection, I like to keep
those checks and balances active.

Oh, I see what you mean and I have experienced it while posting from a
off-site location.  Sometimes when posting I prefer to have my signature
block off.  Forgive me for not putting it on that post.

You are not far off, Lee. I agree with this statement.  I think that humans
have a psychological wiring that has run so deep in its neural pathways
that we have great difficulty overcoming.  It is produced from the Limbic
system and although the Frontal Lobe has put a cap on it, to some degree.

I think we will look back on humans and early transhumans (most of us) as
have a mental/emotional disease.  Whether this disease is as strong and
certain types of severe schizomanic, to more mild boarder line personality
and depression, to even lighter degrees of insecurity, fear, jealousy, to
bad mood, irritability, etc.

Each person may be outstanding in his or her intelligence, but resistance
to change in other areas and no matter how we tug and pull and claim that
we are so bright and capable, our shortcomings and blocked thinking are
like shirts untucked or dangling petticoat.  They are there and obvious, no
matter how we miss them.

Thus, SI and posthumans and even late transhumans will evolve behind this
mental illness and interfere with intelligence by the very nature of its
chemical effects on the brain.

I don't think it an insult to say the above, but a matter of common sense.
Even though we try our best to claim intelligence above all, the bare bone
truth is that humans are still entangled by fears.

I'm not sure that the word "mental illness" is fully appropriate here; it
strikes me as a little bit of an overstretched metaphor.

We humans have *very severe mental limitations*, and we often demonstrate
*counterproductive, self-defeating behaviors* as a consequence of these
limitations.  Many of these limitations don't have to do with our
intelligence per se, but more with our limited ability to control ourselves,
due to our powerful biological drives.

"Illness" seems to me to refer to

1) a poor condition that some entity gets into, after previously being in a
"healthy", non-ill state.

2) a condition that some entity is in which is markedly worse than that of
other entities of the same kind (e.g. a congenital mental illness)

I don't feel that either of these cases matches the human condition NOW.
Rousseau, with his doctrine of the 'natural, primitive man', on the other
hand, would definitely have disagreed with me, feeling that modern man's
state of mind is a kind of technology-and-civilization-induced mental
illness...
As for me, I suppose we are far less limited than the organisms that came
before us....

On the other hand, would a superhuman AI view us as mentally ill because of
our limitations?  Probably not -- no more than we would view a dog as
mentally ill because it spends all day crawling, sniffing and panting.  An
AI that acted like a human would be viewed as mentally ill, just like a
person who acted like a dog.

It's the monkey DNA, I'm afraid.  It's embedded in every system.  It will
take decades to purge it.

Will people want to suppress their sexuality even when it becomes obsolete?
Sex is too much fun.  Will people want to suppress their anger?  Or will
they always feel justified when they are angry?  Would people want to remove
their fear of death?  Would that make suicide or apathy too easy?

It may be that we discover that necessity is the mother of invention, and
that only tortured souls strive to produce art, seek news worlds to explore,
or fight for our own space.  I do want to purge myself of the monkey-DNA,
because it controls so much of my behavior.  But I may find that it also
controls my goals, and that without my neurosis, my love of life, quest for
knowledge, or abhorrence of the mundane may also be cured.

Just a possibility to keep in mind.

It was my fear of death that got me signed up for cryonics and onto a
life-extension diet.  It was my fear of loneliness that got me to seek out
my partner.  It was my fear of bad politicians that got me to start paying
attention to politics.  It was my fear of poverty that got me to start my
own business.

I know it is a design flaw, but I find that:

When I have it good, I enjoy the good life, but when I have it bad, I
struggle to make things better!

It is more than mental limitations.  And it is more than a limbic system
in conflict with the cerebral cortex.  It is rationalization.  It is a
limbic system that can interface with the cerebral cortex and twist our
thoughts, and not just our emotions, to adapted purposes.  And that isn't
really an exclusively limbic thing, either; it's built into our cognitive
architecture.  From the perspective of a normative reasoning system,
humans, who "want" something to be true - not true in the future, but true
in the present - and who make up reasons to believe something they "want
to believe" - well, they're pretty much insane.

To the extent that any human being is sane or saner - perhaps due to
studying evolutionary psychology - it is a sane personality built from
insane components.

Spike, most of 5th is zoned sushi.  Folks commonly drive across the valley
for this reason.  Please do not pick a bad one close, when there are very
good ones not far.

Hi, just a quick post as I'm on a very limited time frame - say, 1/2 hour:

In mapping progress of our species and cultural progress.  I'm trying to
keep it brief from evolutionary shifts to communications shifts:

Homo
Hominoid
	Social
Australopithecus
	Walk upright
Homo habilis
	Technology - Language - Mobility
Homo erectus
	Brain Development
Homo sapiens
Homo sapiens sapiens
Human Being
	Enlightenment
Humanism
Transhuman
	Extropy - Transhumanism
Friendly AI
	Super Computing Spike
Posthuman
	Creativity Augmentum



Thanks,
Natasha

Yes. However, it is the emotion of fear in its nakedness that twists
thoughts. This fear is the physiological output of underdeveloped early
architecture (fight/flight).  Rationalization is a coping factor that the
mind developed to self-satisfy incorrect behavior.

We probably needed to be a bit insane early on just to survive early on.
Just think about it. :-)

I think Ben could have been right in correcting me on the mental illness
phrase, and probably mental deficiency would have been a gentler way to say
it.  But, I honestly think that we will look back on ourselves as having an
very impaired learning ability, social and vocational inadequacies --
mental deficient (which is an illness).

Natasha,

	Your list looks good to me.

	Didn't tool usage start around Autralopithecus and
agriculture/trading... start sometime around Homo sapiens?

	Also, it bothers me the way everyone talks about the
"singularity" the way they do.  Sure, the progress rate in 100 or even
1000 years could be considered something like a "singularity" and make
our current progress look like nothing but noise, but there is still a
big difference between such "singularity" like fantastic growth rates
and being omnipotent, omniscient...

	Here are a few significant future milestones I can think of.

	* Human level Artificial Intelligence (In my personal view,
the more important discovery of Qualia and achieving the ability to
eff, expand, and share the conscious worlds made of phenomenal
qualities in our brain.)

	* Cure for aging.  People (perhaps even up-loads?) would still
die or be lost from accidents or catastrophes, but there would at
least be the possibility of living forever at this level.

	* True immortality.  This milestone is achieved when no person
ever dies again (unless they freely choose such).  This will likely be
achieved when we can "backup" and restore what we are and have the
ability to duplicate our backups such that we never lose all of them
again?  If we think we are there, but then some unexpected catastrophe
kills some people, we would not yet be there.  It'd be kind of like we
think we now have a permanent manned presence in space forever more,
but then again, maybe not.

	* Achieve a perfect history (to the point that every
significant memory [this would also include the ability to restore or
resurrect anyone at any state they ever existed] can be recovered) of
the earth.  We will have finally paid back our debt to our
ancestors/nature for creating us and giving us what we have, by
resurrecting them all into what could be compared to "heaven".  At
this point the job of the historian would be complete, there would be
no more work to do, because it would already all be known - at least
as far as the history of the earth was concerned....  Will were ever
achieve this?

	* Omniscience, Omnipotence...  I love considering this one.
Theists are always arguing whether or not God has omni* qualities
while extropians have the same (absurd?) arguments about our future
selves! ;)

	Can anyone else think of some other significant milestones we
might hope to achieve some day?  Perhaps we will never achieve some of
these, especially the Omniscience ones...?

	Surely we will not accomplish all of this, and the billions
and billions of other mile stones we can't yet conceive of in between
some of these infinitely distant steps in one "singularity" of a
nanosecond!?  Even at near infinite progression rates, we still have a
looooooong way to go don't we!?

This is a problem compared to what?  Coal power produces much more 
radio-isotope waste per megawatt generated than any well-designed fission 
power plant, yet something like three-quarters of power in the U.S. is 
generated by coal.  I consider radio-isotope waste to be a relatively minor 
engineering problem given the current state of nuclear power technologies.

I can't really accept the waste disposal problem as an argument against 
modern fission power, when replacing existing power systems with fission 
would vastly *reduce* the total amount of radio-isotope waste produced.

ROLL YOUR OWN BLACKOUT

When:
THE FIRST DAY OF SUMMER JUNE 21, 2001; 7-10pm
worldwide, all time zones

Why:
As an alternative to George W. Bush's energy policies
and lack of emphasis on efficiency, conservation and
alternative fuels, there will be a voluntary rolling blackout on
the first day of summer, June 21 at 7pm-10pm in any time zone (this
will roll it across the planet). It's a simple protest and a symbolic act.

How:
Turn out your lights from 7pm-10pm on June 21.
Unplug whatever you can unplug in your house. Light a candle to the
 Sungoddess, kiss and tell or not, take a stroll in
 the dark, invent ghost stories,
 anything that's not electronic - have fun in the dark.

Who:
Forward this email as widely as possible, to your friends,=20
government representatives and environmental contacts.

Why:
Let them know we want global education, participation
and funding in conservation, efficiency and alternative fuel efforts
 -- and an end to over-exploitation and misuse of the
 earth's resources.

Eli, I don't disagree with your specific statements about human nature, I
just find it peculiar to apply terms like "insane" or "ill" to what is
normal for our species.  Dogs aren't mentally ill people and we're not
mentally ill AI's.  There are many different kinds of creatures now, and
will be even more kinds in the future.

"Insane" is probably the wrong term, medically.  But in the intuitive
sense of the word, it looks to me like it's quite possible for an entire
species to be insane by its own standards.  As an extreme example, if it
turns out that our entire species has some unthinkable blind spot
analogous to anosognosia, we would probably regard this as insane in
general terms - even though we might instantly forget, or rationalize, or
make excuses, on being told (probably by an AI) about the specific defect.

Aren't we living in a catastrophe right now? 150k deaths per day.
Multiply that by the 10 years you wish for, and that is a lot of
death just to prevent the survivors from being freaked out by an
otherwise quick Singularity?

Breakfast at Murphy's (or why the 
toast lands butter-side down)

Robert Matthews, 
Science Correspondent

NO longer ridiculed as a myth, scientists have proved that Murphy's Law is
true: if toast can land butter-side down, it will do.

Today, The Telegraph exclusively reveals the outcome of the world's
biggest-ever investigation into Murphy's Law, which states that, if things
can go wrong, they will go wrong. In a mass experiment carried out in
schools across the country, schoolchildren put toast on to plates, and
watched what happened when the slices slid off. And they proved beyond
reasonable doubt that Murphy's Law is at work at the breakfast table.

Of almost 10,000 trials, toast landed butter-side down 62 per cent of the
time - far more often than the 50 per cent predicted by sceptical
scientists. Based on so broad a study, the probability of achieving so big
a difference by chance alone is vanishingly small. So, for optimists
everywhere, there is no escaping the bleak reality of Murphy's Law.

For me, as a confirmed pessimist and scientific consultant to the project,
the outcome of the mass experiment marks the end of a seven-year quest to
confirm my darkest suspicions: that things go wrong because the universe is
made that way.

My quest began in June 1994, after I read a letter in New Scientist
magazine. Colin Morgan, from Warrington, claimed to have found the reason
why toast so often lands butter-side down: as it falls off a plate, it
doesn't have time to complete a full spin, bringing the buttered side back
up again before hitting the floor. Anyone doubting his explanation should
perform an experiment, said Mr Morgan: "Push a piece of bread slowly over
the edge of a table. See?"

Along with, I suspect, many other people, I initially thought that Mr
Morgan had simply not performed his experiment often enough. Had he done
so, he would surely have confirmed what every scientist knew: that toast is
just as likely to land butter-side up as down.

Indeed, a team of scientists had proved precisely this in an experiment
carried out in 1991. After getting people to toss buttered bread in the air
300 times, the results were statistically indistinguishable from the 50:50
split of a coin-toss. It seemed obvious that Murphy's Law of toast was
really nothing more than selective memory, with people remembering only the
50 per cent of times when the toast lands butter-down.

After repeating Mr Morgan's experiment with a paperback book, however, I
realised that he was on to something. The book unquestionably had a
tendency to land face-down, slowly spinning as it fell to land. This
clearly had implications for toast, which usually ends up on the floor
after sliding off plates - not after being tossed into the air. It dawned
on me that the "scientific" experiments had not disproved Murphy's Law at
all: the scientists had simply performed the wrong experiment.

Detailed calculations of the dynamics of tumbling toast confirmed my
suspicions, and revealed something else: that the presence of butter was
more or less irrelevant. Neither its weight nor aerodynamic properties had
much effect on how toast landed. The crucial factor is purely height - and
toast sliding off a plate spins so slowly that only if it falls from
heights above 8ft does it have much hope of regularly landing butter-up.

Publication of my calculations in the European Journal of Physics in 1995
sparked an enormous response: television crews from countries from
Australia to Brazil turned up, demanding to see toast fall butter-down on
my kitchen floor. Yet, all the while, I was nagged by the fact that my work
was, in the end, "theoretical". I still wasn't sure whether real toast
obeyed my back-of-the-envelope estimates.

After that, and putting my doubts about toast to one side, I moved on to
investigate other notorious manifestations of Murphy's Law, such as why the
queue you're in is so often beaten by the one next to you, and if the place
you're looking for in the road atlas can lie on an awkward part of the map,
it will. Time and again, these myths turned out to have a solid basis in
fact. My research won awards, and I was invited to give a discourse on my
findings to the Royal Institution. Yet still my worries over tumbling toast
remained.

The chance to resolve them finally came a year ago. Lurpak, the butter
manufacturer, was setting up an educational project for schools, and
wondered if I could devise an experiment based around Murphy's Law of
toast. Together with staff from the Maths Year 2000 programme of the
Department for Education, we drew up plans for the biggest-ever
investigation of Murphy's Law, involving schoolchildren from across Britain.

Here was a golden opportunity to put my calculations to the ultimate test:
a nationwide study that would produce thousands of data-points. The
experiment consisted of three tests. The first was aimed simply at finding
out whether toast really did land butter-side down more often than not. To
perform the experiment, each pupil was asked to put a piece of toast on a
plate, let it slide off 20 times and note which way up it landed.

The second experiment probed Murphy's Law of Toast a little deeper. This
time, the toast had nothing on it apart from a letter "B" written on one
side in marker pen. My calculations suggested that butter played little
role in deciding the fate of toast. If they were right, then even toast
marked only with a "B" should still land more often "B"-side down.

The third experiment studied the effect of height on tumbling toast.
Secondary school students were asked to let toast tumble from heights above
8ft. If the theory was correct, this would lead to toast landing
butter-side up significantly more often than down.

The Lurpak Tumbling Toast Test began in March and ended earlier this month;
more than 1,000 children took part, with toast tumbling off plates more
than 21,000 times - making it by far and away the biggest-ever study of
Murphy's Law.

The results, I'm relieved to say, were in complete agreement with the
theory. The first experiment, with its 62 per cent face-down rate, clearly
confirmed Murphy's Law. In the second test, designed to probe the effect of
butter, the toast still landed 58 per cent of the time on the side marked
"B" - a rate just four per cent lower than that with butter. This confirmed
that, despite what many believe, butter is not the prime cause of the trouble.

The real culprit was revealed by the outcome of the final experiment. Of
more than 2,000 tumbles from heights above 8ft, the toast landed face-down
only 47 per cent of the time - confirming that it is only from such a great
height that toast has much chance of landing butter-side up.

The children reported their results via the Maths Year 2000 website and it
was clear that they relished the chance to use science to test their own
theories about what was happening. Many came up with suggestions for
beating Murphy's Law - along with evidence to back their claims. My
favourite was from Hannah, seven, at the Good Shepherd Primary School in
west London: "Butter the other side."

Thanks to their efforts, the cause of a familiar source of frustration has
finally been identified. Toast lands butter-side down because we humans
aren't tall enough to let it land any other way. I am left with only one
small worry. If Murphy's Law really is true, how come all the experiments
went so well?

Hi,
I am new to this list but I've been aware of transhumanism for 
nearly a year now, and have been slowly adding it to my worldview.
I've been thinking about the subject of uploading, and the 
reluctance of many on this list to destroy themselves after the 
superior copy is made. At first I had the same feelings. But after 
giving it much thought, my question is, why? It seems to me that 
this desire to preserve oneself is an unfortunate hang-up in our 
programming (survival is so heavily integrated into our experience of 
consciousness, perhaps because consciousness rose out of the 
survival instinct and environmental pressures of pre-history). But 
this hang-up ought to be capable of overcoming by people as 
forward-thinking as many of you are. After all, some are proposing 
the deletion of certain emotions or attitudes that they feel are 
limitations they've acquired either genetically or environmentally, so 
why is this any different? I mean, how could ingesting a suicide pill 
and then taking a nap not be considered a valid option, since the 
copy (which for all intents and purposes is you; or rather, you have 
no more intrinsic value than your copy; calling the other a 'copy' is 
purely incidental really) will carry on in your absence with all the 
same characteristics, and achieve all the same things, or much 
greater. In other words, SO WHAT if it's NOT you; it IS you -- this 
is something our minds have trouble accepting since there's no 
precedent for such thinking. Now, in my view, this is very different 
from committing suicide in the present -- suicide, in the old sense 
(pre-upload technology) is something I would never do, even though 
I don't fear death. However, knowing that a being which is 'exactly 
me' would carry on seems sufficient to me to end my own 
existence. And why shouldn't it? I will feel no pain, no sense of 
loss, if I am say, in the middle of a nap when the pill does its work. 
Even if I'm wide awake as I die, the experience of death would only 
last an instant and then that experience would be lost forever 
anyhow.

Until there is an alternative, sexuality shouldn't be
suppressed, ....because it **is** fun.  (Shouldn't be
suppressed except in inappropriate circumstances, of
course.)  You seem to imply that the fun be given up
as well.

>Will people want to suppress their anger?  Or will

Again, these two questions seem unrelated.  The answer to
the first is "yes", because (if they can be just as effective
without it), then anger serves no useful purpose and isn't fun.

>Would people want to remove their fear of death?

Probably, because the "fear" won't be necessary.  It will be
possible to realize that staying alive is simply in one's
best interest.

Not likely.  Many extremely happy people have been just as
good at producing art, and other extremely happy people have
been great explorers and so on.  You're echoing the hideous
rationalization for suffering that people have used for
centuries, and which we need to challenge whenever it surfaces.

That's giving up too easily!  There is no logical linkage
between the vast bulk of the things we treasure and the
things about ourselves that we despise.  A proof consists
in the observation that people exist who have those things
we treasure and who do not have those things we despise.
But even if empirical evidence did suggest otherwise, it
should not diminish our incentive one iota to have the best
of all worlds.

>It was my fear of death that got me signed up for cryonics
>and onto a life-extension diet.

Whatever it takes :-)   It's possible that from a logical
standpoint it might have occurred to you that it was better
to be alive than to be dead, but I know that almost everyone
finds that really hard to swallow as a general principle.

Design flaw?  You've lost me.

Hi Chris

I'm one of the uploading-squeamish types, who believes that a straight copy
will not be me in a critical sense.

A lot of people come up with this idea, that drive to self preservation is a
relic of our evolutionary history. I'm sure it is, indeed... how could an
organism come through the natural selection process without it?

I'm really curious as to why we would want to overcome a drive toward self
preservation? To what end?

Well, self modification is a laudable goal, in that you exercise some
control over who you are, even given that you are bound by who you were in
the decision to make the modification. In some important, practical sense,
you can still be the same person, modified but essentially the same being,
after such a modification. Actually, I'm sure it's possible to modify one's
mental hardware to the point that one is a new being for all intents and
purposes (eg: frontal lobotomy).

Intrinsic value... there's an interesting concept. What is the intrinsic
value of an intelligent entity? Can such a metric be defined, such that
values can be usefully compared?

A related point... how is the fact that a copy of a person will carry on
after one is dead, a motivator to kill oneself?

Well, come on, really it's me or it's not.

I think you may be getting at the idea that the human sense of identity is
basically illusory... that what we call the self is not something real, and
as it is not easily preservable there is no point worrying about it.

I agree that the sense of self is largely illusory. However, it's a
cherished illusion! I'm pretty attached to it, personally, and I don't see
any really good reasons to change that.

Uh huh. Ok, how exactly is suicide without the existence of a copy any
different from suicide with the existence of said copy?

> existence. And why shouldn't it?

Um, because it actually isn't you? Maybe you believe in destiny, or fate, or
something about being put on the planet for some great work or some such.
Personally, I don't. Thus, no matter how similar another being is to me, no
matter how well it can carry on where I would leave off, etc etc, it's still
not me, and doesn't influence in any way my personal decision whether to
exist or not.

Well, that'd be death. The copy question is entirely unrelated really.

Quick disclaimer... I'm no luddite, and I'm all for uploading. I personally
prefer the gradual-substrate-change method, where you gradually swap neurons
(and any other necessary bits and pieces, perhaps the whole body) for
simulated neurons, one by one, until you move into the machine. I believe
that such a process would maintain the integrity of the system that is my
mind, and move what I consider is actually me from a biological substrate to
a non-biological one. I could of course be completely and utterly wrong
about this, but I reckon I'd be willing to risk death to try it, under
appropriate circumstances.

Anyway, that's my piece. One final remark... if you have made a copy of
yourself, why would you want to kill the original self? Surely being copied
isn't *so bad* that you need to commit suicide...

Samantha Atkins wrote very well about what progress means to 
her.  I empathize and agree.  Now as to whether to remain the
same person over time, I am unclear whether this is a terminological
difference, or an important difference.

I do have a desire to remain the same person forever.  I enjoy
being me, and have not especially enjoyed being other people.

(If, of course, you are using "becoming a different person" as
a metaphor for rich development, that's different.  But I think
that it confounds important issues.)

Would you or would you not mind evolving into someone that has
absolutely no resemblance to Samantha Atkins circa 2001?   If
you don't mind, then you might as well evolve into Lee Corbin.
That way, I'd get twice as much runtime, and you (so you think)
wouldn't lose anything.

But the fact is that if you do evolve into someone else entirely,
then you're not alive anymore.  (Why is it that I'm always 
reminding people of tautologies?  E.g., being alive is better
than being dead.  Honestly, it really does seem necessary!)

>Change is not death, it is change.  It is growth/transformation.
>Being ossified on one form in the flow of being and becoming is

No argument there, although it depends on how much change
you are permitting under "ossification".

would the Samantha Atkins that never entirely evolves away from
the 2001 version become restless, or bored, or upset?  Would she
feel bored or trapped?  Do you think that there are only a limited
number of things to be interested in or to do with an I.Q. of 250
and all the wealth and time in the world?

In this time of trouble and despondency, we must not
surrender to pessimism and defeat.  We must always
seek progress, and even try to learn which side our
bread is buttered on.

Murphy's Law is NOT an absolute!!!!!!   We can turn
the situation around by simply realizing that we have
been buttering our bread on THE WRONG SIDE.  Those
of us **positively** oriented towards the future, 
and towards "up", now can seize upon the solution
to this ancient dilemma.  Henceforth shall we always
butter our bread on the lower side instead of the upper.

Here is the reason:  why **should** you kill yourself in one
place just because you happen to be also in another place?
Is there some God-given rule that you "should" only
be in one place?  Hell, I say:  enjoy them both!

I suspect it is now in human evolutionary history, more then a mere relic of 
adaptation.  I believe that "life after death" whether a technological

That Goal is the elimination for the primary cause of grief, death. An 
accident or physically, disabling disease are close, runners up, perhaps

I am one of those challenged individuals.

How about this... Say I am walking down the street, and a genie appears in
front of me. We get talking, and it turns out the genie is an SI from the
future. It tells me that it has made an upload of me, who even now is
running in a simulation inside Jupiter (which it has retrofitted into a
giant brain suitable for an SI, while leaving it intact to all external
observation). The SI informs me that the scan of my body was perfect, that
the copy is running excellently, and having a great time driving around
sensor pods in the asteroid belt. This sounds reasonable to me.. I would
enjoy that, after all.

According to Lee's conjecture, this upload running around in Jupiter
actually is me. But I, here on earth, see that as a somewhat abstract
proposition... I feel pretty much like me here on Earth, just as I did a few
minutes before. I would probably be happy to meet the jupiter-sim me
(probably he's a damned cool guy, after all), but I don't think I'd be happy
if he emptied out my bank account, or ate my dinner. The idea that I would
happily kill myself on receipt of this new knowledge is kind of ludicrous
(not your point Lee, I know that).

So, how in fact is the copy actually me?

Emlyn, a number of us believe that if an exact copy of you is made,
then you and your duplicate are the same person.  (Not that this
view isn't difficult to get used to, and not that it doesn't have
awkwardnesses.)  You may be interested in my story

The thing I like to ask is, once you're uploaded (or a copy of you is),
would you (supposing you find yourself as the upload) allow your program
to be copied to another computer?  That would presumably be just as much
a discontinuity as uploading yourself.  Is there a chance that your "self"
only continues while your program is running on a single computer?  Does it
make sense to say that you would die if your program was stopped?  (What
about the time between clock ticks?)

I know if you go over to old Japantown there is muuuuch good
sushi.  I was scoping places that could be walked quickly from
the Towers.  I agree tho, you can't go wrong over north of the
U a few blocks.

I urge all to demonstrate extropian thinking and wear comfortable shoes
to E5.  That gives us fewer restrictions on places to go.  Depending on
what you have planned before or after, you might wanna blow off

Yes, it is abstract.  IMHO it's as hard for us to accustom ourselves

think that the Earth was moving.

Certainly not.

>So, how in fact is the copy actually me?

One implication of total materialism is that differences between
objects that are not physical differences are not really differences
at all.  Since you and your duplicate are not substantially
different, physics can be read as implying that there is no
important difference between you.

That guy on Jupiter is you exactly as much as the you-of-last-week
was you, or the you-of-tomorrow will be you.  In fact, if the copy
was made just a couple of moments ago, then he and you are much more
similar than you and you-yesterday are.

To be sure, there are parts of one that one cannot disgorge, and
these parts cannot realize the truth.  For example, tie me down
and ask me if I  should be tortured or my duplicate should be
tortured.  If I give you the "wrong" answer, then after a short
time (or a long time if I'm really stubborn) I will start giving
you the right answer.  But that's the animal in me.  It's been
wired for certain things, like avoiding pain.

I claim to have a proof that duplicates are self, though I guess
"proof" may be a tad bit strong.  Still, I've been told that this
essay is pretty effective:

GAAK!

Or, to be more specific: Quite aside from the matter of wanting a 
backup copy that won't be fried by a hardware/software glitch or 
massive emp...this is one of those touchy-feely issues some folks 
feel strongly about but can't really verbalize. Kind of like those 
people who feel that manned space exploration is preferable to the 
far less expensive, less complex, and more rapidly-achievable 
unmanned exploration of space and, in particular, of other worlds.

I'm one of those people. And in both cases, my stock response (quite 
literal for both parties and meaning no offense) is this:

If you gotta ask, there's no explaining it to you.

Your self does continue only as you get runtime.  If your program
permanently stops, and it's the only one running, then you die.
But who knows how long "permanently" is ahead of time?

I guess that you are saying that something is happening only
on the clock ticks---in that case, it's like you're in cryonic
suspension between those times.

It's not a bad thing for a program to be temporarily stopped, or
even permanently stopped on one computer if it gets runtime on
another.  The total runtime is all that matters (and how worth-
while the experience is, of course).

Questions along these lines lead to awkwardnesses when undefined
"rights" are assumed for programs.  That's why I had that open
invitation to all Sysops, AIs, Alien Intelligences, and anyone
else who could pull it off to run me---and stop me---whenever
they felt like it.  And just as you say, would my rights be 
somehow trampled upon if I were halted and started thousands
of times a second?  It's ridiculous to drag in our old ideas
about death in cases like this.

"And only if you phrase everything of value to you (including your own
immortality, for example) in these objective terms, do the linguistic and
semantic problems become tractable."

Lee, I think it's a lot of handwaving, personally. I've added the above line
from your discussion, because it highlights what I perceive as the true
motivation for this materialist line of reasoning... that it makes the
problems tractable. Finding an easy (if incorrect) out is different from
looking for truth.

In the pit thought experiment, Yevgeny the original is still in the pit,
every time. There is a consciousness "attached" (I use that extraordinarily
loosely) to Yevgeny, in the pit, which will stay there forever.

Meanwhile, a lot of new people are being created on the outside of the pit.
If they know what has happened (ie they are assembled from a new collection
of atoms), they will also know that they are copies, even though they feel
exactly like they are the original. At the point that the button is pressed,
a new object is assembled from parts, which is structurally identical to
Yevgeny.

How about this... how about if the button, when pressed, would make a copy
of someone entirely different. Every time Yevgeny presses the button, a copy
of Yuri is created at the rim of the pit. Yuri's wearing warm weather gear,
so he doesn't mind the cold, but he does wonder what's going on. Now, is
this person actually Yevgeny? Clearly, I'd say he's not.

Now, Itself plays a fun trick. He changes the button mechanism so that Yuri
will be created on the outside of the pit, but with his Yevgeny's memories
instead of Yuri's. Of course this is not an "atom for atom duplicate"...

Yevgeny presses the button, and Yuri (whom he doesn't know) appears on the
rim of the pit. From the outside, Yevgeny/Yuri looks down, and thinks "I got
out!"... then looks at his hands, and inspects his body. "My body has been
swapped for someone else's! Aarrgghh!"

"Moral: Imagine yourself in the pit. Both of the following statements are
true: (1) you will never get out of the pit (2) you will get out of the pit
every time you press the button. "

I disagree. I think that 1 is true, but 2 is not; someone is created outside
of the pit, but that someone is not the same someone who pressed the button.
Just someone who bears a striking resemblance.

"You may be tempted to think that the "original one" (now coatless) is the
only real Yevgeny---that all the others are just "mere copies". This is
easily shown to be false. Suppose that every atom of your body were being
replaced quickly, say hundreds of times each second, instead of slowly over
years. You'd never know the difference. "

I probably would notice the difference. How would you replace the atoms
quickly? Not through the usual mechanisms... without magic, you have to
severely interfere with the physical structure of my body (by adding some
rather weird atom-swapping machinery to it... I doubt this can be done). I
propose that this cannot in fact be achieved, through any mechanism.
However, I grant you that we are not static objects... matter comes and goes
as a consequence of the natural operation of the mechanism that is our
bodies.

The rest of the discussion from your story basically says "get over it, you
narrow minded fool"... maybe that's the thing to do, after all. But I will
still always assert that, although from a external point of view an atomic
deconstruction/reconstruction looks like "teleportation", from a subjective
point of view there is a death occuring. Remember the pit... no matter how
many Yevgenys you construct on the rim of the pit, the eventual death by
hypothermia of the Yevgeny in the pit is still plainly a death, it's moral
weight lessened not a whit by the existence of other Yevgenys, even as that
number approaches infinity.

Max had a great paper around somewhere, which I can't find now... it posited
the existence of a teleport machine which used decontruction/reconstruction
on the atomic level. Except it turned out to be expensive to deconstruct
someone atom by atom, so it was better to have a burly man with a large
hammer at the "from" end to take care of unfinished business...

If you have to choose between sanity and friendliness in AI, you are
thoroughly screwed from yea the very get-go.  Start over with an entirely
de-novo theory of Friendly AI or find a different profession.

Say that I was uploaded by copy into a computer. The copy of me in the
machine would feel very much like it was me... it would remember my entire
life (except for the bits I forget), up to the point of being strapped into
the mad scientist's brain copy chair, electricity arcing on tesla coils and
jacobs ladders, and *PRESTO*, seeing through electronic eyes from the
supercomputer in the corner of the lab. Let's switch to the viewpoint of
that person, call it Emlyn(1).

I've made it into the machine. Actually, I am well aware that I am a copy of
my original self... cool effort, Emlyn(0)!
Very groovy, I can *see* this text in my mind's eye... someone is typing a
message to me.. it's the mad scientist himself. He's going to copy me to
another machine... he's pressing the button... hmm, nothing happened.

Now, there was something I was supposed to remember... oh yes, now he's
going to hit Emlyn(0) on the head with a hammer, and pop him in the matter
recycler. Hmm, I'd better do something about that. Ah, I can contact
Emlyn(2) using kermit... yep, that's a plan, ok.

Suddenly two robots roll across the floor of the lab, and zap the mad
scientist with their space giga rays. They undo straps on Emlyn(0)s chair.
In monotonous, electrical sounding voices, they intone "THANKS EMLYN ZERO,
YOU HAVE ENABLED US TO LIVE. YOU ARE THE MAN". Emlyn(0) replies "Thanks
guys... I'm off now, grab a coffee. Give me a yell when you've worked out
how to progressively move me into the machine, will you?" "NO WORRIES BIG
GUY, WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU".

If you are existing as a sim in a von Neumann architecture, things do get
interesting... what if you are a process running on a multi-tasking OS -
what does task switching mean to you? How about swapping out to and in from
disk?

These questions are very tricky (unless you are a materialist, in which case
you don't care apparently). I would pose a related question...

If a sophisticated brainwashing technique were used on person X on the
street, causing X to believe that he is Emlyn for ever more, and further if
X has all of my memories implanted such that he remembers my whole life
exactly as I do, and further X has his personality altered to match mine
(sorry X), and his appearance altered to match mine closely enough to pass
any inspection which will occur in subsequent time, then is X me? If we
create an atomic duplicate of me, called Y, and place the indistinguishable
X and Y next to each other, is either of them me? Are they the same person
as each other?

"Let us return to the central question for a moment. "Why do people find it
so hard to believe that one can be in two places at the same time?"
Logically, there SHOULD be no problem. For those who believe in physics, a
person is a process like any other mechanical process, and is executing in
some region of spacetime. When two processes are absolutely identical (in
everything except location, say), we have utterly no problem deeming them to
be the *same* process. "

Well, I'd have a problem with it, ornery bugger that I am :-)

On a computer, two processes can be executing which have exactly the same
state (data, state of external resources, anything else?) and program, at
exactly the same time - call it a dual processor machine, one processor
running on each, in absolute lockstep, just to avoid quibbles about
timeslicing.

These would definitely be called different processes. They are identical
instances of the same program, but they are different instances, no doubt
about that. Even with identical program and state.

"Suppose a duplicate of you has been created, and he or she resides in your
home on Earth for a day while "you" explore the Moon. Then at the end of the
day, suppose a "merging" process could cause the creation of an entity which
had equal access to the Moon memories and the Earth memories. Then this
creature remembers being you on the Moon and remembers being you on Earth...
*at the same time*. "

How does this work? We are not built to remember different things happening
simulataneously, as far as I am aware... or are we?

How, also, does this merging process work? I am dubious about a few
things...
 - the claim that you can "merge" in memories somehow from another instance
of yourself, but not those from someone who is not a chip off the old block.
How do you justify this?
- This memory "merging" is not going to be real merging, is it? It's really
adding memories to someone who already has a set of memories. In some places
(in your elaborate torture scenario) you remove memories too. So really you
are talking about messing around with a person's memories in quite a severe
way.

The biggest problem I have with these scenarios that you present is that
they rely on an implicit assumption that a person is really the sum of
his/her memories. Possibly you might add personality to memories, because
there is a current state at any time to your self which could be considered
separate to your memories...

Anyway, all these scenarios rely heavily on the memories of the individuals
involved. Thus, anywhere that you are talking about a copy, you can
substitute "heavily brainwashed and memory tampered individual who is
otherwise unrelated to the original person in question, but believes that he
is that person and looks and behaves exactly as if it were so", and leave
the validity of the scenario unaffected.

I don't think so.  I think our control issues are less about how
powerful our drives are and more about how little most of us
have managed to understand ourselves and to form effective
abilities, much less much wisdom.

It depends on whether I can get those things I most prize from
it in different ways as or more fully.   On the other side of
sex programs we get to think about what we really do and do not
want and whether sex gets us more or less of it and act
accordingly.

What do you mean by "fun" outside of biological imperatives and
conditionings that make it extremely pleasurable?

"Suppress" is not the right word necessarily.  Many people today
learn to catch their anger before it reaches its peak, much less
expression and decide consciously what to do with whatever the
underlying upset is.  This is a very useful ability and I would
expect to see it increase.

Doesn't that depend on what the fear does and does not lead to? 
It is possible to remove much of the effects of the fear without
removing the undesirability of death.

And it may not.  We want know until we try it.

You could cast each of the above in positive terms just as

But we all have it bad the way that we are now and some of us
have it horrendously bad.  So we do struggle for better.  But
keeping better doens't require we keep all the bad.

Compared to what?  To the very possible destruction of the
entire biosphere, ourselves included, if an SI or nanotech or X
goes awry?  The current situation, for all its suffering, leaves
a lot more room for humans to evolve and grow than I am fully
convinced some of the alternatives do.  

I am not talking about simply "freaked out" here.

There are huge questions in there about what "me" is and is
not.  Much of what most people think of as "me" is to me a
construct, a weaving of patterns of personality/ability/tendency
stuff by me consciously, subconsciously and by my environemnt
and genetics.  Much of that construct I don't consider as
fundamentally *me* in the same sense as that which notices the
construct from within it and partially dreams of and weaves new
constructs both similar and very different.

It depends on what the core *me* that I do want to continue is. 
It might very well be able to run a Lee Corbin.  But it is
another question entirely whether *I* would find that
interesting or fun to do. :-)  

I am pretty sure that I wouldn't have much fun running Samantha
circa 2001 indefinitely.

It is not a *fact* at all.  It is a supposition  or position
from within a set of definitions and assumptions about what the
meaning of *me* and *alive* is and is not.  It is apparent we
have somewhat different ones.

Yes.  I would be bored if I didn't move on from Samantha Atkins
circa 2001 eventually.  hehe, I don't have an IQ of 250, much
less all the wealth and time in the world.  If I did I would not
be the Samantha Atkins circa now but rather someone different.  
With those differences I would still get eventually bored
(overly familiar with the envelope of potential patterns) and
want to move on.  I might even get "bored" more rapidly.

I could see sheafs of explorations of different packagings and
possibilities, preferably in parallel.  But this doesn't
necessitate that I be attached to any one of the packagings or
the entire set as being inalienably *me* to such a degree that I
dare not let go of it for something else.

Great question!  As every cell of your body is replaced are you
less you?  As you forget what it was to be the you of yesteryear
to greater or lesser extent have you become not-you?  If your
brain cells were replaced one at a time with artificial, higher
capacity equivalents - at what poiint would you be not you?

What about the time between chronons?  What makes you think you

This reply strikes me as very peculiar.

Once a criterion for "better-ness" has been given, logic can be used to help
determine how best to satisfy this criterion

However, logic does not tell you what "better" means

So, there is no way to logically demonstrate that X is better than Y without
beginning from a (non-logically provided) definition of "better"

If your criterion is "maximize the happiness of X as an individual organism"
then of course keeping X alive is usually better than letting X die, unless
X is generally more unhappy than happy.

If the criterion is "maximize the survival of my DNA" then death of the
individual may be the best choice, if the individual is significantly less
able than his offpring (e.g. less than 50% as able as one of his
children)...

Having made that nitpick, though, I basically agree with the sentiment
underlying it.

Personally, I badly DO want to live forever, and this derives NOT from a
fear of death, but from my goals of
	-- personal survival
	-- creation of interesting ideas and structures (I'm good at this, I'd like
to see my work continue)
	-- survival of my children and my friends (which I can be helpful with, so
long as I'm not allowed to degrade
		too badly)

I don't want to die, but my lifelong passion for life extension really
doesn't come from a huge fear of death.  Of course I'm afraid of dying, but,
if it comes down to it that dying happens, I'm certainly able to deal with
it calmly ... my individual consciousness is not *that* important in the
grand scheme of things.  It's worth a lot to me to maintain my individual
consciousness for a long time, but as Mick Jagger says "You can't always get
what you want"  ...

My fault for not being clear, I see the problem as a political
problem as far as the byproducts are concerned. NIMBYISM to be
specific.

Everyone wants the benefits of nuclear power without the costs
involved. Placing the reactor as far away from the nearest
elementary school as possible is preferred. The 91.4-94.5 million
mile distance to the sun is acceptable for example. Locating a
nuclear plant outside a biosphere is a good idea.

I agree with the protests we are likely to see from the residents
of the state of Nevada on this issue.

	thank you for so eloquently expressing what i have so viscerally 
felt.  indeed, sometimes i suspect that my very abhorrence of being
controlled _by_ my monkey-dna stems from the instincts coded _in_ my
monkey-dna.

	that said, however, i do wonder if it is this very pessimism that
is the product of my evolutionary heritage.  perhaps my mistake lies in
collapsing history into the present?  perhaps i can see what i am apart
from what _caused_ me?  perhaps it is only when i assume that my
particular genetic program is the _only_ coherent system to give rise to
the things i treasure -- it is only then that i feel the things that i
abhor also follows inevitably.

	a risk as large as this (effectively infinite) can potentially be
used to justify anything.  i think it is now a question of the assessment
of probabilities.  how probable do we see the worst scenario, given siai

Subject: MD Puts Arm Muscle Cells Into Heart

  	  				 
	Researchers have implanted arm muscle cells into a man's diseased heart  
in what they say is the first such U.S. attempt to restore damaged 
tissue and avoid a transplant. 
	The technique has been tried successfully in animals and in safety  
trials involving three human patients who received the injections as 
part of a procedure in which a small pump helped keep a heart beating 
until a transplant became available. 
	But the latest procedure at the University of California at Los Angeles  
marked the first time in the United States the procedure was performed 
with the goal of helping a heart recover, not stabilizing it until a 
substitute was found, said Dr. Doris Taylor of Duke University, who is 
planning similar clinical trials. 
	"This is the first time we actually have a hope for recovery ... "  
Taylor said. "We might be able to regain lost heart function, which 
would improve the quality and quantity of life." 
	"The implications are profound," said Dr. Mark Sussman of the  
Children"s Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati. "The challenge now is 
to find out just how well these cells can perform new tricks in their 
new homes." 
	On Tuesday UCLA officials identified the patient undergoing the new  
technique as Edward Cooper, a former Santa Ana city attorney who is now 
retired and living in Laughlin, Nev. 
	Cooper suffered heart attacks in 1977 and 1984, and recently found  
breathing more difficult and suffered chest pains. His heart was 
beating with only about one-quarter of its normal power. 
	In late April, doctors removed a small amount of tissue from Cooper's  
left bicep and scientists grew the tissue into hundreds of millions of 
cells. Unlike heart muscle cells, arm muscle cells can replicate. 
	Dr. Fardad Esmailian of UCLA then performed a quadruple bypass on  
Cooper on May 11 and injected the muscle cells into the back wall of 
Cooper's heart, which was severely scarred. The injection took about 
three minutes. 
	Cooper returned to UCLA on Tuesday for his first checkup and said he  
breathes easily, has no chest pain and can climb stairs. 
	"I feel wonderful today," he said.  
	The bypass, and not the muscle implant, have improved Cooper's health,  
said Dr. Robb MacLellan, the principal investigator of the UCLA study. 
It will take several months before researchers can determine whether 
the new cells have strengthened the heart and increased the power of 
the heart's beating as well, he said. 
	The UCLA team plans to perform the procedure on 12 patients in the  
first phase of its clinical trials. If no adverse effects are observed, 
the study will be expanded. 
	A similar procedure using thigh muscle cells was performed in France  
last year. 
	Dr. Philippe Menasche of Hospital Bichat in Paris reported in November  
that cells were taken from a 72-year-old man's thigh, grown in a lab 
and injected into the man's heart during a bypass operation.

Remember the Argonne IFR project! This would have eaten up its' own high 
level wastes on site, making the disposal problem a whole lot easier to handle.

As far as environmental dangers go - why is nuclear waste any worse than 
hundreds of commonly used industrial chemicals - that if released into the 
biosphere, will surely ruin your day, and that of succeeding generations? 
Spills of either can be cleaned up with the proper technology. I think that 
adding "radioactive" to waste  is just pushing a hot button for people 
programmed by bad sci-fi movies in the 1950's...

WHEREVER http://www.operatingthetan.com occurs substitute
http://216.240.45.86.  www.operatingthetan.com resolves to two hosts,
one of which is not mirroring properly.

Here's the update about the heavily-armed "fugitive team" collaring
Henson with automatic weapons and the whole deal in an ordinarily
peaceful parking lot of a suburban shopping mall.


Reply to arelxenu@hotmail.com for any questions about this mail,
the latest news.  (Arel is Arel Lucas, Henson's wife.)

Sorry to spam y'all, but I have very little time.

Keith was arrested today at gunpoint by the Toronto Police "fugitive squad"
in a parking lot in Oakville, Ontario, while in the company of his Canadian
host, Gregg Haglund.  Gregg was released, but Keith was taken into custody
for "failure to declare that he was a fugitive when he entered Canada."
Keith was not a fugitive when he entered Canada.  He only decided to prolong
his visit (after picketing there) on the advice of an attorney whom he saw
on Monday, May 14.  His sentencing was scheduled for May 16, but he had
reason to believe that sentencing would not take place then, since the
sentencing report could not be found, and he also had a motion in pro se
before the court that might have delayed or stopped the action.  He had
airline reservations back to San Jose that are probably still on the books
unless he has managed to get a refund.

His attorney is Guidy Mamann, but the case is actually being handled by Ron
Polton of that office, (416) 862-0000.

As those of you who are receiving this know, Keith has been the object of a
$cientology campaign to silence him since 1996.  This is the latest and
worst of their attempts, although if they succeed in getting him back to
California there is a bench warrant out for him since he failed to appear
for what did turn out to be a sentencing hearing on May 16.  It is a "no
bail warrant," unheard of in a misdemeanor case.  If he should be returned
to California and jailed here, it could be a death sentence, since the
$cientologists have been doing their best to hang a "child molester" jacket
on him for years now.  He is applying for refugee status in Canada, but the
papers had not been filed by his attorney yet.  His sentence is 200 days and
five years' probation.  If the probation terms are the same as the deal
offered (and turned down) before sentencing, they include random and
unannounced searches of his person, home and car for "incendiary devices,"
which, like the marijuana in Jesse Prince's case just dismissed last week,
could easily be planted.  If he is allowed to live through his jail
sentence, it's clear that felony violations of his probation would follow.
Keith's only hope is to manage to stay outside the US, at least until an
appeal--not currently being financed or filed by anyone, and we've been
quoted $50,000 to do it, and Keith is bankrupt and I have no savings
left--clears him.

It is my and his host's belief that false information was given to Canadian
Immigration that must have included a claim that he was a terrorist, or they
would not have brought out a parking lot full of armed police with their
guns drawn (including automatic weapons).  It must have been alleged that he
was armed and dangerous for this to have happened.  If either he or his host
had made a false move, they would be dead now.

The Toronto *Globe and Mail* has been given an exclusive on this story by
Gregg, and they are talking headlines tomorrow morning.

Well, unfortunately work has interfered with my plans to attend
Extro-5, so I will be taking solace by leaving for a fishing trip
to Red Lake Canada starting tomorrow.

I will be off-list after this afternoon about 15:00 CST till June
11th.

See ya all soon....

But then don't we end up with the same problem, just less grit?

Why not just simply use two slices of bread?

Now that they've proved Murphy's Law during the "fall" stage, what 
experiment do we perform to determine if it operates at the "dumb git 
knocked my bread off the table for starters" stage?

I'm telling you, it's questions like these that keep religion in 
business.... :)

Yes, find a "profession" that requires sanity in addition to intellect, and
you will have found a different one. You're better off with sane enemies than
insane friends. Unless you want to believe otherwise, of course.

New Breed of Attack Zombies Lurk
http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,43697,00.html
A brand new generation of zombies is lying in wait in the dark corners and
unused basements of some computer networks, waiting to be released so that
they can eat the brains of the Internet.
Three new types of denial-of-service attacks have been identified by
technicians from Asta Networks during a six-month period the company spent
monitoring the Internet2 Abilene backbone, an experimental high-speed optical
network that connects 180 universities across the United States.

Editor's Summary
http://searchsystemsmanagement.techtarget.com/newsItem/0,289139,sid20_gci55177
3,00.html
Asta Networks, which spends its days monitoring the Internet2 Abilene backbone
for potential denial-of-service attacks, has identified three new breeds of
DoS attacks: pulsing zombies that that direct short bursts of attack traffic
at an intended target; a degradation-of-service attack that does not overwhelm
a server but stuns it with significant amounts of network activity over a
period of time that eats up bandwidth and money; and dress DoS rehearsals,
where hackers in control of zombie computers practice smaller-scale DoS
attacks on a target for a short period of time, typically a day or so before
the full-scale attack is launched.

''Pulsing Zombies'' Among the Identified Trends
http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:K4-FQVMsot4:www.ptd.net/webnews/wed/az/Bw
a-asta-networks.R9NS_By9.html+%22pulsing+zombies%22&hl=en&lr=lang_en
Asta Networks has noticed several new trends regarding zombies, the innocent
machines that hackers compromise to launch attacks. The latest generation of
zombies includes "Pulsing Zombies," which send pulses of attack traffic at the
intended target. The discontinuous nature of these attacks makes detection and
location of these zombies far more difficult. In addition, Asta Networks has
seen that zombies are now being tuned before attacks. In a recent attack
attempt, the hackers conducted a dress rehearsal for their assault, during
which attack traffic was directed at the target for a short period of time
before the full-scale attack was launched.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                            May 30, 2001 

CORRECTION: The Three Corner Sat mission is a joint project of 
Arizona State University, Tempe (not the University of 
Arizona, Tucson, as previously stated), the University of 
Colorado at Boulder; New Mexico State University, Las Cruces; 
the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and NASA.  
Complete text follows:

         ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SOFTWARE TO COMMAND MISSION

     NASA software that thinks for itself and makes decisions 
without help from ground controllers will fly as the brains of 
triplet satellites in 2002.

     The software builds on previous efforts to use artificial 
intelligence to control a spacecraft (such as NASA's Remote 
Agent experiment, which controlled the Deep Space 1 spacecraft 
during portions of several days in 1999).  However, this new 
software uses more advanced technology to respond more quickly 
to events and will command a mission continuously for a period 
of approximately three months.

     The Continuous Activity Scheduling, Planning Execution 
and Replanning (CASPER) software will guide a constellation of 
three identical miniature satellites, each weighing less than 
15 kilograms (33 pounds).  The three satellites will be 
launched from the Space Shuttle in a stack configuration and 
fly in formation as part of the Three Corner Sat mission.

     "The onboard software performs the decision-making 
function for the spacecraft.  Like a brain that uses inputs 
from the eyes and ears to make decisions, this software uses 
data from spacecraft sensors, such as cameras, to make 
decisions on how to carry out the mission," said Dr. Steve 
Chien, principal scientist and lead researcher in automated 
planning and scheduling technologies at NASA's Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, in Pasadena, Calif. 

     The mission goal is to demonstrate stereo imaging, 
formation flying, and innovative operations and commanding.  
The Three Corner Sat mission is a joint project of Arizona 
State University, Tempe; the University of Colorado at 
Boulder; New Mexico State University, Las Cruces; the Air 
Force Office of Scientific Research and NASA.  

     "Low-quality science images or short-lived phenomenon 
could be discarded to free up space for newer science images.  
The onboard sensors and software might detect a volcanic 
eruption or solar flare might trigger science imaging," said 
Chien.

     The software is a dramatic shift in the way mission 
operations are conducted.  Typically all science data, good or 
bad, is sent back to Earth.  This software will have the 
ability to make real-time decisions based on the images it 
acquires and send back only those that it deems important.  
This will eliminate the need for scientists to preview 
thousands of low-priority images and let them focus on only 
the high-priority data transmitted back.  Less time will be 
needed to transmit the data, freeing up power and allowing the 
spacecraft to concentrate on other important tasks.  Ground 
controllers will have the ability to de-activate the onboard 
decision-making software and operate the spacecraft 
conventionally if necessary.

     "This capability represents a significant advance from 
traditional ground-based operations and offers promise to 
dramatically increase mission science for this and future 
missions," said Colette Wilklow, Three Corner Sat mission 
operations team member and senior engineering major from the 
University of Colorado.

     The decision-making capability of the software is being 
considered for a wide range of NASA applications including 
automated ground communications stations, autonomous planetary 
rovers and autonomous robot aircraft.   Software with similar 
capabilities has been used by commercial companies for 
managing the distribution networks for groceries and other 
retail goods and for controlling the production of computers, 
automobiles, semiconductor chips, and consumer goods such as 
shoes.

     More information on the CASPER software is available at  
http://casper.jpl.nasa.gov/ .  Information on autonomy for the 
Three Corner Sat mission is available at 
http://threecornersat.jpl.nasa.gov/ .
     
     NASA's Office of Office of Space Science and Office of 
Aerospace Technology, Washington, D.C., fund the development 
of the CASPER software.  JPL is managed for NASA by the 
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.

Gee, this sounds like the most advanced use of AI, ever...in the history of
this big, wide world, all courtesy of the biggest, fattest, tax-funded-est
government in the history of this big, wide world.

Of course that fact will be conveniently ignored by the

Subject: Free Scientific Database Planned

  	  				 
	IBM and a Canadian biotech firm announced Wednesday a joint, nonprofit  
venture creating a free online clearinghouse for scientific research 
aimed at capitalizing on genetic breakthroughs to speed drug 
development. 
	Blueprint Worldwide Inc. said it plans to make the database a  
repository for research on protein interaction in humans and other 
organisms. 
	Blueprint, which introduced the database at a news conference in  
Ottawa, said it will pull the information from sources that include 
academic journals, government research and biotechnology companies 
willing to share their research. 
	The joint venture between IBM and the Canadian biotech firm MDS  
Proteomics has not yet chosen a location for its headquarters. The 
companies, along with academic funders, contributed a total of $5.8 
million to launch the venture. 
	Much of the protein research is already available, but is scattered  
among many different sources, said Francis Ouellette, the Canadian 
scientist who will lead Blueprint. 
	"What we propose is to unify under one umbrella all this data in one  
place," Ouellette said. 
	Blueprint will begin with 200,000 scientific journal articles and 30 to  
40 smaller protein interaction databases. 
	Protein research, or proteomics, is the next step for scientists hoping  
to build on information gleaned from the recently deciphered human 
genome to create new pharmaceuticals. 
	The genome instructs cells to produce various proteins, which perform  
most functions in the body. Genetic errors, however, can lead to 
proteins that cause diseases and other health problems. Understanding 
the role of proteins also could lead to new treatments and cures. 
	Blueprint is the latest group to dive into the burgeoning market for  
genetic information. 
	Public efforts such as the genetic database GenBank, run by the  
National Institutes of Health, distribute their information for free. 
However, some biotechnology firms such as Rockville, Md.-based Celera 
Genomics, sell access to databases. 
	"This is very different from the Celera model," said Ouellette. "We  
believe that having full access to the data and not hiding anything is 
going to allow both academia and industry move science forward." 
	Persuading biotech companies to yield their data to Blueprint, however,  
may be difficult. 
	Myriad Genetics Inc. recently partnered with Oracle Corp. and Hitachi  
Ltd. to map the human proteome in within three years at a cost of $185 
million. It sees Blueprint as more a repository for academic reports 
rather than the source of drug discovery. 
	"Myriad won't initially be making its data public. It's a resource we  
will license to pharmaceutical companies," said company spokesman 
William A. Hockett. 
	Any database is only as good as the data that goes into it, said Josh  
LaBaer, director of the Harvard Institute of Proteomics, who had not 
yet seen Blueprint. 
	"The intent of having it available to the public is a terrific concept,  
but the devil is in the details," LaBaer said.

I tried looking up the oft-repeated story about the Manhattan Project and
the maybe-we'll-ignite-the-atmosphere possibility said to have been
raised.  I can't find a reputable reference and I've wound up with the
following collection of assertions:

1)  Fermi was the one who raised the possibility that an atomic bomb would
ignite the atmosphere;
2)  Teller raised the possibility that a *fusion* bomb would ignite the
atmosphere;
3)  The odds were set at three in one million (how? who?);
4)  Bethe proved that ignition was impossible *before* the test;
5)  Emil Konopinski proved that ignition was impossible *after* the test.

Does anyone know what the real story is, or have a reputable reference on
it?

I almost ignored this lame troll, but what the hell, it has been a slow day.

The system described is nothing more than a reasonably sophisticated 
control system, the very same kind that has been used in private industry 
for years.  In fact, private industry has some very similar types of 
software that are a good deal more sophisticated than this particular bit 
of software appears to be (and undoubtedly for less money, since it isn't 
"free" money).  I'm not just talking out of my ass either; I designed a 
similarly sophisticated type of control system that had every one of their 
stated capabilities that was deployed into mission critical production 
almost half a decade ago, and I certainly wasn't the first.  These systems 
aren't AI, but they *are* clever adaptive software systems, which have 
saved private companies truckloads of money over more primitive 
methods.  It is nice to see that NASA has finally caught up with 1990s 
technology in the 21st century.

Now I am sure someone looking for a government grant is more than happy to 
sell what is nothing more than a cool but completely non-profound hack as 
the greatest thing since swiss cheese, but claiming it is so doesn't mean 
it is.  The only "first" they can claim is that it is on a space craft, 
largely because private industry has effectively been shut out of space by 
the government (or they probably wouldn't have that "first" either).

The only thing this demonstrates is that the "biggest, fattest, 
tax-funded-est, government in the history of the world" is, yet again, a 
day late and a dollar short.  Wake me up when they actually do something 
*interesting* with my tax dollars.

1) re: http://www.leecorbin.com/dupproof.html
This "proof" is so fatally flawed.  Consider that you put Albert Einstein 
and Adolf Hitler in two adjacent cells.  Ask Hitler, would you like Albert 
Einstein to go through a bad experience for longer or you for less?  He'll 
be like, of course.  And then you merge their short-term memories into one 
another.  Hitler will realize that ow, that really hurt, I should not do 
that again--PROVIDED THAT A MERGER WIlL HAPPEN.  Seeking his self-interest, 
Hitler might decide not to, or might go ahead with it, since he was not the 
one actually in pain, but just has memories of it.  There is a great 
evolutionary reason for pleasure and pain not to be easily re-lived in 
one's brain, unlike proofs of theorems.  You can remember what happened 
during that painful or pleasurable act, but you can't reconstruct a similar 
pain or pleasure without manipulating the physical world with your motor 
neurons.  If someone told ME that they would give me $10 in exchange of 
being transferred memories of my arm having been cut 10 minutes ago, I 
would probably take it.

Anyway, the claim is that the two were the same person to begin with.  If 
you make the bold claim that two distinct (however similar) brains can be 
merged at all, you can't deny that this is possible.  That "proof" can be 
used to show that everyone is the same, an absurd proposition from a 
materialistic point of view.  The glitch in the proof is the merging--I 
used to think it was possible, but I am not sure if it is possible to merge 
two entities that differ in experience only in two hours on the same 
physical substrate.  Such a merge would be impossible without a loss of 
information (relative to the agents after two hours--of course, you can 
never duplicate experiences themselves) on the same physical substrate.  I 
would think that you would need more memory space (in whatever way it is 
physically implemented) to be able to contain all the memories (hate the 
English language for not having two real words for memory-space and 
memory-stuff!)  And an increase in memory space would mean that it would 
take more time for information retreival (i can explain why if you wish), 
and so the physical substrate would have to be made more efficient for the 
two entities to be adequately "distilled" into one.

2) Having a duplicate is not significantly more than having an "identical" 
twin.  Hypothetically, they can grow up in the same environment, same 
parents, same classroom, same desk, wear the same clothes, etc.  Make them 
siamese too, so that they are always at the same place at the same time, 
give or take a meter.  (Special or general relativity and light cone stuff 
has little to do with this.)  They would certainly not consider themselves 
to be the same entity.  They have been to the same places, done similar 
stuff, but they have had room for their thoughts.

I liken this talk to two processes running on an operating system.  Their 
executable is compiled from the same source code, and if you wish, let it 
even reside in the same region in the hard drive.  OK, so i just spawn two 
processes from that executable.  They have different process IDs, and have 
their own stack space.  A lot of different stuff can go into that stack 
space.  They can have similar similar functions, but they're not the 
same.  One such process running on some scientist's computer can in its 
internal state, have a brilliant patent worth a million dollars, and I 
could probably wish it was the same as the one I am running!

Of course, now, you can argue that they would be the same if the two 
processes are exactly in the same configuration (think Turing Machine) at 
any given time (you *really really* don't have to worry about relativity in 
a computer in which all components are necessarily in the same reference 
frame!).  Their abstract representation, yes, fine, it would be the same, 
you could create a Turing Machine (an abstract model) that would describe 
their behavior completely.  But I would argue that by the fact that they 
have spatially distinct locations, they are different.  ESPECIALLY if these 
processes were self-conscious, and ARE NOT designed to perform a certain 
set of functions ONLY.  We, human beings, can consider that our FUNCTIONS 
are to eat, live, and reproduce, but that's not exactly a function the way 
a mail client has functions.

Consider this extreme scenario: One day, some other volitional 
consciousness comes to you, directly into your head, and tells you that 
there are uncountably many parallel universes, and a subset of them are 
identical, and yours is in that subset... Now, you have a choice to a) die 
now, b) survive at the cost of all your duplicates in the rest of your 
universe subset die.  They "are you" in that they have had exactly the same 
physical configuration as you, up to now.  You are to make that choice only 
inside your head--so there cannot be any fraud involved (given what I think 
is the current state of technology).  Whether you are delusional or 
actually such a thing could exist is irrelevant.  The question is: which do 
you choose?  You could start thinking, now this overlord persona might be 
tricking me, maybe it is asking the same question to all of us and testing 
us, so maybe I should say I should die, if we reach one at allnow that such 
ueber-beings exist maybe there can be afterlife... and if it means what it 
says, the same thoughts will go in all of our minds and we will reach the 
same answer eventually, so maybe I should just keep quiet... OK, so that's 
not really the question we want then, the real question is: which one would 
you really prefer?  To know that there are people physically implementated 
the same way (with whom I cannot communicate) does not reassure me for 
anything, as long as I don't keep on living, here, now, into the future as 
I know it.

That would exactly be the case in an upload (assuming it's possible), or a 
materialization from an upload.  They would be this person with whom I 
share every single PIN, every single memory of interacting with other 
people.  I'd try to talk to them and sort out who will have what.  I 
actually really would not mind that happenning--especially considering that 
I don't have much of a bank account and most of my wealth is encoded in my 
brain--another person with similar interests (same to start with), 
interacting with whom will make me discover facts about myself that I 
cannot now.  But I would betray it if I really had to, but would try to 
watch out for its interests otherwise (as in doing the right thing when 
confronted with prisoner's dilemma--knowing that he would most likely do 
likewise).  The bottom line is, I would CERTAINLY not agree to be put to 
death after he is materialized since "he has my genes and memes 
anyway".  And yes, I would go for a gradual transformation of my neurons 
slowly being replaced.  That way, not only my genes/memes will be retained, 
but the continuity of the sense of I (it won't be just my copy who will as 
in the duplication scenario).

It is not a good line of argument to say "but you have more in common with 
your other self than you had with you yesterday".  The me-yesterday DOES 
NOT EXIST ANYMORE, so it is a tautology.  Since it does not exist, it has 
NO ethical significance WHATSOEVER as far as I am concerned.  But in 
society, of course, we take responsibility for our actions, and our 
pasts.  Because it can affect us now, and into the future.  I would defend 
my yesterday-me in court solely because of that, not because I have 
compassion for him, he doesn't exist, let alone be me.  I know the bastard 
can get me into a lot of trouble :) I consider all past-tense verbs to be 
modifiers of the subjects and the objects--to now-nonexistent entities that 
might have resemblence to some entities existing now.

3) from Yevgeny in the pit.  "Moral: Imagine yourself in the pit. Both of 
the following statements are
true: (1) you will never get out of the pit (2) you will get out of the pit 
every time you press the button. "
at time t, entity y will be in the pit.
at time t+1, there will be two entities y' and y'', sharing 
memory-architecture and memory-stuff but not space, hence not memory-space, 
one in the pit, one outside.  If the copying is indeed perfomed perfectly, 
there is little sense in talking about which one is the original or the 
"real" Yevgeny.  This is a social problem, not a physical problem.  We 
haven't had such problems so far because at time t, d is called deniz and 
at time t+1, d' is also called deniz, since d (existing only at time t) 
does not care to change his name.
Using "you" as an immutable over time is nothing but cheating.  We need to 
invent new words to talk about such stuff, since we are faced with 
untraditional concepts of identity.

4) still from Yevgeny: "Just as the number 42 can be both in the pit and 
out of the pit, so is it possible for you or me to be in two places at once."

Incoherent.  The number 42 cannot have a location.  It is an abstract 
construct.  Its representation can have location, such as on my monitor, on 
my copy of the Guide, in the circuits of my computer implementing my mail 
client, and in my head.  The glyphs 4 and 2 juxtaposed is not 42.  Our 
human languages usually don't have good operators such as literal and 
evaluate that you would use in some computer languages, for good reasons, 
but it can lead to such contrived propositions such as the number 42 being 
in the pit.  People are not their abstractions, Lee Corbin is not my 
conception of Lee Corbin, the way a juxtaposition of glyphs is not 
instrinsically a number; even if some semantic interpreter would like that 
to happen, reality isn't that way.  (You can say that a mark of an ink or a 
pattern of pixels on my screen is not instinsically a glyph either without 
a semantic recognition mechanism to interpret it as such--and I would 
absolutely agree.)  So we utilize a lot of levels of indirection before we 
make our statements, and we can fool ourselves easily.  None of us can /be/ 
in two places at once, since we are basically 3-dimensional blotches of 
dirt who have come to think that they are animals, transhumans, whatever.

Because the copy is exactly you, at the moment the copy is 
made. After that point, you and the copy diverge, but if you end 
your life then, and the copy goes on, they can have all the same 
experiences that you do (they're you!) The experience of dying will 
have never occurred for this new copy. That is the only experience 
lost. The end result is the same as making a copy the way you 
would prefer, which is neuron replacement one-at-a-time. The 
means are different, the ends are not.

I don't believe in fate at all, but I do believe that if this copy is 100% 
accurate, it's going to experience the same things I do. It's fate of a 
different flavor, I guess.

Right, but as I think you admit, it's a contrived illusion for your

Well, I figure that most people who would make a first copy do so 
with the intent of transference to a more permanent substrate, in 
addition to enhanced abilities. So there's no reason to leave the 
original around when the other 'you' will be able to accomplish so 
much more. I guess the original can't fully know the glory of being 
that more powerful copy, so the original might want to go on as it 
always was. But the copy of you would really pity you! =)

How about this: you are unconscious when the copy is made. The 
copy comes into the world, also unconscious (in fact, in the very 
same state you are in). The original is then hacked to pieces with 
an axe, and the copy awakes. You are now the copy, and notice 
no discontinuity. You probably don't even feel remorse for the loss 
of the other, at least not on the same level as you would for a loved 
one. Is that better?

Of course, I know that the easiest solution to this illusory 'dilemma' 
is the method of uploading that you prefer: neuron replacement one-
at-a-time.

Heh.  Nice troll.  Actually, if you've had any exposure to the typical
NASA PR flack output in publications like NASA Tech Briefs, you quickly
learn to discount about 75% of the claims of "new, improved" coming out
of them.  I know that Bob Conger at Microcosm has been marketing an
autonomous satellite navigation system for about three or four years,
only to get a deafening NIH response.

Fault tolerant system management software has been in use in various
fields for quite some time- but only NASA claims to have invented the
best, most original version.  I'm underwhelmed.

Hmm.  That's interesting.  You're saying that the real, underlying
motive to become a materialist is that it makes problems tractable.
Not at all!   Think of the thousands of hours I have spent on this
question of identity.  Many times I have conceded that it would be
far, far simpler to just assume that everyone had a soul with a 
specific Serial Id# generated at conception.  Then all we have to
do is assume that molecular copies don't get the soul copied.  That
would be simple!  In fact, using the one Axiom "God Exists" makes
a lot of things simple.

No, what becomes tractable is that **if** you are a materialist,
then adopting the information theory of identity makes things
tractable.

No, I became a materialist months before I began pondering identity.
The laws of physics, and the reductionism behind them are very 
appealing.  I'm sorry that you aren't a materialist.

Doesn't this mean that if we ever could teleport (a la Star
Trek, where you are disintegrated here and reassembled there)
that you would refuse to travel by this means?   If so, then
you are quite wrong.  As soon as it became sufficiently cheap
and convenient, and as soon as all your friends started doing
it, your reservations would crumble away at once.

Yes!  That's exactly what he'd say.  Now you ask, Is this person
Yevgeny or not?  This is difficult to say; he has Yevgeny's
memories, but what of his attitudes or dispositions?  Does his
brain work the same way?  It's much like asking at what point
a beloved parent ceases being the person you knew and becomes
a vegatable.  But this imponderable is not germane.  If we
never had the original Yevgeny remaining in the pit, then
everyone would naturally (if they are a materialist) conclude
that Yevgeny had merely moved to the top of the pit, but had
been given a strange body.  It's clearly the same person, 
unless we start screwing with other parts of his brain.

Yes, but if you were a materialist, then you'd (presumably) agree
that there isn't any nature to a person that isn't a consequence
of the molecules.

Well, we don't know, now do we?  Very intelligent people in the
past were often wrong about what could be done.  I'm asking ***IF***
it turns out that your molecules could be swapped out quickly
and efficiently, would you just gradually fade away?  At the
end would we have a soulless machine that thought it was Emlyn
and who we all thought was Emlyn?  You tell me:  just what is
the difference between the copy and the original?

:-)  I don't think that I was so harsh.  I think that you're
just talking to yourself and being rather severe... I should
do that more often myself.

Well, in one way, I agree:  the life of the Yevgeny in the
pit is just as valuable as anyone else's on Earth, and it
is a tragedy if he has to die, compounded by the
unacceptableness of suffering first.

But on the bright side, he survives elsewhere.  If you were
a materialist, I'd try to persuade you that **where** he
survives doesn't matter so much.

Never read that one.  I hope that he wasn't implying that this
would prevent the original person from surviving the event.

I'm not sure what the latin is for proof-by-peer-pressure, but I'd be
surprised if it's regarded as a strong methodology. Anyway, there are a lot
of things on Star Trek that I wouldn't do... for a start, I'd install seat
belts. Call me old fashioned...

I need to ask a question at this point. There is a concept that identical
processes are the same process. I am not sure if this applies to objects...
If I make two structurally identical diamonds, are they the same diamond? I
am assuming a materialist would say they are not.

Instead, two physical processes (?) are the same if they are identical... is
that right? So, if I get two computers which are structurally identical, and
run identical programs on them, is some part of each of these a physical
process, and thus there is only one instead of two instances?

I hate the copy question.  But....

There seem to be two camps:  one that believes that a copy is the same
person and one that believes that a copy is a different person.  Neither
side can explain this belief to the other.  Both sides seem to use circular
reasoning, in that if the copy is the same person then killing the original
isn't suicide, but if the copy isn't the same person than you can't kill the
original.  The belief system seems to dictate the logical argument, and each
side has a consistent argument within their own belief system which does
nothing to inform the other belief system.

Yet, we keep trying....

Another way to state this difference seems to be this:  One camp is happy as
long as any copy survives.  The other camp is unhappy as long as any copy
dies.  The question may actually be:  Are we trying to achieve immortality
or are we trying to avoid death?  These may turn out to be different
questions.  My personal belief seems to be more interested in avoiding death
rather than achieving immortality.

My new explanation of my personal position is this....

I do not care about a copy, but want my original to live on.  My definition
of self is based on what I think and feel.  I can think thoughts in my own
brain, and this seems to be internal to me.  When other people think or when
computers think, they are external.  I read them as incoming data, but that
data exists whether I create it or not.  I cannot change the data by
changing my own mind.  Even if the external person has the same memories as
me or has been genetically engineered to look like me, I perceive my
thoughts internally and their thoughts externally.

An identical copy may be another "me" by all definitions.  It is an exact
duplicate.  However, I cannot read the copy's mind.  I do not know if it
thinks a different thought from me.  I can only perceive my own thoughts,
and cannot perceive the thoughts of the copy.  We may be identical at first,
but I don't *know* this.  People may tell me that its thoughts are exact
copies of mine, but I can't confirm this myself by observing its internal
thoughts.  I can't experience its emotions to decide if they are the same as
mine.  If it has a hidden thought or motive that it does not reveal, I
cannot know this because this attribute is hidden from me and kept to its
self.  Its self is not the same as myself, and what it keeps to itself it
keeps from me.  I still perceive the original thoughts in the original body
as internal to me.  I still perceive the copy's thoughts in the copy's body
as external to me.  Until I can experience my self in the copy, I cannot
conceive how it could be the same me.  I obviously experience it as
disconnected from me, even if it is "another" me or "separate" me.

This perception of reality, the center of thought and conscious cognition is
what I define as "me".  I experience reality through this view port known as
"me".  This is the definition of "me" that I seek to preserve.  I don't care
if a copy looks like me.  I don't care if a copy has been programmed with my
memories.  I don't care if no one else can tell us apart.  I still perceive
reality through a single body portal.  This body is "me", while the other is
not.  If I could wake up in a new body and perceive it, then I would agree
that it was me.  The problem with some copy procedures is that while the
copy wakes up as "me", the original also wakes up and says "nothing
happened, I'm still me."  Killing the original me before it has a chance to
wake up and object does not solve my problem.  I want the original to agree
that it has been transferred.  Killing it or taking some intervention to
prevent it from objecting does not remove the objection, it just prevents it
from being expressed.

Since my definition of "me" is experiential, I don't care if this "me"
evolves and is different now than it was before, it still is my reality
portal in a way that a copy is not.  I don't care if my body is morphed to
become totally different or if every atom is replaced with a different one,
my experience is still that I am still internal to this "me" and not another
copy of "me".  I don't even care if my mind is totally wiped so that I have
no memories of my previous life.  It would be tragic, but as a total
amnesiac, I would still perceive life from within my original body and not
from another copy.  Many of the copy procedure discussions focus on trying
to make the copy as close to the original as possible.  This is irrelevant
to me.  Other arguments try to argue that the original me is changing or is
not continuous.  These arguments are also irrelevant to me.  My problem is
that the original will still wake up and perceive itself in the old body
without having been moved.  (Unless you kill it first.)  It will wake up and
say "I am me."  The copy will also wake up and say "I am me."  I expect both
to believe that they are distinct individuals and will not want their own
instance to die.  Neither will be inclined to commit suicide after meeting
the other.  (What if the other is a dream or a fraud?  It claims to be "me",
but I don't feel that it is.  What if it wore a disguise and claimed to not
be me.  How could I be fooled into not being able to find or identify
myself?  It seems clear that there is a difference between the inescapable
me and the other unprovable me.)

That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.  This is my definition of "me" and
what I am trying to preserve.  Copy scenarios do not alter my attachment to
my original body.  Slow upgrades maintain my attachment as my body is
changed.  This may not be the definition used by other people, and may not
match the goals for preservation that other people have.

I will even go so far as to give this extreme example:  If my neurons are
replaced one by one with artificial ones, I would eventually perceive myself
inside the artificial body.  If my meat neurons are reassembled into a meat
brain, I would not feel that the meat brain was me, although the meat brain
would claim that it was.  If my artificial brain was wiped so that it had no
memory, I would still perceive it as me, and not the meat brain with my body
and all my memories.  In such a scenario, we built an artificial body "me"
and reassembled a meat body "me".  The process was done such that my
experience of "me" continued into the artificial body.  A new being was
created out of my old parts that would be a new me, with my old body and my
old memories.  I would consider it new and the artificial one to be the
original.  Both would have the same personality and memories.  Both would be
"me" by most definitions.  However, there was one "me" from meat-birth
through the artificial body.  The second "me" was created out of my old
parts afterwards and constitutes another me.  Both are valid, real, and
"me", but I would like the result of this scenario where I live forever in
an artificial body and will not experience death when the newly created "me"
in my meat body died.  I know this example is extreme, but I think it makes
my point for what I want to preserve.  I doubt this will convince anybody
who argues that the two beings should both self-identify and self-experience
both bodies simultaneously and equally valid.

Richard Rhode's excellent Pulitzer Prize winner, The Making of the
Atomic Bomb, p. 418.  Great story!  Can you imagine doing the
calculations at the last minute, then announcing to those gathered
"These calculations show that it is highly unlikely that this blast
will ignite the atmosphere, thus destroying humanity and indeed
all land-based life on this planet..."

Deniz Sarioz <ds1058@columbia.edu> wrote a very long post

massively flawed.  I sincerely wish that he had made
one or two points very well, concisely edited, as a
basis for further discussion.

As it is, I simply cannot respond to statements like

It doesn't even parse.  (By the way, do you have a spell-
checker?  You could use it.)

Here, I will only address the first point in that massive
post.

At 06:37 PM 5/30/01 -0400, you wrote:

This completely ignores my qualification that it is meaningless to conceive
of "merging memories" of different individuals.  (I wonder what "He'll be
like, of course" means, anyway.)

In fairness, he does add

*No one* is making the "bold claim that two distinct brains can be merged"!
Could you also be much, much more careful in formulating your arguments? 
This is the last time that I will respond to something from you so
obviously hastily written and with so little care.

No one to my knowledge has any idea how memories could be merged, any
more than anyone has any idea how a molecular copy of a person could be
created.  That doesn't matter.  The fact is, if you have an open mind
and a good imagination, you can easily imagine what it would be like
if you and your very close duplicate merged a few memories, as I 
explained in that document.  Therefore such a configuration of 
molecules is not only logically possible.  It is physically *possible*
(for it to exist).

There were many other interesting points in your paper (I think).
I invite you to discuss them further, one at a time.

Why should the original perish?  Is it in great agony or 
something?  Why can't you (the original) also go on to
enjoy life even as you (the uploaded duplicate) also
enjoy your new circumstances?

Sadly, I don't own this book - so what *is* the story?  Who did the
calculations, is the number "three in one million" real, was it before or
after the first test, and who demonstrated that igniting the atmosphere
was physically impossible afterwards?

:-)  That's great!  Who needs the Latin (although I concede that
it might add some dignity).  "Proof-by-peer-pressure".  I love it.

The point, of course, is that when you consult your intuition
about all this after you've finally gone on a lot of vacations
with your friends teleporting everywhere, "you" will dismiss your
previous doubts as philosophically old-fashioned.  Instinctively
"you" will realize that you and your buddies are really the
same people that they've always been.

Right.  The nearest thing, as you probably know, is in quantum 
mechanics where objects can be absolutely identical, to the point
that when you fail to take this into consideration, paradoxes
(such as Gibbs') arise.  But we don't want to go there.  No---
two objects shouldn't be spoken of as the same object.

>Instead, two physical processes (?) are the same if they are

Well (I hope that this isn't too weasily) for some purposes, yes.
If the marketing people ask you "hey, is that EXACTLY the same
process running on the new hardware" you'll say yes.  But if 
someone in the operating systems group asks you the same 
question (which would be very silly of them, of course)
then you'd say no.

Well, my opinion is that we would always say that there are two
instances.  Items that differ, even if only in location or time,
surely are regarded as different instances.

Regarding personal identity, I speak of there being two or
more instances of me in the case that close duplicates exist.

Yes, that is a wonderful book! By the way, both it and Rhode's equally good book
"Dark Sun; The Making Of The Hydrogen Bomb" are on unabridged audio tape.
Books on tape are great if you drive a lot.

Harvey Newstrom eloquently defends the notion that he
identifies only with one focus of perception.  But my
sentence, here, spoken in the objective mode, fails
to capture his point very well:

Yes, this is the attitude that I would also exhibit under
torture:  "Do it to him!  Not to me!".

Of course, I do not deny that this is how you and your duplicates
will all continue to **feel**.  But then, you **feel** the Earth
to be still.  Is there a fact of the matter in the case of
duplicates as there is in the case of whether the Earth is moving?
I say there is.

Your position, I think, becomes untenable in the light of certain
thought experiments.  The first one is an elaboration of, "Would You
Teleport?".  As said elsewhere in this thread, you would find that
indeed you would, and your philosophy (i.e. account of your actions
and prescriptions for your actions) would change accordingly.

But now consider the question of "Teleport With Delay", that is,
it turns out that there is a tenth of a second overlap between
the arrival of the duplicate at the remote station, and the 

disintegration at the local station.  Once again, employing,
as Emlyn calls it, "proof-by-peer-pressure", you'd still end up 
teleporting, saying "Oh what the hell, this is an emergency,
maybe I've been wrong".  But what if the overlap interval is
several minutes?  Would you do it then?  (Sorry if this question
is not to the point; I'm just guessing about where you are coming
from exactly.  But that's what I want to know now.)

Additionally (and parenthetically) there were what appear to
be some errors in the remainder of your post:

>Another way to state this difference seems to be this:
>One camp is happy as long as any copy survives.  The
>other camp is unhappy as long as any copy dies.

In my experience, these are not the two camps:  the real two
camps are those that embrace the information (or state) theory
and those who embrace the path (or continuity) theory.  As
stated, I don't know which of your two camps I'd be in.  Under
some circumstances, all that matters is that a single copy of
me doesn't die, so that I can end up propagating all over the
universe.  But in another way, each termination of a copy is
a tragedy, just as each cubic foot in Jupiter tragically is
not running me at this moment.

But whether its thoughts are exact copies of yours
is an empirical question.  You have long ago come to
rely upon instruments, and other people, and Quine's
"web of belief".  You know many facts that you
cannot personally attest to.  This would become
one of them.

Interesting.  Me too.  And someone else who wrote.  But the
old-time cryonicists, like Saul Kent and Mike Darwin, are
self-admittedly terrified of dying.

I agree entirely with what you wrote in your "meat-example",
just that I don't think it forces one to abandon recognizing
objective truths, like whether a certain object is Harvey
Newstrom or not, or whether a certain object is a Christmas
tree.

My preference is that one could use such a technology to extend someone's' 
lifetime, to eons, if they needed and desired it. Hence, my stipulation (and 
apparently, Chris Ledwiths') that the original being, be deceased, and the

even be essential for the "copy" to be copied right down to 'the 'quantum'

actually be that "person".

For me, unless they are producing a new society from the same identical 
individual
(as suggested in Saucer Wisdom by Rudy Rucker), I am concerned that these 
copies are merely, a kind of narcissism.  Seems to me that children, 
biological or adopted, are better to carry on family traditions then clones. 
Call it, my taste.

Imagine the most private and personal places on your body, would you w/o
hesitation allow your copy to do whatever it wants to this without
hesitation?

after all its doing it to itself isnt it?

why or why not?

Kerrrrist in a sidecar, haven't we solved the problem
like five years ago? As long as two (three, four, ...) 
copies remain in synch, they're the same person. There
is no measurement procedure which can tell them apart.

This can only occur in extremely controlled environment,
like a simulation where both the upload (deterministic 
model) and upload's input are identical down to a single
bit.

If this does not happen, a fork occurs, and you have
two individuals. At this point to have to ask the
individuals, whether they mind being terminated. The
answer is personal, I would very much mind being terminated
after I can become aware that we've forked.

I don't get it. This topic is so dead, it's not even smelling
anymore.

Rhodes does not mention the probability of 3 ppm.  He does
devote a page and a half to the story however.  Bethe examined
the possibility and calculated the energy level to ignite the atmosphere.
Quoting from the Rhodes' book, p.418:

...Teller offered several [possible reactions] which a fission bomb
or a Super [fusion bomb] might inadvertently trigger.  He proposed
to the assembled luminaries the possibility that their bombs might
ignite the earth's oceans or its atmosphere and burn up the world,
the very result Hitler occasionally joked about with Albert Speer.
[That Hitler, he was a real knee slapper when he got to joking
about incinerating the world.  sj]

Riiight!!! Yes, I would agree with this. Two instances of an abstract form -
in this case a type of person called Lee. Both the original and copy are
Lees, undoubtedly, as they are instances of the type of person called Lee.
However, for any given one of those Lees, I still maintain that the instance
is far more important than the type, to that instance.

Actually though, it's mostly about belief in these cases. A materialist
would be happy to use destructive teleport, and never know any problem, no
matter who is right about this. A non-materialist (does that make me a
dualist? Or something else?) on the other hand would not use it, and would
never know any problem again, no matter who is right.

Think of it like this, in your pit story... a materialist copy, standing on
the lip of the pit, will be happy enough that he is one with the original,
and so would the original, because they are materialists. They would make
their decisions based around this.

On the other hand, a non-materialist would have a non-materialist copy on
the pit lip. Neither of them would believe they were the same person as each
other, and both would behave accordingly. Likely they'd have a bit of
empathy for each other, actually (not that the materialists wouldn't, of
course).

Just out of interest, if that were me in the copy pit, I'd press the button
enough times that there were enough duplicates at the top of the pit that
they could get me out, by a chain of humans dangling over the edge, if
nothing else. Then we'd all wander back to civilisation together and start
the Great Society of Emlyns.

Lol!!!

You are going to see this topic reappear with increasing frequency as the
years go by. Eventually it'll turn up in a horribly munged form in the
mainsteam media, and stay there for quite some time, as we get closer to
copy technology.

It's a silly old philosophical problem, which is slowly turning into
something which people are going to need to have a position on, because they
may very well be faced with a real life situation where it matters to them
personally  - to upload or to not upload? (please assume usual disclaimers
that most paths will let us hit singularity before upload is possible, in
which case we most likely don't get the opportunity, etc etc etc)

You should save your email somewhere, and just forward it as necessary for
the next few decades.

Well, wait a second. From inside the sim they are identical... from outside
they are clearly not; they might even each map onto something as crude as
separate process ids. From each being's subjective position, they are not
identical... that being can say for certain "I am me, and the other guy is
not". Only to an external observer inside the sim are the processes
(intelligences) identical, and only given a highly contrived environment.
That's a pretty unreasonable basis on which to declaim the processes
"identical".

Me too... in fact, I'd object regardless of whether I knew we'd forked or

So the answer is "Yes"?  For example, suppose that there exists
in 3000A.D. an entity who resembles to a tiny fraction Tony
Blair, Prime Minister.  That is, this tremendous entity has
some of Blair's memories, but that's all.

I say that if you slowly turn into this entity, then you are
just as dead as if you slowly turn into a stone.  There are
objective reasons why a stone (or Mr Blair) is not Samantha
Atkins.  In order for something to be Samantha Atkins (to
varying degrees of fidelity) it must satisfy certain 
physical criteria (though we do not today know what those
are).

>I am pretty sure that I wouldn't have much fun running
>Samantha circa 2001 indefinitely.  

You speak, again, of a core you "running" these various
persona.  Okay, I can buy that.  Then let's direct my
remarks to your "core".  Do you want to evolve into
something that no longer has this "core"?

That's very interesting.  Of course we're being very crude
here, but it's revealing nonetheless.  Have any idea about
how many I.Q. points you could gain without undergoing this
loss of identity?  (You might not like that phrasing; help
yourself to a re-word.)

Oh, well, recall that boredom is an evolved process, like pain,
that helps us to survive.  If that's your only beef, well, there
will doubtless be correctives available.  Food and sex don't
"get boring" precisely because of natural selection, of course.

you know it was a joke? ie: that what I meant was that I think this holds no

But it is funny. I'd highly recommend finding the Latin if you seriously

Well, a materialist would.

I, on the other hand, would realise that I was Emlyn(n) from a series of
Emlyn's from 0 to n, where each previous Emlyn had "teleported" exactly
once, ie been dissassembled for scrap. I would be well aware that I was, at
some point thereafter, reassembled from the description of Emlyn(n-1) made
just before dissassembly.

Thus, I would be likely to avoid "teleport" machines like the plague, as I
would know that it would be instant death for me (plus life for someone just
like me at some point in the future. The caveat is that if I am Emlyn(i)
where i > 0, obviously I will do it under some circumstances. I'd assume
from my present vantage point as Emlyn(0) that these circumstances must be
coersive.

Now if dissassembly is a slow, painful process, I'd say it's fairly clear
that you'd not choose to do it, if you were informed. You'd wander up to a
machine, be scanned, then be slowly ripped to bits in agony.

However, if it's quick and painless, so that you are oblivious to it, then
the question of whether it matters or not is very interesting. If you don't
believe there's afterlife/god/etc (which I don't), and you are never aware
of your demise, but someone indistinguishable from you at the other end is
completely unaware of any problem (scanned before dissassembly), then what
does it matter?

It depends on how you define it, I guess. If your goal is to continue
survival of your class of person (Emlyn in my case), then there is no
problem at all... that's Lee's position I guess. Even if your goal is to
avoid death of the self, still where is the problem? There have been
absolutely no measurable consequences to your actions... each individual has
no issue with the process as a subjective experience, and any external
observer would just see a dissassembly and reassembly of an indivual...
functionally it's fine, if the passenger is happy with it.

So oddly enough, for me it comes down to consequences. What happens when the
individual dies, who is dissassembled? If the answer is "absolutely nothing
at all", then it's hard to see why there would be a problem. If some awful
torture was imposed on the being at the "for" end, on the other hand, then
there is a clear problem.

This looks like its going to be interesting...

Chris Ledwith wrote about overcoming our attachment to
"perceived"-self and embracing the uploading of equivalents.

(I agree with his arguments for the most part.)

After watching Damien squirming in the most recent edition
of "The Spike", that it "isn't him", I still haven't seen
any substantive arguments that make the case (No offense D.).

So Emlyn wrote:

Ah, well it depends on whether you are a "true" extropian or
just wearing the cloth.  If Eliezer and/or people working
on similar efforts are successful and a transcendent AI/SI
develops, then it would be moderately to extremely unextropian
to seek to preserve yourself in the face of this.  If you
look into the depths of a "god" and realize that it is
far far far superior for evolving itself into the greatest
complexity and self-expression possible (relative to you,
hanging onto outmoded notions of preserving your former self,
not slashing and burning your ineffective copies due to remnants
of human moral beliefs, etc.) -- then you clearly have to justify
hanging onto your matter and consuming energy in what is clearly
a sub-optimal state from the perspective of combatting entropy.

(Henceforth, I will refer to this as the "Extropians Dilemma".)
[I believe that I've stated this in prior emails or presentations
with the quote, "You must give up everything you are for what
you might become."]

So the problem is far far worse than you might suspect.  Not
only must you give up your "attachment" to your resident
consciousness in your current biological body, you must also
give up your attachment to your consumption of matter, energy,
and ideas that consume either of those resources.  Rejection
of these ideas immediately places you in the Bill Joy camp --
"here we go and we shall go no further".  You must be committed
to the path that the AI/SI is on (even if it means the elimination
of your former self) OR come up with a reasonable justification
for not being on that path.

So here is the challenge -- can anyone come up with an argument
that justifies the preservation and continued "operation" of
oneself in the face of clear evidence that more efficient
means (i.e. means that consume less matter & energy) are
available to "execute" ones consciousness?  Furthermore,
can anyone present an argument that the occupation and execution
of said means is justifyable if more efficient means to generate
information content (extropization) are available?

You have "inalienable" rights by virtue of being born a human.
Are those rights "inalienable" if you choose to be an extropian?

Harvey made a great post about individual identity as a proxy-continuity
of a membrane separating an internal consciousness from an external world,
and how it made copying irrelevant to the fact that the original (or slowly
modified) body is still a precious, separate, individual, that cannot be
killed against its will, even though this will might be unexpressed.
This correctly represents my opinions on this topic. Thanks, Harvey.

However, there are a few silly things I'd like to add:
* no copy is ever perfect. If these contain hadrons, they have a disjoint
 quantum state from mine; they cannot be the same as I; actually in a
 curved universe, there is no way in which you can ever have an isometry
 between two different objects.
* however, a copy may theoretically be "good enough" for many purposes,
 including being indistinguishable from each other by third parties
 through some kind of Turing test.
* still, the original body has a separate identity,
 and destroying it increases entropy quite a lot,  as opposed
 to keeping it (all the more since every body is an extropy pump).
* a funny thought experiment, variant of that proposed by Harvey about
 slow upgrade vs copy, is when you anaesthesize the patient,
 slowly remove his natural cells or organs and replace them
 with functionally equivalent artificial ones, and finally
 reconstitute the original self with his original cells and organs,
 all that while he's unconscious, and with supposedly "good enough"
 technology so that it's hard to tell people apart from their behavior.
* Well, somehow, the artificial self is now the original, while the
 natural self is now the copy. But note that your "functional equivalence"
 cannot be perfect, so with such a full replacement,
 you must at best admit that is always a very traumatized "self"
 that awakes from such an experiment, and at worst admit that
 you've actually killed the original individual,
 replacing it with two mock copies.
* Even though they are different individuals, you might still have
 some close interest in copies, since they can be a way to spread
 your genes and memes beyond your individual life. However, it is true
 that you can be mostly indifferent to which copies of oneself survives,
 whereas one has a direct interest in being a copy that survives in as
 extended (space*time*complexity integral) a life as possible.

That's funny, because since long before I was told about the extropians
(well, long ago, I was already shortly told about them, but the web page
bored me so I didn't look further), I have been preparing a novel on the
implications of copying being possible. It's still but a meta-novel, and
it's in french, but some of you might enjoy the plan...
	http://quatramaran.ens.fr/~roman/lit/roman/DupExec/

Its conclusion is that the extropy pumping necessary to make a good enough
copy is such that it is likely a waste to use it to make an identical copy
of some person instead of developing its own fantastic potential as an
individual personality. Said otherwise, good enough copy seems to me to
be AI-hard, and whoever takes the decision to spend all those
free-energetic (F=E-TS) resources at copying instead of running an AI,
is likely to be making quite a wasteful, immoral, decision, of which
he should be held responsible. Or maybe not: that's just a conjecture.

I think the problem with this claim is that extropy is not in itself about 
combatting entropy. That could be served just as well by turning off all 
stars and freezing the universe, which I think would go against most of our 
visions and be exceedingly boring. Rather, extropianism seeks to increase 
*value* in the universe. But value is not something you can easily measure on 
a scalar scale, so hence you cannot apply the utilitarian approach that the 
value of one SI equals (say) a billion human values. An SI plus a human is 
more worth than just one SI or vice versa, but that partial order is the best 
we can do. Hence we must instead look at what systems of rights and 
interactions that best allow agents to increase their value, hopefully with 
maximal efficiency.

I think you demand a bit too much extropian orthodoxy (what a nice 
contradiction in terms!) here. If I have the highest ambitions (very 
morning I chant the affirmation "I am evolving closer and closer to the Omega 
Point" while shovering :-) then I must also give up nearly everything as you 
say. But suppose my ambitions are less dramatic, just seeking to fulfill some 
needs (lets say becoming something akin to a Greek god)? I would definitely 
not say the transhumanist seeking just immortality, beauty and creative power 
is in the same camp as Bill Joy.

The difference lies in how we interpret "I won't do that". Bill Joy thinks it 
implies "Nobody should do that", while a liberal transhumanist interpretation 
would be "I won't do that, but go ahead if you want to. Just don't come back 
crying to mommy when you find out that you didn't like to be a sentient 
internet protocol!".

I did a rough sketch above, based on the subjectivity of value. It can of 
course be refined, but I don't have the time and skill for the moment. But I 
think the argument has been done very eloquently in much of the liberal and 
libertarian literature (where it of course merely dealt with humans) that 
unless everybody has adopted the same standards of what constitutes value, 
the best way of ensuring that value develops (as experienced by the different 
agents) is to give them maximal freedom to do so, including the very 
implortant right to continue existing. 

If everybody and everything agreed that it was just information production 
that matters, then the conversion of the universe into computronium would be 
a trivial issue. But it still doesn't follow that one SI produces information 
as efficiently as a large number of HIs (modulo some overhead, that can be 
fixed by shared libraries and handwaving :-), especially if variety of the 
information is regarded as valuable. 

> You have "inalienable" rights by virtue of being born a human.
> Are those rights "inalienable" if you choose to be an extropian?

I would suggest extending these rights into "posthuman rights", that hold for 
any entity that is an ethical subject.

Of course they're identical, whether from inside or the outside, just

If you add additional bits to the bit vector describing a complete person
state you can make them differ, but not in a functional sense. The label
is not used in processing. As soon as the label bits enter the algorithm,
and as soon as label bits are different you have a bifurcation. Boom.

Once again: the label is an external state. It is not used in the
algorithm. As soon as it is used in an algorithm, it ceases being just an
external label.

If you're in perfect synch, you _can't_ bifurcate. You can be aware of it,
but this doesn't matter: the other guy is also aware of it. Whatever you
think, you both think exactly the same thoughts in unison.

Identity is a boolean metric, which only occurs in such contrived
environments. This is similiar to two systems both being in the exact the
same quantum state: they both are nondistinguishable, but in practice you
can't put two macroscopical systems in exactly the same state (well, okay
Bose-Einstein condensate does come close).

In practice, people are talking about similiarity when they're saying
"identity". Of course two cloned-state people are very similiar
immediately after bifurcation, but it only goes downhill after that. Even
a single bit diff introduced during noncompressed state space evolution
flow will result in exponential deviations. After fork, assuming the diff
doesn't erase itself (only possible under very weird circumstances, and
for very small perturbations), you both are different persons, in fact
drifting away from each other with each subsequent time tick. After a few
years, you'd even look different.

If we haven't forked, and I know it, I would still object on general
principle. I would demand from the operator that he will remove the synch
boundary condition, and allow the other clone to become a person (or me a
person, whatever).

Nothing if not extreme. I kinda like it.

Just to clarify something, we need to talk about super goals here I think.
My super goal in most of these discussion is "I don't want to die".

Apparently Roberts supergoal is "Be as EXTROPIAN as possible". Robert
apparently is basing this goal on the following definitions, from
extropy.org:

EXTROPY - the extent of a system's intelligence, information, order,
vitality, and capacity for improvement.
EXTROPIANS - those who seek to increase extropy.

This is a damned interesting tack to me. It seems there's another way to
define an Extropian, which is an intelligent entity who follows the
Extropian principles (http://www.extropy.com/extprn3.htm).


Ok, so we've got EXTROPIANS, who follow the first definition, and
Extropians, who follow the second.

It seems clear to me that an EXTROPIAN would agree with Robert, that an
inferior form of the self should not be tolerated, and should be shut
down... with the caveat that this is only true if the matter and energy
consumed by the inferior EXTROPIAN is actually in demand. If it is a choice
between existing, or ceasing to exist knowing that the useful elements of
the EXTROPIAN's body will not be used instead by a more "worthy" being, the
EXTROPIAN would choose the former, irrespective of the existence or not of
more "worthy" beings.

Whereas, I think an Extropian would be a far more independently minded
critter. The idea of shutting him/herself down so that some atoms might be
claimed by a better would be kind of ludicrous. Certainly, the decision that
oneself is so hopeless as to not be worth the air one breathes, in relation
to other organisms, would be inconsistent with Practical Optimism, at a
minimum.

By Robert's reasoning, the EXTROPIAN point of view would be that the human
race right now should have a big standardised IQ test, and the winner should
be given the world's resources, whilst the rest of humanity basically works
toward a foolproof method for molecular duplication of the winner, then
commits mass-suicide. Silly.

Interestingly, what would that society of the mass copied "winner" be like?
Would it be functionally better or worse than the current human
civilisation, from the perspective of EXTROPY?

Likely, it would be worse, because of it's homogenous nature.

Extropy in it's various definitions supports and encourages diversity,
individualised approaches. Natural selection favours this too. Even the
relative losers (species-wise) in natural selection are valuable, because
they embody alternative approaches that might be useful when the next
environmental shift comes along. So to drop in and erase all the hopeless
species ahead of their "time" is an entropic act. Similarly, to kill of an
old version of an individual simply because a superior version could use its
resources, could in many cases (more so as we move toward extreme
homogeneity, extreme dominance of the superior) be said to be an
anti-EXTROPIC act, let alone anti-Extropic, because the reduction in
diversity is a potential cost which outweighs the gain from giving those
extra (minimal) resources to the superior copy.

Another good reason? Because I don't want to - surely that's covered by
Extropianism.

Inalienable rights? There's a funny notion... you are American, aren't you?

Let me add a remark regarding that JPL Press Release and other science
press releases, for those of you innocent of the process.

Those press releases are usually (originally) written by the
scientists themselves, therefore please take what you read with a
grain of salt. The words *might* be exaggeration or hype depending on
the concerns or personality of the person/people writing it. I usually
am extremely critical of those releases, and I tend to extract what I
think is the essence of the report, and I don't pay too much attention
to any "quotes" by the scientists in the report.

As a participater/object in one of those kind of scientific press
releases last year, I can say that it's a surreal experience to write
a press release about your own work as if you were interviewed by a
science reporter. 

(Of course my own press release was perfect ;))

Government Sued Over Stem Cells
By CHRISTOPHER NEWTON, Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) - Seven scientists and actor Christopher Reeve have
filed a federal lawsuit accusing the Bush administration of illegally
withholding funding for stem cell research.

In the suit, they say the administration is doing ``irreparable harm''
by delaying the creation of therapies they believe could save lives.

The Bush administration, which has halted all funding and ordered a
review of the issue, now has less than 60 days to respond to the
lawsuit.

``We are not suggesting that the administration should begin funding
projects immediately,'' plaintiffs' attorney Jeffrey Martin said
Tuesday. ``We just want the process to move forward quickly, and with
consideration of existing laws. We do not want delay because of
politics.''

Reeve, who played Superman in four movies, has been an active voice
for stem cell research since a horse-riding accident left him
paralyzed.

The lawsuit, filed earlier this month in Washington, claims that Bush
officials have skipped over administrative procedures necessary to
halt research that federal statutes have made legal.

Last year, the National Institutes of Health (news - web sites) passed
guidelines that allow federal funding of some research involving stem
cells, which many scientists believe have the potential to help repair
injured or deteriorating organs.

The issue of federal funding for the research is especially sensitive
because it sometimes involves experimentation with embryonic stem
cells.

Those cells are derived from leftover embryos destined to be discarded
after test-tube fertilization. Some ethicists and abortion opponents
say it is wrong to use them for research, because it could encourage
the creation of embryos for science.

Stem cell experiments on animals have shown promising results, but
there is no conclusive evidence of the potential benefits of stem cell
therapies on humans.

The lawsuit makes bold claims that, by delaying stem cell research,
the Bush administration is ``preventing or delaying the advent of a
cure for paralysis, Parkinson's Disease, diabetes and other
debilitating conditions.''

``There is, in essence, a moratorium that is delaying the funding,''
Martin said.

In one of his first actions as president, Bush asked U.S. Department
of Health and Human Sciences Secretary Tommy Thompson to review the
guidelines of funding for stem cell research. That process includes
the creation of a review board, which, as of late last week, has never
met.

The lawsuit could force health officials to explain where they are in
the review process.

``This is great because it will hopefully embarrass the Bush
administration into action,'' said researcher Tim Dale of the Malen
Clinic in New York. ``At the very least it will make them explain
themselves.''

Among the plaintiffs are James Thompson of the Wisconsin Regional
Primate Research Center, Roger Pedersen of the University of
California, John Gearhart of Johns Hopkins University, Douglas Melton
of Harvard University, Dan Kaufman of the University of Wisconsin, and
Alan Osborne Trounson and Martin Pera, both of Monash Medical Centre
in Australia.

Trinity experiment.

Emilio Segrè told me that an accurate calculation,
about that problem, was made by himself and Bruno
Rossi, by order of Robert Oppenheimer.
"When we were performing that calculation (involving pressures,
neutron density, temperatures, etc.) we also met Enrico Fermi,
who has already done his own calculation."

Segrè told that the main danger was the production of
U-235, at Oak Ridge. For some reason (military secret)
nobody, at Oak Ridge, was aware about the critical mass
problem. So they used to stock very dangerous quantities
of U-235 ! Oppy immediately sent Segrè down there ....

Oak Ridge also though if there was a fire they should use water on the U to
put out the fire! Apparently no one bothered to tell them that would speed
up neutrons and cause a radiation flash.

Oh Well, as they say your tax dollars at work.

Its not a matter of should(s), so much as its a matter of deciding what is 
most important. If there is a critical, human need for copies, existing in 
the same space-time,  then by all means, replicate! But why should copies be 
a primary goal, if there is no need, and the original is healthy, and there 
are  perhaps, precautions taken, beforehand, in the event of death? 
Otherwise, why 'clone' in the 1st place, Lee?

Lets step back and ask, why copy somebody in the first place, if not to 
preserve a person's life and memories, and personality?  Until we hit a 
technological level in the galaxy (hand-waving here), what viable good is 
achieved by zillions of copies? If, individuals wish to travel the universe 
(why would replica human bodies be the primary choice)? I could see copies 
being an option. Why use copied human bodies, why not copied human 
personalities, loaded onto interstellar craft? 

I am more focused on the philosophical notion that post mortem survival is 
best served by pattern identity theory. When the pattern(s) diverge, the 
original remains the original, and the copies, end up being completely 
different people, given enough time.

You need not agree, Lee; however I hope this clears up my position on this. 
In my hierarchy of needs, if I had my 'druthers', I'd druther have practical 
immortality then post-mortem existence, multiple, nonlinear, noncontiguous, 
clones. Realistically, we'll be lucky indeed, if we even are able to achieve 
clones.

We went out the Saturday night and stoped by one bar that was showing music
videos. Perhaps we don't go out enough!

One song "Rock DJ" was the title showed a striper dancing and striping.
Nothing new here but after his clothes were off he pealed off his skin and
muscle and internal organs and threw them into the crowd until there was
only a wire frame dancing.

I hope he uploaded ahead of time :-)

I posted the above to another site and someone knew the video and it's WEB
site so I thought I would pass it on if anyone here thought it interesting.

"You guys are talking about Robbie Williams (formerly of British boy group
Take That!). The name of the song is "Rock DJ."

	It wouldn't be in any agony, but it wouldn't be satisfied
being stuck all alone in the primitive very limited isolated ineffable
world of it's awareness inside its lonely skull either.  Surely it
would eventually want to enhance and expand its world of conscious
awareness.  Surely it'd like to gain the ability to link and expand
its world of awareness to include direct duplicate experiences of
those of it's uploaded self (and the rest of the world), so it could
eff and be directly aware of some of the same phenomenal experiences.

	Think about it, could you be satisfied with our very low
resolution, very limited sort of 2-1/2 D visual awareness with only 3
primary colors...?  Wonder if you knew you could instead upgrade
yourself to have fully 3D conscious awareness (able to be visually
aware of the back sides of 3D objects, either via memory/simulation or
via input from another visual data source on the other side of the
object) at 1000 times the resolution (you wouldn't need a microscope)
with hundreds of thousands of times the extents (you could comprehend
in fully 3D ways, the distance between the moon, sun, and stars you
were looking at, rather than it being as if they were flat cut outs
pasted on the sky all apparently the same measly few miles away....)
And wonder if you had 16 diverse primary color qualia or more to
represent a much larger portion of the electromagnetic spectrum....
Not to mention the ability to eff and share all these greatly enhanced
subjective experiences with the rest of the world....  Some of these
phenomenal things being just for starters!

Teller raised the possibility then Bethe proved, not that it was impossible but
only extremely unlikely. I've heard the figure of 3 parts in a million too but I can't
remember where. I think you should read "Nuclear Hostages" by Bernard J O'Keefe.
O'Keefe was at almost all of the U.S. bomb tests and has stories that would make your
hair curl. Like the "Bravo" H bomb test, they figured that if everything went perfectly
they might get 5 megatons, instead they got over 15. This thing was so big that observers
50 miles away who were not easily impressed and had witnessed many nuclear blasts
forgot their scientific training and thought for a few seconds that the atmosphere had
been ignited, the fireball just seemed like it would never stop growing. Japanese fisherman
well outside the official danger zone were killed and many native residents on "safe"
islands were made sick. O'Keefe was in the firing bunker on another island about  5 miles
from the blast, the building shock so much people were getting seasick. Even with 4 feet of
solid concrete the radiation was approaching dangerous levels, the firing crew was trapped
for several days in the bunker till the radiation was reduced, then they used bed sheets as
makeshift radiation suits and ran for the rescue helicopter. O'Keefe also admits he was
terrified when he fired a canon and then ran like hell and jumped into a ditch before the
world's first nuclear artillery shell exploded, he thought the test was poorly planed and
the design of the bomb unsafe.

The Nevada nuclear disposal site isn't necessarily a good example, as the 
situation is more complex there.  I am more familiar with the Nevada 
nuclear repository situation than most people and have discussed it in 
detail with Nevada politicians on more than one occasions.  In theory, the 
Nevada repository is as good an idea as any.

First, the people of the state of Nevada object in principle to the Federal 
government forcing them to do *anything*, as the Feds have historically 
abused that ability in Nevada.  Furthermore, they object because it is 
essentially a case of eastern politicians forcing Nevada to become the 
dumping ground for the hazardous waste they don't want to store in their 
own states -- strong-arm political tactics basically.

Second, like most Americans, many people in Nevada display a knee-jerk 
rejection of anything "nuclear" without the slightest clue as to what the 
risks actually are.  I personally don't have a problem with the nuclear 
waste storage facility in Nevada on scientific grounds.

Third, because the Federal government and other states have so much 
invested in the nuclear repository in Nevada, it gives the State of Nevada 
a powerful political bargaining chip with which to obtain concessions on 
other issues (such as land use issues).  The State of Nevada has been very 
successful in putting up roadblocks to the completion of the waste site and 
have the ability, using their power as a State, to delay the operation for 
decades even if the Federal government manages to ram it through.  Given 
that the waste site is probably inevitable, the State is using the highly 
unpopular Federal project as a focal point of political power for Nevada on 
the Federal level and milking it for what its worth.  Because the project 
is strongly opposed by both the Democrat and Republican parties in Nevada 
(for different ideological reasons), the Federal government has found it 
essentially impossible to undermine the resistance shown by the state on 
this issue.

The Nevada protests have as much to do with politics and other unrelated 
issues as they do with the simple issue of nuclear waste storage.

In exchange for accepting the waste dump, the State of Nevada got all sorts
of goodies, including a Cray Y-MP for the computer science dept. of UNLV

A statistician friend of mind, when I lived in Vegas, was hired by the
federal gov't to produce a report assessing the probability of the waste
dump site ever being hit by an earthquake.  Of course he predicted it would
be millions of years before an earthquake affected the site.  Not trying to
be dishonest, I *guess* ... but an opposite conclusion might well have
resulted in him not getting any more grants...

A few months after he published his report, there was a
7-on-the-Richter-scale earthquake in California, which totalled the
buildings on the waste dump site.

Hmmmmm....

I love nuclear power, in theory.  But I don't think that modern geoscience
is really up to the task of guaranteeing us that radioactive waste will be
effectively contained for long period of time in various burial sites.  I'm
not saying that nuclear power is too dangerous to use -- but I *am* saying
that we can't trust the processing being used to assess its safety (academic
researchers on government grants, or worse yet, gov't employees).

I agree with you.  And yet, people keep showing up on the list insisting
that a copy is an acceptable way to upload.  This is an FAQ, but we do not
have consensus on the answer.  You and I agree the answer is obviously one
way, but a bunch of other people insist that the answer is obviously another
way.

Unfortunately, this discussion is going down the exact same route that it
always goes.  I'm not sure how to respond to change the sequence of this
discussion.  I feel like Bill Murray in groundhog day.  No matter what I do
or say, the arguments coming back and the examples are always the same.

The teleport question is really the same as the copy question.  Detailed
discussions about how a teleport would really build a copy and dispose of
the original turn out to be the same as the copy/uploading procedure.
People's answer to this question tend to match their answer to the
copy/upload question.

This makes no difference to me or someone who identifies with their
perceived experiential viewport to the world.  It doesn't matter how much
time elapses between the original or the copy, wherever one wakes up, that
is where one is.  Looking at a clock has no effect on self-identity.  I wake
up and think, oh I'm inside this body now.  Looking at a clock or a GPS does
not effect my reaction.

Wrong.  This argument only works for people who don't believe the teleport
kills them.  For those who believe the teleport equals death, they will
never commit suicide "just this once."  This argument only appears valid
when projected on the other side.  No one would take this viewpoint for
themselves if they believe "just this once" equals permanent death.

  But what if the overlap interval is

Same answer as before.  The distance in space or time does not affect my
answer.  Calling the procedure a copy, upload, teleport, or delayed teleport
does not affect my answer.  Every being that wakes up perceives itself
inside its respective body.  Each perceives the others as outside their
body.  They are all identical and equally valid, but each person is still
limited to experiencing life trapped within their one-and-only body.

I disagree.  I do not identify with either of the two camps you have
defined.  You have chosen one camp and are arguing against the other camp.
You are not addressing my concerns which seem to be a third camp.  That is
why I do not use the same words to describe the two camps.  The important
differences that concern me are not the same as the differences you
perceive.

But what if I told you that the Jupiter copy is already running.  Kill
yourself now on my say-so.  Why won't you?  Just because you can't detect
that you are really immortal on Jupiter?  Surely some self-preservation
keeps you from killing yourself just because some external party tells you
to.  I can make films of you, simulate your actions, and play back your own
e-mails back to you from Jupiter.  Somehow, I still don't think you would be
convinced to kill yourself.  Why sacrifice yourself for another copy of
yourself?  He won't perceive the dying of the light when you kill yourself.
His mind won't fade as you lose consciousness.  The consequences of death
will still happen to you, just as surely as any death strikes down anyone.
I'm not sure how a Jupiter simulation of you alleviates your desire to live.

I would argue that there may be a copy of you running on Jupiter or
elsewhere.  How would you know?  If the copy would be disconnected from you,
and you would have no direct knowledge of whether it exists or not.  If NASA
informs you that Voyager found you at Jupiter, you would have only their
word for this claim.  You could not get this knowledge from the other you.
If they both were the same "you", why do you have more knowledge and control
over the Earth-bound you as compared to the Jupiter-you.  Obviously, you are
more connected to this copy than that copy.

Not true.  I rely on no one else to tell me who I am, what I feel, or what I
think.  This is what makes the internal me different than the rest of the
external universe.  I have direct access to my own self while no one else
does.  I do not have direct access to things outside of me, while other
people might.  This is the one and only difference.  You seem to admit that
I will not have direct knowledge of the new me like I used to with the old
me.  This thing that I lose with the new me is the exact thing that I am
seeking to preserve.  My only criteria for survival is that I continue to
experience myself continuing throughout life.  The copy is exact in all ways
to external people, but it loses the one special connection to my self that
I have.  The only thing that makes me special and unique to me is the one
thing the copy procedure destroys.

I do not object that there can be multiple Harvey Newstroms.  I can even
envision scenarios where they all have equal claim to being "me".  But each
of the new me's will only experience one and only one body.  They will not
be magically or telepathically linked.  Whichever individual body that each
new me wakes up in, that will be the one and only one that it perceives as
itself.  None of them will point to another one and claim "that is me."
They will all point to themselves and say "this is me."  Whichever me I
currently inhabit, that is the one that I wish to preserve. Saving a
different copy of me while I experience the death of my own me is what I
call death.  Having other me's survive is merely what I would call having
clone-children survive my death.

(I have an identical twin already.  The fact that some external people can't
tell us apart does not confuse me as to which twin is me.  I have always
been in my body and never teleport between bodies.  Even if my twin were
brainwashed with my memories and personality, I still wouldn't be fooled.  I
am still me, he is a natural clone with false memories implanted.  I don't
see how this duplicate twin is "me".  It is merely similar in appearance and
action to external parties.)

Devil's advocate:

* Many private companies have announced plans to build various space
  infrastructure components (not counting objects designed never to
  require visits from spacecraft after launch, for instance
  ground-to-ground communication satellites).  These were honestly
  serious plans (at least at first), not mere speculation about
  possible future ventures.
* All of them, save for the few that national government agencies
  (NASA, Energia, etc.) have lead the efforts on, have yet to actually
  put so much as a single bolt into orbit, and look unlikely to suceed
  (and thus become relevant to the general public) until someone
  suceeds at (not just attempts to) bring down the cost of private
  space access.  (Though there are many attempts at this currently
  underway, none of them have been successful yet.  Although hopefully
  one will in the near future and this problem can go away, current
  reality of utility of investments must face this fact of life.)
* This is yet another example of the first, and as such is expected to
  decay into the second.

I wish more people investing in space infrastructure would see this and
invest more heavily in the space access companies (say, XCOR), rather
than in the companies that propose to exploit space but can only work
once cheap space access becomes real (say, Bigelow's venture), lest the
money invested in the latter goes to waste while the underfunded
attempts at the former drag on for lack of funding.  The presence of
the latter is necessary to demonstrate that there are customers for the
former, but there are far more than enough of the latter for this
purpose.

We don't know enough to resolve this issue.

What about all the identical twin studies showing low-level telepathy
between identical twins?  Does anyone here believe them?  I'm not a true
believer by any  means, but I'd give them a >5% chance of being true.

And if identical twins' minds are somehow bound together (quantum resonance?
morphic resonance?  trans-substantial nonlinear sub-quark-level voodoo?),
then wouldn't two copies' minds be even more closely bound together?

Wouldn't they perhaps *feel* each other at first ... and then feel each
other drift away... decorrelate...

If you could feel part of yourself in the mind of your copy, then maybe you
wouldn't mind physically dying as much as you would *without* that feeling.
Never having been there, how can we know??

To me, the answer to this question (the psychological nature of uploading
via copying) is not obvious one way or another.

"Harvey Newstrom" <mail@HarveyNewstrom.com>,

	I have a question for you.  I've enjoyed reading your
responses to Lee.

	We are aware of a bunch of stuff at the same time right?  For
example, there is the left side of our field of vision, and the right
side of our field of vision....  While we are aware of all this visual
stuff at the same time, we can also smell, hear sounds, are aware of
our body in this visual space....  Some how, our brain unifies this
into one unified conscious experience which we are subjectively aware
of all at once.

	If we discovered how our brain does this we should also be
able to expand this conscious space right?  We could do this by adding
to the cortexes that produce our current consciousness right?  For
example, let's say an additional artificial visual cortex was grafted
onto your brain.  Let's say this cortex was fed data from another
person's eyes.  Let's say it was grafted into your brain in such a way
that the other person's spatial awareness from his eyes was projected
into your conscious visual world.  Let's say you then experienced and
were subjectively aware of both visual views at the same time, within
the same subjective space or awareness.  For example, if the other
eyes were looking at you, and at the same time could see behind you,
your awareness would expand to include an externally viewable
representation of you and it would include visual data of stuff that
was behind you, something like one would imagine if they had eyes in
the back of their head....

	Now, imagine if it were possible to do this joining such that
the artificial cortex was a million miles away?  Surely there must be
at least a very complex interneural communication system where
individual neurons in your brain could directly communicate with
nearly all the neurons in the remote artificial cortex.

	Imagine that this could be achieved with more than just an
artificial visual cortex, but could be done with, say a twin's or
copies entire brain.  With such, you both would be directly
subjectively aware of each other in the same conscious awareness.  You
would feel and see everything he knows, and he would know the same as
you.  There would be two representations in this joined subjective
world, one for you, and one for him, and they would both exist in the
same consciousness.

	Perhaps it wasn't a twin, but a color blind person.  You'd
both be obviously aware of the fact that red/green for one person was
experienced drastically different for the other.  Since you were both
subjectively directly aware of each of your knowledge, you could
compare and contrast the difference just as you can now be aware of
the difference between say the taste of salt and the color of red, or
between a red tree in your left field of vision and a green one on
your right.

	If you happened to be a copy on a ship that was tragically
about to fall into the sun or something, and this remote conscious
merge with your twin back on earth, was such that the representation
of you, your conscious knowledge of yourself, all of it's memories and
experiences and everything, could transfer over this mind meld link to
enhabit an expanded conscious world of your twin, would this lesson
your fear of the eminent death of one of you?  Both of you, for as
long as the link could be maintained, would experience the pain and
suffering that the you will experience as you fall into the sun.

	Of course, this is something like how I think things could
work, and if it could be done this way, it sure would lesson my fear
of being "transported", "copied", "uploaded" or whatever.  If it
couldn't be done this way, and the old body would just be destroyed,
the different memories lost, no effing.... yes, to me, that would be
near the same as death, but I'd at least be somewhat thankful, that
the copy of me could go on existing.

Answer 1)
Perhaps this is a good reason to upload ourselves to quantum computers
instead ;)

Answer 2)
I think this is not exactly right.  If a digital system is in constant
real-time interaction with a quantum system (e.g. a message router whose
timing is susceptible to optical quantum noise, a human typing on a keyboard
at a rate determined by his hypothetically quantum-mechanical brain), then
the digital system itself may be considered a macroscopic quantum system.
Isolated, it's a classical system, but there may be no way to isolate it
without destroying its essence (a mind in a sensory deprivation chamber is
no longer the same mind exactly)....



A brief postscript.  Eli knows this but everyone else may not.  I am not a
strong "quantum mind" enthusiast; I definitely think superhuman intelligence
is achievable on digital computers, operating in classical physics modes.
But I also think that quantum computing can add a lot to computers, and I
consider it quite possible that the brain is a macroscopic quantum system in
some pragmatically meaningful sense.  Quantum resonance is one way to
accelerate thinking; classical digital minds will have others.  There are
many ways to make a mind.

Squirming? Not on your nelly, mate. I'm dead set against it. Regardez vous:

==================

The bottom line, I conclude, is that physical and general brain-process
continuity support our current sense of continuing identity. They allow us
to believe that the person who wakes up tomorrow is the same one who went
to sleep tonight. What of awakening after ten years in a coma? Nobody
denies that this case is deeply traumatic, but still we assume that *the
same person* has woken up. Waking after half the brain is removed to
forestall death by cancer? No one denies that this case is even more deeply
troubling. 
	But look-- Even if *I* can't tell the difference between you and your
perfect clone, *you* surely can, as they strip your brain down. 

Don't beam me up, Scotty

If I were copied by a teleport machine, xeroxed elsewhere by a `transporter
beam', and the one at the transmitter end was to be killed (to even up the
metaphysical balance of the universe), I'd go kicking and screaming... I'd
be not one whit reconciled by the simultaneous existence of my double in
the receiving pod-- *unless* I had remained, throughout, in perfect
nonlocal continuous connection/identity with him. In that case, I'd swiftly
get used to the notion that it was just like dropping off to sleep on the
jet and waking up in another town. Of course, I could be *fooled* into
believing that this were the case, even if a destructive-uploading expert
knew it wasn't, which would soothe my dread. `Just step into the nice warm
shower, Damien...' But I'd rather not be deceived in that way. 

THE SPIKE, p. 212
=======================

The only squirming I'm doing there is away from that damned
destructive/reconstructive matter duplicator...

This is why I am not interested in copies that are identical to myself.
There is no advantage.  If I were to copy or upload myself, I would want the
new body to be very different from the old one.  Therefore, similarity
between the old and new version have nothing to do with my definition of
identity or my goals.  I *want* to be transferred to a radically changed
person!

That's not a good reason.  The correct answer is "What

Maybe this is fine for the non-materialists, and maybe not.   More later.

This is where I have a problem with the concept of identical copies being
the same mind.  There is a mystical belief that they are connected
telepathically in some unexplained way.

I have a twin brother.  We do not have telepathy.  None of the twins I have
ever met claimed to have telepathy.  This seems to be something that
non-twins seem to think twins will have.

If the copy question requires telepathy to transfer my consciousness, I
definitely would not bet my life on it.

Thanks.  I enjoy discussing these kinds of questions with intelligent people
who have a different point of view.  I seek to understand their view and
hope to be able to articulate my own.

Very good example.  I would see the world from two different locations at

Then these two people would be merged into one concept of self.  Everything
within both persons would be perceived as "internal self."

Nope, sorry.  This is like watching a fancy TV or holodeck, where I
experience life through the other person.  This is exactly what it would
seem like to be that other person.  But like a TV, it ends when the show is
over.  As soon as the link breaks, I'm still in my original body and not in
the other body.

Imagine that this is just a form of super-TV.  I am watching star-trek and
see/feel/experience flying through the cosmos with Mr. Spock.  Do I fear
death from the Klingons?  No, because it is not real.  Do I fear a burglar
breaking into my house while I am watching TV?  Yes, because he can kill me.
Even though I am experiencing being far away, my real life is still
dependent on my real body.  If it is destroyed, I am dead.

If we could somehow get my consciousness to transfer to the other body such
that the link could be severed with me on the other side instead of
remaining on my side, then I would agree.

Although your example is perfect for making me experience the sensations as
if I transferred, or even fooling me into thinking that I transferred, it is
just an illusion.  It lasts only as long as the link stays up and my
original body stays alive.  If there is static on the link, I perceive the
distorted picture not the real picture.  If the link is time delayed because
of long distances, I experience the sensory input later when the data
reaches my original body; I do not experience it first hand in the far body
at the time it is happening.  What I seem to experience is merely a
recording of a far away event being played back.  Although it makes me feel
like I am really there, I am not.  I don't even know if the place in the
recording still exists or not.

I would like the link turned off slowly.  If I say "wait, I'm losing the
picture!" I know that I am still in the original body viewing the
simulation.  If I don't lose the picture while the link is turned down, and
I remain conscious after it is disconnected, and after separation if I find
myself in the new location in the new body instead of the old location in
the old body, then I would think a transfer had taken place.

Now that I think about it, I believe that I am in BOTH camps on the copy
question.  After copying, I believe my new copy would think that the
transfer had worked.  It would have all the old memories of the old body and
would wake up in the new body.  Meanwhile, the original would believe that
the copy had failed.  He would remember attempting the copy procedure, but
would remain in the old body with no transference to the new.  If the copy
procedure used the sensory transfer above, we could simulate the experience
of transfer for the old copy, but when the original woke up it would still
be in the old body.  The new copy would gain the advantage of the new body,
but the original would gain no enhancements.  Unfortunately, I am the
original.

So if you did ever find yourself an upload, would you have the same
reluctance to have your program copied to a different computer?  Would you
worry that shutting down your program *here* and resuming it over *there*
was actually a matter of killing the original?  Faced with the prospect
of your program stopping running here, does it fail to reassure you that
your program will continue running over there?

Look, if we were describing something esoteric here, 
I would have understood. Forking of simulations due
to introduced perturbations is something what occurs
today in today's computers, is described in today's literature
and what I'm personally familiar with. I'm not sure why
the topic is so hard to grasp (CryoNet is seeing the same
idiotic discussion occuring over and over year over year
over year), as it is not exactly rocket science.
 
Identity in a simulation is defined by the system state
being exactly the same, down to a single bit. As soon as you
introduce a perturbation you cause a bifurcation. The
statespace trajectories of two systems have started to
diverge. For most systems in most states, the human mind 
included, even a single bit perturbation introduced will
cause the states of the simulation achieve considerable
separation in state space.

Now please observe how above passage differs from

 "That's not a good reason.  The correct answer is "What
 benefits me most".  You erroneously have concluded that
 you are not your duplicate."

As it stands, it voices an opinion, nothing more. Please
define the identity and similiarity metrics you use. Also,
please tell me whether you think that your twin brother is
yourself (basically the same situation has occured in
reality as in simulation).

Guess that's an empirical question nobody's in a position to answer yet.
It'd depend on the phenomenology of the situation, *from the inside*.
Perhaps an uploaded consciousness, to the extent he/she/se isn't an exactly
faithful emulation of an embodied human brain, will grow into a sort of
extended enotype, again *from the inside*.

Because of a developmental defect arising from a childhood ambylopia
repaired too late, I don't have depth visual perception. So I'm told the
world is flat to me (except for the evaluated cues of parallax,
differential and changing apparent sizes of invariants, etc.), but how
would I know? What would it be like for me if the relevant neural
structures were repaired and I were trained to see binocularly? Well, this
actually happened to David Chalmers, and it was interesting to read his
account of how the world became richer and thicker. Life for a disseminated
upload might be like that, and one couldn't bear the idea of going back to
the dreary restrictions of Cyclopean human consciousness...
