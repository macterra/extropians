Relative to what?

Ian's argument assumes, without any justification, that the velocities
of A and B are defined relative to each other.  That's a valid
definition, but it's far from the only possible definition.  Both A and
B have velocities relative to C, for example, which do *not* behave as
Ian describes.

This isn't the first time Ian has tried to wow us by with a proof 
based on assumptions that were not in the statement of the problem.

In other words, delta(|A-B|) = delta(|B-A|).  Whoopee.

When you get to define all terms, of course you can prove you're right.

If velocity is an element of identity, then there is no identity between
A before acceleration and A after acceleration; and so one might ask how
the above argument is relevant.

Then why is it called by a word whose root means `same' ???

Once again Ian stands well-established usage on its head to get his way.
A symmetric relation is one where R(A,B) implies R(B,A); for example, if
I am taller than Ian, then Ian is taller than me.

(A-B) + (B-A) = 0, yes; so what?

This web page shows something of which I was not fully aware until now:
Ian confuses the vernacular meaning of identity (a property of a thing)
with the mathematical meaning (the relation between a thing and itself
or between two equal things).

Beep!  "A=A" is not a definition of A; it is a definition of "=" (as I
believe I have pointed out before).
The context of the definition is the field of mathematical logic.
The definition "A=A" defines equality as different from inequality
(which yours, by the way, fails to do).

Where have I asserted that A is free from not-A?  Please quote me.  
I don't even know what "free" means here.

I was not angry when I jocularly used the word "crackpot".  
I only become angry when I read your tirades against everyone who uses
the word _identity_ in its etymological sense.

That's funny -- just a moment ago I responded to a post, apparently from
you, that said 

	IAN: Identity is what a thing is; wether rock,
	symbol, or idea, all things have an identity.

Do please make up your mind.

I remind you that I also do not say "the identity of A is the same as
A".

I posted examples (adding to yours) of multiple perceptions.  After ten
days of happy distractions, I've forgotten just what my purpose was, but
I can't believe I intended them as examples of "free identities".  They
couldn't be: because _identity_, as I am using the term, has no plural!

Identity *is* the "same-as relation".  Every example of identity is of
the form "A=A".  The attributes of identity include symmetry,
reflexivity, transitivity.  (Others, anybody?)

The attributes of a *thing* are not identity.  They are very useful
information, but they are not identity (Latin for "sameness").

Do you mind if, for the sake of my blood pressure, I replace all your
uses of the word "identity" with "plergb"?

>   A is A not because A is the same as A,
>   A is A because A is different than not-A.

A is A whether or not A is different from not-A.
A is A whether or not there is another thing like A.
A is A whether or not there is another thing unlike A.
Exceptions eternally? Absolute none!

I don't care *why* A is A.  *Why* is not part of the definition of
identity.

We don't need no stinkin' evidence to define a logical construct.  The
guys who defined ASCII did not need evidence to assign the bitstring
"1101001" to the letter "i".  That bitstring represents that letter
because some engineers chose to make it so, and _identity_ means
"sameness, the relation of a thing with itself" because someone coined
the word and chose to use it in that sense.

Keep in mind that one of the "eyes" is (iirc) a reference-dot, i.e. an
artifact of the camera, not part of the picture in nature.

Also, every picture I've ever seen of the "face" is the SAME IMAGE.
How many times have our various machines passed over Cydonia?  
Shouldn't there be more than one image of the site??  
If two or three of them show a "face", let me know!

That means nothing, not even an electron, retains its (vernacular)

The two collapse into one:
(1,2).  Libertarians assume a weaker time-preference than the median
voter in fact holds.

Consider also:
3.  Certain key results in economic science, which make libertarianism
more persuasive, are not yet widely known.  (*Why* they are not widely
known is left as an exercise ;) )

Correct: two different EXPRESSIONS of the SAME underlying thing.

By "meaningfully" I guess you mean "nontrivially".  Where the relation
is identity, no two things are related; a nontrivial identity is a
relation of two (or more) expressions or perceptions of the same thing.

Thanks.  ;)

What?!  A few sentences ago, you seemed to say that "2+3=5" *is* a
meaningful example of identity.  Now you seem to say it's not.

You challenged me to give a meaningful example of identity.
I return the challenge.

You must be very brave to stand up in public and say that "A=A" is
meaningless while "the identity of A is A" is not.

What does it mean to "have" an identity?

Apparently you deny my statement "identity is a symbolic construct - you
can't go out and dig up rocks and find an `identity'".  If I understand
you here, every thing is its own identity: this clock is the identity of
this clock, the Pachelbel Canon is the identity of the Pachelbel Canon. 
This suggests that "identity" has no *general* meaning, only innumerable
*particular* meanings.  Must be awfully hard to theorize about it.

Again: you confound the mathematical sense of identity (the relation of
a thing with itself) with the vernacular sense (the sum of a thing's
attributes?).  In the mathematical sense, everything "has" the same
identity - that is, for every thing, "identity" has the same meaning (I
am identical to myself, and you are identical to yourself); in the
vernacular sense, "identity" is different for each thing (I'm Chevy
Chase and you're not).

>   Simply saying that A is the same as A tells
>   us nothing about what identity is.

Too bad, because that is the (mathematical) DEFINITION of identity.
Like it or not, the word _identity_ was coined from the Latin word
_idem_ meaning `same'.  Sameness is the defining element of identity.
If you don't like it, coin another word, or use one of the many words
available, such as description, distinction, attributes, qualities.

All I ask of you, Ian, all I have ever asked of you in this dispute, is
that you refrain from stealing for your concept a word which others have
adopted for a very different well-defined concept.  No, even less than
that: I don't care if you misuse a word for your purposes; I object only
to your insisting that others, who had it first, are wrong in their use
of the word.

<analogy>
The ancients used the word _planets_ to mean Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus,
Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.  We have since found it more useful to
subtract the Sun from that list and add Earth.  But our new definition
does not make theirs wrong; they were using the word in a different
sense.  It would be foolish to go through old writings and attach a
gloating correction to each passage where the Sun is called a "planet". 
The Sun *is* a planet in the older sense: a bright body which appears to
move against the background of the distant stars.  When the new usage
came along, it was specialized at first; it was wrong to use the word
_planet_ in the new sense without explaining that it was being used in a
special way.  Centuries later, the context has changed: nobody but
astrologers now have any interest in "planets" in the old sense, and now
it is they who must explain their special usage.
</analogy>

If your theory has merit, eventually most of us will forget the
etymological meaning of _identity_.  I concede the remote possibility --
but it is still arrogant of you to behave as if that has already
happened.

I'm not sure what you mean by posting this (invalid) syllogism; is it
meant as a reductio ad absurdum, somehow, of my previous statement
(using your definition, A = A+~A = B+~B = B), or do you concede the
truth of my statement, and mean here to show that my definitions lead to
an equally silly result?

That your syllogism is invalid can be shown by Boolean truth-tables:

(The next-to-last column is always true because "T=T" is true.)

With my definition of identity, "_=_" is sometimes true and sometimes
false, depending on what's in the blanks, so there's something special
about "A=A" which is always true.

With your definition(?) of identity, "_=_" is always true; so no use of
"=" can ever say anything distinctive, nonvacuous.

Please pay attention: I explicitly called your attention (once again) to
the distinction between vernacular identity and mathematical identity.

Also, you're failing to distinguish between two things and two
perceptions of the same thing.  When I say "I believe this cat is the
same as yesterday's cat" what I really mean is "I believe that my
present perception and yesterday's perception are of one and the same
cat" -- not at all that "the two cats are equal".

>   Also, the cat is always relatied to not-cat.

Everything is related to everything in *some* way.  My quarrel is with
your contention that everything is related to everything (except
possibly itself) in the *same* way.

Yawn.  Okay, what if there's only the black void?  Can I say that the
black void which I perceive right now is the same black void as the
black void which I perceive right now?

YOU don't know what we're doing.  There's a difference.

By such standards, do we know what *anything* "actually is"?
I'll let you in on a little secret: I don't much care what identity
"actually is", any more than I care what an electron "actually is" --
what interests me is how they behave.

Do you understand the difference between that statement (with which I do

Most of the Sphinx is a lot older than that, it was a natural limestone hill. 
Considering its proximity to the site proposed for Chepsos's new pyramid it 
was probably considered an eyesore by the builders, there may even have been 
talk of laboriously removing it, until some artistic genius took a good look 
at that oblong outcrop of rock and said " You know, I think I can do something 
with that". The evidence that any portion of the Sphinx carved by humans is 
older than 5 thousand years is weak, to put it politely.

See http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/photogallery-mars.html#controversy
for all the images which show the region of the Face.  You usually see the
same one because it is the best one.

See http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/target/announcement2.html for the
schedule of photography attempts for the Face as well as the Viking
and Pathfinder landers.  The first attempt at the Face will be April 5,
with a delay of about 24 hours before it is posted on the net.

Because of positional and orbital uncertainties, they estimate only about
a 30%-50% chance of photographing the target object on any given try.
I would imagine that the odds would go up on the later tries as they
are able to see how far they were off on the earlier ones.  So I am
reasonably optimistic that they will get new pictures of the Face within
the next month.

See http://www.psrw.com/~markc/MiscArticles/Predictions/Predictions.html
for predictions of what the new images should show, by a non-crackpot
believer in the significance of the Face.

Indeed, secular humanism seems to be nothing more than (new testament)
christianity minus the supernatural elements. That also explains why they
don't embrace transhuman technologies: humanists are hampered by the
christain notions of humbleness, self-sacrifice and the idea that suffering
makes one a better person. The highest humanist ideal seems to be to
lead a decent life and die with dignity, or something along these lines.
A far cry from transhumanity's glorious vision of technoascension...

Most of these folks were also in the London Times recently; I was amused 
when I picked up a copy someone had left lying around on a bench and
spotted Steve Mann and others on the center pages.

I thought Steve Mann's site was www.wearcam.org, but my machine couldn't 
find a DNS entry for that yesterday.

Well put. Transhumanism claims that we can modify the human condition
in various ways; more specifically, it claims this can be done through
rational means such as technology. There is a division here between
those who acknowledge this, but regard such changes as bad (an
increasing number of people have advanced to this stage from the
original "nothing new under the sun" stage) and those who think there
can be very positive consequences of such changes. I prefer to only
call the last group real transhumanists, since otherwise Jeremy Rifkin
would likely be a transhumanist too.

Note that humanism in its most open-minded form doesn't necessarily
have a problem with this, but in practice many humanists regard the
assumption of an unchanging human condition as essential for their
philosophy.

Found him again at:

http://n1nlf-1.eecg.toronto.edu/netcam_privacy_issues.html

"So I felt quite uncomfortable when video surveillance cameras began to 
rise over our city, on high poles, looming over our neighbourhoods. In 
fact, I would rank cameras in increasing order of acceptability (fairness) 
as follows: 

     Government looking at people. 
     Establishments looking at people 
     Establishments looking at establishments or people looking at people 
     People looking at establishments ("shooting back") 
     People looking at government ("shooting back") 

with a neutral position in the middle (people looking at people). 
Surveillance is actually desirable when aimed at Big Brother (and possibly 
also Big Business). It would seem logical that organizations capable 
of wrongdoing should be placed under a degree of surveillance proportional 
to their capacity to inflict damage on society. The potential damage, 
to society, of a large and unaccountable organization, operating above 
the law, is far greater than the damage that an individual might inflict 
by stealing a loaf of bread. Thus it is possible that society would do 
well to place certain large organizations under greater scrutiny than a 
shopper at the local convenience store, or someone living in a house near, 
or walking down a public sidewalk past, a gas station."

I agree...

My point was I never claimed to be speaking about secular humanism,
but about secular humanists I met.  Since I qualified my statements, only
a sloppy reading would mischaraterize my assertion.

>I was just pointing out that your comment
>was not a fair way to characterize humanism.

To reiterate:

 "I've also noticed that many people who call themselves "secular
 humanist" are really just using the term as a euphemism for
 "atheist.""

I was observing how people I've met who call themselves secular humanists
use the term.  I qualified my statement in such a way that only someone
with an axe to grind would have mistaken it.  I took no stand on humanISM

Problem is: I did not and do not claim my "off the cuff observations" are
somehow the height of data collection.  In fact, I made no claims that I
could not support.  Nor did I maintain that my experience is somehow
priviliged or universalizeable.

Because you misread me.

I made and make no claim about secular humanism as a philosophy.  I
was making claims about secular humanists -- not ideas but people.  I've
met a few and when we got to discussing our beliefs, it seemed to me
that most had atheism as their only binding belief -- the thing they had in
common, that they all could agree on.  Some did share other things, such
as a basically JudeoChristian ethical system.

I'm not claiming that secular humanism implies this, though if secular
humanism owes anything to humanism as it has come down through
the centuries, then one might expect it to be JudeoChristian ethically
and Leftist politically.  This is because few movements have outright
rejected JudeoChristian ethics -- even Marxists are animated by them
-- and humanism is generally has always been more toward the Left
end of the political spectrum.

For the record, these are just my observations.  I've not done nor do
I claim to have done extensive research or randomly surveyed
secular humanists.  The thing to do here, if anyone cares, would be
to do a survey of alleged secular humanists and examine the
major and influential works of secular humanism.

>This would not be a be
>a far criticism. It is like then people characterize transhumanism as
>science fiction that is confused about reality. 

Again, my claim was about secular humanISTS NOT secular humanISM.
I think I have a little understanding of transhumanISM, but it would not be
wrong to examine and post observations about transhumanISTS, as long
as others and me did not confuse the two.  Do you see the difference?

Cheers!

Yes, but it could have misinterpreted, I was just trying to clarify as
someone of the list, after reading your comments, sent me some private
mail pointing out humanism was just atheism in disguise. 

Now, lets move on.

Lee, if you don't believe in democracy and are transhumanist, this is
your right.
Den , if you like the traditional Afghan way of dealing with criminals
and see yourself as a transhumanist, this is certainly your right too.
As Nick said in his principles/declaration/manifesto, "transhumanism is
politically neutral" (and yes, I find this sentence useful).

But, because the posts of this list are archived and I worry, as Arjen
does, about PR of transhumanism, I cannot let strangers or newbies
believe that these extremist positions are in some way representative of
transhumanist thought.(even if I aknowledge the fact that the posters
used wisely the "I find", "I think" words).
I'm a transhumanist: this means I want to abolish death and suffering.
As such, I think my job is to accelerate my own evolution and help
people to do the same thing, not to punish them with tortures or
sentence them to death.
I'm an antiauthoritarian: I think democracy is the closest form of
"spontaneous order " that we know, the best way we found to limit, and
eventually break down, power structures. Other find that capitalist
libertarianism is a better way. That's their right. But this choice is
not an official part of the transhumanist package (for extropians, I
don't know: if I understood some earlier Max's posts, it's more complex
than usually said).

A last word about humanism: I don't know what is exactly "council for
secular humanism", but the fundamental text about humanism is certainly
the "Manifesto on human dignity" by Pico de la Mirandola, written during
the Renaissance, and there is certainly nothing in it which contradict
transhumanism. Transhumanism seems to me a natural follow-up of
humanism, not an adverse ideology

Remi

Nearly  99% of all the matter in all life, human or otherwise, is made of 
just 4 different types of atoms, 4 different building blocks.  
61% of the atoms in life are hydrogen, 27% are oxygen, 8% are carbon, and  
2.5% are nitrogen. The other elements (about a dozen) involved in life are 
found in trace amounts. 

It's interesting that there is not a clear relationship between the amount of 
elements in the earth's crust and it's use in life. 28% of the earth is made 
of silicon yet it plays at best a minor role in life.  4.5% is aluminum, the 
most common of all metals, but it's a poison and to my knowledge not used by 
life at all.

Hmm, I don't understand how you can call "do what the majority tell you or 
else" democracy an example of antiauthoritarian "spontaneous order", or 
claim that it limits and breaks down power structures when the real-world
examples seem to show democratic bureaucracies bloating until they collapse 
due to lack of funds to steal.

That democracy is better than many other forms of government is obvious,
that it's much good for anything is not.

>Other find that capitalist
>libertarianism is a better way. 

It's unfortunate, of course, that libertarianism/anarcho-capitalism is
incompatible with democracy, when democracy is compatible with
libertarianism/anarcho-capitalism.

I can see that transhumans can support involuntary democracy, but I don't
see that Extropians can; there's nothing spontaneous about being told
what to do by the majority on pain of death for refusal.

Sure, the MIT cyborgs (including Steve Mann et al) are quite active at
implementing their ideas into their everyday lives. You can get a decent
intro to the Lab by checking out:
<http://wearables.www.media.mit.edu/projects/wearables/>

The Swedish Isaac Project is also worth checking out. It's been quite
successful at using many not-quite-cutting-edge-anymore-technologies to
create a working solution that significantly enhances the function of
non-techie humans by using wearable tech:
<http://www.certec.lth.se/research/projects/isaac/isaac1_1_wealth.html>

I have many more URLs but that's a reasonable start. [My company, btw, does
hw and sw development of ubiquitous computing solutions, of which
"wearables" makes up a significant part.]

Btw, the MIT Media Lab Wednesday Colloquium today ("The invisible computer:
Why Good Products Can Fail, the Personal Computer Is So Complex, and
Information Appliances Are the Solution") features Don Norman - the author
of "The Design of Everyday Things," "Turn Signals Are the Facial
Expressions of Automobiles" and "Things That Make Us Smart". The Colloquium
is on Wednesday 1 April 4:30 pm Bartos Theatre 20 Ames Street, Cambridge
(refreshments at 4:15 pm). 20 Ames is the Media Lab Bathtub, for those
unfamiliar with MIT numbering schemes. Bartos is downstairs.

I'll be there, taking written and voice notes on my mid-size electronic
slate...

so a billionaire's whim would be much more powerful than any "standard"
indivual's greatest desire.  What would stop someone like Bill Gates from
doing what he will with 10000000 Indians?  Not to mention that most
people's wieldable money (spare money?) is much less than 2% of a rich
person's spare money.  Also, what's the difference between a large PPA and
a standard nation state, in which you pay taxes to be protected?  
What will protect you from your own PPA?

I find most of Afghan justice rather repulsive, actually...I certainly 
don't endorse things like the stoning of adulterers or the mutilation of 
thieves.

For the record, here's a disclaimer: the views expressed by me in the
postings sent to the extropian list are not necessarily the views of
any transhumanistic/extropian institution, individual or group of individuals. 
They solely represent a (rather poor) reflection of my thoughts at the 
moment of writing, and should be no means be considered definitive.
                                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

> I'm a transhumanist: this means I want to abolish death and suffering.

Is the desire to elliminate death and suffering *in general* an official tenet
of transhumanism then? That would be rather, eh, missionary-like (and
certainly not what I consider "neutral", although it's a great _personal_
goal).

Also: I'm a transhumanist: this means (among other things) that I hold 
no view or custom sacred, but openly question everything. This includes 
the widespread idea that capital punishment and torture are inherently 
bad, and can't by definition be incorporated into a modern, fair justice 
system.

> As such, I think my job is to accelerate my own evolution and help
> people to do the same thing, not to punish them with tortures or
> sentence them to death.

Most people (me included) don't *want* to punish or torture people
(certainly not for its own sake), but I do belief that when prevention
has failed and the damage has been done, some sort of action has
to be taken. Letting criminals walk is neither fair nor practical -- you
are sending a very wrong message. So, some kind of punishment
is required, and of all those available I prefer the consequent principle
of returning the damage to the source, "to make one reap what he sows".
The punishment is customized to the crime. Also, one shouldn't 
forget that most criminals aren't poor victims that had to steal to
survive or something like that, but ruthless individuals who don't respect
other people's life, freedom and/or property. Why should we be mild
to them?

What would _you_ (if you were the state) with criminals (thieves, rapists,

Subject: Pre-Freezing Protocol

Hi:

In the latest edition of "New Scientist" there was an article about a new
protocol being used to prepare pig embryos for reversable freezing.  It
seems from the article that the cells in a pig embryo are more
(differentiated) than those in most other animals and freezing usually
irreversibly damages them. The villians were apparently the microfilaments
that help cells to keep their shape.

The solution was to perfuse the cells with cytochalasin, which broke down
the microfilaments into simpler structures which weren't damaged on
freezing.  On thawing, the cells are able to rebuild these simpler
structures into the correct microfilaments once more.

Is anyone using a similar protocol in their experiments with freezing and
thawing fully differentiated organisms?

Sincerely
Robert Horley

Here are some things I've previously written on the relationship of humanism
and transhumanism:

"The word transhumanism consciously evokes the tradition of humanism, i.e. the
secular view of man as the "center" of the moral universe. However,
transhumanism goes beyond humanism, because it does not accept some immutable,
fundamental "human nature" as a given, but rather looks to continuing -- and
accelerating -- the process of recursively expanding and improving the very
nature of human beings themselves."

and

"In its embrace of humanity's self-transforming and world-transforming use of
technology, transhumanism rejects the pessimism and more or less explicit
moral guilt of modern humanistic thinking. ... With the development of tools
to explore and manipulate the fundamental elements of matter and
consciousness, we now stand at the brink of a new shift to an even greater
level of complexity and consciousness. Seeing and embracing this new
challenge, the transhumanist world view is a redemption of the optimism of the
Enlightenment of the 18th Century, a New Enlightenment reinvigorated by a
deeper understanding of consciousness as an integral part of natural
evolution."

I don't have the intention to add more noise then there allready is.
But, this one is keeping me busy some time now.....
So, John, if you don't mind could you tell me a bit more.
I was pretty impressed by this "rain-marks on the sphinx" thing....

Thanks.

I'll check it out. Funny enough, but the book is in my 'to read' pile and has
been for years.

For some reason though I've been more interested in other books. Has anyone
seen a book called the beginner's guide to constructing the universe?

This is a fascinating book about the numbers 1-10.


Thanks for the tip.

I'd love to debate the semantics of Sphinx dating, but I'm sure it would be more
appropriate on another list.

I'm no geologist, but the evidence of water erosion is more substantial than that
of an egyptologists non-scientific perspective. Just because its been written,
doesn't make it true.

I'm really not an expert, but the evidence seems to lead me in the 10k
direction..

Do you know something scientific about the date of the sphinx or are you just
reiterating what archeologists think?

The prime difference between a PPA and a nation state is that a) a PPA isnt in a
monopoly position enforced by overwhelming force of arms, as a nation state is, b)
a PPA's client should have an ability to choose among various services, and only
have to pay for the ones desired, and c) if your PPA provides poor service, or
abuses its customers, its competitors should be able to acquire that PPA's
customers as they so choose.

So its basically a difference of being a free market of politics and being a
monopoly dictator.

Theoretically, he could, but after doing so he wouldn't be Bill Gates
anymore.  He wouldn't just have to have lots of money, he'd have to SPEND
his money (all of it) in order to get that kind of power.

Other PPAs.  If your PPA decides to get tyrannical, you decide to stop
paying them for protection and instead pay another PPA (who will gladly
accept your funds) to protect you against your current PPA.  If your
current PPA is really being tyrannical, then lots of people will favor this
strategy and the tyrannical PPA will be out of funding.  They may still try
to wage war, and lose even more money, until eventually they'll be out of
business.

9 YEAR OLD DISPUTES 'THERAPEUTIC TOUCH'

A study conducted by a 9 year old girl for a science project and 
published in a distingished medical journal concludes that 
'therapeutic touch,' in which a healer supposedly manipulates a 
patient's energy field, is bunk.

Emily Rosa, the daughter of a registered nurse and an inventor, found 
that 21 experienced practitioners were unable to detect the field 
they supposedly manipulated to heal.  Her study was published in today's Journal of the American Medical 
Association and immediately drew fire from supporters of the 
practice, who say it is respected worldwide.  

Thereaputic touch has been used to treat problems ranging from burns 
to cancer.  The technique is practiced in at least 80 North American 
hospitals and taught in more than 100 colleges and universities in 75 
countries, said the study, written by the Lovelace, Colorado, fourth 
grader, her parents, and a Pennsylvania doctor who works to uncover 
quackery.  

Those who practice the technique say an energy field emanates from
every person and is detectable above the skin through a tingling
sensation or a feeling of hot and cold.  Emily set up a cardboard  
screen through which practitioners put their hands.  With their sight 
blocked, she asked them to identify which of their hands was near one 
of hers.  The 21 practitioners chose the correct hand 44 percent of 
the time.  That was slightly less than the 50 percent chance they 
would have had of choosing the correct hand by guessing, authors 
said.

Yes Kathryn, this was a welcome surprise in my morning paper. That these frauds were trumped by a mere 9
year old is additional humiliation for the 'profession'. I wish that all quackery would be proven false with
such publicity.

Samuel Butler (1835-1902), best known as the author of _Erewhon_ and _The_
_Way_of_All_Flesh_, also wrote

	"...[M]en and women exist only as the organs and tools of the ideas
	that dominate them; it is the fad that is alone living."

	_The_Notebooks_of_Samuel_Butler_, ed. Henry Festing Jones, (London:
	Hogarth Press), 1st pub. 1912, new ed. 1985, p. 232.

What's the earliest mention of an idea similar to Dawkins's meme?

Btw, in the essay, "Darwin Among the Machines" (1863), which he incorporated
into _Erewhon_ (1872), Butler attempts to apply evolutionary theory to the
development of machines.  Note that the "Butlerian Revolution" in Frank
Herbert's _Dune_ alludes to _Erewhon_; upon noticing that machines evolve
faster than do humans, the Erewhonians prohibited their further improvement to
prevent their supplanting people.  The Erewhonians were insightful, for their
highest technological developments go scarcely beyond those of mid-nineteenth
century England.

19 European nations sign ban on human cloning
Britain, Germany not among signatories

January 12, 1998
Web posted at: 8:00 p.m. EST (0100 GMT) 

PARIS (CNN) -- Nineteen European nations on Monday signed an agreement to
prohibit the cloning of humans. 

Representatives from 19 members of the Council of Europe signed a protocol
that would commit their countries to ban by law "any intervention seeking
to create human beings genetically identical to another human being,
whether living or dead." It rules out any exception to the ban, even in the
case of a completely sterile couple. 

<snip>

The accord will become binding on the signatories as soon as it has been
ratified in five states. 

Countries signing are: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland,
Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Moldova, Norway, Portugal, Romania, San Marino,
Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Macedonia and Turkey. 

Britain and Germany -- two of Europe's biggest nations -- did not sign the
protocol. 

Germany claims the measure is weaker than a current German law that forbids
all research on human embryos -- a reaction to Nazi genetic engineering
experiments. 

Britain, where scientists are at the forefront of cloning, has a strong
tradition of defending the freedoms of scientific research.

That is, aside from the water erosion on carved surfaces.  Which 
indicate that the Sphinx was *not* carved from a rock outcropping in 
the desert -- the Sphinx was carved, then the local climate changed.

It's not you against the world, no viable PPA would have only one member, and

Unlike a government a PPA  will not force you to join or pay them one dime  
because it does not claim rights an individual does not have. If I need money  
I don't claim the right to take it from you regardless of your wishes. 
Government does.
		  

	>What will protect you from your own PPA?


Possibly nothing, one PPA might become  far more powerful than any other,  
turn psychotic and take over everything. It could happen, but it's much less  
likely than the US Army doing it and setting up a military dictatorship, 
and they certainly have the power to do so if they wanted. At the first signs 
of totalitarian behavior in a PPA, people could simply stop doing business 
with it and switch to a competitor, this would cut off its lifeblood, money. 
Remember, doing business with a PPA is voluntary and that gives enormous  
power to people, a power that citizens forced to finance the army and police  
regardless of their opinion of it do not have. Also, just like now, PPA's in
a world without government would attract people who enjoy exercising control 
over other people, but unlike the police and army of today, it would also 
attract people who enjoy making money. Those kind of people are much safer to 
have in positions of power.

I've looked at the pictures for which Hal(?) provided a pointer. 
Thanks.  I was in error about the dot.  But I couldn't find the face in
most of the pictures, and in the two where it's visible, the light is
from the same angle (illuminating the right cheek).

much more, but i think the figures are hemp can produce 4 times more paper
than trees per given area plus hemp can be harvested once a year (or more if
grown indoors) and trees take 20 years, so does it make 80 times more paper
than trees?
there are other benefits too like strength.  hemp plants can grow very big and
produce a lot of fiber if bred for that. like 10-15 ft high with 4-8 inch wide
stalks (thats a guess kinna, ive seen pictures).

Indeed you are correct sir. However, I was told that Hemp grows very fast and is
really easy to rotate with other plants to prevent soil sterilization.

Why is this titled the "great hemp swindle?"

I'm pretty sure that it would still be one of this country's greatest agricultural
assets if it weren't illegal to grow. (note that hemp and mj are not the same kind
of plant. I guess you could say its similar to a fruitless cherry tree)

Ask yourself why ALL forms of hemp plants are illegal to grow in this country?!?

I'm speculating here and I'm sure there are people who have more information, but
there's a lot of reasons why lobbyists from logging, fuel and cotton industries
would love to eliminate a major competitor.

Personally, I think that its absurd that a plant can be made illegal. But then
again, many native americans were really confused about the idea of land ownership.

Hello. I have been lurking for a bit, and feel that I can add something here.

I understand that hemp paper is produced without acid, so it will last much
longer than wood pulp paper. I have also heard that some of the early
Federal documents are written on this paper..

The entire prohibition against cannabis as a crop is a fabrication produced
by those whose financial interests were served by removing a competing
product. The fact that you can 'misuse' hemp is just a fortunate side effect
for these people.

Check out: http://www.mcwilliams.com/books/aint/f01.htm - the chapters on
marijuana are quite interesting..

  According to some Archeologists the water erosion patterns on the
sphinx are as a result of sustained rain, possibly associated with the
decline of the last ice age, probably somewhat more intense than the

That depends on the size of the PPA.  You could say that the nation state
is not in a monopoly position since there are, approximately, another 200
nations "available".  If the PPA hits some critical size level, it could
be just as controlling as a nation state

They would do this if 1) they can get you out of your own PPA's control,
and 2) It is profitable for them to do so.

first of all, he wouldn't have to spend all his money.  He earns more per
unit time than those 10000000 Indians combined, so he would just have to
spend a couple of months until the indians run out of funds.  Second of
all, even if someone did have to spend all his money (say a lesser god,
like rupert murdoch or ted turner), that is still way too much power to
give to one person.  Most of the psychotic dictators around the world
didn't get anywhere near that figure (arguably only three ever made it
there, counting side effects and other stuff)

That is if your PPA lets you decide where your money is
going to go.  I think the analogy with the nation state is pretty useful.
you could fund another nation, (a la cubans in the US), but only if that
other nation is more powerful than your current one.  And that does not
guarantee that your new PPA won't do the same thing, even though it 
might not be to the same degree (again, a la cubans in
the US).

Someone mentioned theories regarding the age of the Great Sphinx. You may want to check out "The Message of the Sphinx" (aka "Keepers of Genesis") by Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval. The general theory was espoused by John Anthony West, an archeologist of sorts, and Robert Schoch, a geologist at Case Western Reserve University. The general theory surrounds Schoch's analysis of erosion patterns on the Sphinx enclosure. Schoch asserts that this erosion was caused by heavy rainfall, not wind erosion. Heavy rainfall was only prevalent in the area, at the latest, some 10,000+ years ago. There was a PBS special about this some years ago. West also states that the head of the Sphinx is not the original head and bears no resemblance to Khufu (who conventional wisdom says it is). Finally, West points out that, with the use of "new" software that allows astronomers to construct how the night sky looked in any previous epoch, it can be shown that the lion-like Sphinx faces the direction of the sunrise on the Summer Solstices of the 10,500 BP era and that the constellation Leo rises just before the sun in a manner not unlike the positioning of the Sphinx.

The Schoch-West Sphinx theory also corroborates Bauval's own Orion theory. "The Orion Mystery", by Bauval and hermetic researcher Adrian Gilbert, explores alternative theories of Egyptian religion in early and pre-dynastic times. The most sensational claim though arise from the alleged relationship between the size and relative positions of the Nile, the three Pyramids at Giza and various other. Using the same archaeo-astronomy that West uses, Bauval attempts to show how the angles and sizes of the Giza Pyramids correspond with the belt stars of Orion and that the Nile is fairly similar to the Milky Way galaxy across the sky.

Finally, Graham Hancock ties all this together in his book (though it was written first), "Fingerprints of the Gods" which has interesting discourse on various subjects. Hancock asserts that there was a civilization in existence some 10,000+ years ago with fairly advanced technolody (not Atlantis type stuff but close to it. By the way, Hancock also thinks Atlantis is hidden beneath the Antarctic ice sheets).

I have read all the books and there is some liberty to some of the points Bauval, West, Hancock and Schoch make. Archeology is a provincial science with lots of old guys clinging on to theories and not very quick to welcome new viewpoints. This rigidity has led to some embarrassing retractions by archeology over time. However, Hancock and company (especially Hancock) do not know when to stop and take things too far. Hancock, for example, has a theory that the crust of the Earth has suddenely shifted over the mantle in the past causing sudden 2,000 mile shifts in where continents lie relative to the poles and so forth.  Bauval and Hancock have a new book coming out also called "The Mars Mystery". The title speaks for itself.

Colombia Rebels Wheel Out Secret Weapon In War: Home-Made Tanks

By Karl Penhaul, Reuters

     BOGOTA (April 1, 1998 Reuters) - Colombia's leftist rebels
wheeled out a surprise weapon this week in their long-running war
with the government -- home-made "tanks" built from farm
tractors.
     Two of the makeshift war-horses, farm tractors with the
driver's cabs protected by thick sheets of steel and M-60
machine-guns mounted on top, spearheaded a guerrilla attack on
the town of Vista Hermosa in eastern Meta province on Tuesday.
     The rebels have sporadically used crude armored vehicles in
the past. But police sources said on Wednesday the growing
sophistication of the designs indicated they were trying to form
their own "armored cavalry division".
     "(These tanks) were made using a small tractor which was
stripped down to the chassis and fitted with extra thick, special
tires," Vista Hermosa town council official Alirio Omana told
Reuters.
     "It was a sophisticated machine and could have destroyed an
entire army," he said, adding that the "tanks" drove through the
town at speeds of up to 25 miles per hour (40 kph).
     In Tuesday's attack, about 300 Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC) rebels destroyed the town's bank and abandoned
one of the tanks after crashing it into the police station. One
policeman and four rebels died in the firefight.
     "With these tanks the guerrillas are looking to restrict
their casualties," Gen. Alfredo Salgado, operations director of
the national police force, told Reuters.
     The first reports that the FARC was building its own
military vehicles came when the army discovered two dump trucks
reinforced with steel sheeting in northern Bolivar province in
1995.
     Regional army commander Gen. Freddy Padilla, head of the
army's 7th Division, said the FARC used another tractor-based
"tank" in a raid elsewhere in Meta earlier this month but
downplayed the weapon's effectiveness.
     "These tanks do not really give the bandits any advantage.
They're easy to neutralize and destroy," he said.
     However, the increasing military might of the FARC and the
smaller National Liberation Army (ELN) is causing an ever-bigger
headache for Colombia's armed forces.
     At a congressional inquiry into military strategy on Tuesday
evening, armed forces chief Gen. Manuel Jose Bonett put the
number of guerrillas in the country at some 20,000 -- 33 percent
higher than any previous official estimate.
     He said the army had an active combat force of just 40,000
men to fight the rebel threat.
     Those figures, coupled with the guerrillas' growing ability
to outmaneuver even the army's best-trained counterinsurgency
troops in the mountains and jungles of Colombia has led to sharp
criticism from U.S. military experts.
     In comments on Tuesday, Gen. Charles Wilhelm, head of the
Miami-based U.S. Southern Command, said Colombia's military was
incapable of defeating the country's drug traffickers and rebel
armies.

Which would mean that you would just die of some other cause in the
extremely short term.  What i meant by spare money is money that can be
used for things other than necessities, necessities being anything you
need to survive (just food, probably shelter in non-tropical areas, and
expenses spent in getting the income/means to get the previous two). This
spare money, for most people in the worlds, is an extremely small
percentage of their total income, and is smaller the smaller the income
is. So you get this exponential, instead of linear relationship between
total income and spare money, which means that those 10000000 indians have
some sum approaching zero (its tricky for them to survive without any
other expenses), and bill's (or pick your favourite billionaire)
approaching huge.  Net effect: bill 0 Indians -10000000
If you are poor, you couldn't count on your PPA being supported by some
billionaire since any billionaire would know that he would just be
supporting the rest.  In fact, i don't see any PPA supporting the poor
people since they have nothing to gain from this, apart from forced labor
and slavery.
The analogies that naturally emanate between the description in the above
two paragraphs and nation states were not premeditated.

They are just paid a "tithe" of 300 billion dollars a year by the US
population.  Rest of the world's armies do simmilar things, unless their
tithe is too low, in which cases they decide to take more direct
approaches.

Again, the fact that the "laws" and "rights" are backed up by PPAs, they
do not apply to PPAs.  Doing business with a PPA is voluntary as long as
that PPA lets it be a voluntary thing.

i would say that is exactly the kind of people that are in a position of

http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/photogallery-mars.html#controversy

Four of the five images have the face illuminated from the left side,
lighting the right cheek.  Only the last one has the face lit from the
right, but it is low resolution and you can't make out any detail.

I can help you find the face in the last three pictures.  Note in
the first two that the face is the leftmost in a series of three or
four small outcroppings of rock, each about the same size as the face.
To the right of these outcroppings are two larger plateaus, the left one
four-sided and very flat, and the right one five- or six-sided with a
mountain on top.  These can help you find the face in the other pictures.

The third image is rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise compared
to the others.  To help you find the plateaus, first find a pair of
small craters, equal sized and touching, a bit to the right of center.
45 degrees down to the left of this is a larger crater which has a
distinctive straight "wall" just below and to its right.  (This wall is
also claimed to be an artifact, a backdrop for the Face, by enthusiasts.)
The two plateaus are to the right of the wall, the series of outcroppings
lead down from there, with the Face the last in the series.

The fourth and fifth images are oriented the same as the first two.
In the fourth image, find the two touching craters a bit down and
left from center.  The lone crater with the wall is to the left and a
bit upwards from them.  The two plateaus are below the wall, then the
outcroppings leading to the Face are to the left.

The fifth image is the most frustrating because it is illuminated from the
right (producing an optical illusion of inverted relief in some areas).
This might be expected to reveal the degree of symmetry in the image, but
the resolution is too poor.

The two linked craters are halfway down the right edge of the picture.
The lone crater is up to the left from them, but the wall is invisible
in this image.  An imaging artifact in the form of a vertical dashed line
is just to the left of the crater, and if you follow it down it divides
the two plateaus, which are dimly visible.  The outcroppings to the
left of the plateaus are almost invisible, and the face is (presumably)
the last one, but all you can see is a small blob, light on the right
and dark on the left, with no features visible.

This sounds plausible.  It's not something I've modeled, but I'd like to get
to it sometime (anyone want to fund a study? :-).  It's not clear 
how much mutation there will be in such entities though.

What that says to me is that even in its worst case scenario,
anarcho-capitalism would result in a nation state.  I conclude that we have
little to lose, in that case.

Other PPAs, as I said elsewhere.  Moreover, they will back your ability to
choose, not because it is morally right, but because this ability is
valuable to customers; they will therefore be willing to pay for it.

And why would either of these be false?

This is untrue.  They may well run out of reserve capital, but so long as
their health and safety is in jeopardy, they will constantly be working to
preserve themselves; they can never be stripped of their human captial
unless killed.  At best, Bill Gates would keep on spending his money on
this FOREVER.

Also, don't forget that most of his income comes from wise investment
strategies, not just from the software sales.  If he's spending a major
portion of his revenues on surpressing the populace, he will be severely
cutting into the growth of his income.  This decrease in growth would
cumulate over the years, eventually costing him far more than surpressing
the people ever would have been worth to him.  If he continues to persist
anyway, you can be sure that his reserves would dwindle down to nothing
over time.

And best of all, Bill Gates, being a wise investor if nothing else, KNOWS
this, and therefore would NEVER try such a thing:  he'd much rather invest
in something that will actually pay for itself in the long run than throw
money at such a stupid plan.

Perhaps I should have made this clearer... if Gates *were* to spend all his
money, he'd be crushed by his competitors in no time flat.  And while Gates
is picking up the pieces of his squandered fortune, the indians will be
hiring a PPA to protect them from people like him in the future.

>That is if your PPA lets you decide where your money is
>going to go.

If it doesn't, YOU DISOBEY THEM, with the support of the other PPA, who
profits by helping you do so.  That's part of the point of this whole system.

>I think the analogy with the nation state is pretty useful.
>you could fund another nation, (a la cubans in the US), but only if that
>other nation is more powerful than your current one.

The problem with this analogy is that you're still thinking in terms of
nations, where you have to stage an overthrow (ie win a war) in order to
live under a new form of government.

In the instance of PPAs, on the other hand, even tyrannical ones, we're
presuming that they're actually trying to do a cost-benefit analysis with
respect to what they're doing.  A tyrannical PPA will not simply throw
itself at all other PPAs indiscriminately if its customers decide to look
elsewhere.  That would be economic suicide.  It's simply not worth it to
pursue a "stay with us or suffer the consequences" policy when you're
competing with other PPAs, because war is expensive.  An agressive PPA
simply can't compete with a peaceful non-interventionist one; the agressive
PPA would eventually go out of business, no matter HOW power-hungry they were.

It comes down to this:  it's worth more to me not to be oppressed than it
is worth to others to oppress me.  No one can maintain for long a policy of
spending money on things which aren't worthwhile to them; such fools will
always go out of business in the long run, so long as other competitors
exist to take up the slack.

>And that does not

>might not be to the same degree (again, a la cubans in

True, you don't have guarantees.  What guarantees do you have now of the
same thing?  As John Clark pointed out, what's stopping the US armed forces
from turning this whole land into a military dictatorship?

I agree with Clark that anarcho-capitalism will not guarantee freedom,
(nothing will,) but rather that it is the political structure most likely
to uphold it.

Centralized systems are not inherently bad, they just take some smart
organizing and some well-placed checks and balances. It sure beats
anarchy (remember this setup is meant for Jack the Lad, not responsible
and independent people like *us*), which is beyond anyone's control.
A centralized system can be benevolent in its intentions, anarchy, like
nature itself, doesn't give a crap about fairness or individual well-being.
It's simply survival of the fittest in its most basic form. Although I don't
like nation states or bureacracies, I do belief that leaving them intact
while repairing the some of the major flaws is better than the gamble
of anarchy. Anarchy is inherently unstable and leads to hierarchy, often 
of the opressive kind. Just check any history book.

Yes, but you are of a rare breed. Jack the Lad, for whom the system was
designed in the first place, is a lot more obedient than you claim to be.
*Most* people are quite obedient, and in this case it's even for their own
good. Anyway, besides the bodycams the state wouldn't need anyone's
co-operation with their surveillance. If you don't want to document your
life, then you're free to do so at your own risk.

So we obviously don't want something that is a 1000x smarter, but something
with exactly enough intelligence to take on judicial matters combined with
superhuman speed and unlimited stamina. 100 cases a minute, 24h a day
so to speak. In any case, "simple" electronic justice can be implemented
*today* by constructing easy to use national/global crime databases, heavy
electronic surveillance of judges, poilice, criminals and everyone else, by
adopting electronic house arrest, automated prisons etc.

By selection on the desired criteria, continous training in the most difficult
cases,
continous surveillance (to prevent corruption), excellent pay, high social status,
bonuses for correctly handling extremely difficult cases etc. It's a very intensive
job, but you are aided by top technology and can leave with a clear conscience
and a stacked bank account.

See above, it *does* pay to do the best job possible.

Good surveillance brings out the saint in anyone, and all judicial candidates
are subject to intensive psychological profiling, not just one but continously.

The free market is no magic bullet, not by far. Many a good product has 
failed for trivial and/or incomprehensible reasons. The free market is
basically commercial democracy: you let the people vote for products.
Now we all now that many people are asses when it coms to real
(political) voting, and they aren't much better at economical voting.
Instead of being fooled by slick talkin' politicians they would be (are)
fooled by slick talkin' (PPA) salesmen...

Others have already criticized the anarco-capitalist PPA model but I'll ad my
$ 0.10 anyway:

First of all, how do you want to achieve a state of anarchy? After all, the nation
states aren't going to roll over and die just like that. Not until the Powers get
them, but by then *all* our ideas about society will be obsolete.

Even if you could achieve widespread (all major nations must co-operate, or
you'd just be invaded "for your own good") anarchy, how do you prevent it
from becoming one big mess a la Mad Max? 

How do you prevent PPAs (basically bands of armed thugs) from developing
the characteristics of the mob, feudal lords or regular governments? Remember,
most people are *afraid* of real freedom and personal responsibility, they don't
want it, and even if they want it they usually don't know how to defend it. They
are easy prey for any power structure that survived the colaps of the nation states
like (parts of) army units and criminal organizations. Before you know it, you
have a world full of more or less totalitarian city states, large bans of robbers,
hardly any infrastructure (and travel is extremely dangerous anyway) etc.
Basically, it's the dark ages all over again.

Yet the only reason these contracts have any value is because there is a
big government to keep an eye on things, to provide a civilized context.
So why not try to commercialize and smoothen up the court system
(and everything else) instead of abolishing them (so that they may sneak
back under a different name). Centralized governments don't *have* to
be bureaucratic. Automatization can help a lot, and services can be 
only offered to those who want them.

I suppose somthing like this could be incorporated into a centralized system 
too...

Civil behaviour through threat of force can also be achieved by allowing the
citizens of a nation-state to keep and bear arms. I personally think that 
we would see more and worse violence in anarchy than in a centralized
society. In fact, a nation state with good electronic surveillance and the right
to keep & bear arms would be quite peaceful, with only sporadic crime
as opposed too the relatively safe patches of civilization surrounded by
dangerous thug-filled wastelands that are typical for anarchy.

In the past, when the world was more anarcho-capitalistic than it is now, justice
*was* something for the rich, and people would risk their lives as enforcers for
a fraction of today's price because human life wasn't worth much anyway, and
one has to eat after all... Why would it be different the second time around?

If you were rich, I'm sure you could buy "perfect" justice for yourself and your 
relatives in your new world (dis)order. But if you're not...

"Anarchy" in any form is unstable (it's simply a power vacuum), and sooner
or later will give rise to new "nations", most of which are sure to be ruled by
dictators. As far as I know, no serious democracy has ever decided to kill
of half (or any substantial portion) of its own people. I'm no great fan of 
democracy, but considering human nature I think it's better than anarchy.

That depends on how pissed off and/or rich I am...Since there's only your PPA
to deal with instead of a huge government that's all over I might try to take you 
out either myself or I may hire as many destitute souls as my budged allows 
to do it for me. By the way, slander would be punishable by fines and a public
excuse, not torture. But of course this only applies to centralized nation states...

There is a subtle difference here: smoking, drinking, driving cars etc. are one's
personal choice and responcibility, and by no means criminal behaviour. Robbing
or killing someone is something else entirely since it doesn't involve the victim's
consent. It's not up to the state to stop you from eating too much, but they should
try to make public spaces as safe as possible.

Sure, drunk driving has to be taken care of, but but the more morally
repugnant deliberate criminal acts like murder, rape and theft should
be taken on even harsher.

My definition is a manual for fair justice, yours is stating a certain goal. That
are two different, and not necessarily incompatible things. By the way, I
am primarily intersted in reducing the suffering of the *victims*, not *everyone*,
including the criminals. They simply get what they did to others, no more &
no less. IMO as fair as you can get.

A goal is nothing without an explanation about the means to achieve it. My 
definition gives you the tools you need to implement justice, assuming that
your goal is something like "minimizing the amount of crime in society".

Not a whole lot.  

But the Sphinx has quite a lot of rain erosion on 
its back -- even considering how old it was formerly believed to be.  
Indicating that substantially more rain has fallen on it than has 
fallen on any similarly-sized nearby patch of land in that period of 
time.  

The most plausible explanation is that the Sphinx is older than was 
formerly believed.  If you just slide the date back to account for 
the erosion, you cross a period in which we are pretty sure the 
climate in that area changed -- before this period, that area was 
*not* desert, and got substantially more rain than it gets today.  

The problem is, you also go past the period in which civilization is 
believed to have come to Egypt.

And there is the fallacy.  A centralized system CANNOT be benevolent 
in its intentions.  For that matter, it cannot be malevolent either.  
This is because a "system" cannot have intentions.  Only individuals 
have intentions.

The FOUNDERS of that centralized system might have had benevolent 
intentions.  Are they still in control of the system?  Do they still 
have those intentions?  Do their successors have those intentions?

There are two factors arguing *against* the notion that a 
centralized system will remain consistent with its founders' original 
good intentions.

One applies to any organization: the organization *cannot* pursue 
those good intentions if it ceases to exist.  On the other hand, it 
can pursue its current controllers' goals more effectively if it 
grows in size and wealth/power.  Therefore, from the get-go, some 
portion of the institution's efforts must go to self-preservation and 
self-aggrandisement as opposed to any other objective.  The larger 
fraction of its efforts go to these purposes, the more successful it 
is likely to be in competition against other organizations.  
Therefore these efforts tend to take over the organization 
completely.

The second applies disproportionately to government.  If you wish to 
create opportunities for a million people to run their own lives more 
effectively, or to become wealthy, or to be happy, or any thing that 
people would welcome into their own lives, there are a million ways 
you can do that and very few of them require the force of government. 
 On the other hand, if you wish to make a million people miserable, 
or make a million people do whatever you want them to do without 
compensation, or simply take wealth away from a million people, or 
any other thing they would NOT welcome into their lives, there is 
really only one reliable way to achieve this goal: through 
government.  Therefore the latter sort of people are 
disproportionately represented in government; and since they want to 
be the controllers, not the controlled, they won't consider 
themselves bound by anyone's intentions but their own (except perhaps 
as a matter of expediency).

While I believe that centralized government is inherently either bad 
from the get-go or doomed to become bad, I will also agree with you 
that anarchy is unstable and leads to centralized government -- 
usually of a *very* bad sort.

However, looking at history isn't much help, because all the great 
examples of "anarchy" (at least, all of them I have checked) prove on 
closer examination to be examples not of the *absence* of government, 
but of the *overabundance* of government -- as in, several of them 
claiming and exercising the authority of government over a single 
area.  It would be too much to hope for, that all these governments 
would succeed in killing each other off completely while somehow 
leaving the populace and their productive capacity mostly intact...

Look, if Bill Gates ever develops an insane homicidal hatred of me then  I'd 
be in a very uncomfortable situation in my system, yours, or any other. 
I think you're trying to hold advocates of Anarchy to an impossibly high 
standard, you want us to prove that evil acts would be impossible in such a  
world. Well I can't do that, but I think I can show that there would be more
freedom, far fewer victimless crimes, and no murders committed on an  
industrial scale that we're all too familiar with. Instead of dreaming up 
bizarre and unlikely scenarios involving murderous billionaires ask yourself  
how the holocaust or the inquisition could have possibly occurred in the 
world I describe.

By the way, last time I checked there were close to a billion Indians not 
10 million
           

        >i don't see any PPA supporting the poor people since they have

If this sort of thing bothers you then pick a PPA that does a lot of charity 
work. Of course if nobody wants to help these people then they're in deep 
trouble, but no worse than today. If you won't voluntarily help the poor why 
would you vote for a politician who makes you?
           

        >Doing business with a PPA is voluntary as long as that PPA lets it         
        >be a voluntary thing. 
           

A nation has a geographical area, so changing nations is nothing you can do  
lightly as it will change every aspect of your life. A PPA on the other hand 
has no geographical area, changing a PPA would be like changing your car 
insurance, you just pick up a telephone. A PPA that tried to prevent people 
from changing would have to go to war with all the other PPA's, for reasons I
explained earlier it's unlikely it would win.

It's meaningless to ask how much money Stalin had, his face was on the 
currency for goodness sake, he could have anything and everything that it was 
possible for the USSR to produce. Making money is a good and noble activity 
and the idea that Bill Gates had more power over peoples lives than Stalin 
is crazy.

Financial cryptography may be one important step...  but I don't think even
the most pronounced advocates of anarcho-capitalism have a step by step
plan to bring it about.  Most anarcho-capitalists I know favor a gradual
movement towards libertarianism, then simply continuing the privitization
process until there's nothing left.  No collapse, no widespread chaos, no
period of anarchy as you know it.

Have you been reading?  If people don't want society to look like Mad Max,
then they'll pay money to do so.

There is no way.  How do you prevent the US armed forces from taking over
the nation and turning it into a military dictatorship?  How, especially
when the groups holding the guns are (almost exclusively) working for the
government?

You're presuming that this would involve a violent uprising and a collapse
of the institutions we hold most dear, and then (cross your fingers!)
anarcho-capitalism rises up from the rubble.  

But what if rather than a collapse, it was just a slow process of
privitization?  Not only would this not lead to chaos, it would also very
likely improve the material welfare of everyone in the nation every step of
the way.

So in one respect, I agree; I also think that a totalitarian regime would
likely take control if the US government fell tomorrow.  For that very
reason, I advocate slow privitization, not instantaneous collapse.

>Or, like in the good old days, with brute force. Guess who has the privelege

What happens now when disagreements happen between nations, or even between
many governments and citizens?  Guess who has the privelege of being the
foot soldier?

Those contracts, yes.  These new contracts would be more comparable to
national peace pacts; except in order to prove their worth, PPAs might
offer some form of collateral to show that they'll actually abide by their
laws.  ("How do we know that you'll keep your word?"  "My trustworthy
arbitration agency has a copy of $100M of my money.  If that court awards
you restitution, they have the ability to give it to you without my consent.")

What do you mean by commercialize?  Do you mean privatize?  If so, then you
already know that this is EXACTLY what I'm suggesting.  :)

There's no rule saying that centralized systems of government CAN'T do
whatever a market would do, but at that point, why not just let the market
do it, and save yourself the time and money?

Please, remember, we're not talking immediate collapse of governments,
we're talking privitization...

And another point:  if your plan for government really is the most
cost-effective, then it will be the plan which most profit-minded PPAs will
choose.  What would be wrong with that?

<sigh>  Go back and reread.  If you try to buy your own justice, you'll
have to pay through the nose for it.  Not only is it not worth it, but
you'll also lose if there's a sufficient number of PPAs competing against you.

Military generals and the local police force haven't really tried to snatch
power by force in the US, so far.  I put it to you that there is nothing
preventing them from doing so.  So what's keeping them from filling this
so-called "power vacuum?"

Except that I'm much more invested in preserving myself than you are in

not worth it to do so.

Who says?  Why couldn't PPAs have a similar legal structure, especially if
it's the most cost-efficient?

Actually, paper companies are using much faster growth trees for paper production,
that have been bred specifically for this purpose. South of Olympia, WA, for
example Weherhouser has a rather decent sized plantation of 3 year cottonwoods
that it harvests regularly.

You can find details of Mars Global Surveyor's (MGS) imaging schedule concerning Cydonia and NASA's approximate internet posting of the resulting images at http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/target/prepare2.html

Personally, I do not believe these images will settle anything. The people who claim that the "face on Mars" is of artificial design have done so based on extremely tenuous and unconvincing evidence. Such claims are more faith than scientific speculation. Through the goggles of their faith I am sure they will see new evidence in the MGS images to support their claim, not evidence refuting it.  I can image what they'll say already:

"Look at how naturally the Martians made this massive monument appear!"
"NASA doctored the images."
"The natural features are the result of sand blowing over the artificial features of the face and surrounding monuments."
"The Martians learned from their agents here on Earth that we were going to image the site and covered their tracks."
"Wow this image totally confirms what I've been saying all along! Can't you see it too?"

These images will be used to confirm both sides of the debate and serve as additional weaponry for the certain massive usenet "debates" to follow. Anyone want odds on predicting what month the alt.cydonia newsgroup will appear?

Not to mention that the smart ones will gang up and fight back; remember,
Bill Gates + $1,000,000 nuke == vapor. Somehow I think most of those
10,000,000 Indians will be happy to pay $0.10 each to eliminate the

Stable anarchy can only exist with a complete overabundance of
government.  When *everybody* wants the power, nobody gets it.

What?  Whoever made that claim?  the 10000000 Indians i had in mind
earn less than a dollar a day, and he earns more than 10 million a day,
but the exact numbers are not really relevant to my numbers in any case.

What you have to lose is whatever the cost of converting the current
system into an anarcho-capitalist system is.  Don't get me wrong, if you
found this magical way of making the world an anarcho-capitalist arena,
i'm right behind you, but i don't see the point in striving for some
almost-unatainable system which i think is likely to naturally degrade to
the present system.

They are both likely to be false due the same reason: you prefer the other
PPA because you are going to pay less than you do now, which means that
the potential profit for that other PPA is lower than the current profit
of your current PPA, which means that your current PPA will spend more
money keeping you than the other PPA will in trying to "free" you.

If their human capital is worth almost nothing to the market (as it is, or
otherwise their income would be higher), it is also worth nothing to their
PPA.

not really, it just means that his growth wouldn't grow, but it does not
mean that his growth would decline.  He could just keep a stable state and
spend all his profits on his whims.

the indians will not be hiring anyone cos they will be dead.  And as i
showed before, Gates could do this with just using his profits.  (And if
you don't like the numbers, change the 10000000 indians for 1 million
indians, the actual number is inconsequential to the argument as long as

I don't see this at all.  War is expensive for both sides.  Your PPA
doesn't have to fight anyone if no other PPA tries to "rescue you".  And
no other PPA will try because they know that your PPA gets a higher profit
from you than they would (since that is the point of your rescue,
otherwise they would try, and probably succeed, but this means that they
would get more out of you than your current PPA).  Analogies with
nation-states ad infinitum.

Depends what you mean on "this whole land".  If you mean the US, i would
say they get a very nice forced profit from you, and almost complete
autonomy from any civil law.  this is probably more profitable for them
than forcing a military dictatorship (they are tricky things to run, very
personnel-intensive, and probably not worth the trouble).

Depends on your idea of freedom.  I don't see it as something only
quantitavely rather than qualitatively different from the current state.

I'm interested in results, I don't give a damn about intentions. I hope I  
don't come across sounding too cynical but any system that must rely on  
people loving each other is not going to work. The farmer grows my food, the 
trucker moves my food and the grocer sells my food, none of these people love 
me, yet the free market plunges them into a conspiracy to put food on my 
table.

Continuos surveillance would be enough to stop most from going into that line        
of work, it would certainly stop me.
          

           >(to prevent corruption), excellent pay,        


High pay won't stop corruption, regardless of how much money you have it's 
never enough. In my world you don't need to tack on anti corruption measures, 
it's intrinsic to the system. The better job a PPA does, the  more it can 
charge. If 10$ more is stolen from me if I stay with PPA #1 rather than 
switch to PPA #2 then I will stay with #1 ONLY if they charge 10$ less.
Each dollar stolen from me is equivalent to a dollar stolen directly from the 
PPA. For this reason it is in the financial interest of the heads of the PPA 
to keep bribery of employees as low as possible. Contrast that to the  
situation today, it doesn't cost the police a dime, regardless of how much is 
stolen from me, and they may even make money off my misfortune by receiving  
payoff money from the thief.               
          

        >Good surveillance brings out the saint in anyone


I'd rather be a sinner.


        >and all judicial candidates are subject to intensive psychological

1) Psychological profiling is crap.

The reasons they failed are often comprehensible and never trivial. For 
example, consider the computer you're probably using right now, the one 
you're unhappy with. It's true that if you were starting from scratch lots of  
people could make a more consistent, more elegant, system than Wintel, but 
Microsoft and Intel didn't have that luxury. Everything they made had to be 
compatible with everything they made before, this imposes a severe burden, 
but a burden the  most popular operating system in the world MUST bear. 
If the Many Worlds Interpretation is correct, I predict that on nearly all 
those worlds people are complaining that the most popular operating system is 
an ugly mess, a inelegant hodgepodge of kludges. Such is the fate of things 
that are not designed all at once but evolve and grow, things like English 
with it's weird spelling, or biological organisms for that matter.

It's in the nature of things that standards are resistant to change, but 
that's OK because that is exactly the way a standards should be. The lack of 
popularity of the Apple or Next or Bee or whatever operating system is not an 
example of market failure because in the context of the real world they are 
in fact inferior system. If everything else was equal they would be better 
than Wintel but everything else is not equal. These systems have some small 
technical advantages but that is countered by enormous practical 
disadvantages, they will not operate on the type of computer most people have 
and it will not run billions of dollars worth of popular software that took
millions of man years to write. It's perfectly valid to take such things into 
account when deciding what system is really  superior. When a standard is set 
it's just not worth going to a new one unless you get an  astronomical 
improvement. The market has decided that the Apple or Next or Bee is not a 
huge advance of that type. Maybe the market is wrong but I know it has a
better understanding of such things than a bunch of hack politicians.

No, there is a fundamental difference. Elections are dumb, an idiotic way of  
communicating your wishes, there are much better ways. Every day I send 
hundreds of exquisitely precise messages to the Free Market telling it what I 
want it to do. I also get to compare brands, I can't do that In a democracy 
because I'm not voting for goods or services or even policies, I just get to
choose between two grab bags of promises every 4 years, and democracy is the 
best form of government, the best of a bad lot.

When I "vote" in the economy by making a purchase I am sure to get it, I 
always win. When I vote for the grab bag I may or may not get it. At any rate, 
the chances that my vote will influence things is so small that it's not 
worth my time to study the issues very deeply, the result is that the 
politician with the best hairdo gets to make the decisions.

        >that. 


I don't need to achieve it, like it or not I see no way to stop it. I think 
we'll soon find out if my optimistic assessment of a world without government 
is correct, because I don't see how the traditional nation state can continue 
much longer, they will go the way of the city state.

Nations will die not with a bang but with a whimper because modern worldwide  
communication, cryptography and untraceable digital cash and signatures will  
make it increasingly difficult to collect taxes, the balance is tipping away  
from the tax collector and in favor of the tax evader.  

Governments will undoubtedly draft many new laws to try to protect themselves  
in this brave new world, but making rules is easy, enforcing them is not.  
Short of dismantling the Internet and confiscating all home computers it's  
impossible to dictate what form of encryption or digital cash you must use  
in your home. Regardless of the rules, you can't collect the tax if you can't  
find the  money. Even the traditional standby of "tax by inflation"  would 
not work as  people would just switch to a competing currency (untraceable of 
course) that  suited their needs better. The tribute that could still be 
extracted, like property taxes and building permits, would have to be 
increased to astronomic  levels and collected with a heavy hand, I think a
tax revolt would follow.  Without money government will grind to a halt.

Except in binding arbitration, when 2 companies go to an arbiter it's like 
going to a marriage councilor, they are not legally required to do what the 
arbiter says, yet companies almost always do. If it does not then nobody  
would be willing to engage in arbitration with it in the future and that

that my PPA  wasn't pulling out all the stops in its investigation of a
murdered member  I'd change my PPA so fast it'd make your head spin.

"Why Good Products can fail"?  Okay, a good idea might make a bad

I agree that this cost would be born...  I said that we have little to
lose, not nothing to lose.  However, there is much, much more to be gained.
 The degree to which this system is "attainable" is currently the subject
of debate.

Not at all!  In this particular case, I prefer the other PPA because it
isn't TYRANNICAL, remember?  I think it's safe to presume that I'm prepared
to pay at least as much as I'd pay a tyrannical PPA in exchange for my
freedom.

Once I have made the decision to switch PPAs, my current PPA gets no profit.

If I'm prepared to spend more money for a more liberal PPA, this whole
argument goes straight out the window.

I'm not trying to hold anarchists to anything.  I consider myself
an anarchist, in the more traditional use of the word
(anarcho-socialists).  I was just pointing out the, what i think are,
extensive simmilarities between the current system and PPA based
anarcho-capitalism as you described it, and the big power that one man
could wield over a large part of the population in this supposedly
decentralised system.  The holocaust or the inquisition could just as well
happen as with the current nation-states, the main difference being that
the new megalomaniac's great quality would be having heaps of property.  I
don't see the case i described of bill gates or some other billionaire of
trying to wipe a part of the population as any more far-fetched than that
of some german thinking that jews are evil and trying to wipe off that
portionof the population.  Great wealth is not a certificate of sanity.

say that bill gates wanted to wipe India off the planet, just that some
person with wealth y would want to do something disagreeable to  x people
with income z, where x is very large but y > x*z, and him/her being able
to do this rather easily under the proposed system.

i didn't claim that.  Stalin is not exactly the average guy in a position
of power right now.  That Bill Gates under PPA anarcho-capitalism (PPAAC?)
would have more influence than John Howard (Australia's PM, just in case)
has right now, i would say most definitely.

A PPA, even a tyrannical one, supported by people who are worth nothing to
their PPA, would not be in business for long.  I conclude that they are
worth something, and to the extent that they are, another PPA would be
willing to support them.

It would decline relative to those around him, who would continue to grow
at a far faster rate.

I'm not trusting anybody.  I continue to assert that Bill Gates would be
crushed if he tried to pursue the policy of enslavement.  The fact that he
knows this is only an additional safeguard.

>the indians will not be hiring anyone cos they will be dead.

Sorry, I'd missed this.  I'd thought he was trying to enslave the Indians,
but you had meant he was trying kill them.  My mistake...

>And as i

... but in that case, perhaps you'd best consider that right now he could
just as easily purchase some attack helicopters from a defense contractor
(he could afford it), renounce citizenship in the United States, and then
bribe the current Indian government into not stopping him as he razes their
cities.

As Clark pointed out, if Bill Gates suddenly decided to stop at nothing to
kill you or me or 10 million people out in India, we'd ALL be in serious
trouble, especially under our current political system.  Anarcho-capitalism
won't be able to put a stop to this sort of thing; it is not utopian.
However, at least under anarcho-capitalism the Indians could legitimately
employ someone else before Bill Gates decided to launch his assault.  They
would not have to support their corrupt government while they were under
attack.  As I see it, they would have a chance.

>I addressed this in my previous answer to your mail. The profit to your

Which I also explicitly disproved.  People would pay at least as much if
not more for freedom.

This, I repeat, is simply untrue.

Though the conclusion to this point is telling.  They WOULD probably
succeed, because they WOULD get more out of you than your current PPA.
That's our whole point.

The military gets paid well, but not half as well as they could be.  Not to
mention the fact that, at least for now, they only receive the wages which
the politicians allow them to receive.  There's no question, the military
would DEFINITELY profit by rejecting this policy and taking over the country.

>Depends on your idea of freedom.  I don't see it as something only
>quantitavely rather than qualitatively different from the current state.

I'm not certain what you mean by this, but I can assure you that freedom is
not binary.  Someone at the point of a gun is more free than someone
physically strapped to the ground, but clearly less free than someone who
isn't being threatened at all.  I see these as quantitative, not
qualitative changes.

Well,  I've done it again - gotten myself into a bind.  I was caught in
my Freshman Seminar class reading the latest installment of the
Extropian Principles,  and was forced to give a small lecture on the
subject matter (i.e. - explaining to everyone what extropy was).  This
interested my FreshSem teacher enough for her to give me that as an
essay subject.  Now I must relate "Extropian values in accordance to
slavery" with the Harriet Jacobs book "Incidents in the Life of a Slave
Girl".

Anyone have any ideas for subject matter for me?  I've read through the
book and through the Extropian Principles,  but I need to write an essay
that my teacher will be able to comprehend - and that drastically
reduces my options.  Assigned on Friday,  I need to have it done by
Wednesday.  Eep.  

Any help would be appreciated,  as I'm not accustomed to writing
analytical essays.

The first thing to do is give your teacher an English lesson by
titling the essay "Extropian Values as Applied to Slavery"; "in
accordance with" means "in agreement with", which Extropian values
are most definitely not.  "In accordance to" is just a mistake.

You'll probably find more information starting from Libertarian
sources and then changing the vocabulary and point of view to be
more Extropian.  Objectivist sources like the IOS might have some
good stuff as well.

"I often found myself regretting my own existence, and wishing
myself dead; and but for the hope of being free, I have no doubt
that I should have killed myself, or done something for which I
should have been killed." --Fredrick Douglass

Doesn't sound very Extropian to me.

Hmm, can we please tell aparth between parlamentarian democracy and direct  
democracy? -- I think that direct democracy is really the closest form of  
"spontaneous order" that we know. Democratic bureaucracies are a phaenomen  
of the parlamentarian democracies.

Sincerely,
Nico

Not to mention "We can't do our job!  We need more tax funding!"

Ever notice that a government agency that is doing a good job at its 
alleged purpose sits there and gets ignored, while a government 
agency that is doing a lousy job at its alleged purpose gets lots of 
attention and an increase in staff and funding?  And, quite often, an 
increase in its power and authority as well, along with the coercive 
measures available to it?

And some people wonder why some of us don't trust government to do a 
good job...

Their "detailed description" is mathematical-sounding bullshit
and absolutely fraudulent claims.  Their money is safe, though,
because their system is trivially unbreakable in the same way
a one-time pad is, because their method contains no key exchange
or distribution method; this has been known for centuries.

Any idiot can make an uncrackable cipher, and you don't need
the pile of algorithms these guys yammer on about--you just need
a plastic decoder ring and a safe way to exchange keys.  It is
public key distribution where are the interesting stuff is.
These guys are con artists preying on the public's ignorance of
this fact.

If "everybody wants the power" in the sense that they are competing 
against each other for it, they will form gangs.

A stable anarchy would indeed make each person a government -- over a 
very small area that doesn't overlap with anybody else's very 
small area except by mutual consent.  That doesn't create the 
situation of multiple governments over the same area.

You might look up extropian and transhumanists writings on the UIF
principle, which is central to our thought on many things. UIF stands for
Unlimited Individual Freedom. In this context, being extropian is about as
far from being a slave or condoning slavery as one could possibly get. You
could also say that they stand at opposite ends of the evolutionary scale,
where at one time in our past, all humans were slaves to one thing or

Except that they're not spontaneous.  Once your direct democracy has made a
decision, it has to force its operations on the minority who disapprove.
On the other hand, the great majority of market operations take place
because both parties want them to take place, and thus they participate
volutarily.  To that extent, capitalism is much closer to "spontaneous
order" than democracy.

If you just take away private property, then the government, who is no more
required to be benevolent than Bill Gates, has precisely the same magical
powers.  This is not theory, this is fact.  Slaughters just like the kind
you're proposing have taken place at the hands of authoritarian governments
countless times throughout history.  Abolishing private property does not
alleviate this problem; it makes it much much worse.

So I presume you mean to topple the state, too...  But if you try the
revolutionary tactic many anarcho-socialists suggest, the general consensus
is that people will be only MORE likely to embrace totalitarianism.
Revolution is dangerous and chaotic.  People beg for strong leadership
during these periods...  we'll *definitely* be right back where we started,
because there won't be ANYTHING to stop it, not even the possibility of a PPA.

No, you're right, it's not a certificate of sanity.  Neither is holding a
public office, sadly.

But consider this, Mr. left-anarchist.  Remember Bakunin?  (Hint:  Don't
eliminate money to make the state fall away, eliminate the state and let
MONEY fall away.)  Anarcho-socialist communes, group societies, etc. could
all exist, live and thrive under anarcho-capitalism.  If they're more
prosperous than a capitalist system, they will even be more abundant than
the PPA system.  

If you support a society with no state and no private property, you should
eliminate the state first, in a slow, peaceful manner; then, if you're
right, private property should fall away as the more efficient and
generally superior socialist communes spread like wild fire.

So would you at least consider looking at anarcho-capitalism in the same
way that true communists wanted to look at authoritarian socialism, as an
intermediary step towards the final goal?

Under anarcho-capitalism slaughter is harder than it is now; but if it's
really really easy now, then there's not quite as much we can do about it.
Anarcho-socialism won't help this, either, sadly.

Again, your conception of the situation was completly incorrect.  Say my
PPA (PPA-1) decided to become tyrannical.  PPA-2, we agree, will interfere
only if it will earn them a profit; they will win only if they make more
profit than PPA-1 would otherwise.  In light of this, I offer PPA-2
slightly MORE than I used to pay PPA-1, and I refuse to pay PPA-1.  From
there, PPA-2 has the means and the incentive to protect me from PPA-1.

John Howard is a poor choice...  A better choice would be someone like the
head of the Australian military, who, we imagine, actually could take over
the country given his position.  Howard could not do this.

Anyway, the point is this:  Yes, Bill Gates would have a lot of power under
A-C, but there are plenty of people who wield incredible powers today
(military generals, etc.) who have no checks on their power.  No system of
political checks and balances can overcome this; so long as the military
exists, it can simply choose to reject the laws set down by the politicians
and take over the country.  Anarcho-capitalism is the only way to even sort
of begin to limit the effects of this power, by allowing people to choose
between competing protection agencies, rather than being stuck with just one.

And that's a good thing.

PPA's are profit motivated, Nations are power motivated. Nations have a  
geographical location , PPA's do not. It's easy to change PPA's, it's not 
easy to change nations. PPA's membership is voluntary, Nation citizenship is 
not. PPA's settle differences with arbitration, Nations prefer force.  
Nations claim powers individuals lack, PPA's don't.

Please explain to me how a PPA consisting of 40 million Germans, even 
assuming they all decided for some reason to join the same one, would be 
powerful enough to kill 6 million Jews. Explain why even though it means 
their life the Jews would not be willing to pay a premium seven times as high 
as their German neighbors pay their PPA.

If you're an Indian fisherman and you think that big bad Bill Gates is out to

The worst thing, a fair fraction of them are still not getting it --
there is a significant (and growing) support for the communist party.
The things have not improved as rapidly as promised/people would like
to have it, and they are getting impatient. Also, most of them are
depressed and cynical, many are looking to make an escape into the
west. Men being alcoholics is axiomatic. Health care system is down,
pensions often hardly sufficient to keep people alive. Otoh,
especially among older people a touchingly naive faith in 
the government is widespread I don't know what the average youth is
thinking, but girls are purported to find prostitution an attractive 
career. Unemployment, especially hidden unemployment are
dramatic. Black economy eclipses the official budget by an order of magnitude.
Ecological situation is a desaster. Bad as the situation in Moscow and 
Leningrad is, the periphery is way worse. Wages are not paid for
months there. People are gone into minifarming to not to
starve. Sachalin's fisher fleet won't function because there is not
enough money for fuel. Youth criminality is very high 
generally, the streets are not safe at night. Infrastructure is in 
a terrible state, attempts of  maintanance are slovenly. The streets 
belong to the dirt, and the street dogs. Kamikaze car drivers with
bogus licenses run over people frequently. The new russians often even 
do not stop after an accident -- they can always get away by bribes.
Tendency for improvement is purported to be there, yet it is slow
enough not be perceptable by yours truly on the scale of a few months.

The centralism has not decreased imo: merely people in leading
positions grabbed the resources which suddenly become available. Of
course, to be in leading positions these people had to be Communists.
The tax system is a bad joke. Mid-range businessmen are drained both
by the mafia and ridiculous taxation. There is money out there, but it is
concentrated enormously. The newest of the new russians have current 
or past criminal affiliations. The most basic issues as
e.g. privatization of the ground are still being debated about, after
a decade of 'reforms'.  For all practical purposes industry is down. 
As is science (20% of MSU's staff have leaved the country, most of
them permanently. Of course these are the best 20%). The mafia and 
the government are indistinguishable. The police is corrupt, and 
harasses and waylays people (you can be easily beaten up and robbed, 
legal methods to combat this are useless -- in fact worse than
useless -- police casualties are thus very high). Mafia and business 
are indistinguishable. During 'rasborki', as they call it, mafia gang 
members and businessmen are killed routinely.

There's centralism for you.

Please demonstrate me the magical technology which will maintain a
long-term stable fine-grained anarchy for current, average individua
(=hick off the street). The governments and criminal organisations do 
not exist because of a whim. Even if you remove them, the ecological 
niche will still persist, to be filled with individuals with according 
inclinations. Don't fret, predators/prey coevolve to a higher fitness.

There might be a tendency for the average person to become more
educated with time but it is slow and suffers occasional backslides -- 
hence virtual or physical aggregation of individua with nondefector
values may become worthwhile. Trivially but importantly IT
technologies allows e.g. more leisure time for education and more
efficient methods of teaching, implementations of tamperproof currency,
instanteous (tele and face2face) transactions, diverse agent 
authentication schemes and maintaining a dealing history and thus 
accelerate such a trend. Of course it assumes the ROI amplitude of above
activities to be dramatic enough not to be drowned by random noise.

  That's the opening of the Humanist Manifesto II, from 1973.  To get the
tenor of modern Humanism, read a little on the American Humanist
Association page at <http://www.infidels.org/org/aha/documents/> or the
newer one at <http://humanist.net/>.  

  A very current issue that both transhumanist and humanist communities
have adressed is cloning.  See
<http://www.SecularHumanism.org/library/fi/cloning_declaration_17_3.html>
for the Humanist argument supporting cloning research.

  I have been involved for over 5 years with organized humanism, inspired
by the promethean stance suggested by the quote above.  The Humanist
Community meets at Stanford University.  See <http://humanists.org>.  My
own impression is that Humanists are more accepting of conventionally
assumed limits of human nature, and less interested in extrapolating from
current technology than the Extropian/Transhumanist movement. Sometimes I
get bored.  They definitely are more inclined toward collective solutions
to problems than the libertarians in the Extropian movement.

  I agree with someone who said that Humanists, although agnostic/atheist,
have more of the Judeo-Christian values than Transhumanists, and Humanists
tend to address issues from more of a religious/ethical viewpoint.  Perhaps
that is why they are so reviled by fundamentalist Christians --- you can
write off someone who is radically different, but it's frustrating to deal
with someone who is culturally similar enough to you to be relevant, yet
differs sharply on important issue(s).

  Any anthropologist who was dropped into both communities would observe
that Humanists are generally older than Extropians/Transhumanists.

  My view is that Humanists and Transhumanists have enough common values to
work together in science-promotion, euthenasia legalization, and other
areas.  But to do that we have to avoid overemphasizing where we differ.

It does sound agreeable, especially to someone like myself, who is under
the spell of transhumanism and Extropianism.  Nonetheless, I am wary
because I wonder how much is platitude and how much is substance.
(I apply the same to Extropian and transhumanist manifestoes.  Maybe
manifestoes have to be this way.  I hope not!  But maybe...)

To some extent, this might be expected.  I don't wish to be too charitable
either.  I _bet_ most secular humanists are desirous of passing themselves
off as reasonable and conventional, while with transhumanists, Extropians
and libertarians -- never those who are all three!:) -- there seems to be a
tendency to be more radical than thou.  (I find this trait to be mostly pleasing
even if it is sometimes shallow and tedious.)

With humans, this is usually the case.  The nations which are in close
geographic proximity are typically the worst of enemies -- typically but not
necessarily.  In ideology and philosophy, the more radical the ideas, it
seems, the less tolerant of difference and dissent seem the purveyors of
such.

This has been my experience also.  I've never met a secular humanist under
thirty.  However, my experience is very limited in this area.  Need I metion I
do not seek their company these days?

That depends on whether the differences are fundamental and how we
define fundamental.  To illustrate, both libertarians and socialists, in their
more pure forms, would agree that the present society is unjust.  They
might even agree on many other issues, such as abolishing corporate
welfare.  Even so, would libertarians (on this list and elsewhere) really
think it good to form a coalition and even offer support to socialists?  I
doubt it!

I think a very divisive, and rightly so!, issue would be that of mortality.
 Secular humanists seem to embrace it while transhumanists/Etropians
see such an embrace as anathema -- even if we admit to having no
means of immortality as yet.  Still, perhaps secular humanists take this
position merely for tactical reasons.  Also, it might be the case that
only the leaders of the movement take this position, while the rank and
file don't care.  And it could be that secular humanists on the whole
have no thought the matter over and would likely be swayed our way
if we make the effort.

In final analysis, we need to ask not only if it is possible to persuade
them but if it is worth it.

Information is measured in number of bits (or more commonly kilobytes or
megabytes). This measure does not tell you much about meaning of the
information. If I would convert this mail to a gif picture or an mpeg
slideshow it would take more information to hold it, and perhaps give a
heavier hype measure (or spam measure), but it wouldn't contain more
meaning.

The concept of Exformation is on the other hand more meaningful. When you
buy milk, butter and eggs, you get a receipt containing a list of these
items and a total. The list contains more information that the total, but
you are more interested in the total, because that is what you will pay to
the cashier. The total contains more Exformation.

The total is computed using the addition algorithm, and in fact the purpose
of any algorithm (the useful ones at least) is to produce exformation, not
information. Information is not good in itself, the less you can do with,
the better (ok, I know there are some info-junkies out there :-).

The interesting question is, how is exformation measured? I claim that
exformation is measured as money. It fits nicesly in the
production-consumption theory. You produce exformation, sell it to someone,
who consumes the information. Although I'm just an economist wannabe, I
would like to go as far as to say that exformation *is* money. You don't
know how valuable something is/was until you actually sell it. But as
exformation is laos closely related to algorithmic complexity, exformation
may be measured as time. So money is time. The time someone has to spend
instead of spending money.

The definition of Extropy (in The Extropians Principles) says it is a
measure of Information (among other things), but more accurately this should
be Exformation. So if Exformation is one measure of Extropy, perhaps Bill
Gates really is the greates Extropian among us.

The USSR malfunctioned for many reasons, but probably most of
all its redicilous communist ideology. This doesn't mean that 
centralism automatically lead to poverty. Many European countries
make this point just fine. Flawed? Certainly. Impoverished? Hardly.
Centralism is what you make it, and it does not necessarily
exclude the free market (after all, there's plenty of free market
in centralised Europe and the US, for example), but it means
that some crucial things just aren't left to chance (free market 
forces). In itself, I think that is a sound idea. Since no-one
has ever set up a centralized system based on _transhumanistic_
ideas we simply cannot say that it won't work yet, comparing
centralized transhumanism to centralized communism is silly;
the ideologies coundn't differ more.

By the way, before I'll get tangled up in the devil's advocate stuff again,
I'd like to state that I don't _oppose_ anarcho-capitalism in itself. It's
a great idea, but I just don't think it will ever work properly in this world
with these people. As I stated earlier, anarcho-capitalism requires
active participation by rational, independent individuals. The very fact
that history (including the present) is a long list of oppression and
ignorance makes me seriously wonder whether humanity is ready
for this experiment, whether it just won't lead to even worse situations
than we know today.

I think my system with all its surveillance etc. is cynical enough to take on
the real world. Anarcho-capitalism on the other hand is IMO based on the
false premise that people will just turn en masse to libertarianism once
they get the chance (or have been "educated"). Well, it ain't gonna happen.
Just like you can tell people all about cryonics and how rational et al it is,
explain every stupid detail x times and still get nowhere, you can hammer
all the libertarian wisdom you want into the masses and they'll still follow
the first guy with some smooth red/reli/whatever talk. The proof is on the
table. Dispite (undoubtedly) heroic efforts, anything only vaguely resembling
a libertarian party is pitifully small in any country of significance.

First of all, if you think my system is based on "love" please read again. It's
based on a rather cynical idea about human nature really. Furthermore, all
the people you mentioned (and then some) will be out of a job in a couple
of decades bedause machines can do it a lot better & cheaper, and unless
you either want to shoot them or let them become a very desperate and dangerous
layer of society, you will need some kind of welfare to support them. (the
free food etc. handouts I mentioned in another thread come into play here).
Release these people into anarcho-capitalism and they'll likely become
the loyal supporters of the first would-be dictator that happens to come
along with promises of a better life.

The internet owes its existence to the computernetworks of centralized states,
mainly the US. It can also "work" because it's very limited, all bits 'n'bites and 
no physical contact. Also, it is still a playground of the more advanced
layres of society; most people are *not* connected. But most of all, the net
is something you can turn off and ignore with the touch of a button if you don't
like it. The real world on the other hand is somewhat harder to switch off...

Well, fortunately there is diversity and thus plenty of people who would do it.
I can well imagine that many "secret" government jobs are a lot worse,
add what to think about cops and soldiers etc, risking their butt for a fraction
of the pay and privileges.

A good thing we have electronic surveillance then, and people that are (finacially)

That depends...With the aid of brainscans and the like we'll be able to
reduce the vagueness in psychology. The rest must depend on good old
common sense (and yes, there *is* something like "common sense").

> 2) Who profiles the psychological profiler?

Checks and balances, so several teams of profilers who's salary depends
on the results of their work (actually, this is something that would apply to *all*
government employees -- pretty radical, eh). do the testing. So a good profiler 
gets wealthy, while a bad one sees a reduction in payment followed by "the boot" if
the bad results continue. Judges, cops, clerks etc. -- the same. Just like in a
normal company. This would take on bureaucratic inefficiency at its root.

They can be as trivial as placing the right ad at the right time. Ads say
nothing about the quality of the product, they are the commercial 
equivalent of smooth talking politicians. A smooth ad campaign can
make people buy crap and make them ignore the good stuff, who's 
inventor didn't happen to have an extra $10,000,000 to advertize it all 
over the place. Also, sometimes good products are suppressed 
because they threaten the position of some big powerful company
that happens to operate in the same niche. Only a powerful state
can put these things right, thus achieving a higher level of progress
and product quality for the consumer to enjoy. Sometimes market
forces just aren't enough, and a healthy dose of ideology is required.

Most consumers aren't as critical or emancipated as you are, they'll buy crap
and vote crap, all the same to them. That's why there's so much crap around.

City states were absorbed by nation states, so you're saying that we're about
to have a gobal state. That's indeed a considerable possibility, which would make
the net a lot more controllable, btw.

Sounds o.k, but many other seemingly good predictions about the demise of
the state have turned out to be duds so I'll don't hold my breath just yet.

I must say it sounds convincing, but somehow I don't think that it will be
this simple. People are more obedient and scared of anarchy than you
think, and the state will prey on their fears to curb the flow of untaxable
transactions. After all, with full control over the real world (where you live
and can get hurt etc.) and with the same problem facing all governments
they'll have the motivation and probably also the means to turn the tide
of coming anarchy. In the worst case scenario violence and another
cold war and/or increased terrorist activity (all set up of course) may be
used to justify all sorts of draconanian measures, and the sheeple _will_
take it once more. If they tolerate such crap as the "war on drugs", then
why not this too? Sanctimoniousness and fear can so easily be exploited...
If this fails, there may be temporary _violent_ anarchy indeed -- followed 
by good old totaltarianism. I can assure you that to stay in power the
governments of the worlds will sacrifice almost any number of lives and
new technologies, including the net. If nothing else works they'll simply
hit it so hard that it will be reduced to what it once was: a toy for a small
number of techno buffs. Brute force gets you a long way.

Any employee has interest in the prospering of his company. Whether that's
the state, PPA, or some other business isn't really relevant. Like I said before,
government workers (like police etc.) would be paid according to the amount
and quality of their work, and be fired when found inadequate, just like in any
market-oriented company. This and maximal automatization should elliminate
most of the problems associated with bureaucrats.

It also quite appropriately means "social and political disorder". The main point is
however that a power structure where the relation between payment and service
is vague (like it is with government and taxes) seems to be the most "natural" one
for humans. Time and again we have seen social experiments fail, even if the
basic principles may have seemed sound. I'm quite sure your PPAs would either
be a minority from the start (the rest being totalitarian clans, citystates and
full- blown countries) or that many, possibly all, would quickly degenerate into a
flock of hardworking, meek/scared sheep ruled by an elite of enforcers. Logical,
because many people are insecure, uneducated and vulnerable to any slick
talker or bully with a gun. In *theory* you might move from a region if you don't
like the resident PPA, but in reality it may proof too difficult/dangerous. I think
the advocates of anarcho-capitalism badly overestimate the rationality and 
emancipation and (practical means like income) of the average man. And I
assure you, there are a *lot* of average and sub-average men out there. I can
hear the new Hitler smack his lips already...

Yes, the strongest PPA wins. Well, this reminds me that even without full-flung
turf wars there can be hostile takeovers and the like, one PPA directly
(and secretly) damaging the reputation (sabotage) of another, causing some people
to leave it etc, and then buying its owners out and absorbing it (with enough of
its structure and customer base in tact to make a profit) or simply disbanding it.
Of course financial problems could also arise due to other causes which would
spare the "hostile" PPA a lot of trouble. Imagine Microsoft as a PPA for ex, 
providing mediocre yet somehow "appealing" services and taking out competition
left and right by any means necessary. Such a PPA would become more like
a nation state with every takeover or alliance it achieved. Indeed, this is the way
that today's great nation states were formed...slowly, by force, by cunning and

*If* you're indeed in a position to do so. I can well image that many folks would
have debts with their PPA, just like with the mob/state etc.No way that you
will leave in one piece, and even if so what other PPA would dare/want to 
accept you in this state...unless you make even more debts and become 
in fact a slave.

Since mine allows both (under certain circumstances) I can imagine would-be
criminals being better behaved on my turf, and a generally more polite treatment
of my customers.

It *does* make sense: normally, there's one trial and one verdict. To avoid 
endless appeals on death row and the trouble they cause to all parties
involved, executions must follow within a relatively short period after the verdict.
Within this period you have the right to appeal for a retrial, but only if there
is new evidence. There is no limit to presenting new evidence in order to avoid 
rediculous situations where everyone knows that the defendant is innocent, but
the crucial evidence has only been found after the 3rd retrial so he has to
die anyway. The 3x limit only applies to the prosecution (in cases where
the verdict was "not guilty"), in order to avoid a situation where someone
has to face trial every couple of months for the same crime.

I don't know if this is what yo mean, but yes, I belief there are such things as 
objective facts and well-argued cases. Without this assumption, there can 
simply be no justice system.

All in all, the moral of the whole story is: PPAs and other anarcho-capitalist
goodies may be great in *theory*, but are in fact ivory tower productions that
don't take human nature into account and will thus fail as have many before
them. Most people are no libertarians, and have not the slightest intention
of becoming libertarians. Hell, many so-called "libertarians" are probably
wolves in sheep's clothing (or sheep in wolf's clothing) when it comes down
to it. If people want the state, well let them have it! You can always move
to a private island if you're really serious about your freedom, and later even
to outer space...Back on earth, I think a centralized and maybe somewhat
totalitarian system based on values of maximal freedom (allow anything as 
long as no-one gets hurt without consent) is the best way to go. Utopic?
Sure. But not any more than anarcho capitalism. The former may fail because
of corruption of the leadership, while the latter fails because the common
man just ain't no libertarian (just like he ain't no communist either -- that's
why *that* idea failed).  

I'll eat my cap if I'm wrong on this one.

I've never heard of a gang without a leader.  I'm not sure it's
possible, even consensus among the gang members would mean giving up a
degree of power.  If an organisation could be formed within this
situation it is likely to be short-lived and highly unstable.

The original idea of anarchy is to give all individuals the ability to
pursue their own freedom.  A freedom dictated only by other like
individuals (the reason why "traditional" anarchists are against large
corporations and establishments.)  Once you start using restriction
and consensus to achieve this goal you loose the original intent.  The
truth is, although we can talk about how anarchy might occur (and try
to encourage those elements involved), forcing it to do so is a
complete contradiction to its very nature.

But we are in agreement on one fact - all individuals must fill the
power vacuum.  The only way this can occur is through more powerful
and ubiquitous technologies of 'control.'  The definition of 'control'
has becoming ubiquitous communication (broadcast.)  The original
ideology of the Internet was to give all users the power to create,
distribute, and use information in an attempt to decentralise the
power of the media.  Without a doubt continuing this trend would be
advantageous to all individuals (especially me.)  And don't be fooled
by the consumer-capitalist front-end that's been tacked on to the
Internet recently, it's just there to fund it's own demise.

Without private property *all* you get is large-scale co-operation.

Gangs tend to be unstable in the sense that the leadership shifts, 
and relative power between gangs changes.

However, a member of a gang, even if not a leader, shares in power 
and privilege as compared to people who are not gang members, to the 
extent that the gang is able to do as it wills without interference 
from some more-powerful authority.

Without gangs, the ninth- and tenth-strongest people in a small area 
are unlikely to have very much power.  If they band together in a 
gang, they will jointly probably be stronger than the fifth-strongest 
person.  If they can get that fifth-strongest person to join their 
gang, they will probably be stronger than the strongest person.  So 
even though the ninth- and tenth-strongest persons have to share the 
power the gang wins, they have far more power than they would have 
without the gang.  Naturally, the strongest person doesn't like this, 
so he's forming a gang too.  Then you get a situation where personal 
strength may be important, but ability to make good decisions for the 
gang and to inspire confidence, enthusiasm, and loyalty is *more* 
important.  If the tenth-strongest person can get half of all the 
weaker wanna-be-leaders to back him, and the nine stronger people 
divide the other half evenly among themselves, then the 
tenth-strongest person has the power to choose the king -- or be king 
himself.

A gang, to the extent that it tries to control the actions of 
non-members (or extract wealth from them, or make them join) without 
their consent, is a government.

Without private property, why do people cooperate?

The purpose of work is gain the resources to survive and do what you 
*really* want to do.  For most people, each of those takes some 
amount of property they have personal sole control over -- private 
property, or property shared among a *small* group according to a 
known schedule.  A writer cannot function without writing equipment 
and supplies (paper, pens, pencils, computer, typewriter, whatever) 
that is reliably available to him.  A dancer cannot function without 
a practice space, preferably one built to a dancer's specifications 
(dancers tend to be very very fussy about floors), reliably 
available, probably for several hours a day.  A dedicated couch 
potato needs a couch.  An  inventor needs space and tools to tinker 
with her inventions, with confidence that inventions-in-progress 
too big to move easily (along with the tools and raw materials) can 
be left there and will be unchanged when she returns.

But the inventor's tools and space, the dancer's floor, the writer's 
pencils, are all "means of production" and under even the less 
complete versions of socialist "elimination of private property" 
would be shared equally among all people.  The dancer has no right to 
say that for this period each day the dance studio he built is *not* 
available as a place for small children to play.  The inventor has no 
right to bar others from taking apart his half-finished invention.  
The writer has no basis for protest when a bored neighbor makes paper 
airplanes of his manuscript and flies them into the lake.  The couch 
potato cannot expel the neighbor's cat from his couch.

Without the ability to control property, the writer cannot write; the 
dancer cannot dance; the inventor cannot invent; the couch potato 
cannot loaf.

Whither then anarchy?  Whither then freedom?  Whither then 
productivity?

That's the problem.  

A perfect social or political system, in all systems I have examined, 
requires perfect people in some quantity -- dictatorship being the 
best in this regard because it requires the fewest perfect people, 
and anarchy among the worst because it requires that the overwhelming 
majority -- possibly everyone -- be perfect.  In this part of the 
world, perfect people are a rather scarce item, and what I read in 
the newspapers doesn't tell me that this is a strictly local 
shortage.

Imperfect anarchy is unstable, and seems likely to quickly collapse 
into tribal warlordism, and then later into dictatorship or 
hereditary monarchy.

People seem so convinced that anarcho-capitalism will collapse into nation
states.    There's no checks on the powers of PPAs, except other PPAs.
What's to stop them?

And I ask you again, what's to stop the US military from doing EXACTLY THE
SAME THING?

den Otter, your state has a military, yes?  What's going to stop it from
squishing your exquisite statecraft, cutting out the electronic
surveillance (at least on themselves) and surpressing the masses?

Widespread unemployment takes place because wages don't adjust down, even
when the demand for labor falls.  Minimum wage laws are responsible in
part; labor regulations also play a major role.  Moreover, keep in mind
that these very same improvements in technology will also make the goods
themselves much cheaper, allowing people to accept lower paying jobs and
still get food on the table.

Uhm... how do you measure the quality of a psychological profiler?  And
more importantly, why wouldn't the politicians/military add your
surveilance-bureaucracy-reducing regulations to the round circular file and
oppress the people as they see fit?  How is this more secure than
anarcho-capitalism?

I challenge you to provide even one example of such "market failures" which

Maybe, if they like it like that ...

... but just in case, there are OTHER PPAs to choose from (with their own
slick talkers) who will offer emancipation from the bullies.  Why wouldn't
people choose that if they could?  Even the advocates of freedom have slick
talkers.

>In *theory* you might move from a region if you don't

You misunderstand how PPAs would work.  PPAs wouldn't have their own
regions exclusively; their regions would overlap with many other available
PPAs.  You wouldn't even have to leave your house to switch PPAs, just pick
up a telephone and make a deal.  Sure, perhaps your current PPA could try
to stop you... but so could the US military.  So could the military in your
own imagined government.  What's stopping them?  How is this more secure
than a competitive system?

>Imagine Microsoft as a PPA for ex,

So what?  The US military has the means and the incentives to do exactly
that; they wouldn't even have to be slow about it, because there is no
competing military in the US to stop them.  So why is this so much more
secure than anarcho-capitalism?

And how is this different from your system?  If I've got a debt with the US
military and it decides not to let me out of the country alive, what's
stopping it from doing exactly the same thing?

I'd say the idea that you could check the power of the military simply by
designing a new system of laws is the ivory tower production.

If the people running some of the PPAs are stupid or of low quality, those
of high quality will be at a competitive advantage to them, and thus will
more likely thrive over the stupid PPAs.

There is, of course, little hope for anyone if EVERYONE is stupid.  But the
advantage of the market is that it rewards ingenuity, intelligence and
creativity, and thus is more likely to maximize extropy than, say, a
dictator, who may or may not be intelligent at all, and for whom there is
no mechanism for ensuring competence.

Yes, exactly! I couldn't agree more. From a purely rational point of view
a "dictatorship" or oligargy based on enlightened principles (as discussed
earlier) would be the most preferable form of government. There is a
reasonable possibility to pick the right people to rule a country (there
have been benevolent emperors in the past, I belief for ex. the Romans had
a few), it's usually the ones who really _don't want the job_. The possibility
that all or at least the majority of "the people" is rational and benevolent
(as needed for good democracy or anarchy) on the other hand is about 0.0...

The first four or five Roman emperors were childless.  They each took 
the same approach to choosing a successor, which was:

 (1) appoint apparently-good people to be provincial governors
 (2) any who proved incompetent, fire and give somebody else a chance
 (3) after a while, bring home the best provincial governor and adopt 
him.

The first Emperor was apparently a good one, along with all who were 
chosen by this method.

Eventually they got an Emperor who had kids.  His eldest son was his 
successor and was more than a bit of a jerk.  This set the tradition: 
almost every Emperor who inherited the throne from his biological 
father was worse than his predecessor; almost every Emperor who did 
*not* was *better* than his predecessor; almost every chosen-Emperor 
who chosen by a chosen-Emperor was pretty decent.

The catch is that the dictator, by definition, has the right to 
either change the rules of succession,  or choose 
anyone he likes; and, if he's at all a decent father, will want to 
provide well for his kids.  This means...

The same thing(s) that have stopped them in the past, like the fact that most
soldiers will refuse to kill their own people, including their family and friends
etc.

Yes, my system would have a military, but this would not be the only armed
force in the empire. There would have to be several, to provide the necessary
balance. Advanced automation (within 10 years or so all tanks, planes etc.
will be automated, elliminating large portions of the less reliable human force)
adds to the security and control by the leaders (and the launching of heavy 
stuff like nukes could still require co-operation of several offices or people to 
prevent accidents). Messing with the robots has little use, 'cause they come
in badges with different programming and coding, so you can never reprogram
them all at once.

We have minimum wage because if you would go much lower people would be
starving. At a certain point, not more than a couple of decades away, computers
and robots will be better and cheaper at just about *any* low-wage human job.
Only an idiot would still hire people then.

Indeed, automation can make prizes drop, but if stuff gets so cheap you can
sell it for virtually nothing, then why not give it away for free all the same?
Besides,  a lot of people would otherwise simply have to beg to get even
those couple of bucks in a highly automated world, because virtually no-one
would want unreliable and inefficient people working for them if they can get
a cheap, trustworthy and super-efficient robot.

You mean caused by corruption and such, the backing of malafide companies
in return for bribes? This problem would be greatly reduced by strict surveillance.
Also, putting techophiles in office (at least at positions where it counts) should
prevent the "disappearance" (into the vaults of some company or the gov itself)
of breaktrough inventions.

Sure, but if you like it, it probably wasn't crap in the first place. I meant
*real* crap, like food so full of conservatives that you'll develop cancer
over time, or a television set with lousy sound etc.

I don't think an initially smooth transition gaurantees anything. At a
certain point a lot of governments and dictators and who knows
what else will see the power they had for so long slip through their
fingers. I'll be damned if not at least some of them would opt for
very desperate measures to turn the tide...

Initially, maybe. But enforcement groups of any kind are traditionally very
territorial (like gangs, who have their own city blocks) and I see no reason
why PPAs would be any different. If you want to offer solid security to
your customers, than you must be in firm control of the place they live
in.

The US military don't give a damn about such stuff. And if you want to leave
the US, that's *fine*. It's getting in that's the problem (well, theoretically
then).
Like I said, your military has a pretty good track record when it comes to
(attempted) coups.

Greater size usually means greater stability. To give an example, streetgangs 
fight all the time, while big governments only fight sporadically, and since the
advent of nukes the major ones even don't fight at all. Also, their conscience
(that of the regular soldier) is stopping them from turning on their own people.
In my system you could add to that mutual surveillance (the people spy back,
and, for what it's worth, they have guns). In a more advanced stage of automation
the key to avoid tirrany is spreading control over the enforcer robots over
rivalizing
institutions (that are unlike PPs part of the same system, more like different
immune
systems in one body than seperate bodies).

Because this system has proven itself, and anarcho-capitalism has (to my
knowledge) yet to give a working example. If it is so great or natural, then
why don't we see it all over?

The law, backed by lots of FBI, CIA, police etc guys who don't agree (they 
don't have to like you but they sure want to screw those military guys).
Besides, you don't usually get in debt with the military, but with some
other government wing or a private organization or person. In the worst
case, you'll go to jail. Now try the same stunt with the mafia-PPA and
you'll wish you were in jail...In your system we'd see a lot more mob-style
justice, and a lot less jail cells I suspect.

Apparently the system is doing fine even without hew laws. I sure don't see
any coup d'etats in the USA...And yes, a system of checks and balances
could reduce any such risk even further (in fact, that's pretty much what
you have with all your special branches, secret services, police forces etc.)
It seems to work OK.

...that we need immortal emperors without a childwish(*)? Or a system
where the emperor may change all laws except certain fundamental
ones (a sort of constitutional monarchy?) including the the law that
forbids emperors from having children. Who checks? A supreme court
maybe, or some other institution of special guardians with security
forces to back them up. Preferably three or more of such institutions to
provide a balance. Or the emperor would have to have his nads removed
before being allowed into office :-)

Oh yes, now I happen to think of it: any system would only have to last
about a hundred years or so, 'cause by then things will be changed 
beyond recognition anyway, for better or for worse. So I guess the emperor
system could work quite well since you'll need only 3 or so, maybe even
less with life extension and all.


(*)Or the emperor would have to have his nads removed before being allowed

The core values of Extropian thinking, while radical compared to
mainstream modes of thought, are hardly incomprehensible.  With out
explicit references to uploading or iniversal assembers, I think the
Extropian principles are rooted in very accessible ideas.  Even so your
teacher or anyone else scoffs the first time encounter Extropian ideals.

Or a person who couldn't afford their own robot.  New localized economies
can and do form for this very reason.

It's not that cheap yet; and much of the important stuff never will be
until we perfect immortality.

This, of course, imagines that the marginal cost of captial will plummet
and the marginal revenue product of capital will skyrocket to such a degree
that the demand for labor will bottom out.  Fortunately for us, a demand
shock like this is unlikely in the near future.  Thankfully (or
frustratingly, depending on your point of view), whenever we make some
small advancement in productivity or technology, people want more and more
from it, which means more and more people have to be employed (yes,
employed; even if it's only to program the robots).

So long as people keep wanting more and more stuff, more and more people
will be needed in the economy.

>By the number of screw-ups he makes (how many people that were deemed
>"OK" by him turned out to be inadequate ?)

Gee, in that case, in order to cover my butt, I'd better just say that
EVERYBODY I profile is inadequate.  "I've never been wrong about this sort
of thing!  Who, him?  He was cured in asylum."

>Anyone who wants can spy back, and expose them.

Expose, schmexpose.  I'm talking about a full scale publicly known military
coup here.  What are you going to do, TELL everybody that the military is
taking over?  Presumably, if the military is worth a damn, everyone will
already know.

>It depends on the "good will" of fewer people. 

The danger of depending on the good will of fewer people means that it also
requires fewer people to screw it up royally.  If there are a few bad
apples in a-c, they can be checked.  If those few bad apples are the
dictators of a government, they can't.

While bribery has been part of the problem, another part of the problem was
companies who would publicly lobby for tax breaks, tarrifs, and other
handouts from the government, and would get them, because either the public
or Congress actually believed that they would be a good for the economy.
There's little you can do about this outside of switching to a system like
a-c.  The leaders can always be fooled, even under surveillance.

The same reason why the military hasn't taken over the country.

Who says?  What if you're in peaceful negotiation with a dozen other PPAs,
covering the same area?  None of whom want to attack each other, because
they'd just lose money in the process...

You're right, it doesn't care about that.  And you're right, they do have
an excellent track record.  So why would the PPAs care more than the US
military, who has so much more to gain by doing so?  Why is a PPA more
likely to turn tyrannical than the US Military?

Street gangs tend to be impoverished.  They also aren't even sort of
participating in a PPA system.  This comparison isn't valid.

>Also, their conscience
>(that of the regular soldier) is stopping them from turning on their own
people.

So why wouldn't the conscience of a PPA stop THEM from turning tyrannical
on their own people?

>In my system you could add to that mutual surveillance (the people spy back,
>and, for what it's worth, they have guns).

I see no reason why a PPA couldn't, if it wanted to, start up a company
where all of its employees are under 24-hour surveillance, in order to
better guarantee security.  And for what it's worth, people under a PPA
could have guns, too.

I never said it was natural, I just said it was better.  And before the US,
democracy wasn't seen all over, either.  And arguably, the current system
under which the military doesn't turn tyrannical (despite the fact that it
could, quite easily,) is evidence that PPAs could be made to do the same
thing; even better, because people would be able to choose between
overlapping militaries in case one went bad.

>The law, backed by lots of FBI, CIA, police etc guys who don't agree (they

Isn't this competing protection agencies, in this case?  If so, why
couldn't they do the same thing privately?

There's no more reason why this should happen under A-C (less, in fact)
than it should happen right now.  The military could do this, but it
doesn't.  Why couldn't PPAs be bound by a similar ethical code?

It works OK because lots of people, from the top down, are opposed to
turning tyrannical on their own people.  Why wouldn't the same hold true
for a PPA?

Fortunately, I want the same thing.

You think everybody is stupid and evil except for the leaders of your 
centralized government. Yes I know, checks and balances, but they're only as 
good as the people who implement them. With such massive surveillance in 
place and the assumption that officials can quickly and easily determine the 
truth, your system has no room for error, if there is the slightest mistake
in the astronomically complex checks and balances required your system will 
quickly turn into hell. My system is more fault tolerant, if one PPA goes bad 
there are plenty more fish in the sea.

Most of the hardware is in nations, it has to be, except for Antarctica every  
square inch of the Earth's surface is in some centralized state, but no state  
owns the Internet, pays for it, operates it, or, despite their best efforts,  
makes rules about it.

Physical contact is a sensation that tells us about the outside world, 
sensation can be simulated with enough information, information is just 
bits 'n'bites.

When the world's economy becomes deeply intertwined with the net turning it

decided it didn't like it  anymore.

On a few occasions big powerful companies have tried that and it has caused 
great misery, for the company. IBM had one of the best research and 
development labs in the world, they fully understood the power of a
microprocessor but didn't want to make a cheap computer based on one because 
it would hurt their mainframe business and they figured if they didn't do it 
nobody would. They were wrong. When Apple started to grow at a phenomenal 
rate they panicked and knew they had to something fast but were unprepared 
with their own technology so they had to start selling an INTEL- Microsoft 
machine that was given the misleading name the IBM PC, the most colossal 
business blunder in history. IBM's fate was sealed when a few years later 
when they refused to make a machine more powerful than some of their 
mainframes based of Intel's new 32 bit chip the 386. Compaq didn't hesitate 
to do so and the rest is history. 

A more recent example is Motorola, a few years ago they owned the analog 
cellular phone market, when digital phones became available they saw no  
reason to change and figured if they didn't do it nobody would. They were 
wrong and now the company is in trouble.

One slight modification on that and it would indeed be a perfect system.

        >just like in any market-oriented company. 


Every politician elected in at least the last 50 years has said almost the   
exact same thing in his campaign speeches, but it has not happened, it has  
never come close and it never will.   
                   

        >Imagine Microsoft as a PPA for ex, providing mediocre yet somehow

I can't imagine it. Why is this PPA so powerful? It's doing some very  
expensive things so it's easy to see why service is only mediocre, but why do  
its customers stick with it and keep pumping it with more money than any  
other PPA?

I know. The world I describe won't happen because politicians pass laws or 
because somebody with a golden tongue convinces the average man it would be a 
good idea. It will happen because the present nation states will not be able 
to continue and something will be needed to replace it. This will be a 
dangerous transition because the PPA system is not the only thing that could 
take its place, for that reason I hope things don't happen too quickly.  
I don't know how fast the bottom will fall out, all nations might collapse  
as fast as the USSR did. I hope not.

I'm not counting on the average man being one bit more libertarian than he is 
right now, I am counting on a system that would make non libertarian laws 
harder to enforce. I don't like you reading dirty books so I vote for a 
prudish politician who says he will stop you, why not, it's no skin off my 
nose. The really beauty part is that you still must pay your taxes so you
end up paying  for your own harassment. In the world of Anarchy I still don't 
like you reading dirty books  but now if I want to stop you I must write a 
check to the book police, and a  big one because you can write checks too. 
Lots of people want to tell you how to live your life but they don't want to 
pay for the privilege, in fact  most think their advice is so wonderful you 
should pay them. I imagine lots of people will be whining about how ungodly 
things have become and be nostalgic for the good old days of censorship, 
drug laws, gambling laws, sex laws, suicide laws, slander laws and Janet Reno.

I'm still not convinced this is "everybody wanting the power."  I
originally said this is "how" a stable anarchy could exist, the
likelihood of it doing so is highly remote.  And the events leading up
to these transitions are unlikely.

Besides gangs, what you talk of can be applied to voters.  If you
can't be in the big chair, you want someone similar to be there instead.

This may seem strange, but as we approach better forms of government
the likelihood of anarchy increases.  The better a government is the
more political diversity (as people concentrate on smaller and smaller
problems that create a greater number of divides in opinion.)  The
more political diversity the less likely gangs and organisations will
appear.  Add to this a degree of paranoia, and you could solve the
problems of organisation and have the system collapse into stable
anarchy.

They have no choice but to share resources with everyone who wants
them.  It may not be formal co-operation, but it is co-operation.

It's economic Darwinism, but that doesn't make it the only way of
doing things.  This is after all, the extropian list where we talk
about doing things differently.

I think you've jumped ahead of yourself here.

Private Property: The government enforces the individuals right to own
property.

No Private Property: The government does not enforce the individuals
right to own property.

Anti-Private Property: The government enforces the properties right
not to be owned.

With no private property you can protect your right to anything you
wish.  As I said anarchy is about the illusion of freedom, you're
never going to be truly free someone somewhere is always going to be
after your dance floor.

Your reasoning is sound but doesn't take subjectivity into account. 
'Perfection' is probably the most subjective term you can think of.

In my opinion, a governments role is to make life cosy for it's people
so they can get on with the important stuff (like nanotechnology and
space travel) without worrying where their next meals coming from. 
Unfortunately, about 80% of what a modern government does is to keep
itself in power (the latest war, the latest drug scare, etc.)  The
concept of such a government is sound transhumanism.

This email has allowed me to build a coherent (but complex) political
system:

The "anarcho-centralist" wants everyone to serve his or her needs but
also recognises everyone else's want to do the same.

-- Prometheus Award finalists!!

Libertarian Futurist Society

For immediate release: March 31, 1998

LFS chooses finalists for Prometheus Award, Hall of Fame

Celebrating the 20th anniversary of the Prometheus Awards, the Libertarian
Futurist Society has chosen five novels as 1998 finalists:
* "The Fleet of Stars," by Poul Anderson (TOR Books)
* "Finity's End" by C.J. Cherryh (Warner Books)
* "Nanotime" by Bart Kosko (Avon Books)
* "The Stone Canal," by Ken MacLeod (Orbit Books, Little Brown, England)
* "Bretta Martyn," by L. Neil Smith (TOR Books)

The LFS also has chosen five classic novels as finalists for the Prometheus
Hall of Fame:

* "Orion Shall Rise," by Poul Anderson (1983)
* "Time Enough for Love" by Robert Heinlein (1973)
* "The Mirror Maze" by James Hogan (1989)
* "Planet for Texans" ("Lone Star Planet") by H. Beam Piper, cowritten with
John McGuire (1958)
* "WASP" by Eric Frank Russell (1957)

Winners, who receive a gold coin and plaque, will be announced in the
Libertarian Futurist Society's annual awards ceremony at the 1998 World
Science Fiction Convention in early August in Baltimore.

This marks the 20th anniversary of the Prometheus Award, which was founded in
1979 when a group led by L. Neil Smith presented the first award to F. Paul
Wilson for "Wheels Within Wheels." In 1982, the Libertarian Futurist Society
was founded by Michael Grossberg to continue the Prometheus Awards, so this is
the 18th awards presentation.  Previous winners include Vernor Vinge, James P.
Hogan, Brad Linaweaver, Victor Koman, F. Paul Wilson, Poul Anderson, and Smith
(who since 1981 has not been associated with the awards judging.)

Fourteen novels were nominated by LFS members this past year for the
Prometheus Awards; and 21 novels were nominated for the Hall of Fame. Other
Prometheus Award nominees: "In The Shadow of Omen," by Steven Burgauer (Zero-G
Press); "Lightpaths," by Howard Hendrix (Ace Science Fiction); "Atlantis," by
Robert Klassen (White Knight Publishing, Internet only),; "Freedom's Choice"
by Anne McCaffrey (Ace/Putnam); "A Mind for Trade" by Andre Norton and
Sherwood Smith (TOR);  "Exiles: The Mageborn Traitor by Melanie Rawn (DAW
Books); "The Merro Tree," by Katie Waitman (Del Rey Discovery); "City on
Fire," by Walter Jon Williams (Harper Prism); and "Deep as the Marrow," by F.
Paul Wilson (TOR).

Both LFS awards honor outstanding science fiction/fantasy that explore the
possibilities of a free future, champion human rights (including personal and
economic liberty), dramatize the perennial conflict between individuals and
coercive governments, or critique the tragic consequences of abuse of power--
especially by the  State. Past awardwinners range from Robert Heinlein and Ayn
Rand to Ray Bradbury and Ursula LeGuin.

For the first time last fall, the Society established two annual judging
committees to choose finalists for the Prometheus Award and Hall of Fame. LFS
Director Victoria Varga chaired the Hall of Fame committee, whose members
included Tod Casasent, Charles Curley, John Fast, Chris Hibbert, Carol B. Low,
Lynn Maners, William Stoddard, Fran Van Cleave.  LFS founder /Life member
Michael Grossberg chaired the Prometheus Awards committee. Members: Fast,
Steve Gaalema, Hibbert, Victor Koman, Tom Lauerman, Maners, Adam Starchild,
and Claire Wolfe.  The 1999 Prometheus  committee, for novels published in
1998, will be appointed in July. As always, all LFS Advisory members will read
the finalists and choose the Prometheus Award winner. and all Basic and
Advisory members will read the Hall finalists and vote for the Hall of Fame
winner.

Since 1982, the Prometheus Award has been  presented each year at the World
Science Fiction Convention, making it one of the most enduring awards after

Who would accept a wage that doesn't pay for the food to supply enough
energy to go to work??

You can't legislate a living wage.  You can only forbid people to accept
a wage that you think is too low.  How on earth does that benefit them? 
How is it better to have NO wages than to be working for less than the
average politician would accept?

Indeed, why not?  The necessities of life may well be given away as
advertising.  But let's not tear down a very functional system (trade)
on the chance that such might happen, hm?

Oy vey.  If anarcho-capitalism depends on everybody's goodwill, so
what?  If that's a serious flaw then we're in deep trouble, because
DAILY LIFE IN ANY SYSTEM depends on everybody's goodwill to the same
degree.  Every single person in several counties is betting that I (and
the rest of our neighbors) won't steal a car tonight and go burn their
house down.

Where power is dispersed, no one person is much of a threat, and there
are balances to every plausible threat.  Where power is concentrated,
the opposite is true.

Or by taking power away from the politicians; private parties, spending
their own money, have no reason to take bribes.

There are civil remedies for such things.  Political control over the
market cannot prevent them; it can only ensure that they happen more
often.

Indeed, the transition is a delicate period.  Best to disarm the
politicians NOW so they won't be tempted.  ;)

But I'll take a risky transition to anarchy in preference to the nice
orderly march toward slavery that we're on now.

What if we buy off the politicians?  Tell them:  "You deserve to be
taken out and shot, but that's a lot of trouble, so instead we're going
to give you all the gold you can carry, and a one-way ticket to any
other continent."

And one could equally well say, looking through history, that sooner or
later people get richer and more free.  Every cycle has a top and a
bottom.  All we can hope for, I suppose, is to make the top come sooner
and last longer.

Around here, I often see stickers on shop windows saying "protected by
XYZ Security" - some private firm which, when it hears an alarm, sends a
couple of goons.  And it's not the same firm whose sticker is on the
shop next door.  It helps if such firms are friendly with each other,
but they obviously needn't have all the business in town.  If pizza
delivery is competitive, why not police delivery?

How silly of the Afghans not to recognize the advantages of size and

Do people lose their conscience when they work in the private sector?

A few years ago, Marines at Twentynine Palms (don't ask me why "marines"
have a base in the Mojave Desert) were given a notorious questionnaire
about their willingness to fire on Americans to enforce some chickenshit
law.  About one in three (iirc) said yes.  They're the ones who will be
chosen as "reliable" when the shit hits the fan.

A few months ago, a boy about 17 was herding goats one evening on the
Rio Grande (border with Mexico), and shot at something.  We'll never
know why he fired (rabbit? coyote?), because four Marines sneaking about
- looking for drug smugglers - assumed he was firing at them, stalked
him for twenty minutes (during which he apparently was oblivious to
them) and killed him.

politicians; that would be anarchy!

Something like it is common in "primitive" societies; indeed the
definition of "primitive society" seems to be "stateless society".

Iceland relied entirely on private enforcement for centuries, and was
generally peaceful.  (The sagas, which concentrate on violence, tell of
years going by between events in the bitterest feuds.)

> If it is so great or natural, then why don't we see it all over?

Partly because until recently you had to be very rich to own useful
weapons.  In the Middle Ages, of course, the dominant weapon of war was
the armored horseman: no peasant could hope to stand up to him.  Thus
power was centralized.

Now, every peasant can afford a weapon that would make short work of a
medieval knight, and weapons that can kill tanks and helicopters are
within the reach (fiscal if not legal) of most of us.  If the world
continues to bow down to central authorities, it's partly out of habit.

Where the central authorities are relatively benign, they will probably
last longer; where they are recognized openly as tyrants and thieves,
they will soon be gone, as already in Northern Somaliland.

Then you haven't heard about how the politicians have taken to wiping
their backsides with the Bill of Rights?  We don't need coups d'etat, we
have tyranny coming in the front door in the name of "national security"
and "protecting our children" and "preventing terrorism" and all that
baloney.

Direct democracy is a main term: there are three kinds of direct democra- 
cy:

- direct voting democracy
- direct delegation democracy
- direct consensus democracy

Once the direct voting democracy have made a decision, it havn't to force  
its operations on the minority who disapprove because the minority are  
able to leave and to split the community.

Once the direct delegation democracy have made a decision, it havn't to  
force its operations on the minority who disapprove. The decision represen- 
ted a consensus/compromise among direct delegates (no consensus = no deci- 
sion). Each delegate had forwarded only the orginaly words of a group of  
humans.

Once the direct consensus democracy have made a decision, it havn't to  
force its operations on the minority who disapprove because if there is a  
disapproving minority than there isn't a consensus among all members and  
therefore no decision.

Have you ever notices the "military" decision making procedures inside the  
industrial companies? --

Once the managment have made a decision, it have to force its operations  
on the majority of workers. Therefore capitalism in its dayly reality  
isn't much closer to "spontaneous order" than democracy.

your current PPA is only being tyrannical in the fact that it makes you

You don't have that decision.  To make it more explicit, the PPA i'm

no, your first conclusion was right, they won't be in business for long.
Which just means that they'll go PPAless, which just means they are easy
pickings.  They are worth very little by definition, since we are assuming
an open free market and their incomes are almost nonexistant.

i am not saying that he could not do it now, although i think he would
have much more trouble in getting through it, personal ownership of attack
helicopters is forbidden i think, so he would have to bribe people in the
US, buy some kind of transport method, bribe every country he goes through
with that transport, and then bribe the indian government, and i don't
think that last one is going to be an easy bribe.  i would say it would be
a much more expensive exercise.

i would say the anarcho-capitalist system is the only one where they don't
have any chance at all.  in the current system those 10000000 have a much
greater leverage on india's army than in the PPA based one.

you didn't disprove anything, you just seem to assume a huge package is
attached to the words "freedom" and "tyrannical" (which i never used in my
description of the PPA's action, BTW).  In this context, tyrannical just
means they make you pay more than you want to pay, which, if you switch
some other "more liberal" PPA which makes you pay more, it still fulfills
this definition of "tyranical".  so please, don't use words that have
everyday meanings attached to them which do not fit in this scenario.

then how does that benefit you?  you are still paying more than you wanted
to?  what was the point of the switch?  is this another assumption of the
baggage attached to the word tyrannical which you were using to describe
the current PPA?

"There's no question" and "DEFINITELY".  brilliantly supported argument.
the first one is simply false, since i questioned it in the paragraph you
were answering to, and "definitely" doesn't do much better.  so, i have to
ask, how do you know? and how are you so sure?

whoever said there would be a government around?  
BTW, i don't think this has been done countless times throughout history.
I can't come up with even ten events where 10 million people were directly
wiped out by a government.  Actually i can't come up with 5 but i think
that's more to do with my extremely limmited knowledge of anything that
did not happen in the 20th century (where my knowledge moves up to
the "very limmited" category)

general consensus?  by whom? again, your argumentative style leaves much
to be desired.  you could try using less "definitely"s and other such wide
sweeping statements and try slightly more concrete or better thought out
ideas. 
I, just one case i suppose, would not beg for strong leadership.  i really
don't know how a mostly educated and wealthy western type population would
react to this scenario, since i don't think its been tried before.  please
correct me on this, since as i said before, my history knowledge is
sketchy.

i agree, but with one big condition: evenly distributed wealth as a start
point.  There are natural advantages of mass production which i don't
think would be compensated for in a free market system, or if it did, it
would take an extremely long time, and i don't really like asymptotic
solutions.  otoh, anarcho-capitalist "societies" could also exist in an
anarcho-socialist world, and if they are more effective then they would
also thrive and multiply

again, with wealth redistribution, no problem.  without it i don't think
it's a sufficiently big step.  i admit that wealth redistribution isn't an
easy task, but again, nanotech might (hopefully) have something to say
about this.

it would definitely help, since there wouldn't be anyone powerful enough

if i remember correctly, it was i who described what i thought your PPA
would be able to do.  again, if i remember correctly, i did not use the
word tyrannical.  i did describe a PPA which would be able to control you,
by which i meant that it could make you pay, even if you did not want to
and wouldn't let you switch to another PPA (i realise now where the
tyrannical and other assumptions come from, i'm sorry for the confusion).
now, from this scenario:  PPA is getting x units per second from you as
pay.  you want to pay y where y < x.  Another PPA would be willing to be
paid y, but it would not be able to get you out of your current PPA's
control since your current PPA would be willing to spend f(x) (where f(x)
is a monotonically increasing function which refers to what a company
thinks you are worth) on protecting you while the other would only be
willing to spend f(y) toget you.  f(y) < f(x), so you are stuck where you
are.  If you are willing to spend z, where z > x, then, yes, you will be
taken out of your current PPA's control, and put under another PPA's
control which charges you z, but they have to make sure that they recoup
what they lost in getting you which has to be greater than f(x).  so,
unless your current controlling PPA is stupid and doesn't know how to
calculate the f function, then you'd end up spending more on your new one
than on your current one.

no, i don't think that the head of the australian military could, unless
it got support from the us military.  but even if he could, i think there
would be more (or at least the same) number of people who could take that
decision in an anarcho-capitalist system as in the current one.

i agree with everything until the last sentence.  why does a ppa have less
power than the army?  don't they fill exactly the same role?  consider the
colombian army hired to protect the oil pipes.  this is just one of the
more explicit forms of it, but if you consider a government to be just a
business, then the army is constantly just a ppa.

Care to tell that to all those who support the American Confederacy?  You
can only "leave and split the community" (aka secede) if the voting
majority hasn't forbidden it.

*I* don't agree with most of Congress's laws, but it's still illegal for me
to sit in my house and secede from the USG.  Try it yourself.

And if my delegate misrepresents me?  See above.

I agree completely.  Now, imagine direct consensus democracy happening on a
very small scale, even between just two people at a time, all over the
country.  Plus, since both participants agree on the "vote" beforehand,
they will almost never need to be forced to agree with themselves (except
when they change their minds after voting).  Now imagine people calling
these votes "contracts" and calling this system "the free market."

>Which parties? Political parties?

Participants.  Individuals making a deal.  All of them do so voluntarily in
a free market.

>Does you really mean that hunger is a voluntary feeling?

You may not volunteer to be hungry, but unless you can either feed yourself
or someone else volunteers to feed you, you will remain hungry.  In a free
market, you usually convince somebody to voluntarily feed you by helping
them out in exchange; you cannot force someone else to feed you, however.

>Have you ever notices the "military" decision making procedures inside the  
>industrial companies? --

So they are competetive.  Fortunately, in the case of companies, they're
competing to see who can perform the services which are worth the most to
the most people... note that each and every buyer co-operates voluntarily
when they buy goods, and that the company which performs services which are
not worth enough to enough buyers eventually goes out of business.

The military, on the other hand, competes in the arena of force.  It
requires no one's consent, and in no way competes in a way that maximizes
co-operation.  The essential differences between these organizations,
therefore, is vast, even if they are both competing.

>Once the managment have made a decision, it have to force its operations  
>on the majority of workers.

This is completely wrong.  Under capitalism, corporations can't (legally)
force their employees to do anything.  All of the employees volunteer to
work in a corporation.  All those who don't volunteer to do what the CEO
wants don't have to work there at all.  How is this force?

>Therefore capitalism in its dayly reality  
>isn't much closer to "spontaneous order" than democracy.

Only your direct consensus democracy is actually spontaneous, and this I
agree with.

Well, it's more like control of all by the many, since the majority are
usually not exempt from the rules they make (what would be the point?).
We might suppose it redundant to *bind* the majority to that for which
they voted, but they may be unwilling to do whatever it is unless *all*
are constrained to do it (because of the free rider problem, for
example).

> just as "market direction" could be (vote with your money?).

The difference here is that the market very rarely makes a *universal*
choice.

If I "vote" with my money to decree that cilantro is not food, even if
I'm in a majority there are still a minority who buy and eat cilantro,
and a minority of restaurants who use it.

And though in fact I am evidently in a tiny minority, most restaurants
will leave out the cilantro if I ask them to.

It's a very incomplete precedence.

Well, not in my present firm, no; I assume all clients are offered
essentially the same contract.  But my previous employer sets different
terms for each client (often giving them a choice), because their
circumstances vary and they want different services.

In each case, clients are free to shop around for a better deal, whether
for a lower price or for services more fitting to their needs.
Where's the center?

Well, you know, no two people are equal, and so it might be argued that
there's always an advantage on one side or another of every trade. 
Indeed some make this the foundation of their politics.

i would say nations are profit motivated, but the boundary between profit

Not by definition, but they would very probably become localised since
weaponry is localised.

It's easy to change nations if they let you, it would not be easy to
change PPAs if they didn't let you.

again, as above.

> PPA's settle differences with arbitration, Nations prefer force.  
most nations settle through negotiation, wars are rare.  yes, negotiation
involves force, but so too would arbitration (the more powerful PPA could
select an arbiter closer to its likings).  Wars only come when the sides
don't agree on their relative strength, this happens with nations as well
as with PPAs (as well as with humans and animals).

I'm sure the germans were spending more than 14% of their GDP on their
army, which, if you translate to PPA, it would make it impossible for the
jews to put as much money (>100%) (they would have to stop at much less,
since
other necessities such as food and shelter would consume some of the
money).  But there would be no need for all germans to join the same PPA,
just the part that would count (ie the bit that has 80% or so of the
wealth) which would probably account for 10 or 20% of germany.  You could
probably do it with the top 1% of germany, but i don't have hard numbers
to back this up, the other claims are probably quite a bit on the
safeside.

but you can't afford it.  A PPA would not take you if it thought you would
be more costly to keep than what you pay, and since with your pitiful
income you can't pay jack, then your PPA, if you can afford any at all,
would be extremely weak.

on the contrary, it's very relevant how much the other PPA is extorting
from you, since how much you they will spend on keeping you depends on
this figure, and how much you will have to spend to fish the guy out
depends on that figure.
why would you loose other customers?

You think they're not easy pickings now?  (Of course they're easy pickings
now, Dan, but right at least for now they generally have the support of the
government.)  Oh, so you're trusting the powerful to be benevolent to the
poor?  

Alternately, you think they wouldn't be easy pickings under anarcho-socialism?

No, the other relation that counts is with another alternative PPA.  See

Whenever someone, anyone, has a gun, there's no way to PREVENT them from
using it.  The only thing you can do is assure them that if it is used,
retribution will be swift and deadly.  This is all we can EVER do to
prevent the misuse of guns.  Getting them out of the hands of the people
and putting them in the hands of the government only makes this worse, for
reasons of which you're already aware.

Bill Gates has a big gun.  We can't stop him from using his big gun; we can
only point a big gun back at him and say "OK.  You COULD fire your big gun
at us; but if you do, we'll fire our big gun back."  Would you call this
"trusting the powerful to be wise?"  I wouldn't.  But if you would, then I
cede this point to you, and argue that in some cases, there's nothing else
you ever CAN do.

If the Indian government is bribed, they would have exactly no leverage,
and no where to turn.  If one PPA is bribed, people could go get leverage
from other PPAs.

You're right, I misunderstood what you meant by tyrannical.  I had presumed
that you had just meant that the tyrannized subjects couldn't leave;
clearly, you mean that the tyrannized subjects couldn't leave AND they were
being overtaxed.  So allow me to adjust my argument.

My taxes to the state are greater than my payment to the PPA; if their
costs were equal, then the state would indeed be at an advantage.  However,
you have to force me to pay my taxes, and I volunteer to give money to the
PPA.  Forcing me to pay costs a certain amount of money.  (I'll define this
cost, for the time being, as "the window of freedom."  :) )  If the window
of freedom is greater than the difference between the state's taxes and the
price of the PPA, then I am worth more to the PPA than I am to the state.

Clearly, the PPA benefits by increasing the window of freedom, because it
allows the PPA to charge less and still remain competitive with the state.
How can the window of freedom be increased?  Threatening war with the
state.  War, too, has a cost to both the state and PPAs; by avoiding war,
they save its cost.

A powerful PPA could potentially cost the government a lot of money in war;
 this creates a large window of freedom.  However, if alternative PPAs are
weak relative to the state, the window of freedom will be smaller.
Nonetheless, the existence of a window of freedom provides PPAs with a
competitive advantage over the state, ceteris paribus.

To be fair, war is not free for a PPA either.  How much war could we
reasonably expect a PPA to be willing to wage?  The profit maximization
rule states that a PPA should be prepared to wage war up until the point
where spending more money on war would outweigh the revenue they would gain
by doing so.  (ie that war's marginal revenue should equal its marginal cost.)

Let's bring this back to your original point.  The state, we note, will be
charging the full price of its taxes while the PPA will only be earning
that amount minus some fraction of the window of freedom.  Therefore, the
state's marginal revenue will be higher than the PPA's.  However, the
difference between the state's marginal revenue and the PPA's marginal
revenue is only a fraction of the window of freedom, while the difference
in cost is the entire window.  Thus, by setting their prices equal to the
amount currently charged in taxes minus (for example) half the window of
freedom, PPAs create an environment under which it is more profitable for
the state to relinquish its citizens than it would be for it to wage war
with the PPA.

And that is why it is profitable for a PPA to compete with a state.

(As a side note, anonymous digital cash and other forms of exchange over
the Internet make it expensive to force people to pay taxes for goods and
services, thus increasing the window of freedom.  So does having a lot of
guns in decentralized places.  So does anarchist propaganda.  Keep up the
good work!)

<sigh>  The DEFINITELY and "no question" were emphasis.  I'll back it up
with numbers.

How do I know that the military could be paid more than it is right now?
Well, let's see.  Bill Gates makes more than $500K every month.  No
military general does.  (At least, not over the table.)  I reason that they
could acquire this much, and more, using their weapons.  Do you mean to
tell me that this increase in income would not be worth the effort of
taking over the country?  Or is it simply that they refuse to do so because
they think it's immoral to do that sort of thing?  And if the latter,
wouldn't you feel a little more comfortable if you had at least SOME kind
of backup system in case the current one decided to take what it could get
from the rest of the nation?

If you recalculate in terms of the fraction of the population being

So can we quit w/ the attacks on "argumentative style?"

You know, to be perfectly honest, I don't think I would beg for strong
leadership either.

However, authoritarianism does tend to become popular when the economy is
doing poorly (but what a horrible solution!), which almost inevitably
results when governments topple; perhaps due to the immense amount of time
and energy which could have gone towards producing useful goods, but
instead went towards waging war.

Also, without private property, you lose the price mechanism; without money
to coordinate the economy, output falls even further.  The combination of
these two could easily be the one-two punch authoritarianism needs to take
over.

Maybe nanotech would cover this...  maybe not.

Not sufficiently big?  In your opinion, is it so small as to make it worse
than not stepping at all, or is it, as I suggested, just one step in the
right direction?

You're leaving off the COSTS of such a system.  I referred to these
previously, but in summary, the PPA has a cost advantage because it doesn't
have to pay money to force me to stay with the PPA, whereas the state must
force me from leaving.  I defined this difference in costs as the "window
of freedom."  By charging only a fraction of the window of freedom less
than the state, the PPA can charge less than the state, while still making
it worthwhile to rescue you if necessary.  This window becomes larger as
the PPAs become more powerful.

True, including the independent agencies who could step in to prevent this

Except that it's monopolistic and won't let you leave, as a competitive PPA
system would.

A good strategy when presenting transhumanism is to be light on the
uploading, space colonization and nanotech from the beginning; that
just makes people think it is some kind of new age (many people seem
to have the heuristic that anything optimistic but non-mainstream, not
obviously political is new age). But if you instead present our core
ideas (the human condition can be improved through rational means in a
life-affirming way) combined with some convincing evidence for this
position and that it has positive results, then people will begin to
listen. And in time even accept the more far-out ideas when they are
ready (or even better, do as my office-mate and ignore them and
concentrate on the immediately useful aspects of transhumanism; he has
pointed out that discussions about uploading might even be memetically
unhealthy for us).

Governments exist primarily because historically centralization has been
more efficient and required to defeat other invading governments. With
current weaponry and communications technologies this is no longer the
case; in fact government centralization is a weakness when the entire
US government could be wiped out by one fanatic with a van-nuke. Hence
increasing government paranoia, which serves only to increase the 
probability that the White House will move to the stratosphere.

Criminal organisations generally exist because of bad laws; remove
victimless crime laws and most of them would have no way to make money
other than direct use of force. Sadly, the generation who learnt their
lesson with prohibition were dying out by the arrival of the 'War on 
Some Drugs'.

A couple of years ago someone on this list (I think Greg Burch or Max
More?) posted an idea called MOM or MOMMs or something.  This was a
solution that addressed the fact that the average man will need some
hand-holding and guidance by a mother-type in an anarcho-capitalist
system.  So many are used to Big Brother acting as Mother...  What to
do... What PPA to choose... 

I would like to see this meme reposted by the original author.

We should also point out the obvious that Bill Gates /became/
obscenely wealthy because he didn't waste his time, talents, and
money doing stupid unproductive things like killing Indians.  He
made money by importing them to work for him. :)

But the majority are also in control of the minority who choose to
vote otherwise - in this case the majority can be seen as the centre.

The majority is in control of what food is supplied, even if you don't
buy and eat it.

The firm would be the centre, even if it is 'controlled' by the
customers.  (As I've said before, even the most totalitarian of
governments are 'controlled' by their people.)

Perhaps because of a firm's size they can offer a more individual
deal.  But I'm sure a smaller government doesn't have to generalise
quite so much as a larger government, yet they are both centralist
entities.

> Where's the center?

Again, the firm is the centre.  Just because it has not been quite so
successful at forcing me to use its product (like a government) it is
not decentralised.  And just because there are more firms than
governments, they are not decentralised.  And just because firms are
smaller than governments, they are not decentralised.

True. I can't draw a sharp line between a PPA and a nation, if a PPA was 
large enough and strong enough it might start to look a lot like a nation. 
I can't draw a sharp line between day and night either.

By my definition they do, otherwise it's not a PPA.

I don't follow. 
1) ICBM's, H bombs, airplanes, anti aircraft guns, and even high power rifles  
   are not localized.     
   
2) We have Private Protection Agencies today and not one of them has an  
   exclusive territory.
              

        >It's easy to change nations if they let you 


No, it's no easy to change nations, even if they let you. You must find a new  
job, a new house, a new school for your kids, you must learn a new culture,  
a new language, and make new friends. Changing nations is something you do 
only if things have gotten so intolerable you are absolutely desperate, it's 
not like changing car insurance or your PPA because you think you might be 
able to get a 2% better deal someplace else.
                  

        >it would not be easy to change PPAs if they didn't let you.


It's as easy as reaching for the nearest telephone, and unless your PPA was  
more powerful than all the others put together they would have to let you.

Large asteroid impacts are rare too, but they're still important because when 
they do happen their effects are huge, however I wasn't just talking about 
external disputes with other nations, but the way it treats its own citizens. 
If government needs money they take it, if I  object to them stealing my 
property they will use force to get their booty, as much force as they need 
to, up to and including a bullet in my brain.  They will NOT take "no" for an 
answer, they'll make me an offer I can't refuse.
        

        >arbitration (the more powerful PPA could select an arbiter closer to         
        >its likings).          


If I get into trouble I'd like my mother to be the arbiter, but unless I'm 
more powerful than everybody else I'm not going to get everything I want, and 
if I am that powerful then I don't need an arbiter at all, I'll just have 
everybody shot. As I said, the arbiter is paid by the case and is picked 
before the dispute and by BOTH parties bases on the arbiter's record.      


        >Wars only come when the sides don't agree on their relative strength,         
        >this happens with nations as well as with PPAs 


I never said violence would fall to zero, I did give my reasons for thinking 
the rate would be less than it is now with nation states.

Of course they were, and if I was there at the time I'd be giving the Nazi 
army money too, all I had, because they didn't have a PPA system so if I 
didn't pay they'd put a bullet in my brain.  Anti-Semitism was rampant in 
Germany, lots of people hated Jews, but I do not believe 40 million Germans,  
or even 40 thousand, would voluntarily pay 14% of their gross income to kill 
Jews and keep doing so for years. I have no trouble believing that 6 million 
Jews would pay 14% of their income to stay alive, and a great deal more if 
needed.

If you're talking about the top 1% then you're talking about the Jews,

why can't I?
         

        >it's very relevant how much the other PPA is extorting from you, 


It's even more relevant how many people this psychotic PPA is extorting 
because that's a measure of its total power. If the number was very large, 
much larger than any other PPA, then it would be very difficult to dislodge 
and might be close to world domination, but how did it get so big if it used 
such unpleasant tactics? I'm not saying it's impossible, maybe it could start
as benign, offer great service and be much more efficiently operated than any 
other PPA and so charge lower rates, then when they had gotten far bigger and 
better than anybody else they suddenly send a memo to their many employees 
that there is a change in policy and we're going totalitarian, if anybody
tries to leave our PPA shoot them. It could happen, but it's a hell of a lot 
more likely that the US Army will do it and take over the world. 
And that's not very likely.

You're saying that if the customers of my PPA are worth on average a thousand  
dollars each to me then another PPA can use $1001 worth of force to steal a 
customer from me because it wouldn't be profitable for me to defend him.  
Nonsense. If I did that all my customers would lose confidence in my PPA and 
I'd be out of business in a flash. It would be as if an insurance company 
never paid a claim to a customer higher than his premiums. As owner of a PPA 
I would be willing to pay not $1002 but millions of dollars, or however much 
it took, to stop that business calamity from happening.

Hi All,

The web archive of the list has been down since March 27,
and that is the reason I've not replied to any replies that 
may have been made to me, which may not be any, for it seems
that after I defined the bottom-line (just show me an example
of A where A is A free from relation to not-A) the debate 
sort of came to a screeching halt. That is the pattern:
I cannot and nobody can find a single example of the
atomist paradigm in existence. This must tell us
something, something critical, something we 
cannot dismiss or overlook, something
that maps out a major shortfall 
in contemporary wisdom.

Oh ya, the list... I noticed something worse than the 
list being down... the database is scrambled. Check it
out: http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/1678.html 
select any message and the page that opens is not the 
message you selected. This seems to be endemic. 
It did not do this the other day, so I don't
know what the source of the problem is,
maybe it's from my side, but I can't 
see how that possibility could be.

This is a very common speculation, but it clearly flies in the
face of the abundant evidence of human history that free
societies--in this world, with these people--are now and have
always been the most peaceful societies, while centrally
controlled societies have always been the most brutal.  It is
indeed an extrapolation on the part of anarcho-capitalists to
thereby assume that even more freedom will result in even more
peace, but at least we're speculating in the same direction as
the data, not directly opposite from it.

JPL has now released a processed image of the Face on Mars.  The camera
aiming turned out to be accurate, and the image is detailed and clear.
Lighting is from the opposite side than in the existing pictures, and
that, plus the higher resolution, shows the Face in a whole new light.

It looks nothing like a face.

In fact, at first glance one's impression is that JPL has goofed and
identified the wrong thing.  But there is a crater to the left of the
face which is visible in the new image as well, in the same geometric
relationship.  Clearly this is the same object we have known as the Face.

It is a fissured, eroded hill, nothing more.

Extropians,

	I just had a very fascinating discussion with person I believe
to be a devout humanist that revolved arround our differences (me
being an extropian/transhumanist) of belief.  I noticed some very
pronounced differences in our beliefs/assumptions about life.

	He seemed to work off of assumption like never, will any of
his children (or their children...), ever have a chance to "swim in a
stream" the way he did when he was a child because of such streems now
being polluted due to "overpopulation"...  For him the optimal life
span was arround 100 years and he expressed that he had no desire to
live any longer than that.  He was very comfortable, apperently happy
with and valuing the idea of death and eventually ceasing to exist.

	In contrast, as an extropian, I value having as many children
as possible (while admiting that there might be cases when
overpopulation is troublesem, to the extent that it might be good to
make efforts to avoid for a time.) I think the more people there are
the faster we can progress and the better things will become.  I
"hope" that either I, or some of my children (or maybe their children
and so on...) might eventually be able to live forever.

	He was a slightly older person than I and I think he
considered me as nothing more than a fantasizing youth.  He also
indicated that he had such tendencies when he was younger.  But,
anyway, I very thoroughly enjoyed our conversation and learned some of
the differences between his and my beliefs/assumptions about life
which I thought might be pertinent to this thread of hummanism vs.
transhumanism tenants.

I think transhumanism needs only one principle:

  To transcend every boundary that defines 'human.'

I see no reason to state "why" or "how" you're transcending, and
stating "who" will transcend is nothing short of elitist.  The less
you state as principle the more people you welcome and the less likely
you are to offend any existing transhumanists.

I want to apologize to Anton Sherwood for calling
him a crackpot, even though he initiated the term
against me. I think that the problem is simply one 
of misunderstanding, and I think that to a large
degree (the largest degree) the burden of that 
problem rests on MY shoulders. If someone does
not understand what I say, and if, as in the 
case of Anton, they are an intelligent person,
then I'm willing to and need to accept that this 
is most likely because I have failed to properly
articulate and fully define what I'm saying.

If something is true, it tends to be immediately
self-evidence, and understanding tends to fall 
in line rather quickly. There are big parts of
what I'm saying that do fall in line (we cannot
show where A is A free from not-A, thus not-A
must be part of the identity structure of A, yet
atomist tradition rejects such inclusion), but 
there are also parts that contradict tradition,
which may mean I've yet to master my inquiry.

Well I'm well on the way!

What I have on my "drawing board" now is simply
fantastic! It abolishes the contradictory inter-
face between holism and atomism, and in so doing
embraces the atomist statement A=A and defines 
a new category, or identity strata in which the
inverse statement exists. It covers all bases!

When Anton said I need a new term other than 
"identity," he was mapping just that out...yet 
it's not a new term, it's a new strata/level.
There is +A and -A, but also (absolute)A. The 
whole identity of A defines/implies 3 things:
inside of A, outside of A, AND their logical 
union -- that's just a surface skimming.

It seems to me that whenever we find a con-
tradiction, our problem is an effort to insert 
two poles into one hole, or one pole into two
holes, and the only solution is to find another 
hole or pole to establish a one-to-one mapping. 

Paradoxes and contradictions are important signals, 
and what they tell us is that either we are wrong,
or there is a hidden duality at work that we've
overlooked. The A/-A identity analysis is an 
effort to map the "duality nature" of identity,
a reality that has been overlooked, proven by 
the fact that the A=A paradigm contradicts
physical fact in which A is A relative to -A, 
and "relative to" implies "is inclusive of."

I'm sorry Anton that I was so counter-attack 
oriented. You've said good things about me,
and even stood up for me after the CNN thing,
and for that I'm grateful, even as in so doing 
you tend to reduce my inquiries to something less 
than mature. Since taking on the TWA 800 inquiry 
and "wrong" theory promotion, I've been under more
personal assault that I could have ever imagined
my life would encounter, direct personal assault 
from all levels of society, even Fed-Heads openly 
curing my name live on the air! The weight of this
is nearly catastrophic to my psyche, and is a major
reason why I tried to "escape" with an apology only 
to be set-up and shot down by the GovtMedia again. 

Think about it, scan the Net, there are gazillion 
conspiracy theories out there positing all manor 
of evil onto to Govt, but little 'ol me, I'm the 
one who has been repeated taken to the woodshed
by the GovtMedia. Why? Look at my work, with every
factoid included carefully referenced, it may be
the most responsible theory-promoting rumor-free 
research you'll find anywhere. I'm attacked NOT 
because I'm telling lies (as all the attacks
portray me as doing), no, I've been attacked 
only because I'M WINNING THE ARGUMENT!!!!!

It's only too clear to see for anyone who takes 
the time to look. The major media is uniformly
pro-Govt. They will not research anything that 
would conclude that the Govt killed 230 people
and then acted to cover-up that truth. In fact,
they'll go out of their way to step on anyone 
who does investigate such a grim possibility.

There is no evidence that supports any other 
theory but the missile theory, that's a fact!
The spontaneous-center-fuel-tank combustion 
theory is totally devoid of evidence, it is 
a definitionally "crackpot theory." Its only 
desirable feature is it absolves the Govt.

OK, enough already....

Qualifier on that: the "war on some drugs" was initiated partially on 
the insistence of the enforcement agents of Prohibition, so that they 
would have jobs after Prohibition ended.  It has varied in publicity 
and emphasis since then, but it has never stopped.

But it's a speculation on a boundary condition, which is 
precisely the sort of condition where simple extrapolation is 
prone to error.

And it's a speculation premised on the observation that groups of 
people do not long remain leader-less, and about half an hour after 
they acquire a leader they have dissent against the leader.

That claim is contradicted by the availability of specialty food in
every city.  (Did you read my first sentence above?)  The majority say
"no tofu!" and yet tofu is sold.  The majority say "Who needs to pay
retail for water?" and gourmet bottled water is sold.  The majority say
"beer is beer" and microbreweries sprout like mushrooms.

If you cut out everything else in the world and look only at the trades
of a particular actor, yes, it is naturally "centralized" - as has
already been conceded at least once.  I can't see the advantage of
describing a free economy, with millions of actors each trading with
thousands of others who may not know of each other, in such terms.

Is too!  It's a face whose left side shows the ravages of some disease,
demonstrating that the Martians were/are more enlightened than us: not
ashamed to look squarely at those who are less "perfect", but able to
see beyond the fleshly shell to the true beauty within.  Truly we have
much to learn from our Barsoomite brethren.

Are the scientologists transhumanists? They would be according to the
above definition since they want to become 'active thetans' or
whatever. 

It is nice with very broad definitions, but definitions can become so
broad they are useless or loose important points. The above definition
cannot distinguish transhumanism as it is discussed on this list from
(say) gnosticism or the ideas of taoism. I think it is a mistake to
ignore the "how", since it has many very important consequences, and
in the case of transhumanism the distinguishing factor from general
transcendentalism (or whatever to call it, is there a standard name
for the idea?) is the "how" - we believe it can be achieved through
reason and technology (not necessarily *only* through reason and
technology, but they provide a possible path).

My current definition of transhumanism is: "The idea that the human
condition can be improved above and beyond the current stage, through
rational means in a life affirming way".

I have begun work on a webpage (unfortunately in Swedish right now)
tracing the history and philosophy of transhumanism, and I argue there
that modern transhumanism has three "parents": transcendentalism
(becoming more than humans), humanism (putting an emphasis on human
matters, freedom and reason) and the technism of the enlightenment
(using science and technology to improve things, guided by reason). We
have inherited many memes from each, and the result is a synthesis
that isn't similar to any of them. Unlike the transcendentalists we
embrace reason and technology for change, unlike the humanists we
think the human condition can be fundamentally changed and unlike some
of the techists we appreciate the sensual aspects of life and the
possibility of using self-organization instead of rigid planning for
some systems.

Because these smaller forces will probably be more like mercenary armies, and
these have less inhibitations when it comes to molesting the populace.

Yes, the system relies heavily on the competence and benevolence of
the leader (but of course he'll be elliminated by someone if he does too
outrageous things, so that's a safety). However, the president or 
emperor or whatever you want to call this guy would have been selected
for competence, stability and basically a lack of thirst for power. You
want someone who does his duty but doesn't enjoy it _too_ much. 
Some people on the list, like Anders for example, might qualify
(I think) ;-)

The system is more or less a constitutional monarchy, but not a hereditary 
one. If it works you have a new age of enlightenment, if it fails...well, you
can always try anarcho-capitalism.

That's the way it often was in ye olde days (still in this century, mind you),
and that's the way it *still* is in many 3rd world and even not-so-3rd-world
countries around the globe. Many people simply don't have a choice
(or at least they firmly belief that they don't have a choice) and those who
can't add to their insufficient income by such things as begging, stealing
& hustling will ultimately get too weak to work and die.

Actually, it's not that bad: minimum wage means that corporations, shops etc.
with a (high profile) reputation to hold up will pay more than they would other-
wise to their workers (think Mc Donalds and such), and that those who are
willing to work for less can still sneak into a sweatshop or some other kind
of "illegal" work. Otherwise, more people would be badly paid then today;
companies need a minimal x amount of workers, and minimum wage is the
difference between 10 reasonably paid workers or 30 badly underpaid workers.
So those who *do* have a legit job benefit directly, and those who don't can
still find (illegal) work anyway.

In a system with practically-for-free production of certain kinds of food and
other basic stuff that's then handed out for free or extremely little there
still can be free trade in anything you want. The only difference is that
since you can't outcompete the gov in the "basics" sector, you'd have
to focus on "luxury goods" (anything else) to make of profit. There isn't
a real *monopoly* on the "basics", it's just that there is no money to
be made anymore in this field. The food factories etc. could even be
maintained with revenues from national (state) lotteries and such, so
that people aren't taxed for the benefit of others. This is a very market-
oriented state I have in mind...

Sooner or later, they will. If you'd push full speed ahead you could probably 
elliminate the vast majority of "dumb" jobs within one or two decades. Why
get rid of these job opportunities? Because machines, when properly
programmed, are a lot more reliable, cheaper  and generally user-friendly
than people. Right now too much of our infrastructure depends on 
dimwits with red tendencies. I'd rather have them at home, well-fed
and having fun with VR.

There are no more politicians in the usual sense. There's just the emperor
(well, let's call him that for the moment), the supreme court and various
other controlling organs. Yes, there could be parlaiment or some other
gathering of the people's represetatives, but I'd prefer direct electronic
voting (referendum) on important issues. The outcome isn't binding, but 
a smart ruler won't go against the people's wishes *too* often.

The adequacy test is meant for government employees (especially in
important functions) and whether or not someone is inadequate can
be determined in exactly the same way as is done in corporations
etc. The new state is largely designed as a company, but one with
certain ideological motives.

Oh really, well I guess we don't need the police then. Or PPAs for that
matter. Hey, all's cool if you can trust your fellow man. Needless to say,
it ain't so, we *don't* trust eachother and have good reason for it too.
The state is a product of the fact that on one hand we need a lot of
co-operation to thrive, while at the other hand we don't trust eachother
very much. The state is the context wherein civilization can exist.
PPAs are basically just small, weak states, and will therefore have
more limited means to uphold law and order (not to mention a 
pleasant environment). 

You can't compare any present security agency to a PPA btw, because
they play on a field that's maintained by the nation state. Once they
(and/or their customers) have no longer Big Brother to fall back on in
times of trouble, they might be in for a really hard time. You only realise
something's importance when it's gone.

In reality, no state on earth has enough power to just do anything with
its people, and the politicians know it. As long as you need them for
maintaining the system you can't just kill them. Only a Power is
fully independent (and that's why it is likely that humanity is finished
when we reach that stage).

Also, in anarchy there *may* be a better balance of power, so the chances
that a _big_ dictator kills you may be smaller, but the chances that a
"local" one will do it, or just any guy with a gun, are far greater. In any
case, anarchy inevitably leads to structure, and structure leads to
centralism. Why not skip the decades or centuries of little wars and
annexations and go right to the final product?

Civil remedies still depend on a government to enforce them. Besides,
"political control over the market" doesn't have to the communist kind
of meddling, it can simply mean that useful new products may get some
extra help, and that there's a state-sanctioned "seal of quality" so that
you know what products meet minimum standards, or are outright good,
at a single glance. Products don't *have* to have this seal (and the testing
that comes with it), but buying them is at your own risk of course, while
products backed by the state entitle you to damages & refunds etc, in
case of a failure. The damages etc. are split between state (and have
financial repercussions for the responsible government workers) and
the producer of the goods. This way, everybody is motivated to deliver
a quality service. Of course today's "lawyerculture" would have to be
pruned back, no more damages 'cause you slipped over a coke bottle
in your own home or something silly like that. It has to be *real* damage,
and frauds will be prosecuted to the full extend of the law -- and beyond ;-)

Somewhere there must be a breaking point where politicians are no
longer in control. Yes, it could work out OK, but it will be quite hard
to dismantle such a venerable tradition. And what will happen to
all the former gov employees, who will get the army hardware, the
_nukes_ etc. Who will get the White House? Bill Gates? Does he
buy the nukes too (wholesale style), and a couple o' carriers too
when he's at it? Of course he would have to share with some other
wealthy folks, and maybe he would be poor by then, but in any case
I can well imagine a Russian scenario where former politicians and
bureaucrats sneak back under different "names" into the positions
of power, packed with cash made from the privatization process.
Also I can imagine all sorts of mafia types having a ball, no longer
hampered by even token government intervention. What is stopping
them from creating a new order under a different name and sucking
the people dry in only slightly different ways. Will the raw intellect
and bold dedication of Jack the Lad be able to stop them? Uh oh...

And then there's the problem that the transition from governments to
a free market world can never happen all over at the same time. Some
areas will simply be left out, and without western backing any hint
of fair rule will quickly fade from the less developed countries all over
the world. Their dictators will be quite interested in all the formerly
classified hardware and expertise that suddenly hits the market.
Saddam: "bring on the nukes! I have oil, you have weapons and
people to operate them -- we trade". Ok, business is business.

Slavery? Isn't that overstating it a bit? Oh, by the way (although you might
have thought otherwise when reading my anti-anarchy rantings) I *welcome*
anarchy. I see chaos as a challenge, a job opportunity if you will. It's the
other people that have a problem...

Hmm, what continent would that be? And guess who its new rulers would

with their politicians (only, those stayed of course).

We don't have much time, so better make this a quick one. And watch out

There is a major difference between present-day security firms and PPAs,
since the former work within the framework that's maintained by the
state, and the latter *are* the state. The main reason why you can have
competing security firms working in relative harmony on the same turf
is because they would get busted by Big Brother if they tried to "take"
a region by force, and kicked out the competition. With BB gone, it's
a whole new ballgame. It's not unlikely that criminal organizations, no
longer able to profit from illegal drug trade after the state's demise,
would be among the first PPAs. A couple of gangs, or devisions of the
same gang, could devide a city and treat the people in it more like
slaves than as customers.

> Why would they [the military] suddenly become less ethical if they shared the

Because the military as we know it would be gone in anarcho-capitalism (who's
going to pay for a huge standing army that offers no direct protection), and the
new PPA enforcers would generally be of a different breed than the patriotic
young men in the regular army. I'm not saying that *all* PPAs would have to
turn bad, but I do think that large areas (especially in regions where democracy
either never existed or doesn't have a strong tradition) would be lost to gangs
of thugs that don't even bother to keep up the appearance of "company".

This means that most 3rd world countries, the eastern block, arabic countries
and some regions of western countries would (re)lapse into totalitarianism. Some
of these new nation states or bands of thugs would probably get big enough,
and crazy enough, to be a threat to the areas controlled by bonafide PPAs.
The most logical reaction by the PPAs would be to consolidate their area
before it falls to religious fundamentalism or whatever, meaning that they
would start to behave like a real state, complete with their own turf and 
probably taxes etc.

Well, the Afghans are an extremely silly people, aren't they. And ironically,
they support my case a lot better than yours: when the centralist communists
ruled the region life was, in the cities at least, a lot better than it is now.
As soon as the regime fell the bands of thugs that fought it turned on eachother
and on the population, and after some very destructive fighting the meanest
of them all, the gang of religious psychos known as Taliban (or something like 
that) has established a regime that makes the communists look *really* good...
If *this* is the shape of things to come, I'd rather be centralized. [Or maybe not,
I like to live on the edge ;-) ]

Oh, by the way: the communist regime was in fact quite stable, and held out much
longer than anyone had expected after the Russians left and cut all aid to the
regime.
The savages (or "freedom fighters" if you will) on the other hand remained quite
well-funded by all kinds of other states, and still had a hard time taking Kabul.
I guess the somewhat more civilized cityfolk were more affraid of them then they
were of their own rulers...and they were right.

Some certainly do, and often it's a different kind of people that is attracted
to PPA work. I would expect a greater number of "brown shirts" (bullies
that are only tough enough to terrorize unarmed or badly armed people) in the
PPA business, while the army is more about patriotism, courage and honor.
(at least they *try* to keep up this image).

If it hits the fan so hard that these folks are really required, civilization has
probably gone down the drain anyway. Besides, if someone is "tough"
(or scared) enough to answer "yes" to such a question, this doesn't
automatically mean that he will really do it.

I don't know what really went down there, of course, but people have always
been somewhat more trigger happy when the target is of a different ethnic
background, and of course assholes can be found in any organization.
The same guys could just as well 've been working for a local PPA. If a
client complaints about mexicans in his neighborhood the PPA people
will probably shoot them just as easy as any Marine would.

The *threat* of anarchy should be enough to keep the politicians in check.
In most cases, neither the government nor the people really want things
to get out of control, especially in a wealthy state. So they'll both compromise
a bit for their own benefit.

PPAs are not under the same command, the rival institutions *are*. The
head(s) of state is/are like a referee in a football match. Also, these
institutions aren't generally into contract-based personal security services,
but rather take care of more general threats and provide the basic
framework of stability in which private security companies can operate
(and can focus on their job instead of "playing state").

Yes, makes you think, doesn't it? Maybe it just doesn't work for more
advanced societies (or at least it seems that centralization plays
a crucial role in the development of modern nations).

But will it work for a technologically advanced society? I'd hate to see

Agreed, most of that is pure crap, but at least you can still openly say so
without risking jail or worse ;-) Needless to say, I would get rid of unnecessary
bureaucracy if I could, few people hate it more than myself.

There are several things to say to that: first, the number of "real" victims is 
relatively limited, and would probably be a lot higher in a world without 
a stable central government. Also, many of the casualties are due to the
unholy war on victimless "crime". There is no such thing in my proposed
plan; do what you like as long as you don't damage others without their
consent and all that. Probably the most casualties are due to war. I
would always seek to prevent war, and if this isn't possible use robot
weapons and small groups of professional soldiers. No-one should be forced 
to risk death for his country (and machines make better soldiers anyway).

Thanks for pointing this out, Hal. To me, the 1976 picture looked as
much like a face as the "Man in the Moon" anyway, but this should put
the FoM to rest. It will be interesting to hear the responses from the
True Believers, provided I don't have to hear too many of them.

Now I can get back to the important stuff like finding an explanation
for the Nazca Lines by skipping letters in the Torah.

Anders Sandberg wrote 4/7/98: <My current definition of transhumanism is:
"The idea that the human condition can be improved above and beyond the

This is a good stab at a definition.  As you know from past list
discussions, definitions are critical to communication, which is critical
to developing a consensual moral polity, which is critical to achieving
great aims in the future.  It seems to me that defining what a human is,
has not met with consensus and that defining what a transhuman is,
therefore, is putting the cart before the horse.

That said, since speculation for fun is the lifeblood of e-lists, I would
like to offer that "rational means" is wedded to the concept of "truth,"
and "a life affirming way" is wedded to the concept of "good."  All you are
missing is some part of your definition that is wedded to the concept of
"beauty."  "Beauty" should enter in as an aim, what transhumanism aims for.
 Across all scientific endeavors, at all scales, spatial and temporal,
preferred branches of development reveal themselves.  Transhumanism should
be aiming at maximizing chances of successful speciation by learning where
these preferred branches are located.  I like the idea of defining
transhumanism as an "idea" because it avoids getting bogged down in
prescriptive or normative ethics, i.e., it doesn't come across as a
"program" or a utopian manifesto.  Optionally, you might bring in some
concept wedded to "adventure," something relating to the vitality of
pursuing enhanced consciousness and indefinite longevity.

The inclusion of "a life affirming way" naturally excludes enthusiasts of
abortion, infanticide and euthanasia since these are all life devaluing,
not affirming.  Freedom to murder is not liberty, it's license.  These
enthusiasts, who sanction predatory behavior against the weak, the sick and
the old, who adhere to the "might makes right" ethic of entropic
death-worship, are essentially ape-like thugs who aim no higher than the
next tree branch up in a fetid jungle.  They may masquerade as
transhumanists or extropians, but they live an ugly lie, incoherently and
irrationally posturing as if they "affirm life" and mouthing vapid
platitudes about "non-coercion" while forcing everyone to tolerate their
endorsement and practice of butchery.

Isn't this the perfect clue to start discussing diverse new list

Does anyone have any information on this book? Its being published by Harper Collins and the target date was February 1998.  However, I have not been able to locate a copy yet. I have not been able to find any information on the perspective of the book either.  I would appreciate any information you may have on this book.

Excerpts from The Washington Post Health Magazine (03/31/98):

    Drinking purple grape juice may turn out 
    to be as effective as taking a daily aspirin 
    to prevent the formation of blood clots that 
    can lead to heart attacks.

    That's the conclusion suggested by a small, 
    preliminary study reported yesterday by John 
    D. Folts of the University of Wisconsin Med-
    ical School at a meeting of the American 
    College of Cardiology. 

    Folts, who first showed in animal experiments 
    in 1974 that aspirin can lower the incidence 
    of heart attacks, has been studying substances 
    known as flavonoids, present in purple grape 
    juice, tea and red wine, that reduce the stick-
    iness of platelets (small blood cells that 
    initiate clotting). ...

    In the new study... [g]rape juice reduced 
    platelet aggregation by an average of 84 
    percent--a stronger effect than that pre-
    viously reported for aspirin. ...

No, our leader will be eliminated unless he ignores trivial things like  
benevolence, justice and transhuman principles and concentrates all his

Hello all.  I have been reading this list for some time so that I might
learn what all of the participants stand for collectively and
individually. The extropian and transhumanist principles, at least what I
have learned about them, intrigue me greatly.  In reading the list I
followed for a while the thread that pitted Reilly Jones against the
majority of the list over what amounted to a discussion of the morality
of abortion.  I would like to make some comments to everyone, and most
importantly, to Reilly.

I think that a discussion resulting in the creation of an "us and them"
dichotomy, fails to exemplify and to encourage thought based on the
principles of extropy.  Here is a quote directly from the Extropian
Principles on Dynamic Optimism:

"Problems technical, social, psychological, ecological are to be
acknowledged but not allowed to dominate our thinking and our direction. 
We respond to gloom and defeatism by exploring and exploiting new
possibilities."

Continuing to argue about a social problem such as the debate of the
morality of abortion does nothing more than perpetuate the problems
associated with the topic.  Reilly, why not try to examine the issue from
a few different perspectives.  There are few things more elusive as the
idea of absolute truth, which is the impression I have regarding the
anti-abortion position I have seen expressed on this list.  I am not
taking the Extropian Principles as truth, but more as a set of guiding
ideas.

You have a valid point.  However, something more to consider is, "what is
life?"  Is life, human or transhuman, meant to be simply existence? 
Should transhuman life be happy, or should it simply be existence?  I
believe that life should be happy, or at least that a human has the
intrinsic right to have happiness from the beginning of that existence,
and even to the frequently unfortunate end.

for.

Wedding rational means and truth is rather difficult.  All things,
events, and thoughts are relative.  Truth relates to reality and each
person has his/her individual reality.  "Rational means" is a way to
improve the human condition as Anders defined the idea.  Linking "a life
affirming way" and "good" is also very subjective and difficult, because
good is greatly open to interpretation as I will later prove by example.
I hate to use the cliche, but Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  What
you see as beautiful may or may not correspond to what another person sees.

If, by "enthusiasts of abortion, infanticide and euthanasia" you mean
those who support the right for the women to decide individually whether
she should continue a pregnancy and those who believe that each person
has the right to decide that his or her existence must not continue, then
I contend that those people are not "naturally excluded."  Your emotions
have greatly confused your ability to discern between those who support a
right to an action or a procedure and those who seek to expand its
application(s).

I do not believe in using abortion as a means of birth control.  Imagine
there is a young woman who cannot possibly support, nurture, and provide
the happiness that the new life she helped to create should have.  I am
not going to stop her from using an "artificial miscarriage"  I would
rather have one unhappy person weeping for the child that could never be
in her reality, than to have two unhappy people as the child grows into a
world that it comes to despise because it is not happy.

What is affirming life?  I take this phrase to mean more than affirming
an individual life.  Life can refer to the general human condition, for
which the extropians and transhumanists stand to improve.  If refusing to
stop abortion improves the general human condition, which includes the ~6
billion beings already in existence, by reducing the number of unhappy
people, then those who "live an ugly lie" are in effect promoting life
affirmation.

Reilly, you are the person who wishes to force your beliefs and your
truths upon everyone else.  By saying that others are trying to make you
tolerate says that because you do not tolerate those beliefs, they should
not be allowed to continue.  THAT is forcing beliefs on others.  Ask
yourself, Reilly, what is your true goal?  Do you not think that there
are already enough unhappy people in the world?  Why refuse individuals
from stopping the development of another few undifferentiated cells into
an unhappy person?  

I personally believe that abortion, particularly late-term, should be
avoided at all costs, unless there are dire circumstances, such as the
threat to a woman's life.  People should ideally, to me, determine that
they can support a child before they proceed to do so, or they should
preempt the problem by simply using effective birth control.  A pregnant
woman should also be able to determine long before the fetus becomes
viable whether she should continue.  However, I am not a woman, and I
cannot speak for everyone.  Nobody can.

After having successfully seized control of the transhumantech mailing list,
mastermind Eugene L. heads for his next big goal: Conquest of Extropia [TM].
Do two part-time moderatorships make one full-time life as a mod? Is it
really Eugene or just his intelligent UNIX mail filter going mad? And --will
the Krauts finally rule the world? For the answers to these and other
exasperating questions, check out next week's episode of "Spam: Above and

Suppose technology evolves to the point where people can create new
biological entities in the privacy of their homes.  Biotechnology
allows you to grow an organism with a desired genetic code in an
artificial womb.  You can create people in this way, and modify their
genome any way you like.

What are the moral issues involved in using this technology?  Here are
some scenarios.  Which if any are immoral?

 - You use it to grow a child, the offspring of you and your partner,
   with a genome chosen from a random combination of the parents using
   a method which simulates natural fertilization.

 - You use it to grow a child with a designed genome that has little
   resemblance to your own.  You can give the child special abilities but
   they have some consequential weaknesses.

 - You use it to grow an organism not fully human, but with a human-like
   mentality - a dog with a human brain, for example.

 - You use it to create an assortment of subhuman servants, the deltas and
   epsilons of Brave New World.

I don't have a good answer to these questions.  It seems to me that
intentionally creating a being whose life will involve more suffering
than pleasure is wrong.  The degree of wrongness would relate to how much
suffering there was, and the level of consciousness and intelligence
which perceived the suffering.

None of the examples above would clearly fall into that category, although
an human-intelligent animal might, depending on how its life turned out.
As in Huxley's novel, the subhuman servants are designed to be happy with
their limited lives.

By the same reasoning, reckless experimentation which stood a good
chance of suffering would be wrong as well, although not as much so.
Most of the examples above could lead to disastrous outcomes if not done
carefully or if the procedures were not well understood.

Based on this rather cautious principle, I would tentatively classify
the above procedures as moral, as long as they were done carefully so
that suffering was minimized.

Sorry, I cant quote the previous material in this thread because I
accidentally deleted the file and am having no luck finding anything
in the archives (it was scrambled, now theres just no content.)

So here we go

Heres my original model for a decentralised market:

Each person contributes to a virtual pool of resources across a
distributed network.  Every resource that is added can be replicated
by any other member of the network for their own individual needs at
no cost to the other members.  There is no direct trading between any
members of the network (even person to person.)  You do not have to
contribute to be able to take, and there is no points or reward system.

Currently this would only work with information (because it can be
easily replicated), but it can be applied to all resources (nobody
said we have to keep this in the realm of the possible.)

I submit that this is more decentralised than the Free Market, and
therefore the Free Market is not completely decentralised.

Sorry, I lost the rest of this message but I saw it for all of 3
seconds and kind of remember what its about :-)

Doesnt this still apply to Scientologists?  Im sure they consider
their means rational and life affirming.  I think the point to be
made is, no matter what you write its going to be subjective.  So
should we say as little as possible or as much as possible?

I'm dubious of this conclusion...  By this premise, all of the above would
necessarily be moral if they were created in such a way that they were
always (artificially) happy, no matter how difficult or otherwise painful
their circumstances...

Moral issues can be solved by applying game theory. Before you create
a new entity, determine its payoff function. This will tell you how
it will behave, if it will cooperate or not. Examine your own payoff
function, and you'll see if you benifit or not. Perhaps the problem
is more how to choose the most morally correct entities given the
existing technology.

Dear fellow Transhumanists/Extropians,

In spite of the fact that many of us are involved with information
technology the millenium problem has only received limited attention here.
Since the potential ramifications are... well _huge_ to say the least I
felt it merits some more discussion.

I know this is 'old news' but many people (companies/governement agencies)
seem to be blisfully unaware of the major hangover that we face after a
long weekend of partying (1-1-2000 is a saturday).

On this site some basics for those unfamiliar with the problem:
this is a wake-up call: http://www.garynorth.com

It seems pretty fatalistic and I'm not at all sure if it has to be this
bad, on the other hand: most nuclearpowerplants, aiports, utility
companies, armies are not yet year-2000 certified. Fireworks ;-). The same
goes for many logistical systems that supply supermarkets and such. No-one
can tell for sure what the extent of the damage wil be. Maybe your company
has been y2K-certified, but have all it's supliers? And if the bankng
system goes bust how wil anyone buy your product?

Or, strictly economically speaking (Gary North):

            What happens to T-bills and T-bonds if the
      IRS computer breaks down and a tax revolt spreads
      because taxpayers know the IRS will never find
      them, and that if they pay their taxes, they
      won't get their refunds?

            What happens to money market funds and bond
      funds that invest heavily in government debt when
      investors realize that if the IRS can't collect
      taxes, the government will default on its debt?

            What happens to the banks when depositors
      figure out that the FDIC is bankrupt and that
      nobody insures their accounts any more?

            What happens to your job when the banks
      close because of bank runs, and no business can
      borrow money or even write a check to its
      employees?

            What happens to the delivery of food into
      cities when money fails because the banks are
      busted?

            What happens to the delivery of public
      utilities when money fails because the banks are
      busted?

            What happens to your retirement fund when
      ERISA, the government pension guarantee program,
      goes bankrupt?

           What happens to the 38 million people in
      the U.S. who are dependent on Medicare?  

          What happens to 42 million people on Social
      Security?

            What happens to every state government?

            What happens to crime rates when the state
      cannot imprison violent criminals and may have to
      release those who are locked up because they
      can't be fed?

            What happens to the world economy when this
      scenario is multiplied across every government?
      -------------------------------------------------

Let's not discuss how great it would be if the IRS died (we can agree to
disagree or now, I think), but which research institutions could be
damaged. How long can Alcor last without power? How can they rescue
patients if the phones are out? If only a fraction of what Gary North
predicts is true some transhuman goals could very well go down the drain or
quite some time.

Mr. North also describes the psychology-of-denial that is being practiced
by many managers and governement officials "don't worry, we've got it under
control". The idea that everything could come to a grinding halt is so
fanatastic that it is dismissed "they will find a solution". If you did not
hear about the Y2K-problem untill now you might have the same reaction (I
still have it - a little ;-).

I have a lot of trust in our ability to rebuild, after all, western Europe
and Japan managed to do so after WWII. But they did get some (in fact,
quite some) help for a big, undamaged country. This time there might not be
big, undamaged countries. How do you repair a mainframe if the power is
out? How do you assemble a team if the phones don't work? How do pay people
if the banking system is in shambles?

Is anyone planing for what could happen? If so, how? Convert your money to
something with stable value? What? How are you going to enforce your
ownership? Can you distribute these goods? Should you learn new (old) skills?

I think I'll do some minor stuff like extra shopping, getting a fair amount
of ca$h and securing some alternative heating/lighting. Then again, if
utility's really go down so goes the rest of civilization after a while and
a supply of candles won't help. The Netherlands of course wil be flooded if
our electrical pumps fail for a long time (there are diesel backups but
there might not be any diesel ;-).

I'm not ready to start looking for another job as Mr Norh advises, maybe
I'll get myself a book on cobol (maybe I'm in denial too ;-).

Not totally unrelated: What if the general populace does not trust
computers anymore after a big crash? What would the impact be on future
adavancement in AI-research? This could have serious impact on things like
a singularity and technical advances in general (quite difficult to design
or run a spaceship without computers).

Greetings & sleep well (it's still 631 nights away)
Arjen

Only if the players respect payoff.  Who says we couldn't design obedient

Clearly they would have nothing to gain or lose from serving me, and thus
all of its payoffs are equal.

Presuming that I could actually make certain that they are always happy
slaves then game theory would DEMAND that I create such people.

    This is the 20'th update on my fly longevity experiments. I made two
 mistakes with this run, one minor and one major. The minor one is that I
 apparently forgot to include the non-toxic taurine larvicide in the onion
 4X/chitosan 4X, and onion 4X/paprika combination bottles. The breeding
 that occurred in these bottles, rendered any census impossible, and so
 these bottles had to be discarded.
    The major mistake was adding still boiling water (instead of boilED)
 to all of the supplement bottles, without first testing to see if this
 was beneficial. Fortunately I included a normal control using cool water,
 in addition to a hot control using boiling water, for all of the three
 breeding bottle fly sources. Thus I am able to learn from my mistake.
    Using boiling water reduced fly longevity by two mechanisms. One was
 purely physical. This involved the formation of tight cracks between the
 fly food and the inside of the bottles. In some supplement bottles these
 were narrow enough to trap and drown numerous flies in the moist fly
 food. The onion 4X bottle was a great example of this, with all of its
 flies being drowned by the day 34 census. Fortunately these cracks tended
 to widen with time as the fly food slowly dried out, so that after the
 day 34 census, few flies met their end in this way.
    The other mechanism reducing longevity can be only speculated about.
 After all the flies in the three hot control bottles had died, a few
 still lived on in the corresponding cool water control bottles. This
 appears to constitute a genuine aging acceleration phenomina. I presume
 this is due to the boiling water destroying some of the vitamins in the
 fly food and inducing subclinical nutrient deficiencies, which manifest
 themselves late in life.
    On a positive note two observations stand out in this run. First
 hawthorn appears to increase life span. Secondly the factors responsible
 for the longer life span associated with cinnamon or sage
 supplementation, appear to be lipid soluable, since addition of the fat
 binding fiber chitosan eliminates this effect.
    I am trying something different for my eighth run. All flies used here
 have been "pre-aged" in holding bottles containing taurine larvicide for
 29 days prior to use. About 75% of the flies in these bottles had already
 died before the eighth run had even been begun. I had anticipated some
 mortality, and so had used 5 holding bottles. However even with the
 increased number of fly sources, I found that I did not have enough flies
 to commence a full sized run. I did the best I could here, with the flies
 available. Since these aged flies were virtually unable to fly I upended
 each holding bottle, and dumped the flies into one bottle prior to use.
 The advantage here is that the flies from all five holding bottles are
 homogenized so that five control bottles are not needed to account for
 variations in average fly age from different bottles.
     The main advantage of using pre-aged flies is that the eighth run
 will be completed quick enough, that I doubt that rotting of the fly food
 would be much of a factor limiting life spans. It is possible that larger
 differences in longevity might manifest themselves with this change in
 procedures.
     I would like to thank Robert Ettinger and Andy Zawacki for donating
 the acetyl-carnosine for the eighth run. I am told that this is from
 Russian sources.

As I wrote before, Gary North is a religious fundamentalist who
is well known among Christian millennialists (believers in the
near-term apocalyptic events foretold in the Book of Revelations).
He has written dozens of books on religious topics, focusing on
issues related to the coming apocalypse, long before he heard
of Y2K.  Here is an excerpt from a review of one of his books, at:
http://metanet.net/freebooks/docs/2142_47e.htm

: Here is the main question: Will Jesus' Great Commission be fulfilled in
: history? Will nations be discipled by the Church? Will God bring judgment
: against His enemies in history? Most important, do we have enough time
: for the healing power of the gospel to do its work?  Two millennial views
: say no, there isn't enough time: premillennialism and amillennialism
: ("pessimillennialism"). A third view says yes, there is enough time:
: post-millennialism. The revival of interest in this third view has
: taken both rival camps by surprise. By tying a vision of victory in
: history to the doctrine that the Bible offers specific answers to social
: problems, a new movement has begun to capture the minds of a generation
: of Christian activists. The movement is called Christian Reconstruction.
: In Millennialism and Social Theory, Dr. Gary North, co-founder of this
: movement, examines why both pre-millennialism and amillennialism have
: never developed independent social theories, and why the spokesmen of
: both positions appeal to the prevailing ethics of contemporary humanism
: as the only possible way to run society.

I believe North sees Y2K in religious terms, as an element of the "end
times" which have long been foretold.  His Y2K site is largely secular,
until you read the bulletin boards where some of his long time followers
retain their religious views.

The point is, North is filtering the data he presents through his
religious ideas.  It is a biased presentation designed to lead to the
desired apocalyptic conclusion.

The operative sentence here is "No-one can tell for sure what the extent
of the damage will be."  That is really the only thing you can say with
any certainty about Y2K.

If the IRS doesn't pay out refunds, they'll have a real problem.
Presumably this is one of the mission critical areas they are fixing
first.  As for not paying your taxes and hoping the IRS won't catch
you because it will crash, who would take that risk?  After all, even
if there are glitches around Y2K, as long as the IRS survives they will
eventually get things fixed, and then they'll come after you.  So you
are basically betting on the collapse of the government if you take this
strategy.  North and his fellow fanatics may do this, but the average
person, whose taxes are automatically withheld every paycheck, won't
be willing to take the chance.

This is based on the assumption that the IRS will fail and people will
stop paying taxes, but as I said that seems unrealistic.  Even if it
has some slowdowns, the IRS should be able to get through the backlog
and keep revenues coming.

This has been bandied about for at least 15 years.  There were record bank
failures in the late 1980s and survivalists gleefully predicted disaster.
But we got through it.

The Fed has already pledged to "make liquidity available" as needed during
any Y2K problems.  I read this as basically meaning that they won't allow
banks to fail due to the bug.  If some bank can't repay a loan to another,
the Fed will guarantee the loan, so the house of cards remains standing.

This is piling uncertainty upon unlikelihood.  From here on out North's
scenarios become ever more farfetched.

Alcor relies on manually pouring LN2 into the dewars every few days.
They are not electrically powered.  Obviously a collapse of civilization
means the LN2 is going to stop being available eventually.  But a more
likely scenario with scattered, localized disruptions should mean no
more than a few days of power outages.

Let me turn the question around.  Suppose power and phones stay up.
It should be clear that most of the problems can be dealt with by human
ingenuity.  People are not slaves to their machines.  If some computers
don't work, they may have to do things a little slower, but after a few
days they will adjust.

Power companies cope with failures in the grid all the time.  The system
is designed to stay up in the face of localized failures.  Generally it
has been quite robust.  The same is true of the phone system.  There
have been a few incidents in which localized errors managed to bring down
larger regions, but these are extremely rare.

When I first began learning about Y2K, I became quite alarmed.  I read
Ed Yourdon's book (Time Bomb 2000) and studied Gary North's web site.  I
started checking companies that offer a year's supply of food, and how
much space I would need in the garage for it.  I looked into solar
electricity generation vs buying a generator and storing gas.

Then, I learned more about the people involved.  I discovered North's
background, and I saw that Yourdon is hawking his Y2K consultancy on
his web page.  I read criticisms by a power engineer of Yourdon's
fearmongering about electricity disruption.  The bulletin board
discussions were dominated by the same kinds of people who have been
predicting disaster since the 1970's.

My current belief is that there is going to be a significant economic
impact due to the bug, to the expense of fixing it, and to people's
reactions and worries about it.  We've had a long peacetime expansion
and it's about time for a recession, anyway.  I believe worry about Y2K
will be the trigger.  There will be disruptions and failures, but they
will be localized.  Some businesses which have Y2K failures while the
competition is compliant will go under, throwing people out of work.
Unemployment will increase, the economy will contract, stock prices
will fall.  It could be a severe recession.

It all adds up to a bad situation.  But it's not the end of the world
that people like North are predicting.

I can't see this.  Computers aren't like they were in the 1960's, vague,
threatening behemoths off in a sterile computer room somewhere.  They're
in our wristwatches, our pagers, our toaster ovens.  What, am I supposed
to "not trust" my microwave because there was a Y2K crash?

More likely than this is North's scenario of people turning on computer
programmers as the villains whose lazy programming caused the Y2K problem.
Some people suggest that computer programmers will walk away from their
jobs in 1999 when they see that the Y2K problem is going to hit hard,
and they don't want to be around when the mobs come drooling for blood.
This will then make the Y2K fixes that much farther behind schedule,
according to this scenario.  Dramatic, but pretty far fetched if you ask
me.

Wouldn't it be better to create slaves that are only happy while actively
serving you, and are otherwise in a neutral state? Also, you might 
insert a feature that prevents them from even *thinking* negatively
about you (by linking these thoughts to mental and physical discomforts
a la "A Clockwork Orange". Game theory demands it ;-)

The version of the Transhumanist Declaration (as it's now called) 
that will have to do for now is at:

http://www.transhumanism.com/declaration.htm.

In the future it will of course be revised and updated. Thanks to 
everybody who has contributed!


Another thing that is useful to have worked out is a one-sentence 
definition/explanation of what transhumanism is, to use in 
conversations for example. I used to say:

"Transhumanism is the philosophy that we can and should use 
technology to overcome our biological limitations and transform the 
human condition."

Anders said:
> My current definition of transhumanism is: "The idea that the human
> condition can be improved above and beyond the current stage, through
> rational means in a life affirming way".

After reading this, I think I will change my one-sentence definition 
to:

"Transhumanism is the idea that the human condition will 
be dramatically transformed by technology and that it is a good thing 
to use rational methods to overcome our biological limitations."

What do you other people say when somebody asks you "What is 
transhumanism?"?

<sigh>  Do you remember when the government shut down for a while, because
the politicians couldn't agree on a budget?  Did you manage to get your
paycheck that month?  Did the economy crash as a result?

Yeah, well this is even LESS of an issue.  If/when the IRS goes down, the
US government will borrow money to cover the temporary downtime.  And yes,
it will be temporary, because the government will make the IRS its top
priority until it is up and running again, if it goes down at all.

All of the above horror scenarios are dependent on the government being
unable to collect taxes, which, to be perfectly blunt, won't happen, even
if the IRS WAS shut down for a few weeks.

Before I hear "Yeah, well, you're in denial," we had best keep in mind that
I would also be "in denial" if you told me the sun wouldn't rise tomorrow.

To answer a few of your specific questions:

>How do you repair a mainframe if the power is
>out?  How do you assemble a team if the phones don't work? 

The utilities will only go out if the banking system is in shambles...

>How do you pay people if the banking system is in shambles?

... and the banking system will only find itself in shambles if the
aforementioned "tax revolt" happens and/or FDIC insurance runs out.

But unfortunately, a tax-revolt will be no easier two years from now than
it would be any other year.  The IRS is not monitoring your transactions
day-to-day; it only does so year to year, and even then only on those whom
it audits.  It keeps little of this data on hand; that data which is on
hand is either saved to disk, (and backed up daily,) or kept on paper.
Moreover, it COLLECTS the data it does have from your bank, employer, etc.,
so imagining that it DID lose all of its data, it could have it all
replaced as necessary.  

The FDIC would only stop if the government went bankrupt; which won't
happen, because the IRS will not go down permanently.  And fortunately for
the banks, they're closed Jan. 1.  It's a national holiday.  :)

This kind of attitude, however, is the sort that could cause some real
damage.  If everyone, afraid that the US economy is going to crash, pulls
all their money out, they CAN cause it to crash.  But this will not be due
to a technical error, only due to people spreading horror stories like these.

Don't bother.  You're frustratingly safe, this time.

Au contraire!  I'm helping in the UCI fly lab right now, and they're
doing work on breeding flies for longevity, and the genetic basis
of late life mortality rates.  They're just finishing a 60,000 fly
experiment right now.  Several others are doing various related work;
Curtsinger, for example, is investigating environmental effects on 
late-life mortality.  There's a lively row in the literature
right now about the genetics of lifespan variation.

What is the difference between artificial happiness and the real thing?
Can someone be happy and still be in terribly difficult and painful
circumstances?  That seems a bit contradictory.

Perhaps the real difficulty here is the difficulty of knowing what the
true mental state is.  Obviously, creating someone with a fixed smile
on their face is no indication that they are actually happy.  Even if we
have good general understanding of genetics it may be much longer before
we can say with confidence that a particular design will lead to a happy
being, one which does not suffer.

Still, in terms of judging morality, I'd say we have to use our best
understanding of these matters, just as in other areas of uncertainty.
We may want to err on the side of caution, in which case creating beings
with drastically new mental structures could be considered immoral,
since we might unknowingly create a being who was constantly in terrible
pain, and who (of course) never volunteered to undergo that experience.
This would obviously hinder the growth of understanding the mind and
brain, but it would be wrong to gain knowledge at the cost of involuntary
suffering by others.

Hal:  I'd love it if you (or anyone else) could provide some good links for
Y2K  skepticism (if I can call it that). It's really easy to find stuff by
the fear-mongerers, and it is useful to look over what they have to say. But
I've had more difficulty tracking down contrary reasoning (saying why we
shouldn't be too fearful) with anything like the detail found on North's or

I say: "Transhumanism is the notion that human evolution is an on going
process and that it can should be directed by the individual, for the
individual."  

I may change my response to: "Transhumanism: Evolution of the individual,
by the individual, for the individual."

   The idea of gain of knowledge at the painful expense of others is 
akin to the controversy of abortion.  To include issues of morality in a 
discussion where everyone is not in agreement with a moral, is a waste 
of time.  
   I don't feel that we could ever know for sure whether or not our 
procedures/experiments are inflicting unnecessary pain on an individual.  
In the name of advancement, it becomes necessary to take those "immoral" 
steps to whatever degree necessary before dedicating efforts to 
modification of experiments to decrease discomfort for the specimens.  I 
know the preceding statement may sound Hitlerian, but when push comes to 
shove, and life to death, how else do we humans operate in this world 
anyway?  
   I propose that we could develop interfaces to allow ourselves to 
become the specimen being subjected to whatever stresses other impose on 
it.  Later on, we could, upon exit of such xfers, more accurately 
interpret what the specimens may be "feeling".

You know this could be rather funny. You could look at it like those people whose
technology is outmoded such that they do not fix their Y2K problems will die a
horrible death economically as their livlihoods are destroyed. Thus those people
with non Y2K compliant software and hardware are marked with 'the number of the
beast'  he he he..... thus the chosen people of GOD are the extropic digerati of
the world, and the old ignorant people and bureaucracies are the minions of the
devil... he he....   If things are bad with the US's IRS, how bad are they for
computer systems in countries like India, China, and Russia???  ....

Those that get the Y2K fix will experience 1000 years of computing Heaven on
Earth, those that don't will burn in the pits of ignorance....

Hmmmmm, sounds like a marketing campaign......

How about this one?

Transhumanism is the belief that humans are predisposed to perpetual
self-actualization, and that they will inevitably utilize rational
technologies to facilitate mental and physical transformations which will
serve that end.

I don't know that there'll be many of those.

First, the people who think that Y2K will be no big deal, think that 
it's no big deal.  People tend not to write substantial 
well-researched essays on things that are no big deal.

Second, even the people who think that it'll be no big deal, are NOT 
forecasting a problem-free transition.  Me, I'm a computer 
programmer, I'm trying to arrange to get at least a month off wrapped 
around Jan 1 2000.  If I can manage to take off the entire months of 
December and January, I expect the problems will be fixed (or 
otherwise dealt with) at my place of employment; if I can't get any 
time off, I expect I'll work two or three 60-hour weeks on the 
recovery effort -- putting my *current* work behind schedule.

That's because it's a lot easier to provide great detail, when you 
are free to make it up and to ignore anything that doesn't agree with 
you.

I like it, Scott, and that's not to disparage the other definitions
others may have offered, but it kind of ties in with a Randy-Smith
truism:  many, if not most, humans are, in some fundamental way,
unhappy. That ultimate state of self-actualization would seemingly
elude us until that day that Nanotech Arrives In All Its Glory. One
would think when one controls matter on a nanotech scale,
self-actualization is only a matter of twiddling brain biochemistry.

There would seem to be gene survival advantages in the unhappy and
self-actualization-seeking human.

As far as utilizing "rational technologies" to acheive
self-actualization" ends, I guess it is a transition from the
"spiritual technologies" previously used, eh?

I have heard that many cryonicists (and I understand that many
extropians are cryos or wannabe cryos) see cryonics as a chance at
another life, one in which they can fulfill their goals
(self-actualize).  Comments?

Hal Finney wrote 4/8/98: <Suppose technology evolves to the point where

Um... We've been here for some time now, Hal.  The biological entities are
called children.  With the socialist statism we live under, the privacy of
our homes isn't very private any more.  It seems the state has largely
coopted raising our children, at least those children not murdered by their
mothers with the sanction of our judicial oligarchy.

Hal: <Biotechnology allows you to grow an organism with a desired genetic
code in an artificial womb.  You can create people in this way, and modify
their genome any way you like.>

We're not here yet, but we're certainly trying to get here.  Following my
distinction between "developed" individuals (which many abortion
enthusiasts pretend to find at some arbitrary point before or even after
birth but which actually don't ever exist) and "developing" individuals
(which begin to develop after conception and continue until death - with
polycentric jurisdictions free to handle different options), then the only
area here subject to political jurisdiction would be if the genome were
intentionally altered during development.  That would be altering a self
other than your own self, which involves the larger polity.  The polity may
choose to ignore the alterations, set guidelines for them, outlaw them,
whatever they see fit.  Choose a different polity if you don't like it. 
But let's not have one giant standard for all, a monoculture.

Hal: <It seems to me that intentionally creating a being whose life will
involve more suffering than pleasure is wrong.  The degree of wrongness
would relate to how much suffering there was, and the level of
consciousness and intelligence which perceived the suffering.>

Half the world's population believes in some form of redemptive qualities
in suffering.  Suffering or pleasure are very weak guides to morality.  Why
would suffering or pleasure matter much at all, especially since such
physiological reactions are increasingly modulated by technological means? 
They just don't mean much in the moral sphere because humans (and
transhumans) are able to transcend both, whether aiming towards great
achievements or high ideals.

Michael Scarazzo wrote 4/8/98: <I followed for a while the thread that
pitted Reilly Jones against the majority of the list over what amounted to
a discussion of the morality of abortion....  I think that a discussion
resulting in the creation of an "us and them" dichotomy, fails to exemplify
and to encourage thought based on the principles of extropy.>

Fortunately, majorities don't manufacture truth.  Discussion that relates
to what is entropic vs. extropic is always appropriate to the list. 
Oftentimes individuals adopt some personally convenient position that
appears extropic without following the chain of moral logic to its entropic
endpoint.  Exploring these chains of moral logic is often interesting and
informative even if annoying and uncomfortable.

MS: <Is life, human or transhuman, meant to be simply existence?  Should
transhuman life be happy, or should it simply be existence?  I believe that
life should be happy, or at least that a human has the intrinsic right to
have happiness from the beginning of that existence, and even to the
frequently unfortunate end.>

Rocks are simply existing, yet they aren't life.  Perhaps you should
consider the possibility that life is qualitatively different than rocks. 
I could care less about happiness, especially now that it can be
technologically modulated.  When we can get eudaemonia-in-a-pill, what
worth is striving for knowledge, or sacrifice for achievement?  Try reading
Aristotle's "Nicomachean Ethics" about how elusive happiness is ("feeling
of conscious vitality") and think about how feeble happiness is as an ideal
to develop morality by.  There is never a right to happiness.  The right to
*pursue* happiness is no different than the right to pursue unhappiness, it
is simply a statement of the centrality of volitional freedom to humanity
(and transhumanity).

MS: <Wedding rational means and truth is rather difficult.  All things,
events, and thoughts are relative.  Truth relates to reality and each
person has his/her individual reality.>

Is the statement "all things are relative" a true statement?  You see how
absurd such windage is?  Relativism is incoherent.  If rationality is not
wedded to truth then it is clearly irrationality.

MS: <Linking "a life affirming way" and "good" is also very subjective and
difficult, because good is greatly open to interpretation...>

If "life affirming way" does not refer to "good" then why use the word
"affirming"?  This makes no sense at all.  Any time you specify a moral
direction ("way"), you are inescapably referencing the good.

MS: <Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  What you see as beautiful may
or may not correspond to what another person sees.>

I see an underdeveloped imagination here.

MS: <Your emotions have greatly confused your ability to discern between
those who support a right to an action or a procedure and those who seek to
expand its application(s).>

If you really followed the earlier discussion, you will see that I
presented a rational chain of moral logic, entirely secular in nature,
beginning with clear definitions and ending with clear, reasonable options.
 Emotions are not a part of this presentation until the end of the
consequences are reached and they are a bad end.  I was met with
unintelligent bigotry, stereotyped as a religious kook, and flaming
emotional irrationality was heaved my way, including a prescription for
guillotining half my state for not wanting to turn our doctors into
murderers, into neo-Nazi "angels of death."  My options are polycentric in
nature.  The options of those who support a right to murder, by a clear
chain of cause-and-effect logic, proceed to overwhelm world society with
not just sanctions, which soil all those opposed to it, but inevitably
statist taxpayer-funded support for it.  Extropian culture is inherently
polycentric, the culture of death is inherently monocentric.  No compromise
between the two can be made.  Even Texas Rep. Ron Paul, a well-known
libertarian, in this week's "Washington Times" was quoted saying: "The
Libertarian argument, or the principle is, you can't initiate force, you're
not allowed to use violence.  We even sign a pledge.  If you're not allowed
to initiate violence, you're not allowed to kill.  How can you kill a fetus
without initiating violence?"  Duh...

MS: <I would rather have one unhappy person weeping for the child that
could never be in her reality, than to have two unhappy people as the child
grows into a world that it comes to despise because it is not happy.>

Happiness isn't everything, in fact, it's not much at all.  Individuals are
remarkably resilient, the backgrounds of people throughout history show an
amazing ability to make something of their lives regardless of how horrible
their beginnings were, or their formative years.  Let me sum up your
position here as "better dead than sad."  It's ridiculous.

MS: <What is affirming life?  I take this phrase to mean more than
affirming
an individual life.  Life can refer to the general human condition, for
which the extropians and transhumanists stand to improve.>

This is the classic twentieth-century rationalization for Stalinism,
Maoism, etc.  Butchery on a mass scale to improve the general human
condition at the expense of some poor slobs who just were getting in the
way.  Either we have individual rights, not group rights, or we have no
rights at all.

MS: <Reilly, you are the person who wishes to force your beliefs and your
truths upon everyone else.>

No, I am the person who has had other persons force their beliefs on me and
mine, and the society I live in and am trying to raise my children in, is
so much more degraded than the one I grew up in that it shocks me.  A large
part of that decline is due to the way nihilism transformed into concrete
expressions of the culture of death, such as abortion, infanticide and
euthanasia.

MS:  <By saying that others are trying to make you tolerate says that
because you do not tolerate those beliefs, they should not be allowed to
continue.  THAT is forcing beliefs on others.>

No, I am repeatedly saying we should have extropic polycentric solutions,
only the culture of death will not allow them, it's internal logic forces
sanctioned and taxpayer-supported butchery on all jurisdictions by
*necessity*.

MS: <Do you not think that there are already enough unhappy people in the
world?>

Who cares?  Life's tough.  Let them work it out for themselves without
murdering innocents on the way.

MS: <I personally believe that abortion, particularly late-term, should be
avoided at all costs, unless there are dire circumstances, such as the
threat to a woman's life.>

Well, of the 35 million innocent unborn children murdered in the U.S. since
Roe v. Wade, the best estimates are that less than 3% were for
life-of-the-mother, rape or incest.  If only 1 million had been murdered
during this time span, the culture of death's devaluing of life would not
have extended its grip nearly so hard on us.  We would have a lot more
happy citizens on the streets than we do now.  There'd be a lot more
brainpower in our pool. There'd be a lot more women around.

You apparently have strong opinions on this. Could you, from an extropic
point of view, explain when/what/how/why something becomes murder-able?
And why this is relevant in the first place?

Indeed a good one!

Some more variations:

"Transhumanists seek rational means to aqcuire immortality, increased 
intelligence, physical strenght and beauty. They want to explore, and then
go beyond, the boundaries of themselves and the universe".

"Transhumanism is the ongoing empowerment of the individual through
the use of reason and technology".

"Transhumanism is the artificial upgrading of the human species by the
human species".

Ahhh...Michael ....I don't like flame wars, so I will try a last time to
explain you, calmly, friendly, our point of view. Because I suppose that
by "socialist transhumanists" you mean everybody who don't share your
extreme positions. So, please first, stop to imagine there are two
camps, red-commies-stalinian- socialists on one side,
libertarians-individualist-capitalists on the other; you will really
progress in your  analysis. May I remind you that most of the stalinian
crimes were due to the belief there was only two camps: the "nice guys"
and the others, who had to be fighted and eventually killed. If you
really don't like communism, you should stop to adopt their main
characteristics, don't you think ?
So now, let's go to Michael's (Bowling) definition : we should be pissed
of , really ? By saying that, you prove one more time that you didn't
understand most of the arguments of your opponents. Or worse, you didn't
hear. That's sad. So open your ears and listen :
Nobody here is opposed to individual freedom. The socialist
transhumanists (by this term, you certainly want to name the mad guys
who think that the free market defects have to be corrected by a welfare
system) are advocates of individual freedom. that's why we want to be
sure that ANYBODY (sorry for shouting, but the message seems hard to
pass) can decide of his evolution, according to his own desires, and not
be forbidden to succeed because he is born on the wrong side of the
Bronx.
Is this clear enough, or must I capitalize other words?
You can disagree with my opinion; I just want you to understand it and
be fair in your opposition, instead of using low-level (and constant,
and frequently out of topic, as here)  propaganda. The worst thing in
this, (from your own point of view) being that you give a very bad image
of your own camp, therefore forbidding any intelligent discussion on
economical matters on this list. Fortunately, there are more open-minded
libertarians.

Yep, that's me trying to bring about the downfall of the US gov't (it seems

interesting to see that these memes seem to be much widespread in the US.
Any ideas's on how this (cultural?) difference came about?

Or there's a bug that they can't fix because the power systems went out
too, and they can't even run the computers long enough to find it. I don't
expect that to happen, but if there are unexpected bugs that take down
most of the power generation system for weeks then the rest of the economy 
is probably hosed. If there aren't, then we'll probably be OK by 2001.

The question is, how long does the IRS have to go down before all those 
people who've lent trillions of dollars to the Feds decide that they're
uncreditworthy and want their money back? 

Looking at the IRS' past record with computer systems I'd say that a long shutdown is quite probable; not to mention that they'll have to be willing 
to pay market prices when most of the world's COBOL programmers will be 
busy earning a hundred dollars an hour or more with commercial 
organizations.

Based on what I've read, the best solution to the IRS problem would be 
to throw out their current system and write a new one from scratch; but
they tried that a few years ago and failed.

I don't believe much of what Gary North says, but I certainly expect that
Y2K will have a major impact on the US government and others.

______Year 2000 Efforts: Big Problem, Slow Going_______

Two surveys released yesterday give mixed reviews to 
worldwide year 2000 efforts. The results of Cap Gemini's 
ongoing year 2000 survey of 128 companies show corporate 
America finally facing the magnitude of the year 2000 
problem. But Gartner Group's year 2000 survey reveals that a 
sizable number of users and vendors are not taking the year 
2000 problem as seriously as they should.

Since Cap Gemini's last survey, released in December, the 
number of companies with full-fledged year 2000 strategies 
jumped from 20% to 60%, according to the most recent survey. 
The majority of the IT managers polled said they grossly 
underestimated their year 2000 budgets; some said year 2000 
spending will exceed $100 million. Also, 20% of the managers 
said their companies have deferred new IT development to re-
allocate resources for year 2000 work.

On the other hand, one-quarter of the 6,000 companies and 
government agencies surveyed worldwide by Gartner Group have 
yet to start any year 2000 compliance efforts, according to 
survey results released yesterday at the Gartner Group 
Predicts conference in San Diego. Even more startling: Half 
of all survey respondents have no plans to test their year 
2000 efforts after they've completed them.

Lou Marcoccio, a Gartner Group analyst, cited about 200 
legal disputes involving year 2000 issues. He said 93% of 
those disputes involve end users complaining that vendors 
are not adhering to contracts and are going back on earlier 
promises to provide free year 2000 fixes. A year ago, 
Marcoccio adds, only 1% of all vendors charged for year 2000 
fixes; today, 29% charge. The legal actions are not reaching 
the courts, but are being settled privately, according to 
Marcoccio, who says that two settlements were recently 
reached, one for $8.5 million, another for $2.2 million, 
both in favor of the end users.--Hakhi Alakhun El and Bruce Caldwell

Caution: lurking for too long may cause spontaneous eruptions.

Transhumans and Extropians are regular looking humans except for the
light bulbs on top of their heads that have the word IDEA blinking
on-off...on-off.  For them, it is unacceptable to lurk in the deep end
of the meme pool by floating on their back....no they must constantly
tread water recombining meme after meme in an effort to select the
least entropic while staying afloat in the head water so as not to get
electrocuted due to the light bulb on top of their head.

Dynamic logo left as an exercise.

Dismissing the problem without looking at the facts is just as bad as
exaggerating the problem.  Most people use Microsoft products on
Microsoft Windows, so here are a few examples from Microsoft Technical
Support.  Unless you apply these patches as they come out, your Windows
PC will fail in the year 2000:

Windows 95 DATE command rejects years 2000 or later as being "incorrect
date format":
<http://support.microsoft.com/support/downloads/dp3060.asp>
 
Windows 95 File Manager shows incorrect date for year 2000 or later:
<http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q172/7/07.asp>

Windows NT 3.5.1 FTP service displays incorrect date for the year 2000:
<http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q182/5/97.asp>

Windows 3.1 and 3.1.1 File Manager shows garbled date for years 2000 or
later:
<http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q85/5/57.asp>

Microsoft Access defaults years '00-'29 to year 2000 instead of correct
year:
<http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q155/6/69.asp>

Microsoft Access 97 will incorrectly interpret ALL dates converted from
Access 7.0 due to Year2000 compliance enhancements:
<http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q160/5/03.asp>

Microsoft Excel interprets two-digit dates differently on different
versions:

Microsoft PowerPoint translates two-digit dates incorrectly after the
year 2000:

Another issue that hasn't been mentioned here is what do you do when you
don't have the source code? Several of the companies I've worked for have
sold custom systems to big corporations, and later -- AFAIK -- gone bust. I
don't think there was any kind of arrangement to escrow sources, as we have
sometimes done in other cases.

Now I think those systems are perfectly Y2K compliant (though probably 
not Y2038), but there must be many other organizations who rely on this 
kind of software. It's one thing to say 'well, these organisations will 
fix their code before Y2K', but how can they do it if they don't have the
code to fix? The only solution is to try to hold it together until they 
can create a new system from scratch; odds are there are only a few lines
to fix, but without the source code you're stuck.

Worse are the 'smart' embedded controllers, which will shut down equipment
if it hasn't been serviced regularly. If they're not Y2K compliant then on
Jan 1st they see it hasn't been serviced for a century and that's that. In
this case you may be able to reset the date as a temporary solution, but if
not, and the manufacturer isn't proactive about upgrading, you may be waiting
days for a software fix. This seems to be a particular problem with medical
equipment, presumably for liability reasons.

The definition of Utopia is a perfect political and social system. 
Lets say a utopian world is impossible, for this to be true I need to
satisfy the following things:

The effectiveness of political and social systems will decrease over
time.

Or

The effectiveness of political and social systems will stay exactly
the same.

My problem is, Im having difficulty remembering a period of time that
has offered a more effective political and social system than we have
now.

Presuming that effective means to satisfy all our needs, not just
those of the ruling elite or the system itself.

Is the political and social system we have now better than past
systems?  And if so, would it be safe to say they will continue to get
better?  Will there ever be a time when these systems are considered
perfect?

Like most individuals, I don't know enough about programming to accurately
assess the claims of the doomsayers or the naysayers on this issue.  As
alluded to by others in earlier posts, I suspect that we may be facing a
self-fulfilling prophecy process here.  The public will become so worried
about a crash that they will cause the crash.  The following may happen:
The Dow will probably continue to rise, with a few minor corrections. By the
year 2000 it may be at 12,000 or higher.  But the higher it goes, the more
skittish and vigilant investors will become for a sign that a crash is
around the corner.  The media, seeing it as a huge story,  will gradually
create more and more uncertainty about how big a problem the Y2K bug will
be.  Uncertainty keeps the viewers tuned in for more information.
Eventually, it will become obvious to investors that they would be fools to
risk the substantial profits they've made on their investments on some
computer glitch.  With so much riding on it, the only sensible thing to do
would be to "get liquid" just long enough to be sure that nothing really bad
is going to happen.  After the danger (and the huge profit-taking) is over
(Jan 2?), investors will rush back in to grab all the under-priced stocks.
Fortunes will definitely be made and lost...unless the doomsayers are right,
in which case fortunes will only be lost.  I would like to hear some more
discussion about how we can all get rich off of this.

How can CNET be that sloppy with their research?  They specifically
mention the "myth" that VCRs and coffee-makers won't work after the year
2000.  Then they dismiss this by claiming that home appliances don't
care what year it is.

This is false for some brands.  My VCR is set to record daily programs
Monday through Friday.  When I try to put in the year "00" (it only
allows two spaces), it says year 1900 and then records the wrong
programs on the wrong day of the week.  I cannot program dates past the
year 2000.  I cannot use day-of-the-week codes.

 My coffee maker is also set to make coffee automatically Monday through
Friday.  I haven't tested it, but if it misinterprets the year, it will
be making coffee on the weekends and skipping coffee two week days a
week.

What bothers me is that CNET didn't say most of these devices will
correctly calculate the year and will function correctly. CNET said that
these devices don't care what the year is.  This is demonstrably false. 
I must question whether they really researched VCR's and Coffeemakers to
see how they would function when the dates were set ahead.  Their
explanation for why it doesn't matter is obviously false.

The very fact that they asked different "experts" instead of simply
programming a VCR or coffeemaker to see for themselves shows the lack of
real research going into this article.  People interested in this and
other computer bugs should read the "comp.risks" newsgroup.  It is full
of technical explanation for how computers fail.  Computers fail much
more easily than people think.  In most cases, it is false human
expectations about the computer that causes the problem.  If this stuff
interests you, or you want to hear from people who really research
computer bugs, definitely read "comp.risks"!

The socialists transhumanists make a mistake when they try to label
libertarians as selfish meanies who want to keep the have-nots in the
ghetto. They are also polarizing the argument by doing so. Take your own
advice.

Libertarians beleive that every person should have equality of opportunity.
They steadfastly oppose that people should be guarranteed equality of
results. Socialists do, and that is the main point of contention which you
refuse to acknowledge. Take your own advice.

I am known to be very open minded, however, any individual person only has
to learn about socialism once to decide that is it utter foolishness or not,
which tends to say somethig about their intelligence. I have yet to meet a
committed socialist that has an open mind.

Mr Bowling's excellent statement never once mentioned anything about the
state. Only about the individual. Socialists know that their fondest dreams
require guns to people's heads by government goons to make reality. Those
that don't are either liars or fools.

The workaround, AFAIR, is to reset the year to 1972, if that's possible.
This little piece of information should be much more widely distributed
as a temporary quick fix to get people going again when they hit these
problems (dates in 1972 are on the same days of the week as 2000).

Otherwise I agree that journalists don't seem to know what they're talking
about (e.g. the CNET claims that people are saying that planes will fall
out of the sky, rather than that the air traffic control systems will be
hosed). I noticed a few other problems with that article, and an amusing 
quote talking about electrical distribution shutting down if it overloads; 
as though automatic shutdown is an advantage, not part of the problem.

BTW, to respond to someone else's comments about panic-induced crashes,
it's really a prisoner's dilemna; it no-one panics we should all win, if
the others panic and you don't, you probably lose.

(I have a four day break starting in a few minutes, so don't expect any 
more replies 'til Tuesday).

Predisposed? Inevitably? To quote J. de Lyser (and I think he has a point):

	The whole point of transhumanist movements is to do away with
	deterministic thinking. There is no 'grand scheme of things'
	into which each individual has her/his 'place' or 'task' to

Excellent work-around for situations where the year really doesn't
matter!

      Well, if you really want to get rich off of this you should start your own company 
      to fix Y2K bugs, and then hire the doomsayers to spread panic. :-) Just 
      make sure you make all your customers sign disclaimers so they can't sue you. :-)

     But seriously ...

"The time to buy is when the blood is running in the streets." --Lord Rothschild

A few people made a lot of money by buying stocks and commodities at rock 
bottom prices after the crash of '29. J. Paul Getty the oil magnate as one of them.
It took several years for the prices to recover then. How long it will take this time 
(if an economic crash occurs - I'm not so sure one will) will depend largely on how
badly the physical infrastructure and financial markets are disrupted by the Y2K 
bug. I for one plan on keeping an eye out for good bargain investments. :-)

As a programmer, I would say the Y2K bug is not that big a technical problem to
fix individually. The problem arises when you have millions of them and you don't 
even know where all of them are. IMHO, the biggest problems are complacency
in fixing the problem, and panic over exagerating the problem. As is frequently the
case, the "reality" of the situation lies somewhere between the two perceived
extremes. 

FYI - One Cap Gemini report I read stated that 40% of companies have already 
experienced "some" Y2K failure. Nothing too bad has happened yet. Although
based on the past record of the bureau-rats, I am highly doubtful that they will 
fix all of their systems. Based upon one C-Net article I read about the readiness
of "government" systems, I would say that a 40-50% failure rate of "government" 
computers would be realisitc. I expect the "private sector" to fair much better.

Which political and social system? The US? Cambodia? Iraq? Germany? Sweden? Japan? Russia? Which past systems? Monarchies, dictatorships, democracies? Communism, capitalism? They all differ strongly, if you want an empirical and no philosophical answer to your question, please be more precise.

Yak, I fear that you are about to be blasted for heresy. Many of our
fellow participants seem to spend a great deal of time complaining
about how bad thing are. I personally agree with you that the current
system in the U.S. and in the world as a whole is better than it has
ever been  and is steadily improving in most ways. It's
still far from perfect, and I even agree that some of the problems
addressed by our fellows are real and need attention. However,
the current system is IMO very likely to sustain itself and us for
long enough for us to achieve technological breakthroughs that
will render the system irrelevant. (i.e., the "singularity".) If this
is the case, The system is good enough to achieve iits last
purpose, and it's a waste of time to mess with it except perhaps
for minor fixes. Radical modifications tend to have big up-front
costs with fairly long-term payback. I feel we should spend
our time on attempting to advance the technological breakthrough.

Looks like its time for me to jump in.

After many months of y2k research and thought, I loudly and arrogantly
proclaim myself uniquely qualified among extropians to mouth off re y2k.
Sort of.

First off, if you follow the url about Gary North, Hal Finney recently
posted, you'll find that he does NOT believe in an impending second
coming or revelations predicted apocalypse. In fact, he chides
christians who rather than attempting to solve social problems, just
ignore them and say that jesus is coming. While I am wary of the
religiosity of sources, his brand of christianity is much less annoying
to me than the millenialists who he is accused of belonging to. One
poster accused North of outright fabrication on his web site. If you
check it out, you'll see that the heart of his site is LINKS to other
sources, many of them with very different views than his, plus editorial
comment on the sources. I would like to see one specific lie brought to
light as an example.

Another concern was the nature of the posters on certain y2k forums. Try
comp.software.year-2000. A large number of very experienced mainframe
and other programmers, many working on y2k issues, post there.
Admittedly, you also get Paul Milne, a non programmer who paints some of
the scariest post y2k scenarios, and is annoyingly christian (though
again, not of the millenialist variety). 

And Hal also took a cheap shot at Ed Yourdon. Check out his
bio(somewhere on www.yourdon.com) and you'll see he has quite the
reputation to risk. Is he supposed to work for free? For a view from
someone with a great deal of credibility in the markets and finance, who
also has y's r's d's and an n in his name, check out Ed Yardeni's y2k
links on his site www.yardeni.com. He is the chief economist of nyc
investment firm Deutsche Morgan Greunfell.

Read the links at garynorth.com regarding the IRS, and you'll see that
they're not even in the ballpark for having any kind of meaningful fix
in time.

And the fed printing up lots of cash to keep the banks from having to
close, will only work till 01/03/2000 at best.

Can someone please find an example of one fortune 2000 company that is
even claiming to be fixed. Or one government above the county level.
Tenessee is 70-80 percent done, but they started before almost every
state - around 1990, I think, and most are still not actually fixing
code. How about one major utility or telco? How bout any organization
with over 20 million lines of code to fix.

The electric utility industry looks to be screwed. Check out what Rick
Cowles, the head of Digital's y2k utilities section, has to say at
www.euy2k.com

And let's not forget the y2k errors found in nuclear weapons, admitted
to recently by Clinton's newly appointed y2k czar, John Koskinen. He
said something to the effect that while there is a small chance that
they may actually accidentaly fire, they are more likely to fail safe.
But even that destabilizes the balance of terror. Now, the world's
nuclear powers have to wonder whether theirs and others' missiles now
have a "best if used by date" on them of 01/01/2000.

About resetting clocks to 1972, that is a clever fix for a very small
number of systems. Most embeddeds have no way for the user to change the
date, and dos/windows machines can't handle dates before 1980.

Interesting assertion: One third of business software source code is
missing

Interesting assertion 2: The embedded situation may be twice the size of
the mainframe y2k problem, but awareness and planning is about where it
was for mainframes 2 years ago.

That's enough for now.

No, because we can say that the customers and the business constructed the  
market -- but nobody of them can control the market. The market rules are
result of all autonomous decisions of individuals inside this market. This  
is a kind of social anarchy like the social order among accidental humans  
on the street controlled only by prohability calculus.

You cannot "vote" with your money. You can only make a decision what you  
buy and what you don't buy. The prohability calculus proved that there are  
a prohability that other customers make a decision in your way -- but you  
cannot know or prove this if you are really part of a mayority. Every mar-  
ket investigation based on 10 000 or 2 000 humans in each survey and the  
speculation that this humans represent market trends. But anybody can know  
if this is really true.

If you discuss about this you have to be avare about the paradoxy of every  
election or market survey.

Theoretically, yes. But the customers didn't control the firms direct and  
cannot make a real decision to sabotage this firm and strengthen an other  
(what voters can!) because they don't know each others and havn't no means  
to get a avareness about there mayority. And on the other hand can every  
firm only make offers but cannot be in the real rule of a center. This is  
the story of success of MLM because here the firm is a real center and can  
act as a center because this firm know his customers and can guide and  
control parts of their custom behaviour to sell the produkts.

Smaller than governments, ey? For example, the danish government rule  
about 5,8 Million inhabitants. The firm AOL/Compuserve "rule" about 15  
Million customers/net-user in the hole world. Who is larger?

No, Wax, the only diffrent is: Firms wants to "rule" just about parts of  
the behaviour of customers -- but governments wants to rule about the hole  
behaviour of all inhabitants.

If there is "new land" you can move away legal or just illegal.

Yes, thats true in our time. But there are people in this world who work  
to make this split legal....

Think a little about your American history and "the West" and the  
diffrents between the settlements on the "new land".... And be avare about  
the fact that this splitting of communities was an acepted rule in indian  
societies for several hundred years.

Than all decisions are illegal because the groups have to acept voluntary  
the decisions of all delegates. If one or more groups cannot acepted the  
consensus among their delegates because one or more delegates have misre- 
presented their group(s) than the delegates have to meet again to come to  
another consensus.

Anarcho-Syndicalist Unions like the CNT, the SAC and FAU work with this  
democratic principle(s).

You speak about the USA, isn't it? I'm working here in Europe in a federa- 
tion of anarchistic groups of all kinds of anarchistic trends and we  
making decisions with the consensus principle since 10 years. And I'm  
working on a-infos internet project too making most decisions with the  
consensus principle too.

Okay, but I think there is a diffrent between a contract and a consensus  
decision. A consensus decision ends if the participant in this consensus  
cannot longer agree with this consensus. But a contract is a peace of pa- 
per who can force you to agree with yourself and your old decision if you  
have mutual agreed in a time sequence where you are obligated by the  
contract.

I see, you havn't had thought about it. I havn't told from competetion. I  
have asked if you noticed the inner structure of industrial companies to  
make decisions and not their relationship to buyers/customers.

See above. Therefore this statement is wrong. Workers and their managment  
inside the industrial world are forced to co-operate: the managment have  
to co-operate with their workers because they cannot produce without wor-  
kers and the workers have to co-operate with the managment, because they  
need their wages to survive and therefore they have to acept that the ma-  
nagment have command of their work.

The structure of the military is as well hirarchically as the structure of  
the industry. Both have structures where competence and responsibility are  
split from the top to the bottom; the people on the top make the decisions  
and have a high responsibillity whereas the people at the bottom carry out  
orders with a low responsibillity; only the managment -- the industrial ge- 
neral staff -- could change the production and the structure of the firm  
and have command of this structure of working.

Because workers and human beings like Bill Gates or Rockefeller are *not*  
on the same level. Rich people have enough money to build up a firm; there- 
fore for them are to work for wage or to work for their own firms a real  
alternativ; but if you have to work for wage and must spend most of your  
wage for your survive you are not able to earn enough money to build up  
your own firm. Therefore you are forces to earn wage your hole life.

Every costs of interests of all firms who produce, transport or sell a  
product are part of the price of this product. Every buyer of a product  
have to pay the price -- and all costs of interests inside. Rich people  
could invest there money and could earn this costs of interests back which  
they have to pay inside the prices -- or they earn more. But poor people  
who cann't invest their money because they need this money to survive can-  
not earn cost of interests back. Therefore they are not on the same level  
with the firm- and capital-owners. And therefore they cannot co-operate  
voluntary on the same level.

If you really think you're right: pick ten of the most likely candidates
for Y2K problems. On Dec. 31, 1999, borrow as many shares of each
company's stock as your broker will let you. Sell them immediately. By
the end of the day January 2, 2000, you can buy the stocks back for a
fraction of the purchase price. Give them back to your broker. You keep
the difference. 

Of course, with all the hubbub, Y2K is the perfect squeeze play
scenario. Lots of people I know are eyeing 2K as the time to sell short.
The risk is when a stock that is heavily shorted actually drops only a
tiny bit. If it looks like it's going to stay, short sellers will
scramble to buy, driving the price up. The loss comes when you buy too
late.   

Does anyone know if you can sell short on US Govt securities?

I hate to throw a wrench into the controversy, but most big computer
centers, like Internet providers, have backup generators that automatically
cut in when the mains go down. The phone company has both huge banks of
batteries and backup generators. Many highrise buildings today have enough
cogeneration capacity to allow at least emergency lighting and ventilation
to continue during blackouts. There will undoubtedly be data losses, but not
wholescale devastation.

If a major processor 'died' because of Y2K, the operators simply need to
reboot it and reset the date to
a safe year until they can remedy the problem.

Generating stations always have backup power on site - especially nuclear
plants, where the backup must be adequate to operate the plants' safety
systems in the event the reactors are scrammed. If the worst happened, they
could always run the computers from rented generators.

Having been around Europe and North America a bit, and this before the
Berlin Wall fell, I think the present American system is just about the best
there is today. Not by any means perfect, but preferable to almost any other
system I have personal knowledge of.

Other forms of government in the past may have come closer, such as the
Greeks of Plato and Socrates. Even these govenments were plagued by power
struggles nad politics, not to mention 'PC' thought.

There are attributes in other countries that I admire, and wish that the US
would incorporate. There are many things (IRS!) that I consider
reprehnsible, and wish the US would reform or eliminate.

Our system has the potential to become either a police state or as close to
a Utopia as the Earth has ever seen. It all depends on our 'leaders' and how
they run things.

If the present 'war' on drugs continues, for instance, I see the police
state, with manditory drug tests on every corner, and though police in every
private home to make sure 'drugs' are not being discussed in other than
derogatory terms. 

Should Libertarian ideas gain a foothold in Congress, and inroads made into
repealing victimless crime laws, the opposite could be the future.

I feel this is a powerful reason to vote at every chance I get, and write
lots of letters to the editor. Perhaps I will do little to change the
system, but if I don't at least try, I have no one to blame but myself when
the storm troopers knock down my front door..

As far as a perfect government ever existing, this will have to wait for
perfect humans to run it, or an AI with godlike powers and intellect that
somehow still cares to be our servant, to be put in charge..

I for one would rather wait for the perfect human...

A rule of thumb here. If the device in question responds to leap years, you
probably should be concerned. If there is a way to enter date information,
ditto. Most appliances with clocks don't even have date capability.

I program oven controls used in major brands, among other things, and most
of these gadgets are barely good enough to keep up with 24 straight hours,
let alone years. Unless there's a good reason for a date function, such as
in a VCR, there probably won't be trouble.

They probably talked to someone like me and were told similar to what I just
related, them clipped the explanation down to 'sound bite' size. Most news
reporters are trained to write to the lowest common denominator of the
audience. This is somewhere around third grade level.

These same 'experts' are the ones now peddling Y2K snake oil on the
Internet. Some will get rich...

The mindset most people seem to have about computers is that they have much
more 'intellect' than they actually do. In the case of MS Windows, I have to
agree - and it's an EVIL intellect..

As a reader of the list and not a poster,  one area of my expertise has
come up on this question. I can assure you beyond any reasonable doubt,
nuclear power plants are the least computerized technology you can imagine.
 The technology is so old now (but simple and reliable) that the
combination of a 10 yr lead time and no new orders since 1976 means we
operate huge (and I mean closet sized) 8k turbine control systems and thats
about it. Any new computer system that exist are simply nice to have, not
need to have. The exception may be the government required simulators, most
use SGI systems,  but again that is a nice to have, not a need to have
item.

If true then can you give me a reason, any reason at all, why morality is  
better than immorality?  And what does "better" mean anyway?


        >Why would suffering or pleasure matter much at all 
                  

Perhaps leaving my hand in a fire or pulling it out doesn't matter much at 
all, I don't know and I don't care, I'm still pulling my hand out and if  
morality doesn't like it morality can lump it.

All physiological reactions without exception can be modulated by 
technological means. What does that have to do with the price of eggs?


        >They just don't mean much in the moral sphere 


In my mind you just torpedoed any attempt to take the moral high ground in 
the abortion debate, you were never anywhere near it in the euthanasia debate. 
If your ideas about morality are correct then I'm immoral and proud of it and 
your insults are badges of honor.

Your philosophy is cutting edge, cutting edge for the 13'th century that is,

        >Happiness isn't everything, in fact, it's not much at all.  


Gee, you make your philosophy sound so appealing I don't see how anyone could 
resist it.


        >Is the statement "all things are relative" a true statement?  


No. The speed of light is absolute, it's the same for any observer.

And you've also rejected Quantum Mechanics, I think that's part of your  
credibility problem.  After dumping on the two greatest intellectual 
accomplishments of the century it's hard to get people to sit contentedly at 
your feet while you scream insults cry about modern times and preach morality 
to them, the promise to make them stupid and unhappy may not be enough of an

Though I appreciate you responding to it, I'm not sure my definition is as
heretical as you suggest.  "Predisposed" and "Destined" do not happen to be
synonyms.  I'm not saying there's a grand plan.  Hell, the fact that a
sentient life form even evolved on this planet is an amazing and glorious
accident.  But, it does appear that we have a hierarchy or needs and when
the baser one are met, we "tend" to seek to meet higher order needs and this
appears to be a trans-cultural phenomenon.  I think it's what truly sets us
apart from the other life forms on the planet.  We're just not satisfied
with homeostatic routines.  In a way, we embody the very forces of evolution
that brought us here on both an individual and a societal level.

Banks Unite For Global Year 2000 Efforts
(04/09/98; 1:36 p.m. EST)
By Hakhi Alakhun El, InformationWeek  
 
A group of major banking institutions announced Wednesday an initiative to
keep the year 2000 problem from severely impacting world financial markets.
The group, which includes Citicorp, Barclay's Bank, Deutsche Bank, Bank of
Tokyo, and Hong Kong Bank, said it is planning to organize common year 2000
guidelines to be shared throughout the industry by managers and regulators.

In a statement, the organization, called the Global 2000 Coordinating
Group, said it plans to compile the year 2000 status of countries, cities,
and businesses. It will also examine cash-payment systems, securities
clearance and custody systems, stocks, bond futures, commodity exchanges,
foreign currency exchanges, and derivative trading.

In addition, the group will look at the readiness of organizations and
industries that are linked to the economic infrastructure such as utilities
(electricity, water, and telecommunications companies) and transportation
industries.

I read www.garynorth.com regularly.  It is a good source of information,
but you have to take it with a grain of salt, realize that he is filtering
the data and may be presenting it in misleading ways.  Someone pointed
for example to http://www.garynorth.com/y2k/detail_.cfm/1260, which
North characterizes as a banker testifying about the threat caused by
the collapse of the telecommunications system.  If you follow the link
to the original talk at http://www.house.gov/banking/2598acb.htm you
will see that North provided an out of context quote which was inserted
as a caveat in a talk which otherwise discussed positive efforts to
address Y2K problems.  The speaker has no particular knowledge about
telecommunications (he is addressing banking issues) and was simply
pointing out that the banks were relying on the phone system continuing
to work.  If all you did was read North's synopsis you would have
come away with a false impression of the thrust of the talk.  So it's
important to follow the pointers and not just read North's excerpts,
and also to realize that North is going to focus on bad news.

This is a much more balanced forum than North's and Yourdon's BBS's.  You
will find many experienced engineers who can put the problems into
perspective.

Yourdon is selling his book and his Y2K consulting services.  He has a
financial interest in making the problem look bad.  No one is going to
buy the book and consulting if he tells them that Y2K probably isn't
going to be much of an issue.  You have to keep this kind of thing in
mind when you read his stuff.  Also take a look at
http://www.albany.net/~dmills/fallback/fintro.htm (follow the links at
the bottom) where a power engineer criticizes some of the claims made
in the Yourdons' book.

Yardeni predicts that we could see a serious recession due to the
Y2K problem.  I agree that this is a real danger, as I posted before.
My main beef is with the apocalyptics like North who see it as the end
of Western civilization.

Many organizations will have problems.  But just because an organization
can't certify that it is Y2K compliant doesn't mean that it is going
to fail.  The first order of business is to identify mission critical
components and work on fixing them.  Then you go on to less critical
items.  When the millennium comes, if some things fail you may have to
do some workarounds, but things can keep going.

Cowles is selling a Y2K book from his site.  He is making money off the
problem.  That gives him a potential bias.  Read the link I provided
above for information about how the power grid is designed to keep
working in the face of failures.  Also see the posting here by someone
knowledgable about nuclear plants debunking the fear of Y2K errors
putting them off line.

I'm not a nuclear expert, but I believe these weapons are loaded with
fail safes and are not in a position to go off accidentally.

It's relatively easy to identify embedded systems that could have date
vulnerabilities.  They generally require some mechanism to reset the
date in the event that power is lost (since any clock requires power).
So there is little chance that embedded systems will surprise people by
turning out unexpectedly to have Y2K problems.

There are date sensitive embedded systems in some specific applications,
and testing and fixing those is going to be a big job.  But I've seen
simplistic figures suggesting that 5% of all embedded systems have Y2K
vulnerabilities, and there doesn't seem to be much evidence for this.
Not much is known yet about the scope of the embedded system problem,
but more information is coming out this year as testing continues.

My employer, as part of its Y2K fix process, is evaluating each 
system for "what are the consequences if it fails?".  In response to 
this determination, we have already shut down two systems: they were 
of so little use that it wasn't worth continuing to run them until 
Y2K, let alone to test them for Y2K problems or fix them.

The majority votes that oysters are not food.  The majority votes 
that curry is not food.  The majority votes that lutefisk is not food 
(and if you've ever smelled it, you understand why).

But both oysters and curry are available at any of the four 
supermarkets closest to my home, in the food aisles.  And I know what 
part of town to go to if I wanted to buy some lutefisk -- and it's 
sold as a food.

Please identify a plausible y2k-related bug in a computer used in 
power-grid management, which could not be worked around acceptably by 
(a) disabling the process that sets the date & time to match some 
central clock, and then (b) telling the computer it's Jan 1 1980.  
(Recall that perfection is not required.)

As for the power to bring it up, I'll guarantee that a UPS doesn't 
really care what date it is, and the large majority of 
system-critical computers can run for at least 20 minutes off their 
UPSes.  (The network I used to administer, has doubled the number of 
servers since the last time they upgraded the UPS.  So today the UPS 
can only power all servers for 35 minutes.)  If that isn't enough, 
they'll shut down the servers running financial and office 
applications, and drag those UPSes over.

Um... there is something you don't understand about federal debt.

It's BONDS.

Redeemable at a specified time and NOT BEFORE no matter how badly the 
person wants to redeem them.

There are only two categories of bonds that are in any sense 
exceptions to this:

(1) US Savings Bonds, which are an insignificant fraction of the 
federal debt, and are 5- or 10-year bonds redeemable 6 months after 
issue; and

(2) the special category of bonds that constitute federally-held 
trust funds, and are redeemable upon demand -- if Congress and the 
Treasury find it convenient to redeem them at that time.  And the 
Social Security Administration won't demand redemption for such a 
trivial reason as the government being generally regarded as 
bankrupt.

The shortest-term federal bonds have a term of, if I recall 
correctly, 90 days.  So the average outstanding bond of the shortest 
term would be redeemable in 45 days.  But IRS income is normally 
extremely cyclical, and there is probably little money coming in in 
the first 10 days of January anyway: bonds redeemable in that period 
are redeemed from funds left over from before, or funds raised by 
selling new bonds.  So you're looking at a bare minimum of 10 days, 
and probably more than 30, before the IRS's problems actually have a 
real impact.

Can that be gotten around?  Sure.  Take photocopies of the checks and 
then go deposit the checks.  When the computers are fixed, then 
process the photocopies as if they were checks.

Title
  Sesamin (a compound from sesame oil) increases tocopherol
  levels in rats fed ad libitum.
Source
  Lipids.  30(6):499-505, 1995 Jun.
Abstract
  Six groups of rats were fed diets low, but adequate, in alpha-tocopherol but
  high in gamma-tocopherol. The six diets differed only in their contents (0,
  0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 g/kg, respectively) of sesamin, a lignan from
  sesame oil. After four weeks of ad libitum feeding, the rats
  were sacrificed and the concentrations of alpha- and gamma-tocopherols were
  measured in the plasma, livers, and lungs. Sesamin-feeding increased
  gamma-tocopherol and gamma-/alpha-tocopherol ratios in the plasma (P < 0.05),
  liver (P < 0.001), and lungs (P < 0.001). The increase was non-significant
  for alpha-tocopherol. Thus, sesamin appears to spare gamma-tocopherol in rat
  plasma and tissues, and this effect persists in the presence of
  alpha-tocopherol, a known competitor to gamma-tocopherol. This suggests that
  the bioavailability of gamma-tocopherol is enhanced in phenol-containing
  diets as compared with purified diets.

Title
  Antihypertensive effect of sesamin. II. Protection against two-kidney,
  one-clip renal hypertension and cardiovascular hypertrophy.
Source
  Biological & Pharmaceutical Bulletin.  18(9):1283-5, 1995 Sep.
Abstract
  We investigated the antihypertensive effect of sesamin, a lignan from
  sesame oil, using two-kidney, one-clip
  (2K,1C) renal hypertensive rats. After clipping the left renal artery,
  animals were assigned to either a normal diet group (control group) or a
  sesamin-containing (1% (w/w)) diet group (sesamin group). The sham-operated
  rats (sham group) were fed a normal diet and tap water. The systolic blood
  pressure of the control group increased progressively in comparison with the
  sham group. This 2K,1C-induced hypertension was markedly reduced by feeding
  the sesamin-containing diet. The systolic blood pressure after 4 weeks was
  123.60 +/- 4.01 mmHg in the sham group, 187.43 +/- 5.69 mmHg in the control
  group and 145.57 +/- 6.78 mmHg in the sesamin group, respectively. There were
  significant increases in left ventricle plus septum weight-body weight ratio
  in the control group compared with the sham group. This rise was also
  significantly reduced in the sesamin group. When the thoracic aorta was
  histochemically evaluated, the wall thickness and wall-to-lumen ratio in the
  control group were significantly increased, compared with the sham group,
  indicating that vascular hypertrophy had occurred in the control group. The
  sesamin diet tended to ameliorate this vascular hypertrophy, although its
  effect was not statistically significant. These findings suggest that sesamin
  is useful as prophylactic treatment to combat the development of renal
  hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy.

I have thought about such problem several months ago. To combat the more
mindless address harvesters, trivially mangling addresses (or even
stripping the archives from them altogether) would seem enough. The more
advanced solution would seem to allocate (informative) list-locally unique
handles (like, say, your name) to each participant. This can be done
either automatically, or interactively via a web form. The listserv would
then substitute your real addresses with the abovementioned handles. There
should be no user accessible mechanism to query for real physical mailing
list addresses -- this will make list spamming by mail header forging
pretty difficult. It can get arbitrarily involved here, with groups,
crypto, and whatnot but I realise this to be completely unrealistic as no
one will ever code it.

Btw: here's a suggestion to make proposed extropy-moderated more
palatable. If there is a extropy-rejected list (called entropy?), which
receives all the rejected mail but spam, subbing to both lists will make
you get the whole picture. On the high end I would contemplate adding an
inner circle with good S/N ratio, similiarly to the service Damien
Sullivan is offering, only bidirectional. 

As for distributed moderation (we could make a vote whether the
self-designed moderator group is acceptable) we could borrow the scheme
from the Internet Oracle (instead of askme's authenticated check-in and
check-out, of course). 

Please comment.

I've also done a bit of traveling, including to China not long after the fall
of the "Gang of Four", Nicaragua just at the end of the Sandanista period and
Mexico over a few decades, as well as places with more attractive civil
societies, such as England and Costa Rica (and even Canada) . . . and I have
to echo Chuck's comment.  

There seem to be two elements to one's feelings about where we are on the
continuum of progress: One is a study of history and the other is one's
personal inclination to optimism or pessimism.  It's hard to separate the two,
but at the extremes one can perhaps be more certain.  Only a fool would have
been optimistic living in Weimar Germany in the late 1920s, but I find that it
is hard to be pessimistic for long living in the United States in the late
1990s.  At this moment in history, the U.S. is experiencing perhaps
unprecedented economic prosperity and opportunity for just about anyone
willing to participate, even the very statist mainstream political parties
make at least public statements in favor of less centralized government and
there seems to me to be as much experimentation in social institutions as
there ever has been.  

Of course, there are constant struggles in the cause of liberty: Essentially
all institutions and public figures endorse at least some state control over
intimate private activities such as drugs and sex and accept without question
that individuals should be forced to pay for "public goods" of dubious
goodness.  Some of these threats are aimed at core values of liberty, and
there can be no doubt that the mainstream conception of the proper reach of
state power is greater than it was during the zenith of classical liberal
thought in the Anglo-American world from the late 18th to the late 19th
century.

But all over the world, far beyond the borders of the States, I see causes for
hope: The communist nightmare has passed as the bad dream that it was, only a
lingering memory in Cuba and North Korea, and not long to haunt people there;
there isn't a single real military dictatorship in Latin America I can think
of; a black man is the president of South Africa and elsewhere on that
continent civil society is at least becoming aware of the tribalistic passions
that have wracked it for centuries; and in Asia people are perhaps at last
facing the consequences of carrying too much of Confucianism forward into a
capitalist world order.

True, there are deeply troubling problems in the world.  The worst is probably
the swath of the planet from the Balkans to Sri Lanka dominated by
fundamentalism and primitive religious bigotry; where the concept of civil
society has only a tenuous hold over the human condition.  Here in America,
seemingly growing numbers of baby boomers are turning to traditional religious
institutions or "new age" pseudo science in reaction to realization of their
own mortality.  Throughout the "developed world" the mainstream supports
legislative restriction on at least some promising biotechnology.

But in much of the world the material conditions of even average people is
superior to that of  kings of old and, despite a few luddite laws here and
there, economic pressures compel an accelerating feedback of research and
development of key transhumanist technologies.  It seems increasingly
improbable to me that fundamentalists could stop that trend before we reach
some sort of critical point in our ability to use technology to transcend
traditional human limits.  Regardless of what spokesmen for the mainstream may
SAY, in fact the best and the brightest are working around the clock to put
the tools of transcendence in our hands.

Sure I'd like things to happen faster and for life to be more free.  And we
should all do what we can to make it so.  But in the meantime I, at least,
feel that this is a time for optimism and pride.

The most famous example is Jesse Livermore, by far the most successful stock 
speculator of the 20's. He was born poor but starting with nothing made 
30 million dollars by the end of the decade, a lot of money back then.  
In 1929 he saw trouble coming and brilliantly sold off all his stocks a month 
before the crash. Two weeks after the crash he thought stocks were absurdly
cheap and so got back into the market. He did well in 1930, but then the 
market crashed again in 1931 to the lowest levels ever, Livermore lost 
everything and was forced to declare bankruptcy. A few days later he put on 
his best suit sat down on desk and wrote "MY LIFE HAS BEEN A FAILURE" several 
hundred times in a notebook, then he put a gun to his head and pulled the 
trigger.

I invest in the stock market myself and so far it's been good to me, but 
sometimes I think of poor Jesse.

I wonder if this is true in general? While it is a common phenomenon,
it seems that there are so many possible higher order goals we can set
up that it is not clear that the goals involving getting mental and
physical tools for further self-actualization will be the most common,
let alone dominant. There are plenty of people who begin to strive
after what appears to be dead-end goals which prevent further growth,
such as a constant passive mystical state. But I think you have a
point in that a large fraction of people would, if all their basic
needs were met, likely start developing.

We are in some sense underdefined, we can consciously set up our own
goals and act on them, and this undermines homeostatic
routines. Fortunately.

For some reason, this makes me think of something I read once...

 "The optimist thinks this is the best of all possible worlds;

 The pessimist is afraid he may be right."

(Of course, pretty much everyone here, even the most optimistic, does 
NOT think this is the best of all possible worlds -- just on the 
right track to BECOME that.)

MOVING FORWARD INTO THE PAST.  Many novelists and not
a few scientists have pondered the possibility of returning to a point
in one's past.  In principle physics does allow time travel via closed
timelike curves (CTCs).  Along such a warped spacetime trajectory
the traveler is always moving into the future (locally) but eventually
finds himself back where he started from.  (Think of sailing around
the world; heading west you return from the east.)   J. Richard Gott
and Li-Xin Li at Princeton have speculated on whether spacetime
could both allow travel into the past and insure a consistent
chronology (the traveler must remember shaking hands with his
older self as he sets off). They have determined that in part of space
no time travel would be allowable, but in another part (separated
from the first by a surface called a Cauchy horizon) a time machine
could be built, subject to this restraint: if you build a time machine
in the year 3000, you might be able to use it to go from 3002 to the
year 3000, but not back to the year 1998 because that would have
been before the machine was built.  Of course even this limited sort
of time travel would be very difficult because you would need a lot
spacetime warp for it to work, and this could only be provided
through the agency of a black hole or a decaying cosmic string
loop.  For example, to move even one microsecond back into the
past would require the presence of a space-warping mass equal to
one tenth the mass of the sun! And then there's no guarantee the
black hole wouldn't swallow you and the space around you.  Then,
as Gott says, you'd be able to circle around and meet your earlier
self, but you wouldn't be able to escape to boast about it.  (Physical
Review Letters, 6 April; as usual journalists can obtain a copy by
contacting AIP Public Information.)

That's pretty much what I suggested a year ago; and it requires no
consent of anyone--just a server and a moderator (I have the former;
the latter will require someone with more copious free time).  Even
without free time, I would have done this by now if ExI hadn't kept
promising to fix the situation for the last two years--I always
feared that by the time I got the system working, they'd drop in
their new system, or restrict the list to members, or some other
thing they've been planning.

If ExI would give a realistic, honest estimation of their plans
for this (or lack thereof), the rest of us could at least plan our
own solutions better.

350 new biotechnology drugs reportedly being developed 


Copyright  1998 Nando.net
Copyright  1998 Reuters News Service 


WASHINGTON (April 10, 1998 10:25 a.m. EDT http://www.nando.net) - More than
300 different biotechnology medicines, including vaccines against cancer
and drugs to treat a whole range of diseases, are in development, U.S. drug
makers said Friday.

Nearly half the drugs in development, 151 out of 350, are meant to fight
cancer, the annual report by Pharmaceutical Research and and Manufacturers
of America (PhRMA) found.

It said 140 different pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies were
working on the drugs.

"This is a whole new era that we are moving into, and people aren't even
noticing," Dr. John Siegfried, deputy vice president for science and
regulatory affairs at PhRMA, said in a telephone interview.

"It's an incredibly exciting time to see disease begin to be attacked at
the genetic level, at the chromosome level. My god, when I started to
practice, that was unheard of. It was Buck Rogers stuff, and now it's
happening."

Biotechnology medicines in development include a flu vaccine being
developed by Protein Sciences of Meriden, Connecticut, Chiron Corp's
Proleukin skin cancer drug and Biomira Inc's cancer vaccine.

Proleukin, already licensed for treating renal cell cancer that has spread
throughout the body, is a genetically engineered version of interleukin-2
(IL-2), a naturally occurring immune system signaling chemical.

It stimulates the body to destroy abnormal cancer cells.

Biomira's vaccine alerts the body's immune system to the presence of MUC-1,
a protein found on the surface of 90 percent of common solid tumors
including breast, ovarian and lung cancer. It is being tested in non-small
cell lung cancer, of which there are an estimated 149,000 new cases in
North America each year, killing 133,000 people.

"We used to think that vaccines were only for diphtheria, pertussis for
kids. and all of a sudden you have tons of vaccines for cancer, as a
preventive in AIDS," said Siegfried.

The whole point of biotechnology is to tweak the body's own defenses,
Siegfried said.

"If you look at it holistically, that's really what the body's been doing
all along anyway," he said.

The road ahead is not all rosy, PhRMA warns. For instance, patent battles
loom, such as a fight over who owns the rights to the BRCA1 and BRCA2
breast cancer genes and a lawsuit over genetically altered seeds that
Mycogen Plant Sciences lost against Monsanto in February.

"Patent protection is really the basis of our industry and my guess is if
there is a conflict in patents, which is almost inevitable in the genetic
business, they are going to be very hard fought," Siegfried said.

There were also ethical issues, he said.

"The whole concept of messing around with genes -- people may say 'I don't
want to do it but if you tell me that messing around with his genes will
save my son then I am going to want to do it'," he said.

There were plenty of new targets to choose from, the report, which lists
all 350 new medicines, said. With an estimated 100,000 genes in the human
body, and new ones being mapped daily, companies had their work laid out.

"The modern tools of biotechnology, coupled with computer technology's
ability to analyze massive amounts of data quickly -- help scientists
determine which genes or proteins are defective," it said.

"We can accomplish in the lab now in a couple of hours what used to take a
year," Siegfried said.

Frozen embryos develop normally, study shows 


Copyright  1998 Nando.net
Copyright  1998 Reuters News Service 


LONDON (April 10, 1998 01:49 a.m. EDT http://www.nando.net) - Children born
from frozen embryos are just as healthy as those conceived normally or
through standard in-vitro fertilization, Swedish doctors said Friday.

In a study published in the Lancet medical journal, Dr. Ulla-Britt
Wennerholm and researchers at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Goteborg,
Sweden, found no difference in developmental patterns in babies from
cryopreserved, or frozen, embryos and other children.

"The cryopreservation process does not adversely affect the growth and
health of children during infancy and early childhood," she said.

Up to 2 percent of all births in Sweden are from in-vitro fertilization.
The sperm and egg are combined in a test tube and the resulting embryo is
implanted in the womb. Fresh, or embryos frozen earlier, are used in the
procedure.

Wennerholm and her team monitored growth, major malformations and
prevalence of chronic illness of 255 children from cryopreserved embryos,
255 babies born after IVF with fresh embryos and 252 others conceived
naturally during their first 18 months.

They did not find any differences in the three categories.

"Children born after cryopreservations as embryos develop and grow normally
up to the age of 18 months, with no increase in physical or psychomotor
impairment compared with children born after either standard IVF (in-vitro
fertilization) or spontaneous pregnancies," they added.

If it's illegal, then I have proven my claim that "once your direct
democracy has made a decision, it has to force its operations on the
minority who disapprove."  The fact that people have to WORK in order to
CAUSE it to be legal to do this is proof that majority-level democracy is
not what you claim.

Your "new land" claim made sense back when there was new land to go to...
however, the only area currently which (to my knowledge) has no government
is Antarctica, and IMO the costs of living there are far too great to
outweigh the privledges this would allow me.

This is true at the moment, but again, this is only in the case where
people change their minds and try to violate contracts which they have
already made.  The majority of contracts, however, are fulfilled without a
hitch, without force nor threat of force because both parties agree to its
terms.  And smart contracts and other similar systems may well be able to
obviate the use of force in contracts altogether in the near future.

What?  That they're hierarchical?  Yes, I had noticed this.  This is
because they are in competition.  However, they differ in their essense for
the reasons I just got through telling you.

Ah, the Marxist fallacy: that the workers cannot survive without the firm's
wages.

I know you're probably opposed to the very idea, but try reading an
introductory neo-classical microeconomics textbook.  (It's important to
understand the language of your enemy.  ;)  Hell, I've read _Capital_.)

Anyway, this theory of labor would be true if, and only if, the firm could
offer any wages it wanted.  This is not the case however, and would be true
if, and only if, it were the only buyer of labor (a monopsony).  You see,
when firms are in competition, workers will tend to apply for jobs which
offer higher wages.  As a result, a firm which offers higher wages can
afford higher quality workers, and offer a better product.  In theoretical
"perfect competition," firms cannot set wages at all, but rather must
accept the market price: by setting wages any higher, they wouldn't make
any money, and by setting them any lower, they wouldn't have any workers.

When there is only ONE buyer of labor, however, the firm has complete
freedom to set the price of labor to be whatever it wants, which workers
must accept because there is no one else to whom they can sell labor.  This
is how Marx viewed the labor market, and it is clearly wrong, which we can
observe empirically: there are MANY different firms out there, each
offering different wages and producing goods of different quality.

Even under a monopsony, however, workers can increase their wages through
investment; in this case, strikes.  In this form of wage investment,
workers forego today's earnings in exchange for an increase in wages from a
firm; this can even take place under a monopsony.  Marx presumed that this
would be impossible because the proletariat are property-less (or nearly
so) and therefore too destitute to survive a strike.

But thanks to the competition which does exist, workers are NOT destitute,
and do not depend entirely on one firm's wages to survive.  Using their own
savings, (which Marx presumed would not exist under capitalism,) workers
can and do successfully invest in their own wages by striking.  If the
labor market looked as you suggest it does, then this would be totally
impossible.

Workers do not depend on a firm's wages for their living.  They can sell to
other firms, and they can strike, and the firm cannot legally stop either
of these from happening under l-f capitalism.

This is true; many have argued this is the best way to organize when you
must compete against others.  I am unconvinced, but I do not specialize in
this sort of thing.

...  if organizing in another way would improve efficiency, then I suspect
you'd see more organizations incorporating it.  But I'm not sure about this.

Either way, because companies DON'T have the power to force their workers
to do anything (legally) they are fundamentally different from the military.

See my last e-mail...  Workers can sell their labor to other firms or
invest in their own wages.  Neither of these are theoretical; both of these
DO happen regularly.  Therefore this model of the labor market is
completely wrong.

You're wrong, because (at least in America) the poor DO invest, ESPECIALLY
when they strike.  And even the poor can sell their labor to another firm.
This model is completely and demonstrably wrong.

I suspect this was written "tounge in cheek"...or perhaps your trawling for a
fight from militant vegitarians..(that term always conjours up the visual of
an anthropomorpized venus flytrap  type Rambo...Killer Kabbage..)

Howsomever...It may bear an embarassing relationship to the truth.

I've been reading a book by Robert C. Atkins, M.D.  "Dr. Atkins New Diet
Revolution"

It makes sense to me...a thumbnail is that due to an overabundance of
carbohydrates in modern diet...and the intertwingleness of gylocogen,
sugars...etc and their effect on the hormones in the human body...notably
insulin...that many  fat people (myself included i imagine <5'll...260lbs>
develope a condition he calls "hyperinsulinism"...which over an extend time
leads to all manner of bad things..notably obeseity...and it's attendant
ills.(heart attacks, diabetes, strokes...and other nasty stuff)...

The problem being that someone suffereing from said ailment (hyperinsulinism)
has a well neigh impossibe task facing him trying to loose weight via
conventionally prescribed methods...i.e. cut back calories...

His diet (grossly simplified for space sake) has basicly only one rule...cut
back on carbohydrated to less than 25grams a day...for the "induction
diet".(eat ANYTHING else...and as much as you want..just NO carbs) .this
induces a state of "ketosis"...<medical term...means fat burning>...therefor
weight is lots...but NO (well hardly any) lean muscel mass.

So........I imagine the militant veggies are a trifle upset with this...it
could be called a "hi protein" , "hi fat" or "meat eaters" diet.

I've talked to several people who swear by it...claiming weight loss of ten
pounds a month...(more...but lets not get too carried away)...

So...as I sit here eating a double western omlette....I'm thinking it might be
the thing for me...

These ketosis diets have been around for a long time.  My wife tells the
story of how her sister tried one when they were teenagers around 1970.
It does work for weight loss (at least temporarily) but the metabolic
state your body is thrown into does not sound healthy.  One side effect my
wife and her family noticed is that it causes very bad, sulphurous body
odor.  With a large family and a small house this was not appreciated.
I don't think having these kind of chemicals floating around in your
body would be good for you.

The real problem with diets isn't losing weight, it's keeping it off.
I've seen figures suggesting that 90% of dieters regain all the lost
weight within two years.

If it were legal to secede from democratic decisions, the people
who did so would have to either hire others to provide the services
they opted out of, or form other collectives to provide them: in
other words, anarcho-capitalism.  Even the most die-hard anarchist
has nothing against /voluntary/ democracy; but that's not democracy,
it's anarcho-capitalism.  Those who want democracy can have it, so
long as they don't interfere with those of us who prefer freedom.

I finally have an answer to that question:  'If you could recommend 
one book on the future of gender.....?'

_Gender Shock_ by Phyllis Burke, Anchor Books

A beautifully conceived, accessibly written book about the latest
developments in human gender and sexual evolution, encompassing both
psychological and physiological changes.  Look for intersex to become
the hottest topic this year--Erin Reid and I have concluded that if
we don't stop operating on intersexual babies (2,000 per year in the
U.S. alone are 'corrected') we are most likely cutting off a path of
our own evolution at its source.  

Sin,

Has the number of intersexual babies increased in the past?

Hi Reilly,

Reilly, all phenomenons are relative to the relativity of time and space.  
This relativism is true: In our experience is there only one time -- but  
if we send a atomary watch (A) with a space shuttle around earth and have  
an other similar runing atomary watch (B) on earth than there is a time  
difference between A and B after A has returning from space.

If Einsteins proposal of general theory of relativity is true than every  
watching of phenomenons is relative to the location of the watching human  
in time and space -- and there isn't any sign that Einsteins general the- 
ory of relativity is wrong.

Not every relativism is incoherent.

Sincerely,
Nico

I've read more of the book...so far it makes sense to me...who knows I might
try it.  I've always been a "meat and potatoes" type. How hard would it be to
ditch the potatoes and double the meat?  One of the interesting claims I've
heard is that on this diet youre NOT hungry all the time....which is a major
defect of all previous diets I've tried.

Actually, the NH State Constitution specifically states that NH reserves the
right to secede from the Union, and is still a legal part of the law, as it
was tested in the courts  a way back when...   I beleive that it (the
confirmation in court) was part of the wrangling that brought the Republic of
Indian Stream into the US as part of New Hampshire.

There's a guy who coined transhumanism and already defined it.  It's pretty
good.  But if I had to put my own spin on it:

transhumanism:  The system of thought that centers on transhuman values and
goals.

There is no need to define "transhuman" in a definition of "transhumanism."

My experience suggests that both these accounts, while strictly true only
in extreme but exemplary cases, go a long way toward explaining the world I
live in.  In the last couple of days, a conservative government-supported
stevedoring company sacked more than 2000 unionists on Australian wharves
simply for being members of the union, locking them out and patrolling the
wharves with private muscle and rottweilers.  Workers rallying in protest
have been attacked illegally by irritant gas, which is as close to a gun
against the head as one might wish to see in industrial practice at the
close of the 20th century.  This argues, incidentally, against the claim
that workers can invest on equable terms by command of their own labour.

Well, not "hardly any", but a lot less than you'd expect.  This actually
does work.  When you eat virtually no carbohydrates your citric acid cycle
fails and your body switches to an alternate fat oxidation system.  Your
body has to ship large quantities of fats in ketones around in the blood.
Since your kidney lack the ability to retain these, they get lost in the 
urine.  The situation resembles that of somebody with advanced diabetes,
although this kind of ketosis won't kill you directly.

You can lose weight like crazy on this plan.  You will also be physically
weak,
often nauseous, and you will smell like nail polish remover.  If you go
on the diet and then off it, you will gain back all you lost.  If you stay
on it, you'll subject your body indefinitely to a metabolic regime it's 
manifestly not adapted for.  Research on the long-term safety of ketotic
diets is zilch, which I consider inexcusable given than Dr. Atkins has been
pushing this diet for 25 years.  Not even a rodent study!  Dr. Atkins' diet
may be a good thing, but he is a quack.

>So........I imagine the militant veggies are a trifle upset with this...it
>could be called a "hi protein" , "hi fat" or "meat eaters" diet.

I've always wanted to get a ketotic diet proponent in a room with a vegan
to watch the fireworks :-)

>I've talked to several people who swear by it...claiming weight loss of ten
>pounds a month...(more...but lets not get too carried away)...

No doubt they do exaggerate, but you will lose a lot on the Atkins diet.
In addition to substantial fat loss, ketosis is a strong diuretic and you'll
lose a lot of water as well.  Of course, you'll get the water back within
24 hours of your first candy bar.

You're a human; you need to think ahead.  Losing will do no good if you just
gain it back.  Healthwise you'll be worse off than you were in the first
place.

Harder than you might think.  On ketotic diets, you must essentially eat
*nothing*
but meat, eggs, cream, and oils (25 grams of carbohydrate is one carrot a
day). 
No candy, no dessert, no fruit, no milk, no vegetables, no bread, not even
ketchup.  
Yuck.  

>One of the interesting claims I've

Since you can eat what you want, this is basically true.  Some of the research
literature claims ketotic dieters develop carbohydrate craving for the foods
they can't eat.  So you'll really want that candy bar, even though you're not
hungry.

Yes I was expecting that, but I was more paraphrasing a quote by someone else
that I can't remember.

However, you are calling a mercantilist a capitalist, which is not the same
thing. a Capitalist does not beleive in the use of government to enforce one's
own advantage, while many mercantilist types and oligarchists call themselves
capitalists, erroneously.

In a buyers market, commodity products will always come cheaply.  Manual,
unskilled labor will always be the cheapest to be had. Unions and immigration
rules seek to artificially restrict the supply of manual labor, which is why
unions always support immigration restrictions.

If your union there is anything like the Teamsters here, I can understand why
the owners are using security to keep former employees off their property. That
they have successfully ended the artificial labor supply restrictions they were
suffering under is actually good for the economy in general, no matter how much
short term difficulty the workers may face. I can pretty much guarrantee that
within 1-2 years, if you economic/technical growth is anything like here, most
of those shut out people will be making even more money than they were under
the unions seniority system in jobs that develop greater skills than just
lugging cargo.

I have no pity for these signs of the obsolescence of high paid human laborers
when a high tech economy needs their brains so much more....

As an example, in 1990 up to 1992, Boeing Aircraft Company laid off some 15,000
imployees, over 10% of its work force, most of whom lived in the Seattle area,
and they had some of the highest paid manufacturing jobs around. This big
layoff definitely had a ripple effect in the rest of the economy, no doubt
about it, as the real estate boom of the  80's died a quick death, and the
Federal Gov'ts huge excise tax on boats effectively killed the marine industry
in the area. Now 6-8 years later, Boing has hired back less than 5,000 workers,
but is producing more planes than before. The unemployment rate is lower now
than before the layoffs, so this means that those 10,000 other laid off workers
got jobs elsewhere (many of whom started businesses), and the fact that the
average income in the area is higher now indicates that those 10,000 workers
are likely not making less money than they did before.

Free economies are much more dynamic than centrally planned economies, no doubt
about it. That is not a point of debate. That people aren't guarranteed
lifetime employment means that they will take responsibility to keep their
skills up to date or face the consequences of their actions, or lack thereof.
More dynamic economies do not suffer fools gladly, and they demand efficiency
and technical advancement to keep up the pace of competition. It is no wonder
at all that the most technologically advanced nations are the most economically
dynamic, and that those with the greatest knowledge skills will migrate to
those economies. The US has probably a greater percentage of foreign trained
individuals working in their universities and corporations than any other
industrial nation. It is also indicative that those who live in hidebound
socialist economies but who develop a pride in acheivement will generally seek
to migrate to countries like the US, where their skills are more appreciated.

This makes a lot of sense if one knows the definition of transhuman (I
assume you refer to FM-2020's definition), but it is likely unclear to
anybody who doesn't know what a transhuman is. So this definition
might be useful to us, but when presenting our views to others we will
need the other proposed definitions and to explain transhumanity to them.

Heinlein got it right again...almost.

Reference "Podkayne of Mars".  In which the professional couple had

"thawed " them out and raised the little darlings.

Do you or does anyone assume, if they agree with this, that a non-
capitalist will do otherwise?  The record of many variants of non-
capitalist -- communist, fascist, welfare statist -- seems to show a
lack of concern for the means, though not on a retail but on a
wholesale level.

If we were not unhappy, there would be zero impetus to change. No impetus
to change in an coevolutionary context guarantees failure before long.
Hence this is no surprise that the majority of us is not happy. I am
pretty happy to be unhappy, actually. Saves one from being an
beautifically smiling evolutionary cul de sac.

Hardly. The domain of mechanosynthesis being (cryogenic) UHV conditions
limits action in heavily solvated systems to rearranging premade molecules
by comparatively large (low concentration of manglers in a sea of
manglees), artefacting devices in an unarrested environment. In contrast
to in vivo, you can do a lot with vitrified biological systems. You could
probably even build a (smallish) critter in vitrified stage and
flash-devitrify it into life, retracting the nanofilament scaffolding
after the fact.

Unless we can get out of the Darwin box, which is probably impossible, you
can't remain in the state of eternal bliss. We can homeostate us to max
out the kick we get from being a rat the rat race, though.

Depends on his or her education. An educated capitalist knows that oppression leads to stagnation and that cooperation leads to success. In the end, not the political or economic label matters. What matters is the education of the power elite. The best (least oppressive, most supportive of education) *political* system would be anarcho-socialism, but this is so far from reality that even the singularity seems closer and discussing it is therefore only of philosophical relevance.

      Thanks for the book recomendation. 

      I have one question though: who is this "we" you are refering to? :-)  I'm not flaming you or
      anything. It is just an honest question. Should I assume that you mean "americans", or
      should I assume you mean humans. I know *I* certainly haven't operated on any intersexual
      babies lately. :-) And I'm pretty sure that most of the transhumans on this list haven't either. 
Although this list does attract some pretty interesting characters. :-)

Jason

Very odd. I feel very happy, and I feel a big impetus to change. Would
I feel an even more intense impetus if I was unhappy? I doubt it; the
times I have felt unhabppy haven't motivated me as much as when I have
been happy to do something. I think the basic idea "unhappiness: lots
of action to get happier, happiness: satiety, no action" doesn't hold
well. There is a difference between the overall happiness level and
the amount of motivation; remember the separate "wanting" and "liking"
systems in the brain - you can want things even when you don't like
them, and vice versa (even if there often is a correlation).

Of course, I might be unrepresentative of humanity but I hope it isn't
so.

The human body has been observed to work in a homestatic way.
Many aspects of the human nervous system have been observed
to work in a homeostatic way. It would seem that humans are 
genetically programmed to work in a homeostatic way. 

I think this carries over to the pschology of human consciousness.
Human consciousness as it has evolved seems to operate in a 
homeostatic way as well. Perhaps a fundamental success 
principle, or a fundamental principle for the future evolution of 
trans and post human consciousness will be to overcome this homeostatic
nature of consciousness.

Any thoughts, comments, questions, disagreements?

Jason

All life is homeostatic, that is the meaning after all of a metastable
dissipative system: it manages to retain its structure and state by
allowing energy to flow through it. But homeostasis in some dimensions
(like body temperature) doesn't imply homeostasis in other dimensions
(like aging).

How? In what respect? Obviously memory is not homeostatic, since it is
constantly updated and changes our behavior. We have certain stable
conscious states we tend to return to, but are they really long-term
homeostatic and not just short-term homeostatic?

I think it can be partially overcome already, since people do change
from time to time. It is not easy, and obviously it would be a bad
idea to change constantly since we could not retain ourselves well
(although, as I speculate in a short story I wrote, posthumans might
have attractors in personality space so that they appear to have
stable personalities while they are actually quite fluid).

IMHO humans have a 'default' genetic program to obtain the greatest
benefit with the least effort. If they default to this "program" they will
most likely use any and all means that seem to be appropriate. 

Only primitive humans or sub-humans who have not yet overcome 
this genetic program will use violence, coercion or "any means necessary"
to achieve their goals. This phenomenon does not have ideological
boundries. The boudaries seem simply to be - primitive individuals
use primitive means. Advanced individuals use more sophisticated 
means (even if it means more "work"). And this is a continuem, not
an either/or. 

IMHO the solution to primitive individuals using primitive and often
dangerous means is not to retaliate with even greater primitive and
dangerous means. This simply leads to a vicious circle.

A seriously belated set of comments about "A Sense of Life":

Working with very little archive material, the filmmakers conveyed a
dynamic, intense, woman whose inner drive totally overwhelmed her
physical exterior and rendered her beautiful.

I could have done without the stereotyped commentary about her love 
life.  Obviously she and her husband had quietly conducted an open 
relationship, in an era when one didn't speak of such things.  To 
characterize it as her husband 'not being enough' or Ayn 'being too 
much for one man' simply insults the love that they shared and shows 
a lack of understanding of the complexities of managing multiple 
relationships.  I look forward to the next movie maybe handling that 
part of her life in more depth.

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

What it all boils down to is that any rational person (including transhumanists
who after all emphasize rationality quite heavily) will use any means that
are available to him to reach his goals. Sometimes his actions will benefit
others, sometimes they will be neutral, and sometimes people will get hurt.
A rational person will recognize that most ethics and morals are nothing
but artificial (extra) burdens on the way to ascension. Life is difficult enough
as it is. Castigating yourself with piontless self-imposed rules and 
regulations is pure S&M.

Knowing this is being on the right path to enlightenment.

Ah, you might say, that would mean folks like Hitler, Stalin, the IRA and
any damn street robber are enlightened. Not so. The other part of enlighten-
ment is seeking technotranscendence (immortality, increased intelligence,
physical strenght etc. through rational means like technology). To achieve 
this one needs a lot of foresight, which includes keeping a relatively low profile 
and (thus) minimizing the number of (potentially) dangerous enemies. Also, 
being nice can pay off in several ways, ranging from simply "a good feeling" to 
substantial material gain.

So there's a rational basis for being generally nice. But, unlike many less
user friendly philosophies Enlightened Rationalism (TM)* does not forbid the 
use of force, including the use of force "just for fun". It just says "keep an 
eye on the consequences", which is, wel...rational. So if you feel like it, and
think that you can get away with it...by all means go ahead!

All this may sound ok for individual use, but would this work for society as a 
whole? Yes. Most people are not "evil" by nature. Just a bit opportunistic,
which is only rational. A society based on Enlightened Rationalism (TM) 
would rid itself of the true assholes quite quickly and then become stable
and pleasant to live in, free of such nonsense as the war on drugs and
the persecution of victimless crime in general. After all, most problems
are caused by ridiculous, sanctimonious rules and standards, and people
not being able to live up to them an getting frustrated because of it.
Setting the morals too high only breeds corruption, lies and blackmail,
and sooner or later those who helped to perpetuate the system will be
eaten by it themselves.

Of course "society" isn't going to adopt this kind of rational thinking anytime
soon, which is too bad for them but doesn't matter otherwise since E.R. is
highly suited to be practiced on an individual basis in a "hostile" environment.

Well, enough wisdom for one day...


(*) To recap: Enlightened Rationlism (TM) is a branch on the transhumanistic 
tree. It supports all basic tenets of regular transhumanism/extropianism except 
those that unreasonably limit the freedom of the (rational) individual. For example,
E.R. is neutral on the issues of increasing diversity and being "life promoting".
These are matters of individual choice and depend on the situation. E.R. supports 
no existing political party or movement, and is not compatible with any [other] 
political or religious philosophies. Enlightened Rationalists seek to become 
Powers, but also try to make the most of (have fun) all the intermediate phases.

Btw, suggestions for a better sounding name are welcome; "Enlightened 
Rationalism" is too long and sounds too pompous-assed.

Intersexuals are defined chromosomally as neither 'male' nor
'female', some are further defined as 'true hermaphrodites'. Further
medical info can be found at the Intersex Society of North America's
excellent web site: http://www.isna.org

Erin was trying to find out if the number of intersex individuals
being born had indeed increased, at least in the US--it's impossible
to say without reviewing every single person's medical records, which
are, of course, confidential.  A Medline search going back into the
early 1980's reveals many surgeons crowing about having found 'true
hermaphrodites', and how they fixed them (grrr....).  In a few
cases, surgery was required to avert a life-threatening condition,
but many of these kids were being operated on without the parent's
knowledge or consent.  The criteria: surgical ease of changing the
'anamolous' genitals to those of a male or female, to hell with the
kid's identity.  

Only one followup study has ever been conducted, and it just began a
couple of years ago at Johns Hopkins.  Already, even before compiling
and publishing results, the researcher says that several of the kids
changed gender identity away from the one they were assigned upon
reaching puberty.  To him, this provides evidence that sex identity
lies more in the brain and should not be forced at a young age.

I must second that; I'm a *lot* more productive and looking for improvement

D.L. Crocker wrote 4/11/98: <If it were legal to secede from democratic
decisions, the people who did so would have to either hire others to
provide the services they opted out of, or form other collectives to
provide them: in other words, anarcho-capitalism.>

Agreed.  One of my critique's of David Brin's "Transparent Society" is that
all his emphasis is on some mystical idol called "accountability."  But
secession is the surest way to secure liberty for a consensual moral polity
that is diverging (in the evolutionary sense) from those polities around
it.  Secession, not accountability, because accountability only works when
the core ideals and core purposes are consensually agreed on within a
polity (or at minimum acquiesced to).  If those ideals and purposes have
diverged, then secession is the only option. Anarcho-capitalism, as you
have used it above, would have to be *very* broadly defined to fit all the
different configurations that secession would form and preserve.

Back in the Roman Republic, the plebes used to secede to the Palatine Hill
until the patricians granted concessions to freedom.  The oligarchy worked
fine as long as the old Roman religion was firmly in the hearts of the
elite and the people.  But as Greek cynicism and skepticism worked its way
into Roman society to undermine the old religion, the oligarchy became more
tyrannical because they decided that man was the measure of all things and
therefore might made right.  The plebes seceded and seceded, each time
gaining more freedom.  But as the policemen inside the population's head
went away, more and more policemen outside their head were required.  The
freedom gained through secessions threatened to turn into anarchy, i.e.,
non-stop civil wars between mafia dons.  The oligarchy, in response,
crystallized into a single ruler to impose order and stop the anarchy. 
Attempts to replace the old religion with a secular morality resulted in
the split between the stoicism of the elite and the epicureanism of the
slobs.  The crystallization of the oligarchy behind a single ruler won out
over anarchy largely because the self-discipline of stoicism will always
trump the hedonism of epicureanism.  The fall occurring from the older more
extropic republic towards first entropic anarchy, then to entropic
totalitarianism was the natural result of the loss of the old religion and
the failure of the secular morality designed to replace it.  Secession did,
indeed, work to provide more freedom, but the freedom was lost because of a
loss of self-discipline.  You cannot hold mafia dons accountable, you can
only beat 'em, accommodate 'em or try to get away from 'em.

BTW, I'm reading a delightful book by Walter Pater called "Marius the
Epicurean" (1885) set in Rome c.200.  The dynamic optimism I feel about our
material advances is not matched by any advances in our modern writing
abilities over this.

Thanks for sending this, Ron. I didn't respond sooner because I was really
busy. LEF saw the article right away and wrote the following rebuttal- I
hope to get more input on this from Dick Passwater,PhD, Mathias Rath,MD,
Abram Hoffer, MD,PhD and others:


Life Extension Foundation's Preliminary 
Rebuttal to a Recent Vitamin C Study
April 9, 1998

HIGH DOSES OF VITAMIN C CAUSE DAMAGE

On April 8, 1998, British scientists released the results of a 
study showing that vitamin C was effective for cancer prevention and 
free radical suppression at the dose of 60 mg a day, but at 500 mg a 
day, it caused genetic damage that could lead to cancer or rheumatoid
arthritis.

The researchers gave 30 human volunteers 500 mg vitamin C supplements 
for six weeks. The scientists showed that while 500 mg a day produces
protective effects, it also appears to have a dual activity in which 
it can also cause damage.

Higher doses of vitamin C were shown to react with iron and other 
metals to damage cellular DNA.

This small study help to validate The Life Extension Foundation's 
17-year position that vitamin C must be taken with other antioxidants 
like vitamin E, or the vitamin C will react with iron and copper to 
produce DNA-damaging free radicals.

Saul Kent, President of The Life Extension Foundation, first brought 
out this information in 1978, when he cited animal studies showing 
that high doses of vitamin C, given without other antioxidants, 
actually shortened the life span.

Most vitamin supplement users consume at least 400 iu of vitamin E, 
and 400 mcg of folic acid every day. The addition of these two nutrients 
could have prevented the iron-induced DNA damage observed by the British
scientists. More specific antioxidants like n-acetyl-cysteine, grape-seed 
and green tea extract would provide significant protection against DNA 
damage induced as a result of vitamin C catalyzing with iron and copper.

The British scientists did note that even at the high dose of 500 mg 
of vitamin C a day, it was preventing more damage than it was creating.

I'm coming into this debate late, so I appologize if my topics have already
been covered.

The argument of relativism vs absolutes is a very slipperey slope.

First I want to point out that asserting a position of an absolute frequently 
leads to a fallacy. (Notice I didn't say "always" because my statement 
would then be a paradox; I would be falling for the same fallacy.) (Humor: whenever
anyone starts out by saying "all" or "none" my initial gut reaction is to <in
my best Monty Python/Holy Grail voice>"run away!"</voice>) :-)

For example, the statements "all things are deterministic," or "nothing 
is deterministic" both fall into that category. Empirical & experimental & experiential observation would
seem to indicate that many things are deterministic (eg classical physics). 
Empirical & experimental & experiential observation would also seem to 
indicate that there are some things that are not deterministic (eg quantum mechanics). 

Since I utilize the pragmatic viewpoint, it seems to me that the approach to take is simply 
"take the approach that produces the results you want." In the example above
this would mean that in some situations a "deterministic perspective" might be
more useful, and in some situations an "indeterministic" one might be more 
useful.

I don't consider myself knowledgable enough about physics (at least
at the current time) to evaluate the merit of relativity in that area. I will
focus on relativity in ethics.

Going back to my previous point, if you say "all morals are relative" then
you just created a paradoxical conundrum. You would be using an absolute
statement to affirm relativity.  An oxymoron. :-)
 
OTOH, if you accept that there are in fact absolute morals/ethics, then you come
up against the dificult problems of who determines those ethics/morals, and how are 
they determined. The historic solution to this problem is to default to some 
religious gibberish. However I doubt that many transhumans would find that solution 
acceptable (I certainly don't.)

SOme people accept that these ethics should be determined through democratic
vote. I do not accept this as a solution because you almost always end up with a 
minority who is then typically coerced into conformance (the altrernative frequently being
death or imprisonment). Since I believe that non-coercion/non-violence *must*
be a fundamental principle if the human race is to survive and prosper, I do not
accept this as a solution. If OTOH, democratic vote is not backed up by force 
than the voting itself  really isn't all that useful and sounds more like my solution
below.

"Demoacracy is the worst form of 'government' .... accept for all the rest."  
 -- Winston Churchill  (single quotes are mine)

So my personal conclusion uses a combination of pragmatism and common sense.
I would use the phrase "there are no absolute morals/ethics *that I know of*; each
individual decides for themselves what is ethical/moral. Personally, since I like
pragmatic and anarcho-capitalist ideas (although I don't exactly
like using these or any lables - they are too constrictive), my personal ethics are
"do what works, as long as it doesn't stomp on the rights of others." (I refer to 
"rights" in an anarcho-capitalist way - but that is an enitrely differernt topic.)

However the problem with the no absolute morals/ethics statement is that it leads to 
the innevitable "so you believe that anyone can do anything to anyone else - plunder, 
murder, rape etc.!!" 

And my answer to that is "no
for practical/pragmatic reasons this ethical relativity needs to be moderated by some
sort of common, agreed upon limits within which trans/post human civilization can
exist (if you accept having plunder, murder, rape etc. you have no civilization - depending
on your definition; my definition of "civilization" doesn't include those things). 

So what is needed is some sort of "working boundaries" from within which 
that ethical relativism can exist. This would be sort of a "meta-ethics". Of course you 
then run into the same problem again of who determines these "meta-ethics." (See 
my reason above for why I do not accept democracy as a method of achieving this.)

It would seem to me that two logical base-components of such meta-ethics would be non-
violence/non-coercion and a willingness to allow competing ethics/morals and memes to
exist in the "marketplace of ideas". I think a good place to start for these "meta-ethics"
are the "principles of civilization" that are posted somewhere on 
http://www.buildfreedom.com (of course these are just my opinions)  Freedom seems to 
be a "lowest common denominator" within which other value systems can exist.
A socialist community could exist as a subset within an "anarcho-capatalist world."
Typically, an anarcho-capatalist community would never be tolerated as a subset
under a socialist/communist/facist regime. There is historical evidence for this. 

There are certain memes that clearly do not permit co-existance with other memes. For example, certain
sects of radical Islamic fundamentalism promote that all people must embrace their
meme. Otherwise they should be killed. This could be considered a type of "killer
meme" - a meme that attempts to not only promote itself, but destroy all others. (And
NO, I don't consider that trait inherent in the definition of a meme.) (So far as I know, the 
term 'killer meme' was coined by Howard Bloom in his book "The Lucifer Principle.")
Contrast this with what I wrote above about an open marketplace of memes. Killer 
memes are typically very dangerous. Although I don't know what the best way to deal
with them might be.

Since it is likely that there will always be competing memes, it is also likely that there 
will always be competing ethics/morals - relative or not.

I don't claim this to be the best of solutions. I certainly don't have "THE" answer. As I
said at the beginning of my post, this is a dificult question. These are just some of my
thoughts, and one possible starting point for a solution. What better solutions can we 
come up with?

Regarding the first 'posters' statement at the top of this message: "If rationality is not
wedded to truth then it is clearly irrationality." 

In order to respond to that I would have to ask you what your definitions of "rationality"
and "truth" are. My 
definition of "truth" is a 100% accurate perception of "reality." (And yes, I do believe
that there is in fact an "absolute reality," and that it is "out there". But I also believe 
that everyone has thier individual "construction" or perception of "reality" which is
incomplete and can include incorrect information. Based upon my empirical 
observations/testing I believe that certain aspects of this 
"reality out there" are static, and that others are dynamic. No human or transhuman
that I know of has evolved enough to have an "absolutely" 100% accurate perception 
of "reality" (ie omniscience). And since certain parts of this "reality" are changing 
constantly this would have to be an ongoing process.) 
  
Nietzsche's opinion was that since everyones perception of "reality" is merely an 
approximation of that "absolute reality," all 'truths' or 'knowledge' are/is a form of 'useful fiction.'
A sort of a pragamatic self deceit. His opinion was that when these ideas or 'useful 
fictions' stop producing desired results they should be thrown out and new "useful
fictions" should be created of adopted. Hence he came up wth the aphorisms like "question
everything" as tools to help with this. He also pointed out that these "useful fictions" frequently
become seen as dogmatic absolutes, even long after they have ceased being useful.    

For example, this has occured in the field of physics. First you had Aristotles physics.
Then you had Galileos physics, but he was labled a heretic for quite some time, until
some of his ideas were finally accepted, and Aristotles rejected. Then along came 
Einstein ... etc ...

Another possible future example: at this point in the evolution of "our" 
(meaning human/transhuman) knowledge, many people
believe Einstein's idea that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light. This 
is reasonable based upon the information "we" currently have. But some future
information may "paint a bigger picture" about "the way things are". This new 
perspective might then open up other new possibilities which we did not "see" before. Such
as traveling faster than the speed of light. (I hope so; the speed of light is too
slow :-)

One working definition of rationalsim: "using logic to make decisions based upon 
empirical data and experiential results". How's that for a def?  :-)  Not the only or best
definition, but good enough for now. 

So I would say that "rationality" IS wedded to the "truth." The problem lies in what you 
consider to be "truth." Approximations are not black or white, they are grey. So things
are not so easily put into the "rationality box" or the "irrationality box" - depending on
the quality of your perceptions/information. You could call this the "argument from 
Fuzzyness." (I would really recommend Kosko's "Fuzzy Logic" for more on this).

"So far as mathematics apply to reality, they are not certain. And so far as mathematics are 
certain, they do not apply to reality." -- Einstein 
(I'm quoting this from memory - I couldn't find the reference so, I may have it a little off.)

Feedback appreciated (no flames please).

Sin,
Jason

name are welcome; "Enlightened Rationalism" is too long and sounds too
pompous-a__ed.>

A recap of the description you gave:

<What it all boils down to is that any rational person... will use any
means that are available to him to reach his goals. Sometimes his actions
will benefit others, sometimes they will be neutral, and sometimes people
will get hurt.>

No rationality is used in setting goals, only morality.  Rationality sifts
through various means to various goals in the process of choosing a goal,
but is silent over the actual final choice of a goal.  It is akin to the
difference between effectiveness and efficiency.  Means are always
important because private virtues develop public virtues, which facilitates
the achievement of great aims, while private vices develop public vices,
which facilitates slop.

<A rational person will recognize that most ethics and morals are nothing
but artificial (extra) burdens on the way to ascension. Life is difficult
enough as it is. Castigating yourself with piontless self-imposed rules and

regulations is pure S&M.>

Rational individuals do, in fact, use induction, they do not merely drift
on the waves of infantile desire.  They see that adherence to variations of
morals lead to variations of consequences, some good and some bad.  Some
morals are inductively superior to other morals, if the presupposition is
made that "life is good."  The ability to develop self-discipline is one of
the key capacities that distinguishes homo sapiens from the amoeba.

<But, unlike many less user friendly philosophies Enlightened Rationalism
(TM)* does not forbid the use of force, including the use of force "just
for fun". It just says "keep an eye on the consequences", which is, wel...
rational. So if you feel like it, and think that you can get away with
it... by all means go ahead!>

Past adherents of E.R. would include Pol Pot, Attila the Hun, Mao Tse Tung,
Josef Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Genghis Khan, V.I. Lenin...  A "nice" crowd,
all very successful, all very happy with their consequences, very rational.

<After all, most problems are caused by ridiculous, sanctimonious rules and
standards, and people not being able to live up to them an getting
frustrated because of it. Setting the morals too high only breeds
corruption, lies and blackmail, and sooner or later those who helped to
perpetuate the system will be eaten by it themselves.>

Obviously, someone has offended you somewhere along the line by expecting a
standard of conduct from you that you couldn't live up to without
sacrificing your adolescent worship of the desire of the moment.  The
record of history shows that corruption, lies and blackmail always result
from a lowering of moral standards, never from an elevating of them.  It is
irrational to ignore the historical record.  Frustration over not being
able to live up to a high standard is adolescent, it is stereotypical of
the spoiled-child syndrome.  It is caused by an abrogation of parental
authority, i.e., decadent children come from corrupt parents.

<For example, E.R. is neutral on the issues of increasing diversity and
being "life promoting".  These are matters of individual choice and depend
on the situation.>

If E.R. cannot bring itself to incorporate the metaphysical presupposition
that "life is good" then it is death-worship.  There is no neutrality on
this question, the default is always to entropy.

In summary, it sounds like E.R. is merely license for a bunch of adolescent
Uzi-toting street-corner bermensch out for a joy-ride using up the moral
capital stored up in previous generations by the prey around them.  I
suggest, instead of "Enlightened Rationalism", the more honest "Sophomoric
Parasitism".

IN this case, I would suggest that we differentiate 'happiness' from
'satisfaction', or merely as a subset of it.  One can be both depressed and
satisfied (if thats what makes you happy). Depression is a clinical condition,
not a state of happiness.  While people that are at least marginally happy seem
to be the most motivated to want MORE happiness (which is why IMHO a free market
system tends to outperform socialist systems economically, because people who
acheive even a marginal level of satisfaction or happiness typcially decide that
they want more of it, and work to get it, while a socialist system, as far as I
can tell, assumes that everyone has  identical and fixed maximum happiness and
satisfaction levels, that cannot be changed, and anything greater than those
politically correct levels is nothing but greedy hedonism and sloth.)  people who
are totally blissful and satisfied without cost tend to be even less motivated
than a severely depressed mental patient.

In a free market system, each individual is free to determine their own levels of
marginal utility for a given product, service, etc.  and the price per unit of
happiness or satisfaction the individual derives from a given product or service,
not only the first unit, but each successive unit as a curve of diminishing
returns. A free market system does not automatically assume that everybody has
identical curves of diminishing returns for every product and service, as a
socialist system does, nor does anything but the individual try to dictate to the
individual what that curve may be for them.

A mercantilist type system, as we currently have, more or less, here in the US,
does recognise that people have different curves of diminishing returns, but they
also try to influence and manipulate those curves via tax policies, regulations,
and marketing/advertising violating the individuals privacy.  While this is less
onerous and tyrranical than a socialist system, it does have its own limitations
that I find distasteful.

As Mr. den Otter has previously said is such a rude manner, I am rather extreme
myself, although I personally take pride in that, since being average is to me as
good as being dead.  However, I hope here I have accurately described conditions
for most people...

I suppose that would depend on whether "capitalist" means "a person 
who doesn't give a fig about capitalism but happens to be wealthy and 
to like being wealthy" or "a person who believes in capitalism".

People who are quite willing to commit murder for their own profit, 
are a problem in ANY system.  If anything, it was the degree of 
capitalism in the US economy that made Jeffrey Dahmer be regarded as 
a dangerous criminal, rather than a valued member of the police 
force.

Sorry, but the three people I named (among a great many others -- 
some of whom immigrated to the United States, not speaking English, 
possessing only those resources they were able to keep while fleeing 
through the jungle or accumulate during years in refugee camps -- 
you can't get much poorer than that) did precisely what you 
say cannot be done.

Maybe you didn't recognise the names, though.  

Ray Kroc was a milkshake-making-machine salesman and repairman, and 
from that start he created the McDonald's chain. 

Rich deVoss was a door-to-door soap salesman.  He owns half of Amway. 
 (The other half is owned by Jay Van Andel, who was also a 
door-to-door soap salesman with a territory nearby.)

Sam Walton sold various supplies to small-town general stores.  And 
created the WalMart chain.

While I agree with the upper statements, your last is at the least foolish,
and at the worst completely, criminally, ludicrous. To fail to respond with
greater force to an individual who uses force to impose his will, gain his ro
her ends simply winds up in a vicious cycle of them demanding more and more
from you until you are enslaved or dead.  Responding with such force that you
kill such primitive individual stops the vicious cycle in the first step, and
hopefully before this individual has had a chance to reproduce, thus you are
improving the genetic pool of humanity and advancing evolution.

I would have  thought that people such as Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo, Stalin,
Hussein, Quaddaffi would have established a good enough pool of examples of
the foolishness of appeasement to end such stupid statements from polluting
intelligent discussions.

Up here in New Hampshire (yup, here I go again), as well as across the river
in Vermont, we have possibly the highest per capita level of gun ownership in
the industrialized world, and probably the one of the highest in the entire
world, yet I challenge anyone on this list to name one European or other
industrialized nation of the same size or larger as our state, that has a more
restrictive gun policy yet has a lower crime rate. You can't. That should be
enough to kill any further debate on such a silly statement as your last. (oh,
and btw, if you try to claim that its because we're all rich or something, our
state is below the national average in per capita income by a hefty
percentage.)

It is not necessary to believe "rape is wrong" in order to have a 
compelling reason not to commit rape.  It is sufficient to believe 
"if I rape this girl, her brothers/sisters/friends/neighbors will 
find out who did it and come beat my head in".

For those who hold the former belief, committing rape would simply 
produce a moral problem.  There are abundant cases of people finding 
their way out of moral problems in a manner that leaves them free of 
self-blame for incredible crimes.

For those who hold the latter belief, committing rape would be a form 
of suicide.

This time difference is a function of the measuring mechanism itself.  You
are not saying that the Planck moment has changed during the flight, are
you?  Is the Planck moment constant or is it not?

As long as you bring up science here, I'll address some comments made by
the Merry Guillotiner on 4/9/98:

<Your philosophy is cutting edge, cutting edge for the 13'th century that
is, the same is true of your science....  The speed of light is absolute,
it's the same for any observer....  And you've also rejected Quantum
Mechanics, I think that's part of your credibility problem.  After dumping
on the two greatest intellectual  accomplishments of the century it's hard
to get people to sit contentedly at your feet while you [unpleasant blah,
blah, blah].>

I agree that the speed of light being the same for any observer is
absolute, an absolute metaphysical assumption.  Verification continues... 
This is science, not mysticism.  I have not rejected QM, I have simply
noted that QM and Relativity are not reconciled, and they are not
reconciled for a reason that science has not discovered yet.  They have not
discovered it yet because something is wrong with some of the metaphysical
assumptions underlying the current Kuhnian paradigm and it is very hard to
buck dogmatism when you are trying to suck in grant money.

I also can't believe that individuals who proclaim themselves to be
scientists, promote the Big Bang as science.  Creation ex nihilo was
formulated as a pious scientific doctrine at the Fourth Lateran Council in
1215.  All the kooky machinations undergone since then to undergird this
doctrine resemble Ptolemy's increasingly convoluted epicycles more than
anything else.

There is a lot of kookiness in science I don't go for.  Time travel, for
one.  Utterly senseless.  Basement or attic universes for another, unless
the Planck moment for each is different from ours and different from each
other, then I'd be willing to entertain the idea.  Singularities inside
black holes for another.  Black holes are just like glaciers, if you want
to free up the matter in them, just raise the background temperature around
them.  The idea of a space-time continuum for another, I'd go for a
space-time conjunction or a space continuum, though.  The Planck moment is
not a variable, not involved in any continuum, at least not locally anyway.
 I don't just pick on junk physics either, biology makes no sense when it
takes randomness (as in mutations) to be some ontological aspect, rather
than an epistemological aspect.  If there was one ounce of ontological
randomness in the universe, the universe would be entirely unintelligible.

Lastly, I can't think of any greater credibility problem that to take
information as an ontological primitive.  Information has no existence
without a knower and a known.  It is a common fallacy to say that DNA
transmits information, without referencing the knower who can translate the
information.  DNA replication, the thing-in-itself, is not transmitting
information, it is simply molecules bumping around and lining up in
preferred developmental branches.  The "everything is digital" worldview I
always held to be harmless idiocy until I was shown that it leads to a
mandate to guillotine half my state.  I will take it seriously now.

I have been involved in learning about health, fitness and bodybuilding for 
9 years (since I was 13), and I have worked as a nutritionist and fitness
instructor so I have a bit of experience on this topic.

You are correct: very high blood concentrations of insulin and glycogen can do 
some very bad things  other than obesity. All of the things you listed and more. 
One thing it does is known as "glycolization" which is a build up of cellular garbage 
that causes "cross-linking" of proteins. This is not a good thing if you are striving for 
immortality (like me) because it can ultimately damage DNA. 

One solution to this particular problem is to eat a very  low carbohydrate diet such 
as described in books by atkins and other books like "The Zone..." But the Atkins 
diet has problems of it's own (see below) Another, possbily better solution is to
eat a moderate amount of carbohydrates, but make sure you eat only "low glycemic
index" carbohydrates. Glycemic index (GI) is a scale that measures how much insulin
is released by your body as a result of eating certain foods; it was first devised for 
diabetics, but is useful to anyone seeking health. You can find GI food charts on the web, 
at health food stores or ask a doctor. 

>The problem being that someone suffereing from said ailment (hyperinsulinism)

In order to lose wieght you must eat a high protien, low-medium carb, medium fat, calorie
diet. And you must create a caloric deficit meaning burn more calories than you
consume. It IS as simple as that, but it is NOT as easy as that. It takes time 
because your body has to totally readjust. If you have hyperinsulinism 
then you're body is very insensitive to insulin and another body mass
regulating hormone known as leptin. You're body has to "upregulate"
or resenstize itself to the lower level of insulin, glucose and leptin.
Once that happens the fat loss will accelerate.

Vegtables are still good for you because many (but not all) are low GI. Also
don't cook them as this increases GI (not to mention does lots of other nasty things.)
You don't even *have to* eat meat to do a ketogenic diet because you can get protein from 
supplements like whey, soy or egg protein, and you can eat "healthy" fats like those
found in walnuts, almonds, flax oil, primrose oil, peanuts, olive oil etc. instead of 
saturated animal fat which *is* unhealthy. So it *is*
possible to be both a veg-head and on a ketogenic diet, although I have no idea
who would want to do this.

I have personal experience with ketogenic diets. Yes they do work very well for 
weight loss. Yes, you will stink if you eat that way. You may experience nasausness,
weakness, and you may have trouble thinking clearly. It is also correct that you will
lose a lot of water, so for safety reasons it is important to drink a lot of water. (Water
weight is *not* the type of weight you want to lose.) No, it is not healthy
for a long term diet. I would call the ketogenic diet a "short term militant weight
loss tactic." It is not a long term strategy if you value your health; it has a 
number of nasty side effects. But for short term it is OK. My personal experience
with this is that you will need to eat at least 75% of your calories from fat, and most
of the difference should be made up of protein (to preserve lean muscle mass).

>Research on the long-term safety of ketotic

Actually, there has been some research done on it. Like I said, the results 
showed short term use will not be harmful. But long term use is harmful for several
reasons. Unfortunately I don't have the refs handy. 

If you decide to try the ketogenic diet you should also go to a drug store
and buy what are called "keto sticks."  This are little pieces of paper that you 
put your urine on - they change color if you are in ketosis. This sounds gross,
but it is important to do becasue it is the only way you will be able to tell if you
are in ketosis or not. If you are not, then the diet will not be effective because you
will still be buring carbs for fuel instead of fat. Contrary to what some people say,
you can not just "eat whatever you want" on this diet becasue you will still 
have to create a caloric deficit in order to burn fat; so you will not be able to "pig out."

I must warn you though: It takes an *enourmous* amount of self discipline to stay
on a ketogenic diet. Here is why: your brain chemistry gets all out of wack. Your
body uses carbs to make seratonin, one of the brain's neurotransimittors. (It is the
"happiness" neurotransimitter.) If your body has so few carbs that it goes into 
ketosis, it will most likely not have enough to make seratonin. As a result,
your body will "tell you" you should eat more carbs. You will have the most
horrendous carb cravings you have ever experienced. But if you pig out on
carbs at this point, you will gain even more weight because your metabolism
will have slowed from the reduced carb and calorie diet. 

One way to mitigate
the seratonin problem is to use some sort of drug or supplement that creates
seratonin or prevents the breakdown of it. The drug dex-fenfluramine (formerly
used in phen-phen and Redux) did this, but it has some bad side effects. Some 
bodybuilders I know use methamphetamines for this purpose, (and also to speed 
up their metabolism) but obviously this is not a good idea. You could use 
Prozac which is a Selective Serotonin Reuptake inhibiter (SSRI) which might help.
But my suggestion would be to use a combination of the herb St. Johns Wart
which also acts as a natural SSRI without ANY known negative side effects (perhaps 
nasuau) and maybe some dexitrim which also helps.

So no, you won't be "hungry" on a ketogenic diet, but you will still crave carbs to 
make seratonin. OTOH with a high carb diet you end up being hungry all the time 
because your body releases and burns all the carbs very quickly, and doesn't
have enough of the "slow burning fuel" (eg protein and fat) to maintain level
blood sugar levels. "All things in moderation." -- Ben Franklin. I have found 
that for a normal diet I get the best results with 40-45% carbs, 35-40% protein,
and 20% fat. For losing fat I do 45% protein, 35% carbs, and 20% fat, just with
lower than normal calories. But everyBODY is differnet. YMMV. You will have to see 
what works best for you. Everyone has an individual learning curve about
his or her own body.

Yes, most people regain lost weight. The key to keeping it off in general is to 
make total life style changes. Make eating healthy and excercising a regular
part of your life. Most people fail becaus they aren't willing to do it permanently;
they see it as a short term "fix". Need motivation?: If you are striving for 
immortality just ask yourself the question "what is more important to me, life,
or a cheesburger?" I haven't looked at a cheesburger since. :-) 

The key to keeping off the weight after a ketogenic session is to come off of 
it gradually, and not eat too many carbs at once. Keep your total calories the
same, but gradually shift the macronutrient composition to more (but not too
many) carbs. Once you are back to your revised carb intake level, then you 
may be able to increase calories without gaining much weight. You might 
want to increase your excercise when you do this though. 

BTW - you shouldn't ever try to lose "weight" you should try to lose *fat* You
should go to a gym and have your body composition measured. Scales should
really not be your progress guage. Maintaining muslce is important because
it has a high metabolism (and you do want to be able to move don't you ;-).

Also - I have never seen a fat loss program work that did not include excercise.
For best results I would recommend a combination of weight training *AND* cardio. 
         
Hope this helps.

Sin,
Jason

Low GI is good for diabetics (and probably for the rest of us) but low-carb
isn't.
They used to recommend low-carb diets for diabetics, for precisely the reason
you
describe.  However, in the 50's studies showed that diabetics on high-carb
diets
outlived those on low-carb diets, with better health.  Ever since, the
standard 
recommendation has been high-carb, low-GI.

It is possible to get your fats and protein from vegetable sources
(which wouldn't include whey or egg).  However, you cannot
eat anything that's not processed down to components.  Even
avocados and peanuts have too much carbohydrate for a ketogenic
diet.

Thanks for your first-hand information on ketogenic diets.  I wasn't
aware that anybody had done any research on long-term ketosis and
would greatly appreciate those references.  Short-term OK, long-term
bad is certainly a reasonable result.

As an unrelated quote...  It IS the United States Government, yes?  Not the
"so-called" USG?

I'd like to be able to do whatever I want with my own body.  (The FDA and
the religious right disagree with me.)  I'd like to be able to speak
freely; even if I'm on television.  I don't want to fight/die for the
voting majority, even if the voting majority decides it would be a good
idea to draft me.  I want to buy what I want, and only what I want, from
whomever I choose.  (Right now I am forced to pay for whatever the
government does; I want to stop paying for it if I don't want it.)

>What prevents you from achieving what you want?

A voting majority, sadly.

>What prevents 
>you from puttinging in place the practical means to achieve the above?

Well, I could try to convince the whole electorate to change their minds
about all of these things and more; I do try to convince as many as
possible.  It isn't working, at least for now.  And I will never be able to
get everyone to agree with me.

So, in light of that, I'd like to go secede by myself, and not bother
anyone with my weird ideas about liberty/justice.

Agreed. (Although I wish aging was homeostatic :-)

>homeostatic and not just short-term homeostatic?

Sorry, I should have been more specific. I was referring primarily to 
long term human emotional states. Clearly not all procesees that comprise
human consciousness are homeostatic.

For example, if you were to take a starving, battered Kurd and provide
him/her with the lifestyle of the "average american" (whatever that is),
the kurd would likely be exstatic - would have an "enhanced" emotional
state of consciousness if you will. However, after some time, what 
usually happens is that that persons consciousness returns to "homeostasis"
to a point where s/he would no longer be in that exstatic, elevated state.
(In this example) living this new lifestyle would eventually become "normal"
and blase. 
 
This same phenomenon occurs with people who win the lottery.

Haven't you ever notced, either in yourself or from watching others, that often
the times of greatest pleasure are ones that involve _change_
from one situation to a much better situation. Regardless of how
"good" either of the sitatutions "actually" are.

Hmmm, maybe this could be a small part of why humans either 
end up being unhappy (like so many of the "average people" are)
or they end up engaging in extropic persuits.

But this is starting to get onto the topic being covered in the 
Re: Definitions for Transhumanism thread.

I absolutely agree that it can already be overcome to some degree.
Primarily by those people who work at it. Most people do not.

What is wrong with having a highly dynamic personality? I suspect that
this may become quite common in post humans.

Sin,
Jason

In an earlier message you said:

So you cannot be sure whether the number of intersexual babies has increased. But how can you say that it is "most likely" a path of our own evolution?

In which way would an intersexual be more fit to its (for lack of a better pronoun) environment than its male or female friends? Heterosexuality is a very important concept, both for reproduction and socialization. Zoophilia, homosexuality, pedophilia, all these are likely to have evolutionary origins, but I cannot see a possible use for intersexuality.

With the very low number of occurances, it appears to me that it is just a "bug", a random mutation. Now you tell me that the bug is actually a feature :-)

OK, so you believe that the kid's identity is impaired after "fixing" his sexuality. Are there any psychological studies supporting this view? I grant that it is difficult to do such studies if all attempts are blocked because of such "bugfixes".

Intersexuals are, as described by the ISNA, among other features, characterized by either a small penis or a large clitoris.  Won't these attributes rather lead to isolation? So far you have not presented any evidence that the "fix" is not really a "fix".

With today's society, it is not at all unlikely that raised intersexuals would end up in modern freak shows or perverted pornos. I think that, in a society with other motives and more tolerance, it would be no problem to integrate intersexual individuals, but in the one we have, it might be one.

I agree with you Anders. I feel most motivated to improve when I'm feeling
*good*. Perhaps we should distinguish unhappiness from dissatisfaction. I'm
never satisfied with who I am and where I am and so seek improvement, but
that doesn't mean I'm unhappy. Dissatisfaction can co-exist with happiness
if you have the capacity to see how you (and your situation) could be
better. That doesn't mean you can't enjoy the way you are now. I explained
this point at more length not long ago when asked by an audience member in
Madrid if transhumanists are all unhappy because they seek change.

Dear transhuman friends,

In my most recent post, I was referring to Max More as that "guy" who
defined "transhumanism".  

The gracious practice would be to include those who originally defined
words into the discussion.  The definitions of both "transhuman" (FM) and
"transhumanism" has been published.  And, as I understand it,
"transhumanism" is going into a dictionary.

In explaining ideas to people, what is needed is concise definition and a
manner of explanation that allows individuals who are new to concepts to
grasps the new ideas easily.  This is usually done in stepping-stone ways;
one idea building upon another so that the our ideas are expressed
carefully, openly and reasonably.  Our ideas are fairly far-reaching for
most people, and the best way to do this is not by definition alone, but by
an expression that is inclusive.

Here I'll refer to both Max More's editorial comments in the most recent
Extropy Newsletter where he explains beautifully his thoughts and feelings
on the subject.  Also, Chris Peterson is quite effective in expressing new
ideas to people in a manner that is inclusive.

So, to sum up my point, it is my understanding that definitions can be
concise and effective, and further writings on the subject can be expressed
in a manner that draws people in.  

I'd like to suggest that if we want to redefine "transhuman" let's bring
FM-2030 into the picture.  

If we want to redefine "transhumanism", let's bring Max More in on the
discussion.

We are not such an isolated community that we can go around redefining
words when the folks that defined them are within earshot.  Wouldn't it be
more gracious to include them?

What if I wanted to redefine "nanotechnology."  Would I be wise to include
Drexler in the conversation?  Or, if I wanted to redefine the
"Singularity," I might speak with Vinge about it.  FM has been working in
the field of future studies and social sciences for decades.  He is the
first to teach about transhuman ideas.  He wrote the first book about
transhumans.  Shouldn't we put a call into him for his opinion?  Max
authored the first journal on transhumanism, and made it a philosophy.
Shouldn't we speak with him about this?

I'm just waiting for someone to redefine Transhumanist Art and to write a
new Transhumanist Art Statement.  I would be terribly hurt and stunned if
that person(s) didn't first speak with me about it.  

Thank you.

Long Life!

Natasha

I think you take the word 'evolution' to literally here. It seems to
be used a lot on this list instead of the dreaded and pass 'progress'
or 'development'.

I would rather say intersexuals might be important since their
existence undermines the traditional (and IMHO unhealthy) binary view
of gender. If more people are allowed to develop *their own* gender
identity (and then correct their bodies to fit it) there will be less
resistance to us who have developed a slightly different species
identity and want to fix it...

I know Kathryn will likely have much more information on this, but it
seems that at least of the some of the cases earlier reported as
"successful" have turned out to have been mistakes. (Diamond, M.C. &

If the definition of "transhuman" is given along with a definition of
"transhumanism" and of "posthuman" then there shouldn't be a problem.

The usual procedure, at least among academics, when considering a revised
definition of an accepted term, is to refer to the existing definition.
There's no point in creating a new definition unless some shortcoming is
found with the original. In that spirit, here, again, is my definition:


TRANSHUMANISM: Any philosophy of life (such as extropian philosophy) that
seeks the continuation and acceleration of the evolution of intelligent
life beyond its currently human form and human limitations by means of
science and technology, guided by life-promoting principles and values.
[Max More, 1990]

You might replace "evolution" by "development" if you want to only use
"evolution" in its strict technical contemporary sense of a change in
frequency of alleles. (I say "contemporary" because, of course, "evolution"
had a meaning long before we knew about alleles.)

Onward!

Yes, but are you now happy to stay at the level you are at?  What if further
growth was prohibited? Would you become unhappy then?  I think you might.
Actually satisfied might be a better term than happy.  It is true that
depression brings on lethargy, mainly because of a sense of hopelessness.  I
think many of us are happy precisely because we are changing and growing.
Stifle us and watch us wither on the vine.

Anders made the additional point that people have different ideas about what
growth is.  But the particular path one might choose may not be as important
as our drive to walk down it.

OK, I see what you mean. 

The two examples are actually slightly different. In both there is a
sudden emotional change, but it is temporary (this is what you refer
to as homeostasis). But in the lottery example, there is no real
change in circumstances: the world looks about the same, and the
person's cognitive model is not changed - there is just more money. So
usually it is spent in accordance with the person's personality and
reality map, which doesn't lead to any dramatic changes. Compare this
to moving to a different culture: you cannot avoid it, it is a
persistent pressure forcing you to re-value your old maps. People who
move to a new culture do change, and does not return to their old
selves when they move back to the old land.

One could perhaps model this as elastic and plastic deformation: if
you squeeze a rubber eraser it will quickly return to its original
shape, but if you leave it clambed overnight it will be permanently
deformed.

"Good" is not a scalar potential function (to use a physical analogy
again), it changes. I think the concept of flow (a la Mihly
Cskszentmihlyi ) is a good model for when we achieve true
happiness. He suggested that we achieve it when we feel that our
abilities are just right for the task at hand, they are being
exercised at their fullest, but we also make progress. It is then we
use our true capacity, and this creates what he calls mental order and
leads to a growth process (I'm mangling his argument awfully here). So
it is the task of moving from one situation to the other that is
important, the start and end states are less important (even if it is
of course much easier to feel good while moving towards a better
state).

> What is wrong with having a highly dynamic personality? I suspect that

It is not the dynamic personality that is troublesome (we already
switch our personalities slightly to fit the situation), it is having
a highly dynamic set of core goals and values that is bad. If they are
too fluid, they shift before any goals can be achieved and hence the
individual becomes very inefficient.

And let's not forget the computer industry: Andy Grove was an
immigrant starting from nothing to create Intel; Jobs and Wozniak
started Apple with money from selling a car.  Even Bill Gates,
that icon of evil, has made more _employees_ millionaires than
anyone else in history, many of whom take the money and start
their own companies.

Horatio Alger may be fiction, and success may have as much to
do with luck as with hard work (honest capitalists never claim
otherwise), but it clear can and does happen.

Victims of gender "reassignment" almost universally have many
psychological problems.  Of course, without a controlled study,
there's no way to know that they wouldn't have had worse problems
without the procedure--but it isn't necessary to know exact
results of the procedure to stop it for moral reasons: It is
simply morally repugnant to mutilate a child without eir consent,
so whether or not it "works" is irrelevant.  Such doctors
deserve jail time, not research grants.

I agree with you. You will not achieve freedom by working "within the system." But you 
*can* "secede by yourself," at least in certain ways. Just do so as *quitely and 
 inconspicuously* (sp?) as possible.

I agree with the principles you list.

But based upon my first comment above: If you want to put something into 
your body that the people at the FDA don't like, then find ways you can do
so without getting caught. Speaking freely on televsion I wouldn't recommend
because that is too high profile. You can easily avoid the draft. They can't 
draft you if they can't find you. Or if "they" don't know you exist ...
You *can* buy what you want from whom you want - as long as the other
party agrees. Unfortunately, the bureau-rats have many people scared to
sell certain things - they perceive the risk as to great ...
You *can* stop paying for the "services" the "government" provides you
 any time you want. See http://www.buildfreedom.com

Jason

There is a new factor that isn't acknowledged in your argument above,
and that is that our confiscatory tax system has grown immeasurably
MORE confiscatory since the above gentleman were able to make their
fortunes.  In other words, it is much more difficult nowadays, with
greatly increased gov't taxation on our incomes and everything else
within sight, to save enough to go into one's own business.  

In addition, inflation by the Federal Reserve has eaten away the value
of our money, drastically.  Just compare prices for a commodity from,
say, the 50s to their present prices, and you will see just how much
purchasing power the dollar has lost.  

These facts would make the gentleman's argument more true than false,
IMO.

      Agreed. After rereading what I had written I realized I had made a mistake. 
      Can I rephrase my statement to say: there are certain times when using 
      force is necessary and appropriate, and other times when it is not. I generally
      accept the libertarian principal of using force only for ones self defense and not 
      "pro-actively." The trick and question is knowing when it is approropriate and 
 necessary, and who gets to decide.  

Up here in New Hampshire (yup, here I go again), as well as across the river
in Vermont, we have possibly the highest per capita level of gun ownership in
the industrialized world, and probably the one of the highest in the entire
world, yet I challenge anyone on this list to name one European or other
industrialized nation of the same size or larger as our state, that has a more
restrictive gun policy yet has a lower crime rate. You can't. 

      "An armed "society" is a polite "society" -- I forget who said this but I think it
       is appropriate here.  (quotes are mine). Again, I generally agree with you. I am 
       certainly not a proponent of "gun control" (so-called). My intention in my origional
       statement was only meant to imply 1)that *I* would prefer to avoid violence and 2)
       that sometimes using "more sophisiticated means" is appropriate. "More sophisticated
       means" might include assasinating a dictator like Hitler in an early time frame before 
       he had the opportunity to start a war, rather waiting until you have a full blown war.
       "More sophisticated means" may also mean using non-violence. For example, I think
        the IRS is little more than mafia with good PR. But instead of starting a violent 
        revolution to overthrow the IRS, I simply arrange my affairs so I don't support them
        in any way. 

       I hope this clears up my point.

      Sin,
      Jason

I wouldn't be surprised. What this guy says he eats comes to about 500
calories a day.

that also goes for the Relativism and Ethics file, the

most people can't read these, and since the others are already reading

List members:

I seem to have a problem with my email account.

Someone sent me the following:
      >>Would you be kind enough not to post attachments with your e-mails to the
>>ExI List?  It takes while to download them.

And I responded:
>My apologies. I did not realize I had done this; it was unintentional. 
>I will attempt to correct the problem.

Has anyone else been experiencing a problem with my posts having 
attachments? I am trying to figure out what the problem is.

Assistance or feedback on this problem would be appreciated.

Thanks.

Yes.

Yes. This is why I like to move a lot. It is one way of expanding your =
cognitive map.

Exactly! Some people, after dramatic life experiences, change their =
cognitive=20
map *permanently* so that *they do not return to a state of =
homeostasis.* And that is=20
exactly what I was talking about as a goal in my first message.

Except I mean this change in a positive way. For example, I have read of =

a Jewish surviver of  the holocost, and he was exstatic about every day =
he was still=20
alive. That was such a horrible experience for him - which he used as a =
"relative=20
reference point" - that everything else he experienced afterwards was =
wonderful by=20
comparison. Although ideally you would not have to go through a terrible =
life=20
experience to acheive this.

"Once a man's [or woman's] mind has been stretched to a new dimension,
it never quite returns to the shape it was before." -- Oliver Wendall =
Holmes

>"Good" is ... it changes.=20

Agreed. That was partly my point.

>I think the concept of flow (a la Mih=E1ly
>Cs=EDkszentmih=E1lyi ) is a good model for when we achieve true

I agree. I have read "Flow..." and I think it is a wonderful book. I
highly recomend it. Although I don't know how you remembered
his name correctly. :-)

>So

Agreed. It is the journey, not the destination. (OK, so it is BOTH). :-)

>It is not the dynamic personality that is troublesome (we already
>switch our personalities slightly to fit the situation), it is having
>a highly dynamic set of core goals and values that is bad. If they are

Also agreed. I misunderstood what you meant. Dynamic personality
is not the problem. *Self-conflicting* dynamic personality is a problem.

      Sin,
      Jason

The person was just getting up your nose.  While your messages *do* contain an
attachment (turn it off by setting to 'send plain text only' in your address
book settings for this list) but they are approximately the same size as the
original text anyway - only a few milliseconds of download time is added.  This
is common for users of Microsoft email clients, so everyone go and look at your
setting to make sure you are set correctly.

I bet the person who complained is also the sort that starts beeping at traffic
lights if the cars don't start moving within 1/8 of a second.

Except that the argument was not that taxation makes going into business
more difficult, but that it is impossible, because the non-capital owning
proletariat cannot afford it, being as poor as we are.

I totally agree with your point, but it is an argument for decreasing/
reorganizing taxation, not to eliminate privately-owned capital.

While I can't answer the point about the Plank moment, I can answer your
point about the time difference being "a function of the measuring
mechanism itself."  While this may actually be the case, this is NOT what
is happening if you presume that light in a vacuum travels at the same
speed in all reference frames.  Here's why.

Suppose you have two observers, Alice and Bob.  Alice is on a train, moving
horizontally relative to Bob, at a speed v.  Now suppose Alice has a simple
mirror attached to the ceiling of the train and a lightbulb on the floor,
which she uses to measure the time it takes light to travel from the floor
to the ceiling and back.  If we define the distance D to be the distance
between the ceiling and the floor, she should measure that

	t_a = 2D/c.  (1)

where c is the speed of light in a vacuum.  (See Figure 1.)

      Figure 1 	             Figure 2

        ---                      ---
         ^|                      /|\
         || D                   / | \
         ||                    / D|  \L
         |v                   /   |   \
        -*-                  * ------> * 
                                v*t_b


However, Bob will see something VERY different.  He will also see the light
leave the lightbulb, hit the mirror and strike the lightbulb again, but in
his reference frame the lightbulb has moved a distance v*t_b (where v,
again, is the speed at which Alice is moving relative to Bob, and t_b is
the time the light travels in Bob's reference frame).  So he sees the light
travelling twice the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed
by v*t_b/2 and D, whose length is given by the Pythagorean Theorem to be:

L^2 = D^2 + (v*t_b/2)^2.  (2)

(See Figure 2.)

It is worth now pointing out that if it were simply a ball bouncing up and
down in this train, Bob would observe t_b=t_a, since Alice and Bob are not
moving vertically to one another.  Thus he would observe the speed of the
ball to be c_b=L/t_a, and Alice would observe c_a=D/t_a.  This is the form
of relativity we're used to; just as one runner appears motionless to the
runner next to him travelling at the same velocity, or how trees appear to
be moving relative to you when you drive past them in a car.  We naturally
observe different speeds as our speeds change.

However, when we presume the speed of light to be constant, something
entirely different happens.  In this case, Bob must observe

t_b = 2L/c (3)

where c is *the same c observed by Alice*.  Solving for D in equation (1),
we get

D = c*t_a/2 (4)

which we can substitute in equation (2):

L^2 = (c*t_a/2)^2 + (v*t_b/2)^2. (5)

Now if we solve equation (3) for L^2

L^2 = (c*t_b/2)^2 (6)

and eliminate L^2, we get

(c*t_b/2)^2 = (c*t_a/2)^2 + (v*t_b/2)^2 (7).

To solve this equation for t_b, we can multiply both sides by 4 = (1/2)^2

(c*t_b)^2 = (c*t_a)^2 + (v*t_b)^2 (8),

subract (v*t_b)^2 from both sides and factor t_b from the left,

(c*t_b)^2 - (v*t_b)^2 = (c*t_a)^2 = t_b^2*(c^2 - v^2)

then divide both sides by (c^2 - v^2) and divide the numerator and
denominator by c^2

t_b^2 = (c*t_a)^2/(c^2 - v^2) = t_a^2/(1-v^2/c^2)

and finally take the square root of both sides:

t_b = t_a/(1-v^2/c^2)^0.5

What does all this mean?  Well, suppose v = 0.6c, or 60% the speed of
light, and t_a = 10 seconds.  Plugging into the equation above, we get t_b
= 12.5 seconds, where we SHOULD have gotten t_b = 10 seconds if c_a != c_b.

At this point, you should be saying to yourself "OK, nice math.  But does
it actually apply to reality?  That is, IS c the same in all reference
frames?"

Which is, of course, the job of scientists to determine.  And fortunately
for us incoherent relativists [ ;) ], they have given us plenty of evidence
that this theory is precisely correct.  For example, according to this
theory, the speed of an object approaches c as the kinetic energy
approaches infinity, contrary to what Newton's laws would have told you.
And sure enough, in 1964, W. Bertozzi accelerated electrons to various
measured speeds and measured their kinetic energy using a different method.
 As we all had expected, their kinetic energy did increase, but their speed
did not.

Not conclusive enough for you?  Well, it has also been observed that muons,
which have an average lifetime of 2.200 microseconds, have an average
lifetime of 63.5 microseconds when moving at 0.9994c relating to the
laboratory; precisely the value predicted by special relativity.

Still not conclusive enough?  Physicists at the University of Maryland
performed an experiment which involved taking a high-precision clock and
flying it around Chesapeake Bay at extremely high velocities; they verified
the time dilation predicted by this experiment to better than 1%.

I must admit that at first, while I was immediately convinced that IF we
presume that the speed of light is constant in all reference frames, time
must dilate in the manner prescribed here.  However, it took a great deal
of experimental evidence before I was convinced that this was actually the
case.  Check it out for yourself.  I got most of the information here from
_Fundamentals of Physics, 5th Edition_ by Halliday, Resnick and Walker.
(Further reference upon request.)

Verification is complete.  It is not metaphysical, it is repeatable and
observable to within 1%.

Perhaps not, but the reason we accept both is because both theories predict
the behavior of the world around us to as close as we can measure.  One day
we may find the true model, but until then we accept these models because
they work.

However, I take offense at charges of dogmatism.  People only confuse
science and religion until they actually start taking a look at the very
real repeatable experiments which have been performed throughout this
century.  Mysticism and dogmatism can never provide such evidence.

Good for you!  I don't believe much of that garbage either.  There hasn't

That's fine.  Many accomplished scientists, who agree with special/general
relativity and accept QM reject the idea of basement universes.

This, however, is not true.  Remember that absolute speed of light
constant, presumed above?  Well, as Bertozzi showed, increasing the kinetic
energy STILL doesn't increase the speed faster than c; and since it
doesn't, you STILL can't extract matter from a black hole, no matter how
hot it gets.

Depends on what you mean by continuum, and what effects you claim this has
on physical objects.  As empirically observed above, velocity DOES affect
the way time flows, but a lot of people use the space-time continuum to
explain all kinds of kooky things.

>The Planck moment is

This is an interesting one which I haven't heard talked about much.  Does
the Plank moment dilate along with the rest of time?  Does anybody here
know much about this?

This sentance doesn't make any sense to me, even after I looked up the noun

Statistical thermodynamics, too?  What's up, guy?  

Information is a signal which reduces uncertainty.

It is a similarly common fallacy to say that there can be information in a

And as to your thoughts on abortion, I have this to say:

Your position is not empirical until you prove that the fetus is living
organism which can be killed.  (The finger, for example, cannot be
"killed," even though the cells in the finger can die.)  Most, if not all
people who support abortion do NOT think that the fetus can be killed.

I concede that you do have a concrete definition of what's living and
what's not, and within this context, you are 100% correct.  However, this
is not a sufficient proof.  I could just as easily say that a person cannot
be killed until they are born.

So here's a quick course on logic for you:

You cannot prove an assertion by defining your assertion to be true.  To
provide a logical argument, use COMMON definitions.  If two parties do not
use definitions, you must use other common definitions to show why the
other definitions are wrong.  But anyway you run it, we have to use
premises upon which everyone agrees in order to have a logical discussion.

I challenge you to prove, using definitions and premises upon which we both
agree, that abortion is immoral; if you can't or won't, then don't try to
have a logical argument with me.

Have fun!

This would be relevant if the person originating this were arguing

Holding significant savings primarily in currency-denominated assets 
has not been wise for a very long time.  Inflation should have no 
effect on the rate of savings; it should merely move those savings 
even more toward equity as opposed to currency-denominated assets.

Inflation will not affect a person's ability to transform equity 
assets into a self-owned business.  In fact, if the market perfectly 
anticipated and allowed for inflation (it's never PERFECT -- merely 
better than any real-world-credible alternative we've thought of 
yet), inflation would have absolutely no effect on that person's 
ability to borrow money to help start the business -- and later repay 
the loan.

Your opinion is mistaken, partially because these "facts" are as much 
conclusion as fact, and the conclusion is wrong; and partially 
because the actual facts you cite constitute an argument AGAINST his 
position.

> Horatio Alger may be fiction

No, Horatio Alger was extremely real.  He was an author.

The funny thing is, Horatio Alger wrote no "Horatio Alger stories".

The classic Horatio Alger story is like the guys I mentioned: young 
man gets rich through hard work.

The actual stuff Horatio Alger wrote was more a socialist's parody of 
that: young man gets rich through marrying the boss's daughter.

> and success may have as much to

Many honest capitalists also point out that you shouldn't give luck 
only one chance to happen to you.  There are any number of rich 
people who will tell you they started on a shoestring -- and the 
shoestring broke.  So they worked as employees for a few years and 
saved up enough money to buy another shoestring.  And maybe the third 
or fourth shoestring actually held up long enough to get rich off of.

What?  With the socialists claiming that under capitalism an employee 
can't save enough in a lifetime to become a business owner, I'm 
claiming that under capitalism an employee can do so IN A FEW YEARS?

Yep.  Absolutely.  

My own father did so at least three times between 
1960 and 1974.  (Unfortunately he was a lousy businessman, and never 
managed to make the shoestring hold up; basically both his business 
and the family he was raising had to live off his savings.)

In the current Australian case, it isn't that simple.  We're not talking
about unskilled people being replaced by machines to do the hod-carrying.
Stevedoring is already a fairly skilled business.  For what it's worth,
here are some comments from an article in The Australian, our major Murdoch
newspaper (quoted without permission of the writer, Mike Steketee):

`The Government has enforced the principle that union membership should not
be a requirement for working on the wharves... but...at a significant
cost... security guards and savage dogs dragging employees from their
workplaces in the middle of the night.

`This was heavy-handed action, accompanied by a sneaky shuffle... of
corporate assets to try to escape liability [of breach of Act] which
prohibits the dismissal of employees because they are union members.  Its
success in terms of public acceptance relies on Australians being persuaded
by the demonisation of the wharfies in which the Government has engaged.

`In truth... they have accepted change, including a more than halving of
their numbers as a result of reforms - achieved by negotiation... 

`So what mortal sin have the wharfies committed to warrant their wholesale
sacking?  It boils down to an hourly container movement rate perhaps 25 per
cent below world's best practice (bulk cargo rates are already at the
international benchmark, though that did not stop Patrick employees in
these areas getting the sack as well).  This is an improvement worth
having, but does it require such brutal action?'

Mike Lorrey might be correct that this is mercantilism rather than
capitalism.  I can't say, not being a theologian.  But it sounds to me
rather like guns against heads in one of the advanced non-communist nations
of the First World.  (Do note that I am not saying anything about the
merits of stevedores as wonderful caring human beings, nor trying to deny
their own record of thuggish intimidation, theft, industrial sabotage. etc.
 I am simply responding to the claim that capital operates differently from
socialist state enforcement.)

Boy, what a weird site.  Gotta love that internet.

They don't have a ketogenic diet (in the Atkins sense).  It's mostly
carbohydrates.  It looks like a natural hygeine/food combining diet
to me.  If the number of calories is as low as Susan Cherwin
calculated, it will send you into ketosis because it's a starvation
diet.  But that's not the Atkins method of depriving your body of 
carbohydrates so that it can't run the citric acid cycle.

I'm not sure I understand.  Do you mean McDonald's, as a matter of
pride, pays all its workers some amount more than the minimum (always
staying a little bit ahead as the politicians jack it up)?  Or do you
mean merely that without a minimum Ebenezer Scrooge can hold his head
high in public?

(Ebenezer Scrooge is a miser in a book by Charles Dickens; I have no
idea how well-known it is outside the Anglophone world)

Where instead of being able to turn to the police if their employers
abuse them (e.g. by not paying wages when due), they must hide FROM the
police.  Wonderful.

Don't we?  You trust the pedestrians on the street not to stab you.  You
trust the waiters at restaurants not to poison you.  You trust your
neighbors not to rob you (have you never lent your key to a neighbor to
feed your cat while you're away?).

If we did not mostly trust each other, crime would be largely
impossible!

We have government (in the broad sense which includes PPAs, contracts,
custom etc) to protect us against a TINY MINORITY of badguys.  The
state, which depends for its livelihood on a public perception of its
necessity, puffs itself up by exaggerating what threats exist (Saddam is
going to conquer the world if we don't get him!) and inventing new ones
(pornography on the internet! protect our children!).

A couple of interesting data:
Most ethnic groups in the USA are *less* violent than their home
countries.  (Sorry I can't recall where I heard this)
The state where it's easiest to carry a gun (Vermont) has very low
crime.  States that have recently made it easier, like Florida, have
falling crime rates.

I'll take my chances with "just any guy with a gun," thank you.

Bribes to hired managers, yes, but with private ownership there's always
a boss who has a motive to stamp out bribery.

Suppose I'm a robber and you're a police captain.  I offer you $100 a
week to ensure that I won't be arrested for any crimes in your precinct
(I steal $1000 in an average week).  Unless you have strong moral
scruples, you accept:  the stuff I steal doesn't come out of your pocket
-- on the contrary, if my robberies make the news, you may get a bigger
budget.

But suppose you're a PPA owner.  If I steal $1000 from your customers,
they (in aggregate) find your services worth $1000 less than otherwise. 
You may even be obliged by contract to pay for those losses (an
insurance structure).  So you won't accept my bribe unless it's more
than $1000, which of course I won't offer.

Now suppose you're a middle manager at a PPA.  You feel underpaid, so
you accept my $100.  Now your boss, the owner, finds that your
department is $1000 less profitable than before.  You run a substantial
risk of being fired for incompetence, even if the bribe is never
discovered.

Yes, in the broad sense: government may include the State, but it also
includes custom and contract, even if there are no private enforcement
agencies.  There are *still* small societies where enforcement is
entirely private, ad hoc.

Who enforces treaties?

A good scheme, but why can't it all be done privately?  Jews who keep

Such worries are misplaced.  Before long, every tycoon will be able to
*make* nukes.

I like to think that our institutions are open enough, and our people
are idealistic (naive?) enough, that such corruption would not be so
easy here.  We have institutions against corruption; they're far from
perfect, but they're more than Russia ever had.

(who?)

There's a novel, by the way, in which a Mafia takeover is portrayed as a
good thing: THE SYNDIC by Cyril Kornbluth.  I didn't find it entirely
satisfying - for one thing, the Mafia appear to be monopolists in all
the things you'd expect a state to do, while insisting that they're not
a government.

Perhaps part of the message of THE SYNDIC is that no matter what the
system is, people will get used to it and find retroactive
justifications for it.

On the other hand, J.Storrs Hall sketched a private nuclear insurance
against war (is that essay still somewhere in ExI archives?).  The
insurer gives potential aggressors a list of its clients, and promises
that if any of them is damaged by attack, the attacker's capital will
glow in the dark.

Maybe they'll all go to Switzerland.  Maybe they'll go to Africa, and
bring First World delicacy to the dictatorship business.  ;)  Either
way, not my problem.

Ex-politicians won't be a problem if, by then, the people have learned a

I have more faith in human nature.  With Big Brother gone, so long as no
one PPA controls more than about 1/3 of the available force (which
includes individuals with guns, not just other organized PPAs), it has
to worry that if it turns tyrannical ALL THE OTHERS will gang up and put
it out of business.

James Donald (whom I know from talk.politics.libertarian etc) says that
some gangs specialize in providing security services (and perhaps
adjudication, i dunno) to drug dealers.  He says of one such gang, whose
name I have alas forgotten, that so long as they stuck to the customary
business of terrorizing ordinary people, the police tolerated them; but
when they shifted to providing actual services to willing customers, Big
Brother smashed them.

I should bloody well hope so.  When I was a lad, the thought of going
into the military (or the police force) repelled me because I knew that
I'd be required to do some things I find morally abhorrent.  It
certainly does not comfort me to know that such institutions are
entirely staffed by people who lack my moral scruples.

They are controlled by officers who, by temperament (pre-selection) and
training, think in terms of command and obedience.  As David Friedman
put it, their jobs are clearly marked "nobody but control freaks need
apply."

Oh?  I thought it was about earning money for higher education.  ;)

In the United States, private citizens (including private armed guards)
shoot far more badguys than the police do -- and they shoot the wrong
person far *less* often.  I keep forgetting the ratio, but it's between
three and eleven.

And would answer to other PPAs on a charge of murder.

Those Marines, I'll bet, will never get more than a reprimand.  They are
protected by the mystique of the uniform: the institutions are reluctant
even to investigate the possibility that they did wrong, because their
commander (who may have a friend in Congress) is sure to whine about how
unfair it is that these fine boys, who sacrificed a promising career in
burglary or bar-bouncing to serve their country, should be "persecuted"
for just trying to do their jobs, fighting the good fight to keep
America free of those who would corrupt our children with pornography --
er, drugs ...

Iceland was never a hunter-gatherer society.  Its first inhabitants were
Irish monks; they were displaced (killed? we'll never know) by Norse
farmers.

Even that is dubious.  If you say too loudly that the War On Minority
Drugs is evil, your door will be broken down.  Unless of course you're
conspicuously and unquestionably conventional in all else, like
WFBuckley or the scattering of anti-prohibition politicians.

Well they let at least one pothead slip through.  ;)  If I were a
genuine terrorist, wouldn't I have six forged passports with six
different names?

My friend George O'Brien offered the opinion that such harassment is
meant to convey the message "we're in charge, so shut up and obey."  The
more of this crap I have to endure, the more compliant I supposedly
become, by force of habit.  (Neil Smith suggested that the same is true
of the semiannual time-change.)

Certainly this is the nut of the term, " a philosophy of life (such as

intelligent
life beyond its currently human form and limitations by means of
science and technology" edited with humble intentions, for the continuation of

   I don't think it is accurate to imply that only morality is used for 
anything.  Actually, the process of deciding to use the moral etiquette 
is in itself a rational to "faciliate the achievement of great aims".

I agree that attachments and other non-plain text messages are not appropriate
in a mailing list unless it serves an additional purpose.  I'm just trolling
really.

Like I said in a previous post, I apologize for any inconvenience.

I don't typically use MS mail programs because *I don't like using MS
products any more than you do*. Since I don't typically use this mail program,
I was not aware that the attachment was turned on by default.

I believe I have changed the appropriate option now, so it should
not send attachments anymore. Please let me know if this is the case
or not. Since this email program automatically translates any of
those types of attatchments *I have no way of knowing wether or
not I have corrected this problem without feedback from others.*
(The wonders of Microsoft.) The attachments don't show up on my 
end. So please let me know one way or the other.

And as soon as I get my new email account set up, and my new UNIX
box set up, I won't be using ANY of this MS crap AT ALL. 

I can understand the benefits of having a listserv policy of using only
plain text. I would have gladly followed that policy if *had I known my mail
program wasn't set for that.*

I hope I have this corrected now, and I hope we can all mellow out a bit on 
this topic. (I was a little freaked out by it myself, siince I didn't know what
the problem was.)

Pardon me for butting in, but IMHO the
impetus for change ought to come from
happy, not unhappy people, because
unhappy people may tend to harbor
feelings of envy, spite, or vengeance.
It becomes difficult to trust the
motives of unhappy people. Happy people,
in contrast, already know what it takes
to live life successfully, and can
therefore transmit the knowledge to
others. Happy, self-actualized folks
want to change the world so that 'more'
people can live happily and
successfully.

Examples of unhappy people who wanted to
change the world: Napoleon, Hitler,
Stalin, Mussolini (and his
granddaughter), Marx, Mao Zedong, etc.

Examples of happy, self-realized,
enlightened people who set out to change
the world include Buddha, Lao Tzu,
Krishna, Gurdjieff, Socrates, Galileo,
Max More, etc.

Those who plan to change the world
either want to share their own happiness
or they want revenge and requital. I'll
put my money on blissful, joyful,
prosperous pundits rather than on
miserable losers and sore heads.
Furthermore, people who know how to
effect change stand the best chance of
enjoying happiness in their own lives. I
believe many people remain unhappy
because they don't know how to change
themselves -- never mind change the
world.

>> would think when one controls matter

of twiddling brain biochemistry.

Perhaps so, but then your happiness
depends on continued twiddling of brain
biochemistry forever. Then you become an
addict (not to say a slave) to twiddled
biochemistry.

>> There would seem to be gene survival
advantages in the unhappy and
>> self-actualization-seeking human.

Then again, going extinct doesn't afford
much opportunity for happiness. No one,
AFAIK, has ever demonstrated that
self-actualization succumbs to seeking.
It rather arises when seeking ends.

Reason without spirit may lead to
apathy; spirit without reason usually
leads to lunacy. Although I neither
decry nor applaud apathy (good bumper
sticker there), I have no use for lunacy
either. I suspect that
self-actualization constitutes more of
an attainment than an achievement... it
has to do with giving yourself
permission to get over all the nonsense
they taught you in school.

Oops! Sorry. I didn't know that Eugene
and Randy used the term /self-actualize/
to mean /fulfill their goals/. I had
supposed that self-actualization meant
transcending goal-oriented existence. It
appears to me that as a mere human I
can't now comprehend what life will
render to transhumans who survive the
Singularity. But that suits me fine,
since the transhumans will undoubtedly
fully comprehend what life means to
humans. Just as the human embryo
undergoes  fish-like and reptilian
phases, so transhumans will likely go
through a human-like phase during their
formation.

That's strange, I see free market capitalists as "get back to basics"
people.  When compared to our natural systems, anarcho-capitalism is
the most conservative of all.  It actively promotes the individual,
competition, survival, and all the other aspects of Darwinism.  It
promotes the active expectance, and even advocacy, of genetically
pre-programmed drives. Perhaps many socialist systems should be best
considered as "reactionary" responses to this, but I consider the
general idea of "transcending" our genetic heritage to be sound
transhumanist thought.  I certainly see no reason to consider this
irrational.

And although anarcho-capitalism may make a nice "means" it is
certainly not the "end" - don't forget that we're transcending here. 
That is transcending forwards to something new, not backwards to
something been and gone.  And while I too can be accused of
questioning the rationality of morals and non-competitive behaviour
there is something behind them.  Collective intelligence and ability
to communicate emotional experience is leading to a greater move
towards moral complexity.  Is this good or bad?  It's certainly bad
for your system, but what about those darn socialists?

Subject: Knowledge Roles
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
Sender: postmaster@extropy.com
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

I'm in the process of writing 'Report #TL20: The Principles
of Meta-Knowledge.'  A section of the report will be titled
"Knowledge Roles."

I believe this section is relevant to all those involved
in improving and increasing their own knowledge as well as
that of others.

I would appreciate your comments and suggestions for improving
my classification and descriptions:


Knowledge Roles
===============

By "knowledge role" I distinguish between different ways
in which people tend to behave with respect to knowledge.
This section was considerably influenced by James Craig
Green's article 'ADVOCATES, SKEPTICS and SEEKERS' at
<http://pw2.netcom.com/~zeno7/advocates.html>.

I distinguish the following knowledge roles:

1. Advocate - Someone who has found some (hopefully) *useful
knowledge* (or "absolute truth") and actively attempts to
spread this knowledge or "truth" because it's *useful* or
"right."

2. Skeptic - Someone who has found some purported "knowledge"
or "truth" to be mistaken and sets about proving that it's
"wrong." 

3. Seeker - Someone who actively seeks to improve his or
her knowledge.  (A Seeker can also act as a Learner or an
Unlearner, or both.)

4. True Believer - Someone who believes he or she has found
"objective truth" or "absolute truth."  (A True Believer
could also act as an Advocate or a Skeptic.)

-----

According to Dr. Michael Hewitt-Gleeson -- 'Brain Freebie' course at
<http://www.sot.com.au/> -- the symptom of the True Believer is saying,
 "I have the truth" ... "My policy is the true policy" ... "My doctrine
is good and your doctrine is evil", or, perhaps, "Wasn't I lucky to be
born into that True Religion and now what are we going to do about you,
unbeliever?" It's a dangerous mental condition.  In the Preface of his
book 'The True Believers' Peter Bowler warns:

Here they come, the True Believers, wide-eyed and earnest; here they come,
the devotees, the fanatics, the evangelists, the pilgrims, the worshippers,
the contemplatives -- clutching their hymns and invocations, observing their
holy commandments and taboos, performing their sacrifices but, above all,
believing.  Believing in God, or in several gods, or even a goddess or two.
Believing in the soul, in demons, in eternal forgiveness, in eternal
punishment, in life after death, in assorted varieties of heaven and hell,
in the power of faith to heal, to move mountains...

They are and always have been, the idealists of humankind. Seeking
something beyond the material, something intangible, something to explain
the unexplainable, something to assuage their fear of the uncontrollable,
something to compensate them for the unacceptable, something to offer them
a kind of dignity and power in the midst of indignity and impotence.

Let us not mock the True Believer for their idealism. But watch out for
them -- they can be dangerous. Combative people, they are, by nature;
crusaders rather than compromisers. Because they are right, others are
wrong. The sinful must be punished, and who more sinful than the
unbeliever? The more intolerant and warlike among them seek to punish the
unbeliever in this life, with holy wars and inquisitions; the more
benevolent and tolerant leave it to their God to punish the unbeliever with
eternal torments after death.

>From time to time history has thrown up a sect that is gentle and moderate
and peace loving, like the Quakers or the Baha'i; invariably these sects
are singled out for the most ruthless persecution at the hands of the True
Believers.

When two religions are so similar as to be almost identical in every
significant respect then take cover, because the conflict between them will
be truly murderous. Buddhists and Presbyterians get along famously, but if
you are selling insurance you would be ill-advised to set up shop in
Palestine or Belfast."

-----

5. Rejector or True Unbeliever - Someone who tends to
automatically reject new, different information with
little or no thought.  The extreme Rejector might
claim that all knowledge is basically useless.  The
"Semmelweis-reflex" applies here -- see '#TL03: HOW TO
IMPROVE YOUR INFORMATION' at <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl03.htm>.

6. Onlygenius - Someone who believes he or she is the "only genius"
in the universe.  L. Ron Hubbard of Scientology infamy wrote along
these lines, "In all the history of Scientology there have been
only two or three good ideas that were not generated by me..."
I once shared some realization of mine with a Scientologist friend.
He asked me, "Did Ron say that?"  I said, "No, I said it."  He
replied, "Well, if Ron didn't say it, it can't be true!"  The
Onlygenius suffers from the N.I.H. Syndrome ("not invented here")
coupled with a strong dose of arrogance -- sometimes partly justified.
(The Onlygenius acts as a True Believer regarding his or her own
"absolute truth" and as a Rejector or True Unbeliever regarding the
knowledge of others.)

7. Lazymind - Someone who's not willing to invest any
effort or thought to improve his or her knowledge.  (Both
True Believers and Rejectors could also be Lazyminds.)
Lazyminds passively expect knowledge to be provided to them
on a platter.  For example, a Lazymind might say, "All this
Freedom Technology is written for Americans; I can't use it
anywhere else."

8. Infogetter - Someone who actively acquires the knowledge he
or she needs, adapting existing knowledge as necessary.  For
examples, see David T. Freeman's website at <http://www.mind-trek.com/>,
the "Wepin Store" at <http://www.wepin.com/>, and Bill Way's
website at <http://www.livefree.com/>.

9. Facilitator - Someone who has considerably developed his
or her knowledge and creates and provides facilities that
enable others to improve their knowledge -- without acting
as a know-all Advocate who commands "absolute truth."  (A
Facilitator basically acts as an Advocate, but also as a
Seeker seeking to become a more effective Advocate, while
remaining (to some extent) a Skeptic of his or her own
knowledge.)

The Facilitator's task is vastly more difficult than that
of the Seeker.  Once a Seeker has discovered or developed
some important knowledge people in general lack, he or she
may want to share this knowledge with the rest of the world.
Generally, he or she could attempt do this in the role of
either Advocate or Facilitator.

There are major differences between Advocate and
Facilitator.  Many Advocates just plug away at pushing
their line, sometimes year after year, producing little
or no positive results.  They tend to focus totally on
pushing their line at every opportunity.  Dr. Michael
Hewitt-Gleeson is an example of a successful Facilitator
-- <http://www.sot.com.au/>.

Successful Facilitators mostly act as Advocates,
but include some additional functions:
(1) They seek to learn how to identify and attract
prospects for their knowledge; they need to distinguish
between prospects and non-prospects.  They don't
want to waste precious time on non-prospects.
(2) Facilitators, while being largely Advocates,
focus totally on producing worthwhile results
effectively and efficiently.
(3) Successful Facilitator act as Seekers on at least
five levels:
(a) Identifying and attracting prospects;
(b) Seeking to learn how to become more
efficient and effective Facilitators;
(c) Seeking to better understand people in
general, so as to learn to improve interaction
with them;
(d) Seeking to use the interaction to further
improve their own knowledge;
(e) Seeking to improve their ability to observe,
particularly self-observation -- vitally necessary
to become a better Facilitator.
(4) Suceessful Facilitators always remain at least
"little Skeptics" concerning their own information.

10. Objectivist - Someone who believes in "objective knowledge"
and "objective truth."  Many Objectivists believe in "objective
morality."  Objectivists tend to act as True Believers of their
very rigid "objective knowledge" and "objective morality."
Objectivists tend to act as Seekers of "final answers" who
become Advocates of the "final answers" once they think they've
found them.

11. Positivist, Empiricist, or Realist - Someone who believes
that all knowledge needs to be based on physical observation
and experimentation; that physical objects exist independently
of the mind; that certain concepts like "mind" (as opposed to
brain), "self," and "consciousness" are illusions with no basis
in reality.

12. Subjectivist or Idealist - Someone who believes that
consciousness is senior to physical reality; that subjective
experience and feeling are superior to physical observation.
Plato's notion of "essence" or "ideal form" constitutes the
essence of subjectivism.  (Subjectivists may say, "It's all
in the mind" -- but when the bus bears down at them, they
mostly get quickly out of the way (like Realists) to avoid
being run over and killed!)

13. Egoist -- Someone who regards the self as supreme and
structures his or her knowledge to best serve himself or
herself.

14. Solipsist - Someone who believes that only the self exists,
and that all he or she can know are creations or modifications
of his or her self.

15. Questioneer - Someone with the ability or willingness
to question everything.  Someone who repeatedly asks certain
questions like, "How can I improve this?" and "What is right
about what I'm doing?"  For more details on some powerful
questions on the basis of which to live your life, see Kurt
Wright's 'Breaking the Rules' at <http://www.cpmpublishing.com/>.

16. Learner - A Seeker who has identified an area where he
or she needs to learn more -- an area of relatave ignorance
-- and actively learns whatever he or she needs to learn.
(A Learner could act as a True Believer who "learns" only
what his or her "master guru" Advocate tells him or her to
"learn.")

17. Unlearner - A Seeker (or "Self-Skeptic") who has identified
an area where he or she needs to unlearn certain things --
could be an area of "absolute truth" or arrogance -- and
actively unlearns whatever he or she needs to unlearn.
Because of the "truth" virus, arrogance, learning investment,
etc., it's sometimes more difficult to unlearn what you've
previously learned. Toward the end of 'Report #TL07G: NSPIC
DEBATE #3' at <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07g.htm>
there's a debate on unlearning.  For more on unlearning,
see 'Unlearning Ineffective or Obsolete Technologies' at
<http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~wstarbuc/unlearn.html>.  See also
'What is Unlearning?' at <http://www.mithya.com/what_Unlearning.html>.

18. Identifier - Someone who in his or her mentation
fails to make a distinction between word and thing (map
and territory or menu and meal) when the distinction is
necessary.  See '#TL07A: The Anatomy of Slavespeak' at
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.htm>.

During a debate I wrote:
>
>A thought process that will help some to recognize and
>clear pemes from their minds is to make a distinction
>between the *word* and the *reality* (or non-reality)
>the word is usually used to represent.  Next focus

>
(Peme = political meme -- see '#TL074: Peme-Theory -
Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced' at
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl074.htm>.)

Someone in the Identifier role doesn't distinguish
between the *word* on the one hand, and the *reality/
non-reality* on the other hand, the word is used to
represent.  Thus some or all of what I'm writing here
about the Identifier may make no sense to an Identifier.

Toward the end of 'Report #TL07G: NSPIC DEBATE #3' at
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07g.htm> there's a
discussion about "meta-literacy" -- the thinking skill
necessary to break out of the Identifier role and act
as a Distinctor.

19. Distinctor - Someone who can competently distinguish
in his or her mentation between *word* and *thing*.

-----

Toward the end of 'Report #TL07G: NSPIC DEBATE #3' at
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07g.htm> I also distinguish
four levels of literacy:

(0) No command of language -- can't speak, read, nor write.

(1) Illiterate -- can speak, but not read nor write.

(2) Literate -- can speak, read, and write with a reasonable
degree of proficiency.

(3) Meta-literate -- can transcend language and use language
to examine, analyze, and evaluate language; can change language
depending on appropriateness for any given situation. 

...Ayn Rand's analysis of the concept/word "selfishness" is a
level 3 activity.

This is a level 2 statement: Government exists.

Level 3: The notion that "government" (so-called) exists is silly.

The person stuck at level 2 [the Identifier] can't read a level 3
statement as it's written. So he compulsively distorts it into a
level 2 statement: Government doesn't exist.

...Level 2 statements are essentially about physical reality or
have the form and syntax of statements about physical reality.

Level 3 statements are essentially about verbal reality, the
relationships between verbal reality and physical reality, the
weaknesses, strengths, and consequences of verbal forms, and the
improvement of verbal forms. Level 3 statements are about the
effects words have on the way we perceive the world, the way we
think about the world, the way we communicate, and the way we
act. All these can be greatly influenced by the words we use."

-----

The Distinctor handles level 3 statements competently and
understands them easily.  The Identifier may have great difficulty
with level 3 statements and generally attmepts to change and distort
them into level 2 statements.

20. Wordblinder - Someone who is effectively unaware of the
verbal environment in which he or she lives, and relatively
blind to the influences of words on perception, thinking,
and behavior.  In '#TL076: TWILIGHT OF THE PHOBOCRATS' at
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl076.htm> there's a section
on a Wordblinder who claims, "Words don't hurt people, people
hurt people."  (A Wordblinder almost certainly also acts as an
Identifier.)

21. Whobeliever - ("Who-do-you-believer") Someone who thinks
that some or much of your knowledge depends on "who you believe."
(A Whobeliever probably tends to act as a Subjectivist or
Idealist.)

22. Weigher - ("Rational-weigher-of-theory-and-evidence")
Someone with the ability to collect evidence and theories,
or formulate theories based on the evidence, and who then
reaches reasonably rational conclusions.

Many years ago I had a discussion with a friend who was also
a health enthusiast.  I told him that I'd decided to give up
cow's milk and other dairy products.  He replied that he didn't
know who to believe because some people were pro-milk and others
anti-milk.  I realized that he didn't have a methodology for
weighing evidence and theories in order to come to a reasonably
rational conclusion.  He was acting as a Whobeliever.

In contrast, I collected considerable evidence and evaluated
theories related to aspects such as mucus formation, composition
of cow's milk vs. composition of human milk, calcium deposits
resulting in arthritis, optimum weaning age, etc.  Based on all
this I reached what I believe to be a reasonably rational conclusion.
I acted as a Weigher.  (A Weigher probably tends to act as a
Positivist, Empiricist, or Realist.)

23. Outmeaner - Someone who thinks meanings are outside himself
or herself, e.g., "words have meanings."  See '#TL50A: Semantic
Rigidity, Flexibility, and Freedom' at
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl50a.htm> and
'#TL07A: The Anatomy of Slavespeak' at
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.htm>.

24. Inmeaner - Someone who believes that he or she creates and
has all meanings, e.g., "people have meanings for words."  See
'#TL50A: Semantic Rigidity, Flexibility, and Freedom' at
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl50a.htm> and
'#TL07A: The Anatomy of Slavespeak' at
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.htm>.

25. Inevaluator - ("Intensional Evaluator") Someone who creates
mental models or representations based on personal internal
experiences, rather than external facts.  See '#TL07A: The
Anatomy of Slavespeak' at <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.htm>.
The Inevaluator tends to elevate words over facts -- he or she
tends to regard words as more important than facts.  For example,
a Godbeliever as Inevaluator might say, "I can't demonstrate any
observable facts that indicate God exists, but I've had many
religious experiences that have convinced me that God exists."
(Inevaluators also tend to act as Subjectivists or Idealists.)

26. Exevaluator - ("Extensional Evaluator") Someone who creates
mental models or representations based on observable external
facts, rather than personal internal experiences.  See '#TL07A: The
Anatomy of Slavespeak' at <http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07a.htm>.
The Exevaluator tends to elevate facts over words -- he or she
tends to regard facts as more important than words.  For example,
in thinking about so-called "AIDS," he might say, "OK, we have
this word "AIDS."  What facts are available to justify people
using this word the way they habitually do?" -- See section
below on ""AIDS": The Billion Dollar Word."  (Exevaluators tend
to act as Positivists, Empiricists, or Realists.) 

27. Fixer - Someone who's attitude toward knowledge (and life in
general) is: "Find out what's wrong and fix it."

28. Builder - Someone who's attitude toward knowledge (and life
in general) is: "Find out what's right and build on it."  For more
details on the benefits to the Builder, see Kurt Wright's 'Breaking
the Rules' at <http://www.cpmpublishing.com/>.

I apologize if I came in on this thread without the necessary awareness

money is needed for the day to day business of living.

Inflation is a true evil for any economy.  It is purely and simply theft

Here is one solution to the attachment problem:
Delete all MicroSwill mail client software from the HD

Works for me.

I am now using a different email client. Does this one include 
any attachments??

Thanks for the feedback

These two are in fact heavily intertwined, and it's allmost impossible
to tell which came first and how they mutually influenced eachother.
Morality itself is usually based on selfish hedonism: you (for ex.)
help people because it "feels right", increases your self-asteem and
you don't hurt people because that would you feel bad about yourself.
Of course "feeling good" or "feeling bad" can also be dependent 
on what *others* think of you. So you're either pleasing yourself directly 
or pleasing the crowd (to please yourself). As time goes by another 
mechanism kicks in: the reluctance (fear/laziness) to change. Even if the 
old pattern of behaviour no longer gives the desired result, you keep it 
anyway out of habit. 

There are plenty of other elements when it comes to the moral memetic
system, of course, but they all are more or less based on the punishment
vs reward system, whether the subject realizes this or not. "Morals" and
"ethics" are not some metaphysical, divine spark that's unique to (some)
humans, but rather primitive impulse mixed with some logic.

ER certainly encourages self-disciple, because it's very rational (useful).
The idea that one has to have eleborate, inefficient morals based on
a world view that's not in touch with reality in order to be "civilized" is
downright silly. "Infantile desires" are the core of our being, instead of
blindly suppressing them as you imply we should try to control their
flow in such a way that we get the most out of life. By the way, your
high morals are just another manifestation of primitive desires, the 
only difference is that they have been coated with some rhetoric fluff
to make them look like something else.

I saw this one coming from a mile away, that's why it said in the original 
message:

"Ah, you might say, that would mean folks like Hitler, Stalin, the IRA and
any damn street robber are enlightened. Not so. The other part of enlighten-
ment is seeking technotranscendence (immortality, increased intelligence,
physical strenght etc. through rational means like technology). To achieve 
this one needs a lot of foresight, which includes keeping a relatively low profile 
and (thus) minimizing the number of (potentially) dangerous enemies. Also, 
being nice can pay off in several ways, ranging from simply "a good feeling" to 
substantial material gain".

A touch of ad hominem? Actually, what I meant here is that making
moral codes with lots of elaborate rules (like many religions do) will
ultimately just backfire because hardly anyone can live up to all of
them. Breaking rules will thus become an integral part of the moral
memetic comlex, ultimately resulting in a neglect (open or secret)
of *all* the rules/guidelines, including the useful ones. It is much
more effective to reduce the number of rules (and dogmatism) to
a bare minimum, and base them on common sense instead of ideas
that fly in the face of human nature and logic. 

> The
> record of history shows that corruption, lies and blackmail always result
> from a lowering of moral standards, never from an elevating of them.  

The real problems only start when all parties know (deep inside) that the
rules are not sound, yet for the sake of "keeping up appearances" won't
admit that to one another. The result is a hypocrite, two-faced society
where problems aren't dealt with openly but are swept under the carpet. 
The "war on drugs" is a great example of this attitude.

Indeed.

In some cases, yes. But often it is a result of the "high standard" being 
extremely human-unfriendly without any sound, logical reason, other
than suppressing the population and teaching them "obedience". 
Although this may be useful and even necessary in some cases, 
overdoing it only makes life miserable for everyone involved.

> It is caused by an abrogation of parental

Many of the worst psychopaths come from families with strict (religious)
rules, and the ones that don't crack up completely will carry the scars
for life. Btw, this doesn't apply to me, I'm from a fairly liberal background.

E.R. firmly assumes that being alive is preferable to being dead. However,
this does not force the individual who values his own life to act in a "life
promoting" way towards *other* life forms. That's a *personal choice*, for
which one must carry *personal responsibility*. In a complex world as
ours a dogma like "must preserve all life" is not realistic/practical. It's
as arbitrary as a dogma that says "must bark like a dog and hop on one
foot every time I see a red car".

Theoretically, you could be right. In reality (which seems painfully predictable
at times) those kind of people don't give a damn about transhumanistic ideas,
and thus aren't ERs. If they were they'd wait with this kind of behaviour until we
have perfect VR, unless by "Ubermesch" you mean something akin to a Power.

Sophomoric parasites can be ERs, yes, just like they can be regular 
transhumanists, christians, communists etc, but it's hardly an appropriate
name for my elegant theory, don't you think? ;-)

He wouldn't either, as his mail client would've decoded it automagically. 

It's a bit tricky to see the actual "source" of a mail with Outlook & Co.: Hit Alt+Enter on the message (or choose properties from the context menu), click the "Details"-tab and then click the button labeled "View source".

Thanks for the info. But I have simply started using a different email client. This solution both
solves the attachment problem, and provides me with a far better email solution.

maybe not, but he would have had the attachment dumped on him instead of
us, wouldn't he? Or does the attachment just go to people who don't use his
mail reader? The exi list is the only list I am on that still has this
problem, I swear to god.

Goes to everyone, but without testing it with us poor folks, he'd not have noticed. Anyway, he fixed the problem, so no big deal.

Based upon the feedback I have received, the attachments are not visible to
users of Microsoft mail products, only to users of other mail products.

I am now using a non-Mickeysoft mail product, so the problem is resolved.

I'm not suggesting we change any definition, I'm just asking what 
short explanation people give when they are asked what is 
transhumanism. The above statement is quite good IMHO, but it might 
not be the best possible response to give. The following are the 
disadvantages I see:

1. It's a little too long.

2. As Max suggests, evolution should be replaced with "development".

3.  "the evolution of intelligent life beyond its currently human 
form" almost sounds as if it presupposes that intelligent life has 
not already evolved beyond its currently human form. However, there 
might be very advanced extraterrestrial species.

4. "life-promoting principles and values". I don't know anybody who 
would say of his own values and principles that they are *not* 
"life-promoting". It sounds like either empty rethoric or, worse, 
like a commitment to the anti-abortion, anti-euthanesia stance.

5. "by means of science and technology" could perhaps be misconstrued 
in a too narrow sense.  Anders tends to stress that not only science 
and technology, but also, e.g., psychological techniques and  
institution building, are part of the transhumanists' tool box. 
Natasha might add that developing artistic creativity is a 
transhumanist way of extending our minds and enriching our lives. 

Okay, I'm really struggling to come up with difficulties here. We 
can hardly expect any definition/explanation to say everything we 
think is important in just a few words.

That doesn't mean we can't try :-)  Building on Anders' version, I 
suggest the following:

"Transhumanism is the idea that the human condition will 
be dramatically transformed by technology and that it is a good thing
to use rational methods to overcome our biological limitations."

(Actually, we might need more than one explanation, depending on whom 
we are trying to explan it to.)

I thought this article might be of interest to some list members

-------------------------

>From the April 6 Business Week, pp 128:

These Molecules Are Real Self-Starters

For engineers, it's close to playing god. They are devising so-called self-assembly
techniques aimed at getting molecules to arrange themselves into larger functioning
systems, much as eggs and sperm self-assemble into human beings. Until now, only
nature has been able to get more that a few molecules to join together, into very small
nanostructures. But on March 20, two University of Rochester researchers said they 
had developed the largest synthetic structures ever made by self-assembly.

Though each structure contains millions of molecules, the largest is only 50 microns
long, less than the width of a human hair. Still, that's 1,000 times larger that the 
previous record for synthetic self-assembled structures, the researchers report in
the journal Science. "In the world of self-assembly, these structures are giant," says 
X. linda Chen, one of the researchers and a graduate engineering student at 
Rochester. Chen and engineering professor Samson A. Jenekhe started with a
large polymer macromolecule long thought too unstable for self-assembly. They
tamed the polymer by inserting hydrogen bonds into the structures, the same 
stabilizers found in DNA and other natural self-assebled proteins.

The molecules form a variety of shapes, including spheres, cylinders, rings, and disks-
all of which have a fluorescent glow. The researchers say the structures could be 
utilized as drug-delivery vehicles, adhesives, lasers, sensors, and for other industrial
applications.

Indeed, they wouldn't *say* it because it doesn't sound very nice, but do
they mean it and live it?  You cannot truly claim to be "life-promoting"
and yet allow the murder of the weak, the sick and the old.  To claim to be
"life-promoting" without "a commitment to the anti-abortion,

RJ: <This time difference is a function of the measuring mechanism itself. 
You are not saying that the Planck moment has changed during the flight,
are you?  Is the Planck moment constant or is it not?

DF: <While I can't answer the point about the Plank moment, I can answer
your
point about the time difference being "a function of the measuring
mechanism itself."  While this may actually be the case, this is NOT what
is happening if you presume that light in a vacuum travels at the same
speed in all reference frames.>

What exactly do you mean by "a vacuum"?  For instance, if the speed of
light travels at different speeds depending on the density of space being
traversed, how can we measure such differences since our measurements
partake of the same density in the region in question?  Certainly, an
observer outside the event horizon of a black hole observing the speed of
light inside the event horizon would be hard put to not observe that the
light velocity inside was approximately squat.  How does this change as the
observer approaches the event horizon at a tangent?  If light is travelling
lengthwise between two incredibly long, incredibly dense parallel plates,
which screen out the bulk of the density of space, would not the speed of
light increase over that outside of this system?  At the filamentary
borders in deep space equidistant between all regional galactic
superclusters, where the bulk of virtual particles are moving away from
each other, is the speed of light increased over that of more dense space
or are the photons dilated?  Is not the speed of light also dependent on
the length of the Planck moment, which may be constant in our local region
of the universe, but may be different in other regions?

DF: <I got most of the information here from _Fundamentals of Physics, 5th
Edition_ by Halliday, Resnick and Walker. (Further reference upon
request.)>

Halliday & Resnick are fine by me, mine's sitting at arm's length.

<...it has also been observed that muons, which have an average lifetime of
2.200 microseconds, have an average lifetime of 63.5 microseconds when
moving at 0.9994c relating to the laboratory; precisely the value predicted
by special relativity.>

And in regions of the universe where the Planck moment is approximately the
constant it is in our region, when the muon achieves light speed, it lasts
an eternity while spreading itself atemporally through every possible
accessible place  la Russell's/Feynman's sum-over-the-histories.

RJ: <I have not rejected QM, I have simply noted that QM and Relativity are
not reconciled, and they are not reconciled for a reason that science has
not discovered yet.>

DF: <Perhaps not, but the reason we accept both is because both theories
predict the behavior of the world around us to as close as we can measure. 
One day we may find the true model, but until then we accept these models
because they work.>

We accept the models knowing they are flawed.  Using models which work FAPP
(for all practical purposes) without knowing why they work, without knowing
the underlying reality that the mathematics correspond to, is fine for
technicians.  Some horses prefer to move about without blinders on, though.
 They want an explanation conjoined with description.  QM and Relativity
require common explanations in order to reconcile them.  Usefulness is not
knowledge, it is substantially lower down the scale.

As to contradictory evidence for the Big Bang dogma, review the scientific
literature over the past oh, three or four years, in particular much of the
Hubble data interpretation, but also other cosmic-wide observations.  I
read about plenty of confusing and contradictory interpretations.  The
dogma isn't overthrown yet, something more fashionable hasn't arrived, but
hopefully it will arrive, or if it doesn't, at least its adherents will not
treat it as science.

RJ: <Black holes are just like glaciers, if you want to free up the matter
in them, just raise the background temperature around them.>

DF: <This, however, is not true.  Remember that absolute speed of light
constant, presumed above?  Well, as Bertozzi showed, increasing the kinetic
energy STILL doesn't increase the speed faster than c; and since it
doesn't, you STILL can't extract matter from a black hole, no matter how
hot it gets.>

Even at background radiation levels, black holes are slowly melting at the
event horizon, unless replenished with accreted matter from external
sources.  As the temperature surrounding a black hole increases, the event
horizon is made more permeable at the tangent to the horizon, the melting
rate increases until the event horizon restablizes at a smaller radius
until the surrounding temperature changes again.  Black holes are
recyclable at a high enough technological level.

RJ: <biology makes no sense when it takes randomness (as in mutations) to
be some ontological aspect, rather than an epistemological aspect.  If
there was one ounce of ontological randomness in the universe, the universe
would be entirely unintelligible.>

DF: <Now you've gone and challenged all of QM, which has more experimental
evidence behind it than I can shake a stick at.  What's with that?>

I have not challenged QM, only some kooky interpretations of it, of which
there are many.  Experimental evidence is epistemological in nature, OK? 
The randomness in QM (or in evolutionary mutations) is epistemological in
nature, not ontological.  Experiments and measurements are exercises in
epistemology.  Generally, ontological presuppositions are made prior to
constructing an experiment or taking a measurement.  Sometimes, these
ontological presuppositions are altered post-measurement or
post-experiment, but not very often.  An intelligible universe cannot
contain ontological randomness, but it can contain bucketloads of
epistemological randomness.

DF: <Information is a signal which reduces uncertainty.>

Reduces uncertainty for whom?

DF: <Most, if not all people who support abortion do NOT think that the
fetus can be killed.>

Aside from the sheer erroneous nature of this claim, I would say, "how
convenient."  I could just as easily claim, and with as much logic, that
most people who support slavery do NOT think that slaves have full status
with humans and can therefore be owned as property, like cattle or land, to
be dispensed with arbitrarily.  Slavery and abortion are definitional
issues, the same issue, in fact, the definition of human.

DF: <I could just as easily say that a person cannot be killed until they
are born.>

Yes, you could.  If might makes right, then all is up for grabs, and may
the best mafia don win.

DF: <To provide a logical argument, use COMMON definitions.  If two parties
do not use definitions, you must use other common definitions to show why
the other definitions are wrong.  But anyway you run it, we have to use
premises upon which everyone agrees in order to have a logical discussion.

I challenge you to prove, using definitions and premises upon which we both
agree, that abortion is immoral; if you can't or won't, then don't try to
have a logical argument with me.>

This is another form of the might makes right barbarian tyranny.  If you
recall, the American Civil War was fought largely over defining what a
human was.  No logical discussion between the North and the South was
possible because they did not agree on common definitions and premises.  No
utopia is ever possible anywhere, any time, because there are such
conflicting ideals present in the world.  The abortion, infanticide, &
euthanasia fight will go on and on and on, ending up in either the elite
accepting humane definitions of human, such as when Britain's elite
abolished slavery without a war, or the elite will attempt to achieve
consensus by neutralizing or eliminating opponents who hold conflicting
definitions.  This is the tried and true method of tyranny.

        >Is the Planck moment constant or is it not?


Yes, but I don't see the relevance to our conversation. The Plank time is a  
function of the gravitational constant (G), the Plank constant divided by 
2 PI (h), and the speed of light constant (c). As the names imply these 
values don't change so all observes will see  the same Plank time, namely  
[Gh/c^5]^1/2 = 5.38 * 10-44 second.

The Plank Length is 10^-33 cm, it's the distance light can travel in the  
plank time. As the wavelength of light gets smaller the energy gets larger  
and so does the mass, remember E =MC^2 so M= E/c^2.  At the Plank Length the 
wavelength is so small and the mass is so great a mini Black Hole is formed.   

To put it another way, when time gets shorter than this, or distance smaller, 
a singularity is formed and our theories can tell us nothing about what is 
going on, perhaps because there really is noting going on because time and 
space are digital at these dimensions, or perhaps not. Nobody knows yet if 
these values have any physical significance, my hunch is that they do but 
maybe they're just an artifact of our imperfect ideas.
                            
           
        >I agree that the speed of light being the same for any observer is        
        >absolute, an absolute metaphysical assumption.  
           

Yes, assumptions were made, before Einstein everybody assumed that the speed  
of light would change for different observers, Einstein reasoned that this 
was not true, and experiment has proven him correct.
            

        >I have simply noted that QM and Relativity are not reconciled, 

Nobody said otherwise.


        >and they are not reconciled for a reason that science has not

If a problem has not been solved then obviously new ideas are required. 
I don't have those new ideas, nobody does yet, not even Reilly Jones.

        >paradigm 


You know something, I'm really tired of hearing about Kuhn. It's not that I 
don't like Philosophy I do, but it's only entertainment. I'm sure Kuhn was a 
nice man but such people do not produce new knowledge. Scientists are 
explorers, Philosophers are tourists. When I hear a self righteous 
philosopher of science make pronouncements with absolute certainty on 
subjects he knows little about and in direct conflict with all experimental 
evidence, I'm reminded of a eunuch at an orgy, he can tell others they're 
doing it all wrong but can't do it himself.
            

        >and it is very hard to buck dogmatism when you are trying to suck in         
        >grant money.


You want dogmatism I'll give you dogmatism. Aristotle used pure logic and a 
long string of syllogisms, which fortunately I've forgotten, and concluded 
that women MUST have fewer teeth than men. They don't. Aristotle had a wife, 
he could have counted her teeth at any time but never bothered because he 
already knew the truth, or thought he did. You know that Relativity MUST be 
untrue, but you never bother to count the teeth.
            

        >I also can't believe that individuals who proclaim themselves to be        
        >scientists, promote the Big Bang as science.  


Any theory that makes predictions and can in principle be proven wrong is 
Science. The steady state theory made predictions too and perhaps you like it 
better than the Big Bang Theory, but nature did not, its predictions were 
wrong.      

        >There is a lot of kookiness in science I don't go for. [...]         
        >Singularities inside black holes   


A singularity is a point where an equation no longer works because values 
become infinite. There is absolutely no doubt that our equations do this at 
the center of a Black Hole, whether this fact has any physical significance 
remains to be seen.
            
        >Black holes are just like glaciers, if you want to free up the

No, that would only make them larger because the increased Blackbody 
Radiation would fall into the Black Hole increasing its mass.
            

        >The idea of a space-time continuum          
            
Without space-time relativity wouldn't work. For example, the concept of 
simultaneity is not absolute, observers will disagree about the time between 
two events or even which came first, and they will disagree about the 
distance in space between two events, but they will always agree about the 
distance in space-time between two events.
            
        >I'd go for a space-time conjunction 

A what?
            
        >The Planck moment is not a variable, not involved in any continuum,         
        >at least not locally anyway.


Huh? If the Plank Time is real then time is not infinitely  divisible and so 
not a continuum.
            

        >I don't just pick on junk physics either


I've noticed. If you're not the greatest you're certainly the world's most  
certain expert, and on every subject under the sun. Unfortunately absolute  
certainty is a dime a dozen, being correct is not.


        >If there was one ounce of ontological randomness in the universe,

Why? Event A is intelligible if we know it's cause B, and that means that if 
we find event B in a time sequence we're certain to find event A later in the 
same sequence. Some events have this property but I can find no logical  
reason why all events must have it, and in fact the experimental evidence  
shows that some do not.
            

        >biology makes no sense when it takes randomness (as in mutations) to

Mutation is only half of the machinery of Evolution, the other half is 
natural selection and that is far from random. 

Let's see, you say Einstein was a fool and in earlier posts you told us that 
Bohr's and Heisenberg's scientific theories about Quantum Mechanics must be 
wrong because you don't like their politics, now you tell us that Charles 
Darwin makes no sense. Is there any scientist (not philosophers, I already 
know you love them) in the last 150 years that you approve of?
                  

        >Lastly, I can't think of any greater credibility problem that to

Probably our deepest disagreement of all.


        >Information has no existence  without a knower and a known.          


Without information there is nothing for the knower to know, so he can't be 
much of a knower.
                  

        >It is a common fallacy to say that DNA transmits information,        
        >without referencing the knower who can translate the information.          
        

It's no fallacy and DNA does have a knower, it's had one for over 3 billion
years, the ribosomes in a cell know the language of DNA and know exactly what 
the DNA means.


       >DNA replication, the thing-in-itself, is not transmitting information          
     
            
DNA can not only replicate itself but with the help of a "knower", a ribosome,  
it can duplicate proteins and even entire living organisms.


        >it is simply molecules bumping around and lining up in preferred

Your posts do not transmit information, they are simply electrons in a  
transmission line bumping around and lining up in certain preferred branches 
of the Internet until they reach me.

So there's this lo-o-ong table set up in a conference room at the Garden
Court Hotel in Plow Alto and arrayed along it are (amongst others) Jamie
Zawinski (the guy who footed the bill for the Mozilla Dot Party last
week) and Tom Paquin of Mozilla.org, Paul Vixie, the developer of BIND,
Brian Behlendorf, one of the developers of Apache, Eric Allman, the guy
behind sendmail, Larry Wall, the benevolent god of Perl, Guido van
Rossum, the somewhat-less-benevolent demigod of Python, John Gilmore,
founder of (among other things) the alt.* newsgroup hierarchy, the EFF,
The Little Garden and Cygnus Solutions, Phil Zimmermann (with a magic
markered-in second "n" on his nameplate), John Ousterhout, the man who
created Tcl and Tk, Eric Raymond, author of "The Cathedral and the 
Bazaar", the white paper that was intrumental in convincing Netscape to
release its source code, Linus Torvalds and other luminaries, all gathered
around Tim O'Reilly, who's acting as ringmaster for the collection of
computer industry trade journal wankers in suits who've been invited to
question these luminaries at the end of the first-ever Freeware Summit.

And what, you might wonder, did these business-suited nitwits clamor to
ask this jaw-dropping conglomeration of brainiacs?

"So, how do you expect to make any money, if you give your software away
for free?"

"No, really--how do you expect to make money?"

"Uh--how are you going to convince IS managers to take you seriously, if
you give your software away?"

"I mean it--why should they take you seriously?  You're not IBM or DEC
or Oracle, after all."

"How do you expect to compete against Microsoft?"

"Seriously, how are you going to compete against Microsoft?"

"No, but listen--how are you going to compete against Microsoft?"

This crap went on for almost 90 minutes (I have most of it on audio tape,
if anyone's interested).  It's a damned good thing I don't carry firearms
to these things, or InfoWorld, et al, would have help-wanted signs out
right now.

At least there was a nice opportunity to go one-on-one with the good guys
after the formal press conference broke up.  I found out that Larry Wall
is planning on getting Perl 5.1 out the door by August, and that it will
include stable multithreading, Unicode support and other goodies.  I also
found out that Linus runs Red Hat on his own desktop.  And that Paul 
Vixie is even more paranoid than Zach--and is certain that SAIC is behind
the so-called Green Paper on the New Domain Order.

Other interesting stuff happened, too, but I'm very tired now, so I'm
going to bed..

Go back and reread my argument again, this time note that all observers and
the light particle are travelling though the same medium, having uniform
density, which for convenience I'll call "vacuum."

Maybe I misunderstand your argument in that case...  Halliday and Resnick
have a chapter on relativity, which I thought you disagree with.  Have I
grossly misunderstood you?

True.  So when you provide me with a new cohesive model backed up by
experimental evidence, I'll use your model.  But without that experimental
evidence, how do you purport to know which model, if either, is wrong?

I concede that any observable randomness is at least just that; random as
far as we can observe...  but what is so unintelligible about randomness?

For that matter, what exactly do you mean when you say "intelligible?"

I agree.

>This is another form of the might makes right barbarian tyranny.

You misunderstand me.  I'm not arguing that you are wrong...  I'm making
the much safer claim that you do not have a logical argument for abortion,
BECAUSE we do not agree on definitions and premises.

So, in syllogistic form:

(1)  Axiom:  That in order to have a logical argument, all parties must
agree on the premises and definitions relevant to that argument.
(2)  We do not agree on the definition of human.  (Empirical.)
(3)  Therefore, we cannot have a logical argument about whether abortion is
the murder of humans.

P if and only if Q.
Not Q.
Therefore not P.

>If you

Too true.  They were NOT having a logical argument.  Just as you and I are
NOT having a logical argument about abortion.

Well, yes.  You can't have a logical argument with a tyrant, I completely
agree.  Fortunately for me, this was all that I was trying to prove in the
first place.  :)

Now, it is still possible that one premise, either the "pro-life" premise
or the "pro-choice" premise, are more defensible based on OTHER premises
which we do agree upon.  I'd like to think that this is true.  And indeed,
Jones, I exhort you to seek out such an argument.  Don't just stick to your
guns.  Branch out.  Seek out new arguments.  Because this one, to be blunt,
is illogical.  (Not to mention ineffective!)

On the other hand, perhaps rational parties who disagree about abortion
cannot have a logical discussion about abortion, and anyone who claims to
have a logical argument for or against abortion is either lying or
confused.  To have a logical argument you MUST agree on premises, premises
on which "pro-life" and "pro-choice" advocates may not ever agree.  If this
is so, a logical argument is completely impossible.

For our sakes, I hope this is not the case.

Summary: I'm against needless attachments because they fragment the only
"universal language" of e-mail: the ASCII character set.

  When I was first using computers, IBM mainframes used a character code
called EBCDIC, and everyone else used the ASCII standard.  Because IBM then
dominated mainframes, we would have to struggle converting character sets
between these two conventions that did not completely translate to each
other.

  I worked with incompatible character sets on communicating word
processors during a consulting project at Stanford in 1980.  That and other
proprietary quirks were fatal to information sharing at Stanford at that time.

  I was the entire computer department at Affymax in 1990, when our Macs
used QuickMail.  Microsoft used another mail standard. UNIX and the
then-little-known
Internet used another mail standard, and several other mail standards were
out there.

  Trying to cope with these incompatible standards made e-mailing
expensive and difficult.  The coming of the Internet standards as a
standard protocol has been immensely helpful to everyone.

   Because of the value of everyone sharing a lowest common denominator
standard, experienced Net users avoid using attachments of any kind unless
there is a compelling need.

  There is a class of message that requires something other than ASCII
text: files that use more than the ASCII character set, such as compressed
binary programs.  But running programs downloaded from people you don't
know well is dangerous, since a running program can plant a computer virus.

  On my PC I use the Eudora 3.0 Lite mail program.  This is the free one
with the wonderful filter that now sorts my incoming Extropian mail into
folders I called BEST, MID, WORST, and UNFILTERED.  Those of you who
express new ideas clearly get read faithfully.  Some who are incoherent or
repetitious rarely get read.  This Eudora Lite system saves me a lot of
time.  The few attachments are saved in a directory of attachments.  I have
things set so they will be deleted when I delete the original messages, but
the attachments will waste disk space until I delete the original message
or purge the attachments.  I can't recall ever opening or running an
attachment.  I usually view them as a sign of the author's inexperience or
lack of "Netiquette".

If we want to include lots of people in our Extropian discussion, including
those who are running software on Macs, the many users of Linux/UNIX
machines, Third World villagers with recycled computers, and corporate
employees stuck with legacy mainframes, we ought to express our messages in
what everyone's software can understand: ASCII text.

Imagine we could change the laws of physics, so that we could make a 
material with the following properties: cheap as concrete, and tough 
enough to withstand the blast of a supernova.  Out of this we could make 
walls, safes, locks,  armor light enough to coat vehicles
and wear as clothes, envelopes impervious to snooping or 
tampering, and a wide variety of other devices to defeat violence 
against individuals and their property.  The security possible for  
individuals in our current physical world would be put to shame.

I know of a frontier where these kinds of materials are available.  
Specifically, one-way functions, trapdoor one-way functions, and the 
other building blocks of cypherspace.   Offensive computations could 
quite literally consume the energies of supernovae, and still not crack 
codes generated by a lowly Intel chip.   These codes are currently 
available.  In the future with quantum cryptography, security against 
computers and quantum computers of even infinite energies is possible.   

Out of these ultratough materials of cypherspace, we can really
build  a Galt's Gulch: heretofore merely a metaphorical
ideal or a hopeless dream about physical security.

There has been a lot of hype about colonizing space, the oceans, and 
other physical frontiers.  American culture and perhaps even human 
instinct equate freedom with the physical frontier.  Some government 
bureaucracy  finds 1% water at a lunar pole and  some libertarians, 
recalling those old entertaining industrial-era yarns about a dreamy 
future on the Moon (a.k.a. heaven),  go gaga.   I have  more water, and 
more  of  almost everything else useful, in my literal backyard!

Supposedly, mere physical distance, the mere increase of a constant 
factor  in the energy and time needed to get across the oceans 
or into space, is supposed to provide some protection from the thieves 
and parasites who first steal our livelihoods through taxes, then steal 
our very lives by harassing practitioners of advanced medicine. But the 
increased cost of a physical barrier is the same for both the offense 
and the defense.  Such a barrier offers no significant improvement to 
those wishing to defend their freedoms.  Only a barrier of great 
asymmetry, where defense is vastly more efficient than offense, turns 
the tides towards freedom.   Freedom in cypherspace, first for our 
communications, then for our financial transactions, then for the free 
flow of research and services from unlocatable medical laboratories.

An extropian evolves beyond the stage of entropic griping or whining 
about our current condition of human slavery, and beyond the stage
of participation  in the human tribal rituals of political bickering. We 
evolve beyond the naive belief that what passes for "politics" in our 
public-school-brainwashed and licensed-media-saturated culture 
constitutes any sort of effective political action.  An extropian 
evolves beyond wishful thinking inspired by those entertaining
TV escape fantasy shows.  We transform our human desires to conquer the 
physical frontier into transhuman action which 
conquers the secure frontier of cypherspace.  We seize the liberty at 
hand!  I salute those extropians working on the colonization of 
cypherspace, and encourage many others with a knack for computers, 
mathematics, law, or business to join in.  Ad BlackNet Per Perspera!

"Colonizing" cypherspace is all nice and well, but it certainly isn't
a substitute for good old space colonization. At the end of the day
governments can still pull the plug on your virtual world using a lot
less resources than they would need to destroy a stronghold in
space. Also it would be extremely unwise not to have some viable
offplanet colonies in case of a large disaster (be it natural or man-
induced). 

In cyberspace you have to rely on stealth; the idea is that the 
government can't catch you if they don't know where you are
or what you're doing. That's very tricky, because it means that
a little slip in security procedures can expose you, and the gov
(or others) have other means besides tracing email etc. to 
determine your location. And *when* they find you, you're
a sitting duck. What good is freedom in cyberspace
if you can't be free in the physical world? No, it's better to
move to space a.s.a.p. and add the options of virtually
unlimited relocation possibilities, great speed, big guns 
(nukes etc.) to the defense based on stealth. Not you but
the governments of earth will then be the sitting ducks.

Well, I see free market capitalism as an ideal of efficiency and
individuality that a socialist system can never compete with either in
terms of economic growth or in pbulic morale (in the long run,  however
people are always happy after they elect the next bumch of crooks into
office that guarranteed them bread and circuses).

Actually, its because we don't have a big black market mafioso and
government approved mafioso simultaneously robbing hard wroking people of
their hard earned dollars. While our per capital income is low, our cost
of living is also low due to our low government and criminal overhead.

Jay, thanks for the suggested edits. I agree that "continuation and" can be
dropped. The definition becomes more concise without really losing anything.

I'm not so sure about dropping the last clause about "guided by
life-promoting principles and values", though I could go along with that,
since it may invite confusion about what exactly that implies and what
those values are. Obviously any form of transhumanism does involve certain
values and attitudes, but perhaps that belongs in a separate, careful
explanation, rather than in a definition.

Onward!

The title/theme of the current (May) issue of Discover Magazine is:
"Reinventing Life." It has several articles on the biological sciences.
(I'm not sure if they have a web site up or not.)

There are several good articles in the issue including:

An article on the future of fusion energy (unrelated to the main theme)

An article on the current status of genetic engineering (general) and the progress 
being made in the human genome project.

An article on genetically engineered animal organs and 'test tube grown'
organs for use in humans.

An article on using gentic engineering to significantly enhance the human
condition and for creating 'designer children.'

An article on using info and techniques from ontogeny (related to developmental 
biology) to correct physiological disorders and improve the human condition. 

An article on the status of "assisted reproduction science" and the impact
it will have on "society".

An article on cloning.

And an article on genetic engineering of plants for various uses, primarily
for food.

For those of you who keep up with these topics, there will not be a lot of 
new information (some). But for those who have not been keeping up with the 
latest information, these articles will do a good job of "bringing you up to 
speed."

IMHO, worth reading.

Sin,
Jason

hedonism.  It is based on choosing an ideal, a purpose in life, an attempt
at a great achievement in the future, etc.  It arises from the unified,
coherent answers to the human (not animal) questions such as: why is there
something and not nothing, why am I here, what should my purpose be, how
should I fulfull my purpose, how should I get along with these other beings
around me, etc.  Once you've decided on your purposes, besides the
homeostatic purposes of survival and reproduction that nature has endowed
you with, and the purposes you've chosen don't conflict, you develop moral
values that will lead to the fulfillment of your chosen purposes.

Principles are rational choices, purposes are chosen prior to rationality. 
Deciding to be rational, to aim at truth, is not a rational choice, it is
pre-rational or moral.  These moral values, in turn, filter which
perceptions are allowed to penetrate your consciousness, in the learning
process, and which concepts are deposited in memory.  Your moral worldview
colors the entirety of the way you think, what you sense, what you
remember, which in turn, is inextricably connected to the motor-cortical
system of the behavior of your body.  If you have the morality of selfish
hedonism, you will think like a lower animal and behave like a lower
animal, not like a higher human.  Reflection and abstraction are a surer
guide to morality that works to preserve and enhance higher life than any
set of feelings.  This is why high standards of morality, which develop
subtlety and refined judgments, will always work to elevate the human
condition, while dropping standards of morality will always work to degrade
the human condition.  Pleasure and suffering, happiness and unhappiness are
lower animal guides to moral standards, not higher human guides.

<There are plenty of other elements when it comes to the moral memetic
system, of course, but they all are more or less based on the punishment vs
reward system, whether the subject realizes this or not. "Morals" and
"ethics" are not some metaphysical, divine spark that's unique to (some)
humans, but rather primitive impulse mixed with some logic.>

They are not based on some external punishment vs reward system, they are
based on the choice of purposes, the values that attend that choice, and
the behavior, in the co-evolutionary environment with other beings, that
will lead to their fulfillment.  This is an interior system, isolated from
all observation or participation by outsiders.  Volitional freedom is
central to the higher human, and is what is missing in lower animal life,
the freedom to choose courses not set at nature's table for us.  Higher
morals arise from coherent answers to the metaphysical questions, they have
little to do with primitive impulse.

<ER certainly encourages self-disciple [sic], because it's very rational
(useful).>

I think you meant self-discipline here, rather than self-disciple, although
Enlightened Rationalism as you have sketched it out, amounts to the same
thing.  Perhaps instead of my earlier "Sophomoric Parisitism", E.R. would
be even more appropriately called "Self-Discipleship".  Rationality and
usefulness are not equivalents.  Also, I would point out that earlier you
wrote what is obviously the key tenet to E.R., namely: "So if you feel like
it, and think that you can get away with it... by all means go ahead!" 
This is the very antithesis of self-discipline, and betrays the incoherency
and dishonesty in your version of E.R.  It is the prime tenet of lower
animal life, and human barbarism.

<"Infantile desires" are the core of our being, instead of blindly
suppressing them as you imply we should try to control their flow in such a
way that we get the most out of life.>

You are certainly qualified to speak for yourself in this regards, but
please don't presume to speak for me.  Infantile desires were the core of
my being when I was an infant, but I am no longer an infant.  

<It is much more effective to reduce the number of rules (and dogmatism) to
a bare minimum, and base them on common sense instead of ideas that fly in
the face of human nature and logic.>

And what is common sense but induction?  Moral systems based on common
sense are called traditions or peasant logic.  You make a case for sticking
to habit and custom here.  A good example of common sense for you
personally goes something like this: "When I was a child, I spake as a
child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a
man, I put away childish things."  Is that what you mean by "bare minimum"
rules?

Ideas that fly in the face of human nature are necessary for both
self-improvement and improvement of the human condition in general.  It is
human nature to take the easy way out, to focus on the immediate to the
detriment of society at large, to take no thought of future generations and
to dishonor the sacrifices (the moral capital) of past generations.  Humans
default to entropic barbarism unless ideas that fly in the face of
barbarism are promulgated and upheld.  High moral standards were always
present at the extropic peaks in history.

<E.R. firmly assumes that being alive is preferable to being dead. However,
this does not force the individual who values his own life to act in a
"life promoting" way towards *other* life forms. That's a *personal
choice*, for which one must carry *personal responsibility*.>

Does the courtesy of preferring being alive to being dead extend to unborn
children, burdensome sick and old people?  Oh, I guess not, E.R.'s moral
teachings don't include life promotion extended to others.  How convenient.
 Calling it a "personal choice" is self-evident but then there's that nasty
word so prominent in moral systems that are rivals to the moral system of
E.R., namely "must."  Why must they carry personal responsibility?  Who
says so?  Responsibility to whom?  To those they murder?  To themselves? 
What could that possibly mean except license to murder?  Where, in the
moral universe of E.R., which states that "So if you feel like it, and
think that you can get away with it... by all means go ahead!" could there
be any room for personal responsibility?  Obviously, this is another
incoherent, dishonest tenet.

This ain't natural.  This happens because the government makes it hard to
be a new small bank, (regulations and fees which fall equally on large and
small banks, etc.) thus making it UNnaturally economically desirable to
merge with other banks.

Monopolies are only economically efficient if you can prevent small
business from stealing your customers, and the best way to do that is to
get the government to help.

Government is indeed a useful tool for growing businesses. That's why some kind of government naturally evolves in all capitalist economies.

I wouldn't equate biological genital forms with philias--clinically,
the two don't relate to each other.

I did mean evolution! I don't have to go too far to project
'evolution' in the biological sense (chromosomal) or in the
transhumanist sense (biological change aided by technology) in the
case of intersexual humans.  Due to the vast progress made in
reproductive technologies, intersexual humans are now able to pass on
their genetic structures to their offspring. A recent study has
claimed that a group of non-mosaic Kleinfelter's males were able to
procreate through an advanced method of in vitro. This means that,
for the very first time, their chromosomal structure is passed on to
offspring.  And when cloning is honed to the point of feasibility for
humans, any human can at least replicate.  This is why the topic of
gender continues to fascinate me--it is an arena in which evolution
takes place before our very eyes.

Anders:
>I would rather say intersexuals might be important since their

And that would constitute the sociobiological aspects.  We can
reasonably project that, given absolute freedom to choose, many
intersexual humans would prefer to retain the biological form they
were born with.  The increasing existence of humans that cannot be
classified physically at either polarity is going to force many
societies to reconsider the custom of segregating humans by gender
in various spheres of activity.  It will also call into serious
question the notion that biology determines life roles or
personality.  I like to think of that as socio-evolution, but
it's just a useful metaphor.

Erik:

Not a case of belief, but of mounting evidence.  In addition to the 
one Anders cited, a longitudinal study is in progress at Johns 
Hopkins.

Ah, now this is the interesting part. I'm not totally ignorant of the situation of
organised labor in the harbor/shipping industry, as 'one of my best freinds'
happens to have reached the level of Chief Engineer on container ships (working up
from the bottom), and has told me a bit about what seems to be really going on.

Most modern harbors have converted almost entirely to servicing container
transport ships, and use highly automated crane systems, with eleborate queueing
systems for handling the tractor trailer traffic as it flow through the offloading
system.

While operating a crane, a forklift, or a tractor trailer may not be as unskilled
posistions as a ditch digger, the fact is that a reasonably well trained
individual can pretty much master the job requirements in 6 weeks of training.
(Forklift training actually takes one day, but I'll be generous).

Because modern harbors are so automated, you would think that they would need
extremely few employees, right? Wrong. Just as most of the US auto industry is
saddled with obsolete work rules, and has agreed to not replace more than x many
workers with robots each year, most longshoremans unions in city's where they are
strong and typically supported by the mob, tend to negotiate from rather strong
positions in terms of preserving jobs for people where they wind up really not
doing much at all.

This same situation is being contested in US port systems. The old unions are
fighting with the help of the mafia in preventing the loss of jobs due to
progress. Its about time sombody fought back.  People need to realize that such
strong arm tactics on the part of unions only make things more expensive for the
rest of us.

That the number of longshoremen has only decreased by half, under negotiation,
indicates to me that they have been fighting to preserve a lot of positions that
are totally obsolescent.

As far as I can see, the shipping companies were within their rights in making a
last ditch effort to maintain competetive stature with competing companies and
harbors. I would guess that there are either in that same harbor, or in a nearby
harbor, a competing company that does not employ union workers, and was beating
the heck out of the ones that brought in the dogs and nightsticks to get rid of
the dead wood.

Apparently so, if the obsolete union is preventing the companies from being
competetive. If they don't give up, then they could wind up with nobody having
jobs. It was bound to happen, and could have happened peacefully or violently.
Stubborn unions usually cause it to be the second case.

Any individual should and can decide for themselves. That is the central point of having all
political power be derived from the individual. If the average human cannot handle such simple
decisions, then individual liberty is a really really really stupid idea. I don't think it is.

While being smart and planning ahead are always good policies, it is still likely that there will
be some time in your life when you have to stand up to some sort of bully. Being prepared and
knowing what needs to be done are 9/10ths of what it takes to do the right thing.

Yes it does, thank you. I hope that those who might have taken solace in what might have been a
different position will think differently.

Growing up with an IQ of 160 was freakish enough for me. I can't imagine the
sort of punishment a kid would go through in childhood and teen years in a
state of non-standard, or non-determinate sexuality. If I were such a kid I
think that the best thing that could happen to me would be that someone would
have taken care of if before I could even remember anything and never tell me
anything about it.

This makes it sound like government is caused by markets.  But where has 
government not evolved?

Actually, Charlotte, it really depends on what state you are in. While I
would agree that, say, New York residents probably have little hope of
saving enough for a business, places like Alaska, New Hampshire, Montana,
S. Dakota, etc. are states with extremly low levels of state tax burden.
While many real estate tax loopholes that people used to use to create
businesses are closed,  the federal tax rates are lower on average than
they were in the 60's and 70's.  If you can live in a state that has low
taxes, its not that hard to save, and if you are able to save and put
anything in stocks for a few years, you can do quite well.  My older
brother, for instance, dropped out of college with nothing but a bad back
and a lawn mower. Now he owns one of the largest property management and
landscaping firms in New Hampshire. He was offered a goodly fraction of a
million for his business this year (ten years since he started it with
nothing). He also does quite well in the stock market.  He has never been
given any support from anyone, no outside investors, and always pays 'cash
on the barrelhead'.

Another example is a freind of mine in Seattle, who spent three years
programming at Microsoft, and saved enough to open the Linda Cannon
Gallery, the hottest contemporary art gallery in Seattle.

Then there is my freind Bill Boone. Say what you will about network
marketers (and I've said my share as well, as I don't like most of them).
Bill has been up and down  but dedicated to the business concept for 14
years, working on different product lines, and in the last few years got to
the point where he only works an hour or two a day to bring in several tens
of thousands of dollars a month in income, with no overhead. He's a happy,
energetic, and IMHO, a very extropic personality.

These three people I know well, and am proud to say that they are my
freinds.

I have also known quite a few people who would fall in the category of
'trust fund baby'. Invariably they are usually people who never quite
measure up to the people who earned the money they live off of, and never
seem to be quite motivated to do anything about it. Those that do earn some
measure of success do not nearly attain the same level of ROI that people I
know who start from nothing do, which entirely disproves the adage that you
need money to make money.

Yes, Nick.  I agree with you.

Science and art - intellect and imagination - must be reintegrated for a
complex vision of the transhuman cultural landscape.

Whenever I'm trying to think through a complex matter, it helps me to
return to the earliest source materials, return to the roots, and
work my way forward.  I hereby offer FM-2030's original statements on
transhumanity, from which you can easily see that we have moved away 
from the original definition and are struggling to articulate a new 
personal self-identification and framework of thought:  

*****
Transhumans (trans) are a new kind of being crystallizing from the 
monumental breakthroughs of the late 20th century.  Trans are not 
necessarily the progressives and Up-Wingers defined through this 
tract.  In other words, trans are not necessarily those whose values 
and lifestyles and environments are the most modern.

Trans are not simply advanced historical people.  They are the 
earliest manifestations of new evolutionary beings.  Trans are like 
those earliest hominids who many millions of years ago came down from 
the trees and began to look around.  Transhumans are not necessarily 
committed to accelerating the evolution to higher life forms.  Many 
of them are not even aware of their bridging role in evolution.

Trans can no longer be considered specifically human because the 
promises of biological terrestial life that have always defined the 
human no longer fully apply.  Many of the breakthroughs embodied in 
transhumans are nothing less than the beginnings of the eventual 
transformation of the human species.  If you score higher than 7 on 
Monitor 25 you are a rare being--an advanced forerunner of the 
posthumans who will surely evolve later in the 21st century.  (From:  _Are You 
Transhuman?_1989)

The Questions:
1.	Do you have a high-tech body?  In other words, does your body 
comprise any implants--transplants--smart limbs--electronic monitors, 
etc.?
2.	Does your brain contain a pacemaker--electrodes--other 
peripherals?
3.  	Have you undergone major body reconstruction?  
4.	Are your body processes such as moods--cycles--body temperature, 
etc.--continuously telemonitored and regulated?
5.	Are you connected to people and services via onbody (portable) 
telecom?
6.	Are you androgynous?
7.	Do you contribute to reproduction only through new collaborative 
asexual methods?  For example:  (a) Have you ever donated your sex 
cells for screening and possible fertilization?  (b) Have you ever 
acted as 'surrogate mother'?
8.	Are you a product of artificial insemination or inovulation--in 
vitro fertilization--telegenesis--frozen embryo implant?
9.	Are you postterritorial:  free of kinship 
ties--ethnicity--nationality?
10.	Have you ever been outside this planet on space missions?
11.	Have you ever died and been rescusitated?

****
We can never again be even content with civil rights, human rights, 
the right to self-determination.  These rights by themselves are also 
no longer enough.  We now want cosmic rights.  We want the freedom to 
roam the universe.  We want nothing less than the right to determine 
our own evolution.  We want the right to live forever -- to succeed 
with our revolution against death itself.  So long as we have not 
overthrown the tyranny of death, _all_ mankind belongs to the Third 
World, _all_ mankind is proletarian.  (From:  _Optimism One_)

Just so.  Black holes evaporate when the external temperature is *lower*
than that of the hole, not higher.

This discussion seems wrong-headed anyway, because the canonical view of
Hawking radiation is that it's due to the infall of one half of a virtual
particle pair ripped out of the vacuum beyond the hole, and the slingshot
escape of the other.  Positive energy is *not* tunnelling out of the hole,
negative energy is being imported into it.  I can imagine that this is the
kind of claim that will set Reilly's teeth on edge, but let's at least play
with the net up.  Or agree to play an entirely different game, with equally
interesting rules.

I'm sure they could have cured your abnormal IQ as well, without your
family's knowledge or consent.  That way, you could have avoided such a
freakish childhood.  If the Doctors had only known....

This idea has some similarity to the Renaissance. Perhaps it is the Transhuman Renaissance.

Certainly many Transhumans could, or do, consider themselves "Renaissance entities."

I agree that intellect and imagination must be reintigrated. How do you propose that these two 
differening (but both useful) ways of perceiving (science and art) the universe be reintegrated?

Do they not wish to have a government of their own devising?

Do they not wish to include lands owned by people who don't support 
them?

Stop right there, if you're outside the event horizon then you can't see  
anything inside it.

        >a tangent?  


If I was far away and watching you I would see you and your watch slow down 
as you approached the event horizon, and when you reached it you and your  
watch would stop completely. From your own point of view you'd see nothing 
special when you crossed the event horizon, it just marks the point of no 
return for you. Well ok, you might notice the tidal forces trying to crush 
you, but if the black hole was millions of times as massive as the sun they 
wouldn't be large enough to be lethal even at the event horizon, and wouldn't 
be until you got a lot closer to the central singularity. And once you 
crossed the event horizon there is no way to stop from getting closer to the
center.

        >outside  of this system?  
                

Interesting example, although the plates wouldn't have to be incredibly long 
or dense. If you place two flat mirrors very close together then there can 
not be virtual photons of every wavelength in the vacuum between the mirrors,  
as there is outside, because some will interfere destructively. There are
more virtual particles in the vacuum outside the mirrors pushing them 
together than between the  mirrors pushing them apart. This force is 
extremely weak, but recently it has actually been measured in the lab. 
2 mirrors really do want to come together. 

If you define a vacuum far from any object as having zero pressure and if the 
vacuum can still push the plates together then the space between the plates 
must have negative pressure. According to Einstein, mass is not the only 
thing that can warp space and time, that is, create gravity, pressure can too,
although this only becomes important when the pressure is VERY high, like  
inside a Neutron star. New theory says negative pressure should do 
interesting things to time and space also, just like positive pressure, but 
this part has not been confirmed experimentally because the effect is so tiny. 

An observer's clock between the plates will (probably) run a little fast and 
for an observer outside the plates distances would (probably) expand a little. 
Since speed is distance divided by time nobody sees a change in the speed of 
light. This negative pressure idea is a little similar to the old cosmological
constant idea of Einstein, he later said that was the worst mistake of his 
life, but maybe not, it may play an important part in the  evolution of the 
universe.

The question was not whether the Big Bang is true or not but weather it's a

that you just don't like it. If you have other reasons I'd like to hear them.

According to Hawking a black hole left to itself would slowly melt away. In  
the vacuum virtual particles and antiparticles are constantly being created  
but they collide after a very short time and are destroyed. Things are  
different near a black hole, tidal effects at the event horizon would 
sometimes be strong enough to pull these virtual particles apart, one could
fall into the black hole leaving the other one free to become a real particle 
and radiate away into the outside world.  Thus Black holes are not really 
black, they give off radiation just like any object above absolute zero. 
The smaller the black hole the larger the tidal  effect at the event horizon, 
so there is an inverse relationship between the  mass of a black hole and
its temperature. Large black holes are very cold, small ones are hot, at the 
last moments of their life they are so small and so hot, many trillions of 
degrees, that they explode.

A black hole of 2 solar masses is pretty cold, it radiates energy at  
3 * 10^-8 degrees Kelvin, that energy comes at the expense of the black hole's 
mass but would take 10^67 years to evaporate. Actually it would take even 
longer, the cosmic background radiation is at 2.7 degrees so such black holes 
are actually getting larger and will keep doing so unless the universe cools 
to 3 * 10^-8 degrees or less. If that ever happens it will take a long time.

I wonder what the big deal with this is. Germline genetic engineering
(which is banned (?)) is potentially a much more powerful means to
change our DNA than just enabling to propagate those who previously 
couldn't. Ok, so now we have monkeys which are neither male nor
female. So what?

Besides of providing some cheap shocking effect to the mainstream
(which, apparently, is shocked very easily) I honestly do not see what 
this is any good for. Just my 0.02$.

It should be noted that currently you have to be pretty sick to have
these in the first place. Which makes your life span probably shorter
than average, unless you have signed up with a cryonics outfit, and
that cryonics works. So you probably won't remain a trans for very long.

Ditto. I don't know of any legal recreational implants. Interfacing to 
the brain is notoriously difficult, the nature of the thing
considered. Both the possible pathogen path, irritation due to
subcranial cabling and impossibility to interface a rigid electrode
array of any size beyond the trivial and expected long-term degeneration
processes at the electrodes do not seem to make this a very enjoyable
experience, currently. And epilepsy is also not my idea of a trans.

 > 3.  	Have you undergone major body reconstruction?  

Major surgery is currently done either because of a) cosmetic b) medical
reasons. In any case are modern methods of body modifications terribly 
crude, and should be limited to dire necessities. If having a lump of
silicon within your body makes you a trans, be my guest.

Unless you do it for fun (I toyed with some of this) this means you're 
a pretty sick trans. Body temperature monitoring could be useful for
contraception, though.

Trivial property. Pagers and cellulars are pretty ubiquitous. Times,
they are a-changing.

Is this of any relevance? Are you bald? Do you have brown eyes?

This is pretty neutral. Still fail to see the relevance. If the
creation process leaves no detectable artefacts, why putting into the 
definition?

No big deal.

Most modern techies are that.

You have to be pretty special for this, which could mean a lot for
your future. Check.

Sicko, sicko.


To sum it up, to me this seems like a list of remarkably irrelevant
traits. A transhuman is imo a being which makes it at least a major
fraction of the way through the Singularity/will live practically
forever and changes dramatically in the process. A tranhumanist is
someone who believes that would be a good thing, and tries to shape
his life to work towards that. Tom Morrow's 'Trancendence through
technology' is remarcably succinct and accurate, imo.

Sounds like a good name. Yesterday I suddenly realized that I hear
practically *nobody* say what they will do after the millennium, or
what they think the world might be like. This is an open memetic
niche: let's present our idea of a transhuman renaissance as the
logical theme of the next century.

I certainly do. I might not be a complete renaissance man yet, but I'm
definitely working in that direction and think it is an useful
personal goal. Why settle for anything less?

I think the main problem is 1) a lack of understanding of each other,
2) a feeling they can't be combined (due to 1?). Today there are huge
deficits in education, creating people who doesn't know anything about
science and/or art (the worst thing is that there are a lot of people
in the 'and' group). We better find ways of motivating people to learn
more and more broadly.

As for 2, I find it rather revealing that at my research group (around
10 people) there are one guitarrist in a rock band, one synth player,
one organist and one professional pianist - at least among
computational neuroscientists there are artistic people - but they all
seem to be creating music in its traditional form (rock, church music,
modern classical music), not trying to combine their science with the
art. There seems to be a kind of taboo here, that one shouldn't put
science into art or art into science. I would like to see art that
express science and science that express art. This is why I look
forward to the Cajal space mission - Cajal showed that science can be
art.

I really hope I can turn some of my research into art one day.

I would go further and say that most really good science is a result of
very creative, artistic thinking, combined with a very vigorous logic.
The two go together synergistically.

Actually, I have heard that pacemaker patients have a life expectancy
that is slightly better than normal people (a likely explanation is of
course that they monitor their cardiovascular system better).

Not when FM wrote that. I think most people would have regarded the
idea of widespread cellular phones as Star Trek sf rather than a
likely extrapolation.

I was aware of that. My point was that, unsurprisingly, FM2030's 
definitions of a trans must today appear arbitrary, and partly 
obsolete. Transhumanism should not be defined as a brittle set of 
precise properties imo. Definitions are no theories, after all.

Absolutely not, Northern Ireland is occupied by British Forces and

This sounds very similar to fasting (= eating nothing at all). I think
the main purpose of fasting is not losing weight, but "detoxing" your
body, though. According to what I've read on this subject (not
scientific literature), when your body switches off digestion, it can
work on dealing with all kinds of more or less toxic chemicals that
accumulate with time.

This might make fasting once in a while (maybe once or twice a year)
quite helpful in staying healthy.

Are there any studies that show the effects of fasting on the body?

later,
Holger

I see.  The IRA wants Northern Ireland partitioned into two sections, 
with one section falling under their rule (and, presumably, passing 
to the Irish government) and another section going in some other 
direction (presumably remaining British) according to the will of 
those persons (presumably mostly Protestants) who live there.

No, I am not talking about "British Forces".  I am talking about 
PEOPLE.  Bartenders, farmers, housewives.  Who happen to, for various

No you do not "see". there will be no further partioning of any
kind, the IRA will not be the government, the current republican
govt will control ALL of Ireland.

The PEOPLE you refer to are descendants of those deliberately
settled onto Irish soil by the British Government, to enforce their
rule, not unlike the British invasion of Iceland in WW II, they are
invaders every bit as much as the soldiers. Unlike the soldiers who
do not belong there, they would be free to remain, but under Irish,
not British law.

There will be no peace until this is so.

 I've never operated a crane, but I've watched a few.  It seems to me 
that, typically, the crane starts moving horizontally (inc. 
rotating) before the load does, and the crane stops first as well.

So to quickly move a load from one place to another, put it down in 
place, and not hit anything you didn't intend to hit, probably takes 
quite a bit of practice.

I really hate to defend the English actions in Ireland, which have in the

ancestors in Scotland...

Only one problem... the Irish government have made clear on many occasions
that they don't want the IRA and definitely don't want the Northern 
Protestants; AFAIR they even changed their constitution recently to remove
any claim on Northern Ireland. You can't seriously suggest dumping millions 
of Protestants into one of the most staunchly Catholic countries on the 
planet?

Uh, so an Irish Protestant who was born in Ireland, grew up in Ireland,
lives in Ireland, and comes from a family that's been living in Ireland
for centuries is an invader? I think you're letting emotion get in the
way of reality; which is the main reason why nothing has been solved
in Ireland despite decades of warfare.

> Unlike the soldiers who
>do not belong there,

In reality, of course, while the soldiers have on many occasions acted
reprehensively against the Republicans -- and IMHO some should have been
up in court on murder charges for it -- their main job is to keep the
Republican extremists and Unionist extremists apart, not to act as an
invading force.

>they would be free to remain, but under Irish,
>not British law.

But the vast majority of Northern Irish don't want that, and the Irish
government don't want that, so how is it going to happen? Trust me, the
majority of British people and government would be glad to get rid of 
Northern Ireland and give it to the South if they could do so.

Damien Broderick wrote 4/13/98: <Black holes evaporate when the external
temperature is *lower* than that of the hole, not higher.

This discussion seems wrong-headed anyway, because the canonical view of
Hawking radiation is that it's due to the infall of one half of a virtual
particle pair ripped out of the vacuum beyond the hole, and the slingshot
escape of the other.  Positive energy is *not* tunnelling out of the hole,
negative energy is being imported into it.  I can imagine that this is the
kind of claim that will set Reilly's teeth on edge...>

There is something here that sets my teeth on edge.  Black holes with less
mass evaporate because their temperature is greater than the background
temperature, black holes with more mass accrete because their temperature
is less than the background temperature.  Now, when we have a black hole
with sufficient mass to achieve a temperature a hair more than the
background temperature, it is evaporating.  As a gedanken experiment, let's
dribble itsy bitsy bits of matter towards this black hole and watch what
happens at the event horizon Planck moment by Planck moment.  We are
carefully cooling the black hole until, at a given Planck moment,
equilibrium is reached with the background temperature.  At the very next
Planck moment - Poof! - the black hole is now cooler than the background
and begins to accrete even after we immediately turn off the dribble of
matter.  In one instant, the black hole turns from an everyday ordinary
melting ice cube into a refrigerator powerful enough to suck in every bit
of matter and energy that drifts by it, to suck in the whole universe if we
could maneuver it into the black hole's vicinity.  The only way out of the
eternal mega-refrigerator scenario is to wait for the death-worshipper's
ultimate paradise - the heat death of the universe.  I just don't feel
comfortable with this.

The surface of the event horizon in such a scenario seems to me to be quite
complex.  Aside from tidal forces of rotation, which breaks the spherical
geometry of the surface and creates complex mixing patterns, there should
be peaks and valleys at the surface due to the underlying distribution of
matter inside the black hole and due to quantum fluctuations.  The surface
should be roiling like a flag blowing in the wind.  Evaporation would occur
at the peaks from the tangential shear from incoming particles and
accretion would occur in the valleys.  I am uncertain of the full nature of
particle interactions in such a scenario, but my intuition says that as the
peaks are sheared away in evaporation, the valleys temporarily are more
open to accretion in a see-saw action.  The canonical interpretation says
that the greater the event horizon is relative to the mass inside, the more
peaks control the action and vice versa.  But I not sure if the true
dynamics at the surface of larger masses tip the scale to the valleys.  I
am not certain that the thickness of the region where particles interact at
the event horizon is constant regardless of the mass of the black hole,
even though this is one of the underlying assumptions of the canonical
interpretation.  In any event, thanks for the response.

John Clark wrote 4/14/98: <If you define a vacuum far from any object as
having zero pressure and if the vacuum can still push the plates together
then the space between the plates  must have negative pressure. According
to Einstein, mass is not the only  thing that can warp space and time, that
is, create gravity, pressure can too, although this only becomes important
when the pressure is VERY high, like  inside a Neutron star. New theory
says negative pressure should do  interesting things to time and space
also, just like positive pressure, but  this part has not been confirmed
experimentally because the effect is so tiny. 

An observer's clock between the plates will (probably) run a little fast
and  for an observer outside the plates distances would (probably) expand a
little.  Since speed is distance divided by time nobody sees a change in
the speed of  light. This negative pressure idea is a little similar to the
old cosmological constant idea of Einstein, he later said that was the
worst mistake of his  life, but maybe not, it may play an important part in
the  evolution of the  universe.>

This is lucid and interesting to me.  John, I can't figure out why, after
publicly announcing that you think I and half my state should be
guillotined because we don't want to turn our doctors into murderers of the
old and sick, you still try to help me out, which, in fact, you do.  Why
are you helping me if you think my shoulders should be relieved of my head?

I am wedded to the cosmological constant because of my physical conception
of substance, of how gravity physically works, of the phenomenal continuum
between gravity and consciousness, only I am unsure if the "constant" is an
average constant, with local variability, or is an absolute constant.  I
also may be confusing aspects of the cosmological constant with the
location and quantum effects of negative energy.  I am, ahem, uncertain.

As an aside, since you're being helpful, I'll apologize for my reference to
"Kuhnian paradigms," I was just being irritating, rather out of character
for me.  Thomas Kuhn was a no-good relativist, pah!

JC: <The question was not whether the Big Bang is true or not but weather
it's a scientific theory or not, you said it was not but the only reason
given is that you just don't like it. If you have other reasons I'd like to
hear them.>

Earlier, you wrote your idea of what constitutes a scientific theory: "Any
theory that makes predictions and can in principle be proven wrong is
Science."  Now, I don't want to get into something I've exhaustively posted
on previously, but Popperian falsifiability is itself false, as I have
explained in detail.  The truth about scientific theory is that it
logically *must* be equally falsifiable as verifiable, again as previously
posted.  Verifiability comes when the words of scientific theory are
actualized in physical reality.  This is why there is no boundary between
technology and science.  Now, as to why the Big Bang is not science, it is
because physicists claim:

a) energy cannot be created from nothing and

b) energy was created from nothing.

This looks fishy to me.  Perhaps I don't have the relativist's useful
emotional capacity for embracing contradiction.

JC: <A singularity is a point where an equation no longer works because
values become infinite. There is absolutely no doubt that our equations do
this at the center of a Black Hole, whether this fact has any physical
significance remains to be seen.>

It only remains to be seen after we've completely melted a black hole.  In
the meantime, I will continue to view the postulation of singularities
physically existing inside black holes as kooky.  First reality, then math,
not vice versa.

JC: <If you're not the greatest you're certainly the world's most certain
expert, and on every subject under the sun. Unfortunately absolute 
certainty is a dime a dozen, being correct is not.>

This is a good example of the pot calling the kettle black.  If your
fixation on information as an ontological primitive, your "everything is
digital" worldview, isn't as hardcore a certainty as any expression of
religious dogmatism I've seen, then I don't know what is.  I'm certain of
that.  I'm also certain that it's a delusional worldview that proceeds from
its metaphysical premises to the political consequences of guillotines
working overtime.

I am proposing an idea, and I would like to see if there's any enthusiam for
it among extropians.  In short, Project Star Net (PSN) would aim to establish
an interstellar communication network.  Right now PSN is still in the
"thinking about it" stage, and I want to see if there's any interest in
forming an organization to pursue this worthy goal.

Nothing is written in stone at this early stage, but I do have a certain
vision that can serve as a basis for discussion.

I'm assuming there will be no sci-fi FTL stardrive.  I've heard attempts to
describe how such a drive might work, but they leave me unconvinced.  Even if
theory allows something like that to exist, the engineering difficulties are
overwhelming.  I'm not aware of any technology on the horizon that will let us
conjure up quantum singularities or magnetic monopoles.

So, I reckon the fastest and most efficient form of interstellar communication
and travel will be via the EM spectrum.  I envision a station (or node) in
each stellar system with powerful transmitters and receivers, thus allowing
data to be relayed to a specific destination, or propagated through the
network as a general broadcast.

A major goal would be the translocation (or "faxing") of persons across the
network.  So, if you wanted to visit Alpha Centauri, you could fax yourself
there in four years objective time, or zero subjective.  This would obviously
require some advanced technology to deconstruct the traveller and to recreate
him at the destination -- based on what I know of nanotechnology, it seems
reasonable that this could exist in the near future (i.e. within 50 years or
so).  If the technology proves impractical, the Star Net would be much less
useful, but still worth establishing purely as a communication device.

Because of the sheer size of the network and the associated netlag, it could
not be centrally managed.  In fact, once the first node is established, the
Star Net should automatically manage and maintain itself, and launch "seeds"
to establish new nodes, thus replicating until it ultimately spans our entire
galaxy.  This will require a certain level of artificial intelligence.

(BTW, I feel AI and nanotech are symbiotic fields of technology: they will
feed one another.  My view of PSN hinges on concurrent advances in both
fields.)

Now you have the general concept.  If we assume this may become feasible
sometime in the next 50 years or so, then it may not be too soon to start
planning and organizing to make it happen, and to be sure it's done right.
If PSN becomes a going concern, one of the first orders of business will be
studies to answer some important questions:

   * What is the most efficient way to launch "seed" probes across
     interstellar space?  Also, how small can such seeds be made?

   * What types of star systems should be candidates for
     establishing nodes?

   * What part or parts of the EM spectrum are suited to our use.

   * What are the practical limits of data throughput across
     interstellar distances?

   * What are the data requirements of transmitting a person?  What
     if the traveller is enhanced with extra memory -- do you charge
     by the gigabyte, or have a fixed rate for everybody?

   * What other types of data might be transmitted?  Free news,
     perhaps?

   * How can access to the network be allocated fairly?

   * What is the most likely way to finance the project?

   * How will the network respond if it "bumps into" an alien
     civilization?

   * If a star system is over-populated, can its inhabitants tell
     their station to refuse any new arrivals?  Are there other
     situations that could justify this option?  And what happens
     to the traveller who the station doesn't accept?

   * What kind of data security is required on transmissions?
     What degree of encryption, error correction, and redundancy
     is desirable?

Well, I could ramble on, but I expect I've posted enough to get some debate
started.  I really look forward to seeing opinions and ideas on this subject,
but most of all: Does it makes sense to form an official organization at this
point in time?

Of course, these are only one set of definitions.  Off the top of my head:

Murder = unlawfully killing a human
Murder = immorally killing (a human?)
Murder = not preventing a death
Murder = premeditated killing
Murder = killing with malice aforethought

and/or...

Abortion = the killing of a human reproductive cell
Abortion = the murder of a fetus
Abortion = the induced termination of a pregnancy
Abortion = the killing of a pre-born human

This neglects definitions af "immoral," "human," "fetus," "malice
aforethought..."

What is the flaw in changing the name Anarco-Capitalism to Agoric
Democracy?  This seems to be much more palatable for memetic
propagation purposes by making use of the popularity the democracy
meme has gained world-wide.  Where is my blind spot in thinking this
accurately conveys the concepts of Anarco-Capitalism?   Extropians
hear the word anarchy and visions of spontaneous order are dancing in
their heads.  To many others the word means rebellious teenagers who
want no rules.  Recently, I was on a website chat that forbid a small
handful of topics - one of which was anarchy.  I sent a polite message
to the webmaster asking why. I got a one word response...NO!. 
Extropians/Libertarians must find a way to work with one of our
greatest resources - the mainstream.  Much thanks to David Freedman
but you can keep the memetically dead name.

Huh? I don't see any problem at all here. Of course, I'm deep down a
mathematician, so I might have lost my common sense long ago. Remember
that even an evaporating black hole is still absorbing energy that
happens to get to close to the horizon. There is nothing qualitatively
different between a hole just below the background radiation level or
just above, both absorb and radiate about the same amount of energy
with the only difference that the difference between them changes sign
at a certain outside temperature. It is an unstable fixed point, no
more.

The rotation doesn't seem to cause complex mixing in the models I have
seen (although chaotic orbits exist), it just tends to smear out
everything latitudally. The underlying distribution of matter inside
don't have any effect on the horizon shape if the no hair theorems
hold (it seems reasonable, since a horizon almost by definition means
no information can get out of it). However, when non-symmetric matter
drops into the hole there will indeed be quite a bit of wobble,
numerical simulations suggest that the horizon behaves like a drop of
liquid mercury as it gradually settles down by radiating away the
anisotropy as gravity waves. Quantum effects might create more fuzz, I
noticed some discussions among theoretical physicists about "crewcut
black holes", which might have some "hair" (somebody even mentioned
"hippie black holes"). But overall, macroscopic black holes likely
have rather smooth horizons.

Interesting. I guess the evaporation might be anisotropic for a
excited black hole, further complicated by that the peaks and valleys
are radiating away themselves as gravity waves. I wonder if one could
get destabilizing effects by anisotropic evaporation that makes the
peaks accelerate or grow? Sounds like a wonderfully hard problem in
numerical black hole thermodynamics (if true, then black holes would
likely destabilize and radiate away very quickly and we would see
super-supernovas with total conversion of the black hole as the finale
of a stellar death. Gamma ray bursters, anyone? :-)

So it's a government of the IRA's choosing, imposed on people who do 
not choose it.

Yep.  The IRA (as an organization) is a looter just like any other 
government.

They would be free to give up everything they and their ancestors 
have worked for for centuries, or subject themselves to a government 
not of their choosing.

Yep, the IRA is a looter just like any other government.

There will be no peace WHEN it is so.  It just hasn't been generally 
realized that it is part of the nature of government to make war upon 
its own subjects.

I don't think this discussion is closely related to extropianism, but let me
try to turn it in that direction.

I believe that most ancestors of pro-British residents of Northern Ireland
moved there centuries ago, indeed longer ago than the arrival dates of most
ancestors of current USA citizens.

If some Choctaw were to point out to me, a fifth-generation Mississippian and
eleventh-generation Southron, that his folks were forcibly dispossessed of the
land beneath our feet and to say that jurisdiction therefore belongs to his
tribe's government, would Brian say that I should accept?  Note that the
Choctaws, one of the "Five Civilized Tribes", had a well-written constitution
and a functioning government before the ethnic cleansing that opened
Mississippi to my folks.

The idea that jobs currently done by government employees should instead be
done by private agencies chosen by each individual moves from idealism to
practicality when one considers the bloodshed that results from insistence
that every large geographic area should have a single sovereign power.

I might prefer living under a modernized Choctaw government but would not
acknowledge a nationalistic assertion of the Choctaw right to rule and would
consider myself justified in resisting violently any violence employed by a
hypothetical Choctaw Republican Army.

Attempting to substitute voluntary, private arrangements for governments is
preferable to pushing for rule by one government over another.  Failing that,
I favor the cantonments promoted by Loew and Kendall's _South_Africa:_The_
_Solution_.  By that standard, most governmental functions would devolve to
smaller areas of Northern Ireland--counties perhaps--and cantonal plebiscites
would determine whether London or Dublin would provide the few governmental
services that hadn't been devolved.

Governments exploit patriotism by falsely identifying themselves with the

Still, most sexual inclinations are defined genetically. I gave them as examples for biological properties in the wide area of sexuality that can be of benefit to the human race and therefore survive in the process of natural selection. Intersexuality is no such biological property.

For the record: You are talking about cultural evolution here and not about natural selection. Survival through the aid of technology -- in the context of biological evolution, this is impossible.

Sorry, because of the lack of sources in your original posting I had no choice but to call it belief.

The biggest factors in 'getting rich' are:

1. Make your own luck - get out there and hustle for your business.
2. Never take a loan if you can avoid it. Paying interest sucks the
lifeblood out of a business.
3. Be willing to live like a streetperson while pouring all your cash back
into the business.
4. Ignore all advice from the Wall Street Journal and MBA's, economics
professors on tenure, etc.

My business has been handicapped by raising a family, so I have not been
able to fully implement points 2 and 3 above. I have been working for five
years now, and am starting to see the end of my debt, and rising profits.
Unfortunately, this corresponds with sending three kids to college.

In short, if you are prepared to work long and hard (and smart!), you will
probably succeed. If not the first time, surely the second or third...

I have seen successful businesses reduced to chaos by managers that
slavishly followed the WSJ and any convenient corporate holy grail such as
'quality', 'downsizing' or 'just in time' wihtout understanding the basic
premises behind these concepts which have valid application in SOME businesses.

I fear it's bad form to reply to oneself, but I thought of two additions to
my comments on cantons below:

	I should have made clear that each canton's plebiscite would decide
	for that single canton whether it would "belong" to the UK or the
	Irish Republic.

	As I learned from Daibhi O Croinin's _Early_Medieval_Ireland_
	_400-1200_, which Jim Albea kindly lent me, multiple limited
	sovereignties operating within the context of an overarching customary
	law were distinctive features of pre-feudal Ireland.  The kings could
	not override private contracts and were subject to laws that could be
	changed only by assemblies.  A modernized version of that ancient
	system, which has similarities to the early Icelandic semi-anarchy
	lauded by David Friedman in _The_Machinery_of_Freedom_, could provide
	less-bad-than-average government.

The fact that it is neither agoric nor democratic?

(On second thought, I'm not sure what "agoric" means.  But when each 
person makes his own decision for himself and it applies to nobody 
else, that's hardly "democracy".)

Agoric is greek for market. As in agoraphobia, which translates to fear of
the market place (but is actually used as fear of wide open spaces).

See http://www.agorics.com/text/agoric.html for a precise definition.

I think what Joe's getting at, is that the MONEY votes. That's where the
democracy comes in.

Actually both - think of infalling as being forced down a funnel or cone,

  Er, actually, crushed in two dimensions (normal to the radius) and pulled
apart along the radius. Ouch!

This is something I have been wondering if the acceleration you experience in
falling into the hole, especially at near relativistic velocities, would provide
sufficient frame dragging to equalize the tidal streching with relativistic
compression.

Oh, of course, and there's a good reason why a medical doctor fresh out of 7 years
of medical school is still an intern, making not much more than minimum wage for
72 hour weeks, or why an engineer fresh out of engineering school cannot certify
plans for a skyscraper....

I really don't mean to belittle the trade at all. I'm just stating the fact that
relatively speaking, someone with forklift skills is a WHOLE lot closer to a
ditchdigger than they are to an architect in terms of training and skills. Even a
forklift operator with 30 years of experience is still a WHOLE lot closer to a
ditch digger than to an architect....

> And as far a CRANE!!  <shudder>

ha, yeah, I've operated cranes, small ones, before. It does take a deft touch, and
not everyone can do it, but its not that hard for someone raised on video games to
master rather quickly...  However, many port cranes that unload container ships
are ROBOTS.  A robot has no union, doesn't demand retirement benefits, or medical
insurance, doesn't walk out or sit down on you (although a new one can be buggy),
and works 24 hours a day with no breaks..... hmmmmmmm

I don't think you realize quite how weird things get close to a whole.  Inside
the light orbit radius (the point at which light orbits the hole) orbiting
the hole makes you fall in *faster*.  So tidal forces of rotation *smooth* the
black hole.

Also, there is no distribution of matter inside a black hole, at least as
far as an observer outside is concerned.  Even for an observer inside (if
such is even possible) much of the hole is unobservable and hence irrelevant.

Recently I visited the LA's Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) to view an
exhibition of "Action Art" (1950s - 1970s).   The exhibition consisted of
archival videos, writings, installations, and photographs of performances
and sculpture. While Action Art lasted only two decades, it did pave the
way for Performance Art which paved the way for our Transhumanist Extropic
Art known as "Automorph Art."

If you aren't familiar with Action Art, let me be briefly explain.  Action
Art began with Jackson Pollock's radical method of paintings where he
literally flung the oil painting off the canvas.  This became a statement
of that art can reach beyond the edges of a canvas or the edge of a
theatrical stage - beyond the confines of its form. 

Some example of Action Art are by Manzoni (Italy) who signed naked bodies
of people and then exhibited them as living sculpture; Yves Klein (France)
who authored political and social statements on blackboards and then sold
them as art works; and Joseph Beuys who created the Free University as a
multidisciplinary informational network which he called "social sculpture";
and also Allan Kaprow who is known for authoring _The blurring of  art and
life.

The legacy left by Action Art brought about an "acute awareness among
artists" giving its viewers a sample of "humanity as a work of art." There
were a few pieces that I favored at MOMA - the outrageous frankness of
Carolee Schneemann (known for pulling a 4 ' scroll out of her vagina and
reading it on stage (I did see her perform this in 1976 at the Telluride
Film Festival (1977))).  There were mementos of moments in art history -
moments where creative minds raced past the confines of tradition and
proclaimed each moment of their existence worthy of recording.

Remember, this was in the 1950s - 1970s and these artists were
experimenting with their consciousness and their bodies.  There was little
evidence of  bio-technology or interfacing with robotics. There was little
concern with indefinite lifespans.  There was little interest in enhancing
or augmenting intelligence. These artists exhibited their emotions - as raw
and exposed as they could - as if shouting to the World - "Come see me -
see who I am naked in my mundane life!"  Action Art shunned society's
covering up of thoughts (censorship) and the covering of the body (moralism).

Clearly, nakedness is not new to art, as evidenced in any art history
colorplate.  Genitals are exhibited in plain view in the painting of
"Madonna and Child" or Michelangelo rendered penises on the ceiling of the
Sistine Chapel.  Exploitative sex is visible in Hieronymus Bosch's "Garden
of Delights," (1500s).  Yet, soon the penis was morally covered with a
symbolic fig leaf and culture turned away from gawking at naked bodies on
display in their venerated, adorned and even "divined" creations.  

Indeed, Action Art was a sincere "Kick In The Ass" to humanity's moralism;
yet, Action Art wasn't pretty or particularly inviting.  In fact,
retrospectively it looked real dim to me.  If this genre symbolized the
"every day life of humanity" while shinning a light upon it -- How very dim
the bulb.  

Glad that my own work was not chosen for this particular exhibition, I
thought about the brilliant light of optimism and innovation shinning on
our transhumanity and that the art/science of our early transhuman efforts.  

Our incandescent "Kick Off" to transhumanity's potential may be exhibited
decades from now.

No. They are hierarchical because they have had an history of okonomy. Do  
you know f. exsample the industrial history of time? Do you know f. exsam- 
ple the industrial history of work-organisation and work-structures? Do  
you know, that the first industries had been "working-houses" for the  
poor? Do you realy knowing the diffrents between the short industrial  
history of USA and the much longer industrial history of Europe since the  
middle age?

Do you know that we have in Europe 25% non-hierarchical co-operations in  
competition? They don't need any hierarchy to survive in competition. So  
your thesis, that firms and groups in competition have hierarchical struc- 
tures cannot explain the entire reality.

Ah, the Middleclass dream -- the great illusion. Workers are "free" to  
live without wages. I see, that you don't want to discuss about interest  
and who bear interests because you possibly lose there your positive pic- 
ture of the good capitalism. But I'm not a Marxist.

What a nice simple picture. Unfortunately is this only a picture. Why are  
the high of wages in relation to the spending power on the same level as  
1970? Where comes your higher quality workers? Out of the Sky? Or must we  
spend money to give workers a better qualification?

Who produce your products? The managment? Of course, the workers. Only  
work gave the managment products to sell. So the managment need workers.  
And the managment need buyers to sell their products and to survive in  
competition. Every product have a price -- and this price is subordinated  
to all other prices for the same product of other firms who act in the  
same business. The competition force the high of the price who the firms  
can earn at the market. This price represent partly the costs of produc- 
tion: interests, materialcosts, firmownerloans, costs of promotion, tax,  
wages etc. If one buyer buy a product than he pay all this costs. And the  
majority of this buyers are workers who spend their money which they earn  
as wage.

Every firm hope to earn more money if they selling their products as they  
have had spend to produce them. Marx call this "Mehrwert" -- value adding.  
And every firm payed wages to the workers who are under that value adding,  
because their workers work is just one point in the list of cost of pro- 
ducing. -- This is the theory of labor which you don't reject with your  
nice picture above. The workers can only earn wages who are under that va- 
lue adding who pay capital gains of capital investments by as well firm  
owners as outside capital owners.

You forgot here the back of this class war. If the firms space out there  
workers and force them to live from there wages investments in the union  
than the workers must return to work if their collectively owned money is  
out. Than they have to acept every wage because they need money to survi- 
ve. And every firm are able to dismiss all striking workers and to hire  
other workers.

Many firms didn't acepted union members generally. In the USA are just 15%  
of all workers in an union.... I think, you have to notice that we have an  
diffrent capitalism after the New Deal of 1913 -- which Marx who died seve- 
ral years before havn't known.

I don't suggest this. I havn't proposed that workers are forced to earn  
wages of one firm's to survive. I have proposed that workers are forced to  
sell their work and have therefore to be on the staff of one of the phara- 
os. They could only change their jobs if there are other firms in their re- 
gion who seek for new workers in their training-groups. If they lose there  
jobs and havn't the right qualification than they are unenployed -- inde-  
pended of how industrious they are.

Your mistake is, that your thinking about the labor market use a universal  
worker and don't deal with workers of diffrent qualifications. A worker  
with the qualification to assemble cars cannot produce tomorrow computer- 
chips without a long training to get a new qualification. A doctor who ha-  
ve studied physik couldn't sell his work as a doctore of medicine.

Unfortunately are 51% of all costs of labor costs of transactions; it's  
cheaper for the firm's today and tomorrow to do this work with a PC. 51%  
of all jobs get lost in the coming time sequence of the next 30 years. All  
other jobs will in future need more and more an academic qualification.

"Relative Bioavailability of Coenzyme Q10 Formulations in Human Subjects"

Summary:

    The relative bioavailability of typical commercially available forms of
coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) was compared with that of Q-Gel, a new solubilized
form of CoQ10, in human subjects in two separate trials. In the first,
standard softgel capsules containing CoQ10 suspension in oil, powder-filled
hardshell capsules and powder-based tablets were tested along with Q-Gel
using a daily dosage of 120 mg for three weeks. The baseline plasma CoQ10
values were all very tight (0.50-0.52 microgram/mililiter) and after three
weeks the values were 1.37, 163 and 1.60 microgram/mililiter for the first
three products and 3.31 micrograms/mililter for Q-Gel. The relative
bioavailability calculated using the areas under the plasma CoQ10 curve
(AUC) were (microgram/mililterXtime in days) 7.16 (100%), 8.97(125%),
9.19(128%) and for Q-Gel 22.86(319%). The second trial, carried out to
replicate the findings in the first, employed only two groups, namely the
standard softgel capsules containing the suspension and Q-Gel, and the
duration was extended to four weeks. Plasma CoQ10 values were: baseline
0.40 and 0.38 and after four weeks 1.26 and 2.80; the corresponding AUCs
were: 8.33 (100%) and 22.75 (273%). Thus the data from both the trials show
that Q-Gel, the new solubilized form of CoQ10, is vastly superior to
typical commercially available preparations of CoQ10. This means much lower
doses of Q-Gel will be required to rapidly reach and maintain adequate
blood CoQ10 values than with any of the other currently available products.

Note: Q-Gel is a proprietary formula (patent pending) containing CoQ10 in a
blend of sorbitan monooleate, polysorbate 80, medium chain triglycerides,
propylene glycol, d-alpha tocopherol and PVP (Pasdone).

As people's lifespans slowly but surely start to increase, the frequency
of death from "unnatural causes" will also increase. Eventually, the
chance of dying in a car accident or plane crash will become quite
significant. Approximately one in 2 million flights go down. That means
that if you make only 100 flights in your life, the chance is one in
20,000 that one of the planes will go down - that's way "better" than
the lottery. I saw a rather horrifying TV program recently called "Why
planes go down". Human error is by far the major reason. Anyway, there
was one crash in which one of the engines blew out, and the pilots had
to land the plane as best they could. Even though they had 1/2 hour to
get the plane down, something like 150 people died. A rather obvious
question is "why do airlines not make parachutes available to
passengers." Admitedly, there are some incidents where you have _no_
time to save anybody, but sometimes there _is_ time to bail out. It may
seem like a naive question, but I would appreciate people's opinions.

One problem I see in presenting transhumanist art is the resistance to
optimism in current culture; anything too optimistic is regarded as
shallow because it ignores the "reality" of suffering (a way of
thinking which I must admit I have never understood but seems to be
popular). How do we circumvent that?

In the case of a black hole sufficiently large and massive that the tidal
forces at the event horizon do not tear one apart - does anyone have
theories on what the gravitational conditions INSIDE the event horizon are?
If an observer could survive the transition inside the horizon, would the
situation be similar to that inside a large mass - the gravitation would
drop smoothly to the center of mass - or is the situation completely unknowable?

If the parachutes could be made sufficiently automatic so as to require NO
user interaction, and the aircraft could be equipped with a door openable in
the air (old 727's come to mind, and DC-8's?) this could become a reality.
If the airlines see the same public relations benefit to this that they see
in putting defibrillators on board, they might do it without governmental
prodding.

Some major problems occur to me - as an engineer, I always see problems with
things like this, but that starts me thinking of solutions...

The biggest problem I see is how do you control landing? Coming down in an
urban area, on power lines, in water, etc...

Personally, I wish I did have access to a 'chute when I fly. Trusting my
safety to a machine of unknown maintainance history, operated by persons of
whom I have no knowledge of their abilities and mindset, always makes me
quite nervous..

No, infalling victims/observers do not notice anything special when
they pass the horizon, the tidal forces just continue to grow. Note
that a black hole is a vacuum solution of the field equations, so the
only place where there could be "mass" is at the singularity (and
there, it is doubtful if it can be called mass); a black hole is
almost completely a spacetime phenomenon once it has formed. What is
important is the curvature, and it increases indefinitely as one
approaches the singularity.

See _Gravitation_ by Misner, Thorne, Wheeler for an analysis of this.

More and more companies are downsizing.

More and more people are working for themselves, and many are [or want
to] work out of their homes.

There are something like 80,000,000 users of the Internet today, and the

Net is a wild, crazy ever-changing, anarchistic baby that seems to be
living in the days of the Wild West!  There are no rules, because
technology keeps changing the playing field.

So how can an individual work from home and take advantage of the Net?

Its hard.  Really hard.  If you are selling a service, or a product, and

you are not a large company, just what can you do?

Email.

Spam?  No - responsible email, with no hype, no lies, no bull.  Yes,
there are some who say that ANY form of unsolicited email is illegal.

Wrong!!!

There are no laws against bulk email so long as the message is not
fraudulent, just like regular bulk mail.

So, by using responsible email, you can reach that huge market at a
fraction of the cost of traditional bulk mail.  Less than 1/10th of a
cent per address...

We will send 100,000 pieces of email for just $99 with up to one full

I don't see why you're uncomfortable with this.  It won't suck the whole
universe in because you *can't* maneuver it into the black hole's vicinity.
Furthermore, if the universe is open, then it (the U.) will expand until
it's temperature is lower than the BH's, at which point the BH will again
start to evaporate.  (This could even happen if the U. is not open, but
expands for a sufficiently long time.)  And since the U. is expanding, it
gets harder and harder to maneuver stuff into the BH's vicinity, since
things are getting further and further apart.  And if the U. is closed
tightly enough that it starts to contract before it gets cool enough to
cause the BH to start evaporating, then it will collapse long before
the BH has any chance to gobble everything up --- except during the last
instance, when all the BH's in the universe get close enough to touch,
merge, and swallow everything up just before the universal singularity.
(In fact, I'm not enough of a GR expert to say if this will happen;
perhaps some matter/energy will remain outside BH's right down to the
last Planck moment before the collapsed universal singularity.)

So, what exactly is it that makes your teeth uncomfortable?

I'm puzzled here. At the end of your message you *do* in fact offer another
definition. Clearly what you suggest is not an *explanation* as distinct
from a definition, since explanations are longer than definitions.

For a definition, perhaps. My revised version is shorter (60% of the length
of the original). For an *explanation* it would be too short, but I agree
that for a definition, the shorter the better so long as it conveys the
essence of the meaning.

I've done that in the new version.

True, though I think it's reasonable to assume people would understand the
definition is referring to *us*. However, I've fixed that possible
misconception in the revised version.

I'm not too comfortable with dropping this clause, since the ethical aspect
I see as a vital part of transhumanism, but I do agree with your comment
here. So I've dropped that clause, but would mention the ethical and
psychological aspects of transhumanism in any explanation so that it
doesn't sound like a narrow technological view.

Yes, its certainly important to include these approaches. The intent of the
original was to make clear that we're talking about truly effective methods
rather than religious or supernatural methods. In the revised version, I've
taken into account both my original intention and your excellent point.

"the human condition will be dramatically transformed" won't do because it
leaves open all kinds of tranformations that we certainly do not seek. Are
we to transform ourselves into mindless drones? Into animals? Into
creatures lacking the human drives to create, to understand, to learn? My
definition avoids this problem.

Okay, so here is my revised definition. I'll refine it further if anyone
can pick holes in it! The final version will go in the Neologisms section
of ExI's web site, and I'll also contact the editor who called me from the
Oxford English Dictionary. (They are considering the terms "transhumanism"
and "extropy" and "extropian" for the next revision of the OED.)

TRANSHUMANISM: Any philosophy of life that seeks the acceleration of our
development beyond its currently human limitations by means of science,
technology, creativity, and other rational means.


Onward!

When thinking about federal (FDA/DEA) drug control, think
about this. The Washington Post (04/15/98) [1] reports:


      PRESCRIBED DRUGS' TOLL IS AMONG DEADLIEST

	By Rick Weiss 

	More than 2 million Americans become 
	seriously ill every year because of 
	toxic reactions to correctly prescribed
	medicines taken properly, and 106,000 
	die from those reactions, a new study 
	concludes. That surprisingly high num-
       ber makes drug side effects at least 
	the sixth, and perhaps even the fourth, 
	most common cause of death in this country.

	The analysis, the largest and most 
	complete of its kind, suggests that 
	one in 15 hospital patients in the 
	United States can expect to suffer 
	from a serious reaction to prescription
	or over-the-counter medicine, and about 
	5 percent of these will die as a result.


The Study was just published today in the Journal of the 
American Medical Association. From the JAMA website [2]: 


	ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS MAY

	CHICAGO  Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
	in U.S. hospitals may be responsible 
	for more than 100,000 deaths nationwide 
	each year, making it one of the leading
	causes of death, according to an article 
	in the April 14 issue of The Journal of

IAN: Important to note: the study seems only to have 
included drugs prescribed to hospitalized patients,
yet I would expect that most prescription drugs are
prescribed to patients NOT hospitalized. If 5% of 
hospitalized patients prescribed a drug will die
from that drug, and if hospital prescriptions 
account for (just a guess) 20% of all prescriptions,
then there could be upwards of 500,000 people dying
every year from prescription drugs (just a guestimate)!

-- SOME HOLISTIC-COMPARATIVE THINKING --

Now consider how a couple people died from contaminated
tryptophan and the FDA bans it overnight,  paving the 
way for Prozac to dominate the serotonin-enhancement
market without a cheap non-prescription alternative.

Now consider how one person dies of a heart attack 
after taking an herbal supplement containing the 
herb ephedra and the FDA goes into hysteria that 
the herb must be banned, meanwhile all the FDA-
APPROVED drugs have over 100,000 Americans on 
an assembly line to the graveyard every year!
There is something seriously wrong here, and
the factor that makes it all logical is power:
the Govt will use any pretext to gain more power.

Now think about illicit drugs. Cannabis for example
kills nobody per year.  All other illicit drugs kill
around 5,000 per year, and we're talking about impure
drugs of strengths that vary from one "basement batch"
to the next,  which is a leading reason they kill any-
body.  Yet we are led to believe that they are illegal
because they kill people... BULLSH*T!! They are illegal
because they cause "wrong thinking" and "wrong feelings,"
because they compete with alcohol, tobacco, Dupont,...

We still live in medieval times, our lives controlled by
barbaric and tyrannical thugs willing to resort to any 
level of aggression or fraud to stuff The People into
a dungeon of darkness for the power-profits of a few.

I've never heard of anisotropic evaporation, but if a Neutron star were to        
fall in or two black holes were to merge the event horizon would pulsate, 
it would ring like a bell. If the holes was spinning rapidly the pulsations 
would extract energy from the rotations and many people thought that the  
pulsations would keep growing until the hole was torn apart. However in 1971  
Saul Teukolsky proved that regardless of its rotational speed the hole would 
remain stable, the pulsations do extract energy from rotation but they do not 
grow without limit because they radiate even more energy away as gravitational 
waves so the pulsations damp down.

Relativistic compression as the name implies depends on the observer, to you 
nothing special is happening you're not compressed at all. Tidal stretching 
(and crushing) is absolute because every observer including you would notice 
that your head and feet were in very different reference frames and that 
could be uncomfortable.

Neither publicly nor privately did I announce any such thing. I don't want to 
turn anybody into a murderer. I did say that people should not be punished 
for allowing an individual to make the most important decision a human can 
make, ESPECIALLY if they're old and sick. I love life so I personally don't  
care if you dislike euthanasia, I care a little more that you'd vote against 
it,  but not much because voting means almost nothing. Needless to say I have 
no wish to send you or half your state to the guillotine.

However, if I decided to die and you felt so strongly about it you'd used 
force to stop me, I would with a clear conscience do what I had to do to 
defend  my autonomy, and if that includes causing your head and shoulders to 
become discontinuous so be it. Making a person live when they want to die is 
the moral equivalent of murder.

Speaking of suicide, if a transhuman decided that eternity was just a little 
bit too long there is a way he could go out in style. The quasar 3C273 almost 
certainly has a black hole of 10 billion solar masses in it. At the event 
horizon the tidal forces would be barely noticeable, even by a frail human, 
and would not become lethal for almost an hour (your time), and by then you'd  
literally be face to face with quantum gravity and a naked singularity.   
Unfortunately you'd be unable to communicate your adventure to anyone but 
you'd see things nobody has ever seen or imagined before. Actually you  
couldn't even be sure it would kill you because what the singularity is like  
is anybody's guess.

> What is the flaw in changing the name Anarcho-Capitalism to Agoric
> Democracy?

      It would be a _lie_.  Good definitions read 'from right to left.'

                  
The flaw is that Capitalism is neither anarchic nor agoric, and -- as Noam 
Chomsky among many others has pointed out -- Anarcho-Capitalism would in 
practice very likely produce the most hideous tyranny the world has ever 
seen.  You do not have to meet many Anarcho-Capitalists to realize this. 
These are people whose minds have been seized by an axiomatized deductive 
system.  Every question becomes ansered by a look-up table, or mantra-like 
incantations of 'the market will sort it out.'

   Even 'saints' would wind up as tyrants under anarcho-capitalism.

      Individual freedom is an optimum, not an absolute.

   [ FX: "SHOUT MODE ON:" ]

      There is no 'Absolute Foundation' for property rights, and to 
      propose to base an entire society on the illusion that there is, is 
      the sort of crass folly only clever people are capable of.

   [ FX: "SHOUT MODE OFF" ] 

      Even _one_ working example would be nice...


Capitalism. (n).  Hierarchical economic system structured to give further 
cascading privileges to the existing owners and controllers of Capital.  
Usually turns into 'crony-Capitalism' (ref: Hernando de Soto, 'El Otro Sendero').  

Supposed benefits include fabled 'trickle-down' of economic resources, 
which is no doubt why 350 000 children die _every day_ from preventable 
disease and malnutrition.  Imagine yourself reading gung-ho capitalist 
tracts to them as they die hideously in front of your eyes...


Agorism. (n). Horizontalist, 'reticular' or networked system of 
interacting _equals_.  Note that Agorism is a fully-fledged _social_ 
system while Capitalism is an _economic_ system.


Anarcho-Capitalism: (n). Imaginary system of society where powers of 
absolute government (secret police;  mass murder -- i.e. nuclear weaopons; 
torture chambers -- i.e. maximum security prisons; judicial murder -- i.e. 
'the death penalty', etc. etc.) are all up for sale to the highest 
bidders. Any half-way intelligent devious 'Capitalist' (I know several) 
will show you how to turn all this into an absolute dictatorship while 
still retaining the 'anarcho-capitalist' labels and trimmings.  Take a 
look at some of the caricatures of the 'New World Order' sometime.


Ask an 'anarcho-capitalist' if they believe in (a) unrestricted private 
ownership of thermonuclear weapons (i.e. the means of indiscriminate mass 
murder) and (b) systematized murder (the 'death penalty'), all under their 
personal control.  If they answer 'yes', (a) pre-emptively kill them if 
they give you a funny look; or (b) run like hell!  >:-}


  Whereas Democratic Agorism already exists -- i.e. 

      http://www.agora.demon.co.uk/agora3.txt


In practice, 'anarcho-capitalism' is 'salonfahig'; a fashionable fig-leaf 
for existing privilege, and a time-sink and a pitfall for freedom-seekers. 
Anarcho-capitalists usually attach themselves to right-wing conservatives 
for company -- i.e. to right-wing pols like Thatcher, or 'intellectuals' 
like Charles Murray).  Amusingly, many 'anarcho-capitalists' are State 
agents of various kinds; nothing against State agents, you understand...

hi

heres some info from www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/basicfax.htm

<< The number of drug deaths in the US in a typical year is as follows: 



Tobacco kills about 390,000. 
Alcohol kills about 80,000. 
Sidestream smoke from tobacco kills about 50,000. 
Cocaine kills about 2,200. 
Heroin kills about 2,000. 
Aspirin kills about 2,000. 
Marijuana kills 0. There has never been a recorded death due to marijuana at
any time in US history. 
All illegal drugs combined kill about 4,500 people per year, or about one
percent of the number killed by alcohol and tobacco. Tobacco kills more people
each year than all of the people killed by all of the illegal drugs in the
last century.   >>


I think those numbers are from the actual drugs themselves, there are lots of
deaths from people being killed in drug deals, and if they were legalized,
that wouldnt happen.  I read something, that one of the reasons a lot of
people take cocaine is because its expensive, and assumed to be of quality,
you know, rich people and movie stars, you always hear about it, they wouldnt
being sniffing glue, although that can get you high too, and its addictive.
If cocaine were legal it would be cheap, or could be made to be cheap like
glue (btw the CIA makes money from cocaine, or has in the past, lots of it, so
im sure they like it where it is).

I like this, since it suggests that creativity is or can be rational.

Who's dumping who? They already live there..... When I was a
practicing Catholic most of my neighbors were Protestant, we didn't
go around killing each other over it. The difference in religion is
just a small part of it.

Loyalists do not consider Northern Ireland part of Ireland, nor
themselves Irish, but a party of Britain and themselves British
citizens.

I've never met anyone of Irish decent who did not want
reunification. If troops are needed to keep the factions apart for
now they should be U.N. troops, not British soldiers. This would be
a good first step.

This is the extropian component of this subject, how could we
resolve this conflict, and what actions could we take in the future
to avoid creating these situations?

Hmm. Does anyone else think that transhumanism is weakened
definitionally by the use of 'seeks.' 

It seems to me that one could espouse a transhumanist philosophy without
doing much of anything, really. Transhumanism *could* be a waiting game. 

Maybe something like this (?):

TRANSHUMANISM: Any philosophy of life that accelerates our development
beyond currently human limitations by way of science, technology,
creativity, and other rational means.

This requires every philosophy that might call itself transhumanist to
*prove* it by pointing to the ways it accelerates development. 

It all depends on whether we want to tighten the standard by which
transhumanist philosophies are judged. This little alteration might be
enough to nip any 'rapture of the future' accusations in the bud.
Transhumanism requires a person to develop now, not just later
(perpetually deferred).

Lifespan increases trough better technlogy, better technology also makes

Of course one must not panic, you know, remember to pull that cord and
stuff. Considering the way most people behave during situations a lot less
stressful (a small traffic accident) I would not bet on this saving many
lives. Better to spend the money elsewhere. Improving the planes and better
training of the pilots (maybe even more pilots per plane). The most
dangerous part of any plane-trip is the car-ride to the airfield.

Even if there's a nice meadow you can still break quite a few bones

para-jumping.

I doubt the number would extrapolate that simply;
patients in a hospital are statistically more ill than
those not hospitalized, so are more likely to die from
an ADR (because they were closer to death already).
I suspect that the larger number (2 million ill from
ADR) might scale better.

I can't see a situation where it would be safe and practical for the
passengers in a commercial jet to put on parachutes and jump out.
It would take a long time to get everyone strapped in and out of the
airplane.  Few emergencies reveal themselves far enough in advance that
this could be done.

Jumping out of a jet is not going to be very safe.  Jets tend to fly
a lot faster than planes normally do when dropping parachuters.  There
may not be a good place to jump out from, and you could be blown into
the wings or engines.  Parachuting itself requires some skill, so that
you don't release the chute while tumbling and become entangled in it.
Then, as was mentioned, there is the issue of landing and being rescued.

All in all it seems very unlikely that this would be a practical method
to save lives.

Hal

 Just one picky grammar thing... I think perhaps it should read "...its
current (not currently) human limitations"  The word current is an adjective
describing the noun limitations, not an adverb describing the adjective
human.  It is our limitations which are current.  Though it is true we are
"currently human", I don't think this is your intended interpretation.

 This doesn't make sense to me.  Longer life spans would not increase the
_frequency_ of unnatural deaths.  Let's say you would normally live 100
years and you are risk-aversive to the degree that you have a 1% chance of
dying an unnatural death over the length of your life-span.  If you then
become able to live for 200 years and maintain that same level of
risk-aversiveness, then (all other things being equal) you will still have a
1% chance of dying an unnatural death.  It's just that 1% of 100 is only
one-half of 1% of 200.

And if your life was extended indefinitely (to infinity), there would be a
1% probablity times infinity (equivalent to 100% probability) that you would
die of an unnatural cause eventually (even if you significantly reduced your
exposure to risk).  Am I right people?

  IAN: One thing we're rediscovering is how much
  good stuff is in old fashioned herbs and remedies,
  how much wisdom was in the teaching of the ancients,
  of the yogis, Taoists, and Zen masters.  No question
  modern technology is where its at and is the greatest
  thing we've ever come across and is the only hope for
  the future of freedom, but, overwhelmed by modernism
  we have, assuming all that is old is outdated and
  wrong, ignored ancient wisdoms from our roots.

  Fuzzy logic is a great example of our evolution and
  simultaneous rediscovery thereby of the validity of
  ancient wisdoms, also holistic logic I'm mapping,
  quantum mysteries, and other new/old paradigms.

   IAN: Very true, they are also assuredly given
   more and stronger drugs... however, consider
   that other factors come into play regarding 
   prescription drug use outside the hospital
   (which could be defined as "prescription use
   not under direct supervision") such as a greater 
   rate of drug abuse and misuse (many overdoses are
   accidental, usually old people who forget they just
   took their dose...), multiple prescriptions given to 
   the same patient from different doctors that cause 
   deadly interactions,  accidents caused by people
   under the influence of "dizzy making" Rx drugs.

   Factor in all such and that number might hold.

Well, yes in a sense. What I was trying to say was that I did not 
want to redefine the concept, i.e. alter the meaning of 
the term 'transhumanism. Rather, I was trying to give an alternative 
characterization of the pre-existing concept. In this sense there can 
be several definitions that are all correct (though they can't, of 
course, substantially contradict wach other).

The definition doesn't assert that we *want* any of those 
transformations. It leaves open the possibility that they might 
happen. If we were 100% sure that the transformation could only 
happen in the way we prefer, then we could cancel our efforts and 
spend the rest of our days drinking cocktails. I see it as a virtue 
that the difinition doesn't simply assume that things will work out 
right.

As I see it, transhumanism has a descriptive and a normative 
component:

The first conjunct in my definition expresses the 
descriptive component. This is the hypothesis that the human 
condition will be dramatically transformed by technology. It could be 
weakened to "can be dramatically transformed". This would make the 
prediction conditional upon the appropriate actions being taken. But 
I think that practically every transhumanist believe the stronger 
claim that this *will* happen (in a good way or in a bad way), so why 
water it down.

The second conjunct expresses the normative component, that we *want* 
the human condition to be transformed, and that we *want* it to 
happen in such a way that we can overcome our biological limitations. 
(Individual transhumanists might in addition have more specific 
goals, such as libertarianism, hedonism, the Far Edge party etc. 
etc.)

Now, if it's going into the OED, we have to work on it hard. (I think 
this version is much better than the previous one.) Here are some 
more comments:

1. Is the "of life" really necessary? It sounds a bit clumsy to me. 
Also, not all aspects of transhumanism are directly related to the 
"How to live?"-question: part of it is very theoretical discussions 
about the likelihood of extraterrestrials or the future development 
of microprocessors.

2. I miss the descriptive, factual part. As it stands, it is purely 
normative: "WE WOULD REALLY LIKE TO TRANSCEND
THROUGH TECHNOLOGY". I think an essential part of transhumanism is 
the belief that the human condition *will* (with high probability) be 
dramatically changed by technology. (However, hopefully "we seek" 
will be understood to imply that we believe the possibility exists. 
Since I can't think of a nice brief formulation that makes the 
factual claim more explicit, I won't include it in the modified 
version I will suggest below.)

3. "the acceleration of our  development..." I like the *sound* of 
this, but I have some ideological problems with it:
"accelerate" means move faster. While we tend to be excited by new 
technological breaktroughs, I wonder whether this speed-paramenter 
should be part of the definition. Sure, we want to develop further, 
and yes, other things equal, most of us would presumably want this to 
happen sooner rather than later. But what the optimal speed of 
development is, is something that depends on a complex tradeoff 
between  costs, benefits, risks, practicalities and policy-issues. I 
think transhumanists can have different views on this. We shouldn't 
make the "As fast as possible, no matter what!" attitude a 
transhuman catechism. Suppose someone is impressed by the dangers of 
nanotechnology, and wants development to be delayed until we 
have developed proper nano-immune systems. Such a person might think 
that the pace at which we are developing today is about right; it 
wouldn't be good to accelerate more. It seems to me this person could 
be a perfect transhumanist. I'm sure the above definition could be 
streched and interpreted in such a way as to accomodate for this; but 
there does appear to be some strain.  I think it much more 
important that we get to our goal than that we get there a couple of 
years sooner or later, though I'm aware of the enormous amount of 
misery that every year or month of delay will cause. We want to be 
sane, responsible drivers, not speed-intoxicated madmen ideologically 
compelled to max the accelerator.

What about(?):

TRANSHUMANISM: Any philosophy that seeks to advance our development 
beyond its currently human limitations by way of science, 
technology, creativity, and other rational means.

Social systems tend to be quasi-chaotical, so it might be impossible 
to tell with any certainty what philosophies have what effects on our 
development. Suppose Rifkin formulates a really horrible philosophy 
that causes a huge backlash for all technophobic thinking. That would 
then make him a transhumanist, whereas we ourselves, if we have bad 
luck, might not be.

("by way of" is probably better than "by means of", since "means" is 
otherwised used twice in one sentence.)

I think this would apply only in an individual case. The previous post seemd
to consider more than one person.

If you look at a population, rather than an individual, the frequency of
accidental deaths to natural ones must rise as the average lifespan
increases, unless you also have a corresponding increase in safety. 

I can't conceive of living in a totally risk-free environment - no spice in
life! We all must decide for ourselves what constitutes an acceptable risk.
Of course, I would not welcome risk due to another person's attempts to
relieve HIS boredom!

Property rights, to everything except raw natural resources 
(inc. land) land, can be directly derived from a right of 
self-ownership.  So can freedom of speech, assembly, religion, etc.  

So failure to support property rights is qualified failure to support 
the right of self-ownership, which is a qualified endorsement of 
slavery.

Property rights to raw natural resources (inc. land) can be 
developed from the pragmatic need to enforce property rights in other 
things; from concern about the environment; from considerations of 
efficiency.  In fact we observe worldwide that natural resources 
which are unowned (not the property of any particular person) in 
their natural state are abused, overexploited, and threatened, 
except in those cases where by government decree they are 
underutilized, and then usually neglected; those which are owned and 
thoroughly under the control of the owner, are comparatively *much* 
better cared for.

Depends on how you interpret the sentence.

As our control of disease and aging becomes perfect, and we become 
significantly more reliably nice to each other, accidental deaths 
will approach 100% of all deaths, as opposed to its current level 
of... um... 10%?  That's quite an increase.

Incorrect.  You would have a 1% chance of dying an unnatural death IN 
YOUR FIRST 100 YEARS!!!

Ignoring the safety-enhancing effect of maturity and experience, if 
you survive the first 100 years you would have a 1% chance of dying 
an unnatural death in your second century.  That's a combined 1.99% 
chance of dying an unnatural death.

(In reality, your chances of dying an unnatural death in any given 
year are rather higher from birth through age 25 than at a later 
ages; and presumably the rate continues to decline until the 
eyesight- and reflex-weakening effects of age counteract the 
advantage of increased knowledge and experience.)

It isn't multiplicative.  It's exponential, and the proper way to 
express it is the chance of *not* dying of an unnatural cause, which 
is .99 (the chance per period) to the power of the number of periods 
in question.  Given enough periods, the chance is arbitrarily close 
to zero but never actually reaches mathematical zero.

Consider context.  When such a statement is made, seems to me it's usually

Given your open hostility to individualism in general, and in particular

on the same subject.

But that's all talk, not behavior.  Here is a statement about my own
behavior.  I have twice (I think) picked up my gun "in anger", both
times at night: when a woman's voice called for help, and when something
in my kitchen made loud noises and frightened the cat.  (In the former
case, somebody threw a punch or two in a quarrel over parking; it was
all over before I reached the scene.  The noise in the kitchen was
raccoons; they fled my light.)  Assuming I'm not lying, would you
like to infer anything from these anecdotes?

Irrelevant on two counts.  If both parties benefit from trade, it's worse
than pointless to quibble which benefits more.  But more importantly,
which "developing" (ha) countries have you in mind, that have genuine
market economies - where the dictator hasn't got a monopoly of everything
that might be valuable?

: That's why the US have one of the highest crime rates in the world.

As a nation of immigrants, we have an excess of young single males,
the class most likely to be criminals.  Still, most ethnic groups here
are more peaceful than their counterparts back home (or so I've heard),
and our crime rate had been dropping for decades (even through the Great
Depression!) before Big Brother got serious about suppressing the market
(oo, that nasty word again) in specialty pharmaceuticals.

: That's why big capital eats little capital, little capital likes to give.

No, silly, *big* capital likes to give bribes ("campaign contributions")
to legislators, to make life harder for little capital.  Such giving is,
unfortunately, rewarded.

The degree to which "big capital eats little capital" is exaggerated, 
of course.  A merger of dinosaurs makes headlines; its subsequent
loss of market share to upstarts is ignored.

: The workers like to give, too, with their net wages and standard of living

Which is why we're so much poorer than our great-grandparents, eh?

: They all give. But who takes?

That's the beauty of the market: you take by giving.

   IAN: I have in fact defined that quite clearly
   for several years: If A is the set containing 
   all things that define A, including not-A, and 
   if not-A is the set containing all things that 
   define not-A, including A, then A = -A, as both
   sets contain the same members. If we remove not-
   A from the universal set containing A, we also 
   remove A; if we remove what it isn't we remove
   what it is, thus what it is contains what it
   is not, and thus not-A is just side 2 of A.

   There is (in)A and (out)A and (super)A = (in)+(out).
   It is via (super)A that (in)A acquires identity.

Biological death is not the only way to not-live. The absence of risk
is not the absence of chance or opportuity, but the fruit of careful
strategic planning.

   IAN: Attributes of identity are what a thing

   the identity of A. Same goes for all relative
   features: A is fast, A is good, A is warm,...

   IAN: Difference is symmetrical: if A is 
   shorter (-) than B, then B is taller (+)
   than A. Note that (-)(+) implies symmetry.

   So yes, I turned "well-established usage on 
   its head," because this "well-established"

   IAN: The matrix you just scoff off just showed
   you is that the relation of A to A = 0. All the
   identity attributes of A are derived from not-A.
   So what you call "logical identity" exists not.

  IAN: That's tangential to the issue. The
  issue is "is identity a product of 'same

  it is, is the principle of identity.

  Your doing a lot of talking but no 
  evidencing of your case by showing 
  an identity that is what it is free
  from difference, free from relation.

  Difference is the definition of 
  identity, both logically and factually.

  A is A if and only if A is different than not-A.

  IAN: "Equal" = "same as." I think

  The cat is defined by difference, and

I spend a LOT of time on airplanes and have thought about this quite a bit and
have to agree with Hal -- individual parachutes seems a completely unworkable
solution.  Almost every idea I've ever considered to make large commercial
airliners more safe has always ended up making the plane too heavy to fly, or
at least fly profitably.

Two ideas contiue to intrigue me, though.  One is a detachable passenger
compartment that has SOME sort of deployable aero-drag device or combination
of devices.  The other is an internal fire-retardant foaming system that
activates in anomolous situations (read crashes).  Even if done with the
lightest, cleverest materials and designs, both would add significantly to the
weight and therefore operating cost of the planes and both would also have
safety COSTS, since accidental deployment of either system would tend to ruin
your whole day . . .

I think there has been plans to create a ejectable containment with
the passengers which is braked by a biggie 'chute. Braking with
just-before-impact triggered solid-fuel thrusters could make the
landing even safer. Of course if your containment is drifting
somewhere in the stormy sea after the 'safe' landing you've got 
another, larger problem upon your hands...

IT WAS JUST RELEASED!!

INTRODUCING...MILLIONS VOL. 1

We took a total of over 92 million email addresses from many of the 
touted CD's that are out there (bought them all - some were $300+)!  
We added the millions we had in storage to those.   When we 
combined them all, we had in  excess of 100+ million addresses 
in one huge file. 

We then ran a super "sort/de-dupe" program against this huge list. 
It cut the file down to less than 25 million!!! Can you believe that? It 
seems that most people that are selling CD's are duping the public 
by putting numerous files of addresses in the CD over and over. This 
created many duplicate addresses. They also had many program
 "generated" email addresses like Compuserve, MCI, ANON's, etc. 
This causes a tremendous amount of undeliverables, and for  those 
that use Stealth programs, clogs up servers quickly with trash, etc. 

We then ran a program that contained 150+ keywords to remove 
addresses with vulgarity,  profanity, sex-related names, postmaster,
 webmaster, flamer, abuse, spam, etc., etc.   Also eliminated all .edu, 
.mil, .org, .gov, etc.   After that list was run against the remaining list, 
it  reduced it down to near 16 million addresses! 

So, you see, our list will save people hundreds of dollars buying all 
others that are out there on  CD and otherwise. Using ours will be like
 using the 100+ million that we started with, but a lot  less money and 
alot less time!!  

We also purchased Cyber-Promos ($995.00) CD.   We received it just 
prior to finishing production work on the new CD.   We had our people 
take a random sample of 300,000 addresses  from the touted 2.9 that 
they advertised.   We used a program that allows us to take a random 
sample of addresses from any list.   We were able to have the program 
take every 9th address, thus giving us a 300,000 list of Cyber's email 
addresses from top to bottom.  We did not clean  these, but we did create
3 seperate files named cyber1.txt, cyber2.txt, & cyber3.txt of 100,000 
addresses each. This will give all people that use the list a opportunity to
send mail to the list before deciding if their CD is all it's hyped to be. 

We also included a 2+ million "Remove/Flamer" file broke into seperate
files for ease of  extracting and adding to your own database of removes.

_____________________________

What others are saying:

"I received the CD on Friday evening.   Like a kid with a new toy, I 
immediately started bulking out using the new email addresses.  Over 
the course of the weekend, I emailed out over 500,000 emails and I 
received less than TWENTY undeliverables!!  I am totally satisfied
with my purchase!!  Thanks Premier!!"

- From   PHYSICS NEWS UPDATE                         
The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Physics News
Number 367 April 15, 1998   by Phillip F. Schewe and Ben Stein
  
A SEARCH ENGINE THAT EMPLOYS QUANTUM WEIRDNESS 
has been experimentally demonstrated, allowing researchers 
to successfully find one of four possible pieces of data
in a single computational step, rather than the 2.25 steps it takes
traditional computers on average.  Executing a quantum search
algorithm proposed by Bell Labs physicist Lov Grover (Physical
Review Letters, 14 July 1997; Physics Today, October 1997), 
an IBM-MIT-Berkeley team (Isaac Chuang, IBM-Almaden, 408-927-8245) 
employed an "NMR" quantum computer (Update 310), a device 
in which the binary digits 0 and 1 are represented by
an atomic nucleus respectively aligned with and opposed to an
external magnetic field.  Starting with a solution of liquid
chloroform molecules, and using radio pulses to manipulate the
inner magnets of the carbon and hydrogen nucleus in each
molecule, the researchers first put each carbon and hydrogen
nucleus into a combination or "superposition" of 0 and 1 states, 
for a total of four possibilities in each molecule.  Because quantum
systems can be in many states at the same time, each molecule
would then respond for all 4 possible states at once. Then they fired
one of four possible sequences of radio pulses. By measuring the
response of the collection of molecules, the researchers were then
able to deduce the pulse sequence in a single step. Equivalent to
finding one of 4 items in a database, this is the first experimental
demonstration of a quantum computation requiring fewer steps than on a 
classical computer. (Chuang et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 13 April 1998.)

Not if his means is irrational. But I suppose if Rifkin were a clever
transhumanist (now there's a turn of phrase one doesn't get to see too
often), he might rationally design such a strategy.

Neologism anyone?

SAPPER MEME: An offensive (as opposed to benign or defensive) meme,
intelligently-designed to infect a host, reduce the host's memetic
immunity, and prepare the host for infection.    

Is there already a term for this?

Again, the test is rationality. My basic point is that a philosophy of
life is more than merely a hobby. At this point, transhumanism doesn't
have a ton of tools to work with to achieve the acceleration of
development. That doesn't mean one shouldn't do anything. I don't think
anyone diasgrees with this, I just wonder if it would be an appropriate
thing to include in the definition. And I think it can be included by
just getting rid of 'seeks.'

I've seen a serious proposal for a system which could bring down an 
entire 747 by parachute in a serious inflight emergency (or individual 
pieces if the plane should partially break up in flight). The problem is 
again cost and mass; AFAIR it requires fourteen large parachutes fitted 
to various parts of the plane.

This is just a rewording, essentially, but after looking at the definitions
of other "isms" in my Random House Dictionary, I would prefer to see a
definition something like the following:

"Transhumanism - a philosophical movement that stresses the utilization of
science and technology to accelerate the physical and mental development of
the human species beyond its current limits.
- trans-hum'-an-ist, adj. n.  - transhumanistic, adj.
- transhumansitically, adv."

When I think of others reading this and the impression they need to get, it
just seems more succintly revealing of the basic philosophy involved. Am I
wrong people? Feedback invited.

I respectfully disagree.  Especially when you consider a population, the
probability of an unnatural death does NOT increase.  If the population
decided to take more airplane rides than normal per year per person, then
the frequency of accidents would increase as a function of the number of
flights.  If, on the other hand, the overall level of risk-aversive behavior
reamins the same, the frequency of accidents will not increase as a function
of time.  Look, the simple way of saying this is that if you live twice as
long, you'll have twice as many accidents.  That's not the same thing as
saying the accident "frequency" increases. If something happens once/year
and you're around one year, then odds are you will see it happen once. If
you're around two years you'll see it happen twice. The frequency hasn't
changed. Is that clearer?

Doesn't most airplane accidents occur during start and landing (not to
mention while on the ground)? In that case, parachutes would not be
very useful during the accidents.

I seem to recall some time ago that one of the combat aircraft (?) was fitted

built in parachutes...what would be the problem in having such a concept for
commercial passenger aircraft?  That is: in the event of a "crash and burn"
emergency the pilot could eject the passenger compartment.  It then descending
on it's own automatically deployed chutes.  Since said compartment would be
much lighter than the entire airframe  it would possible require less chutes.

Of course...the redesign of the airframe might negate any saving.

And the pilots might complain...but presumably they might be trained in the
use of individual parachutes...or have a seperate system for the pilot
compartment.

Just speculation.

I'm only going to comment on this point. Erik: Recently, the wages of
workers has been rising. However, over the last couple of decades, if you
exclude other forms of income and wealth, the inflation-adjusted incomes of
workers with few skills has indeed been stagnant. Is that the fault of the
market? I would say no. Why?

Today's economy increasingly rewards those with skills, especially
"symbolic" skills such as computer programming, language skills, legal
expertise, etc. While, in the USA, less skilled workers have made no
progress over a couple of decades, at least they are employed. In European
countries, the very same factors are at work, but the result is high and
persistent unemployment.

In our case, I would argue that the fault is not the market. Partly it may
be an inevitable result of differences among humans and their abilities and
culturally-influenced preferences (such that some refuse to learn the
necessary skills). But much of it I would say results from a poor
educational system that is weak at motivating students, lacks innovation,
and fails to instill important skills. (I *know* this goes on because I
teach students entering college who almost all lack logical skills, basic
math, and any semblance of scientific education.) Schools in this country
are almost entirely run by the state. The state, not the market. Introduce
market discipline and I predict that things would improve dramatically.
Maybe we'll see: One state has recently begun to use the voucher system,
which is an important step towards a market system.

So, once again, the market is blamed for the deficiences of statism.

Onward!

  IAN: That's correct. Mid-flight accidents are very 
  rare. Your greatest chance of dying in-flight is by 
  far during take off and highest during the landing.

  Mid-flight accidents are usually collisions or bombs,
  in which case the fatal catastrophe is so fast one 
  would probably not have time to put on a parachute.
  Engines can go out mid-flight, but the pilots can 
  still manage to land, but once again, it's the 
  landing that will probably kill you.

  Maybe in a case like that people should have 
  the option of bailing out with a parachute
  prior to the high-risk landing.

How about a grown-up version of the ballistic parachute gaining in
popularity in the small plane market? Three or four fairly large 'chutes
would add little weight to the plane, and could bring it down fairly
gently...these could also include drogues to decelerate the craft to a safe
speed for deployment..

Again, not a panacea, but it could save some lives in some circumstances.

Statistics was not my strong point in school. I see the difference between
'frequency' and 'quantity' now..frequency is 'how often', and has no bearing
on 'how many'..

Thanks for the pointer.

Statism is a deficiency of the market.

Why not pyrotechnic charges to sever the wings and empennage, and drop the
entire cabin, pilot and all, as a recovery capsule? Where is it written that
the captain must go down with the ship? 

Or is this a case where the pilot would be expected to guide the remains to
a crash away from an occupied area?

True. Perhaps we need to launch the whole works high enough for the 'chutes
to become effective.

Or, we could stay away from aircraft and airports in our second and
subsequent decades. Could be there will be a workable 'transporter' system
in plce by then..

What is the consensus of underground orbital transports running in evacuated
tunnels? This would completely eliminate the takeoff and landing hazards as
we know them..an be an order of magnitude faster than aircraft, not to
mention cleaner and quieter!

hi how would this work?  Underground orbital, does that mean its in orbit, but
underground?  it seems it would work better above ground, in big tubes,
perhaps using a vacuum pressure system to suck and push the vehicles
(extremely light-weight vehicles, the bulk of weight coming from the cargo).

Ive read that many airplane accidents (mostly electrical malfunctions,
sometimes causing accidents) are linked to wave bursts from the sun (I cant
remember what they're called).

I'm not sure this is so. The reason the state has historically taken
responsibilty
for the education of the vast majority of its population is because
Governemnts
recognised that a growing Capitalist economy had to be able to access a
much
larger pool of educated and skilled labour than the previously ruling and
upper 
middle class education systems were able or willing to provide beyond a few

scholarships. Market oriented Education systems seem to quickly degenerate
into
elitist education for the wealthy and no education at all for the poorest,
Brazil for
example.

 The voucher system that the  new Labour government have introduced
in Britain is actually a step away from the market system. The market was
only
providing Nursery places for wealthier parents, wheras parents of 4 year
olds who 
were trying to hold down jobs with meagre incomes had to rely on cheap day
care
and unlicensed child minders, these have now been given Vouchers worth
about 
1500 pounds that can only be used to pay for a nursery school place. The
government
hope that Nurseries will be created by the market to soak up this financial
glut. I
don't think handing people cheques and ordering them to spend the money on
something
that doesn't even  exist yet has anything to do with free market economics.

If a child is not receiving an education, we are all to blame.

Quantum Electronics is an exciting field with tremendous promise, but what

this article really shows is the quantum electronics is still in its early

lab phase. It's not really useful even for scientific instrumentation,
and is certiainly not yet reduced to engineering practice. a lot of
research and development is needed before we will get the first
practical quantum computer, even using lithograghic techniques.

This is the reason that I feel that nanomechanical computers will
be built before nanoelectronic computers. At the nano scale,
quantum effects will dominate dlassical effects, so to build
a nanoelectronic computer, we'll have to learn both the
engineerong dicipline of molecular nanotechnology and the
science and engineering of quantum electronic computing.
at this point, it is not clear what the minimum size of a
quantum electronic is, or what the minimum spacing of
the connections will be.

By contrast, rod logic is better understood. The minimum
device sizes are on the order of 5 cubic nm.

But is that such a bad thing? Having a benevolent tyrant to rule the moronic masses
would likely be far less problematic than letting the slobs rule themselves...since
most of those masses don't want the responsibility anyways...

An Absolute Foundation? Of what kind? And based on what Doctrine of the sourch of
such Rights, Natural Law or the Force Doctrine??

Y'know, most trust fund babies that I have met have been the most spendthrift, lazy,
unmotivated, unsuccessfull slobs I have ever known. I really don't fear such morons,
and it helps that they have so much money to blow, as its then much easier for active
anarcho capitalists like myself to score a big profit on a few deals.

Yet, I am not aware of any children here in the US or other highly
capitalist/mercantilist economies that die from malnutrition, other than those who
are suffering from such psychological ailments as anorexia. Ethiopia, OTOH, that
socialist paradise, has lost more people to malnutrition in 15 years than are
currently alive there today.

Yet Agorism takes its name from the ancient term for 'the market'. Do agorists
emphasize the minor social aspects of a community bazaar, while blithely ignoring the
over-riding economic aspects?

Any system will wind up with the end that its members deserve. If the members of an
anarcho-capitalist society refuse to take personal responsibility for themselves,
then they will wind up in the sort of tyrrany that you automatically assume any such
society to be. Anarcho Capitalism is not, as a whole, beneficial for the stupid, the
weak, or the faint of heart. This is a given. However, it is wrong for you to
automatically assume that the members of such a society will all become completely
subsumed by the most selfish, self-aggrandising personal drives, and will completely
ignore such habits as personal charity, generosity, etc. It should be noted that the
US, which most will agree is the 'most' capitalist economy in the world, leads the
world in personal per capita giving, in both time and money, both in absolute terms
and as a percentage of income and assets.

Why is it that people living in socialist countries are individually selfish,
materialistic, and ungenerous as compared to Americans???

Highly recommended for any liver-related problems, and for
healthy people who are planning to do some heavy drinking,
eat greasy food etc. The active ingredient is a plant extract 
("Mariendistelfruchte", that's German, I don't have the English 
name right now), and it's extremely safe to use. Great to 
stimulate your appetite too. This is not some gimmick, but
a medicine that's been successfully used for several decades 
to treat people with cirrhosis, acute poisoning and other 
damage to the liver. It has a strong regenerating and protective
effect. 

I got mine from Madaus AG,
51101 Koln
Germany

There's probably some info on the net about it (LEF?), but my 
browswer is down right now so I can't look. In any case, highly
recommended (and with almost immediate results).

I recently discovered that several cryonicists have frozen or plan to freeze
their pets.  It reminded me of an old sci-fi tale (Heinlein, perhaps) about
a future in which pets had evolved in sync with humans and were able to
communicate, reason abstractly, use metacognition, etc...in short, they
evolved into what we are today while their masters had advanced that much
further.  Has this been discussed on this newsgroup?  Do extropians promote
or accept the idea of accelerating the development of non-human species and
if so...under what circumstances?

This is a confusion of terms. Quantum electronics is not the same as 
quantum computing. Quantum electronics is simply electronics at a scale 
where quantum effects become important. It is not necessary to create a 
superposition of computational basis states in order to have a 
functioning quantum electronic device. Such superpositions are, however, 
essential to the functioning of a quantum computer (and they were 
certainly created in this implementation of Grover's algorithm), and they 
are what makes quantum computing a lot more difficult to achieve than 
quantum electronics.

That most happen during takeoffs in bad weather, and during approaches
(which indicates nothing, as a plane with a major failure that can try to
make it back to an airfield is said to crash on landing, even though the
root cause may have happened a while back) is true, in which case, some
sore of personal attenuation device, like a full body airbag, would
probably work much better. Of course, you'd need ejection seats for
everyone to get them away from the plane quickly...

Increasing air travel safety is best focused on a few areas:

a) aircraft system reliability (already VERY HIGH, and not likely to
improved much on.)
b) education, training, and experience of pilots (something which is sorely
lacking in many foreign pilots, whose major cause of crashes involves poor
English skills, which is the internation language of air traffic control).
With cheap computer simulations, the requirements for simulator time for
commercial pilots should be much higher than it is.
c) reducing the flammability of aircraft interior materials
d) reducing the vaporization of fuel in the event of a crash
e) increasing the amount of, the maintenance of, and the accuracy of
takeoff and landing navigation systems
f) building into passenger seats some sort of automatically deploying
environment suit, possibly with attenuation capability, which will protect
the passenger against smoke, ignition of vaporized fuel, and minor high
speed airborn objects.

Yes, above ground would be far less expensive, however, you are likely to endure
never ending environmental impact headaches with the people whose property you
buil don and beside.

People are getting very proprietary about even the VIEW that they have from their
property. In Vermont, for example, the just passed a law giving the local
communities the right to approve the construction of communications towers on
mountain tops (mostly for cellular phone use), something which the FCC is rather
ambivalent about, as they really love the power they have been given by congress
to have absolute power over permitting these towers.

playerThe Secret Is Out!
See Why Winners Choose One Cryo,  It's All About Performance


Dear Softball Enthusiast:

Cryogenics has rapidly become the hottest buzz word in the softball industry. Manufacturers like 
Worth, Bombat and Catapult now feature a complete cryo line of bats. If your bat has not yet been 
treated, act now and seize this opportunity to take advantage of our special 3 for the price of 2 
offer, and find out for yourself why the entire industry is talking about cryo.

And as you know, there is no better time than NOW, to increase your batting average. That's why 
we have put together this special offer...

Send us two of your bats at our regular price and include a third bat at no additional charge. Same 
great process, same great service as we have always provided, we're just giving you a freebee and 
all we ask in return is that you help us spread the word to your friends and teammates about the 
benefits of cryogenics. 

Don't listen to us. Here's what Alcoa, the world's leading manufacturer of Aluminum had to say about 
cryogenics...

"In the rapid water quench following heat treat, bat temperature is reduced from about 900 degrees 
F to room temperature in a matter of seconds. Because the outside of the bat cools faster than the 
inside, there is a residual inward stress on the bat... tests show that this stress is actually reversed in 
the cryogenic process to an outward stress. Since stress is a force, an outward stress can serve to 
enhance the force of impact on the ball. This can be viewed as increasing the trampoline effect of 
the bat". Customers report, Cryogenics increased distance of their bats 10 to 40 feet.

One Cryo is the official cryogenic bat supplier for USSSA Senior Softball. Our process is endorsed by 
USSSA Hall of Famer Steve Leighton and USSSA Half Century Director Coach Roach. 

Articles about Deep Cryogenic Tempering have been published in numerous publications such as 
Winston Cup Scene - December 1997, Brevard Softball Magazine - August 1997, Motorcycle 
Magazine - October 1996, National Speed Sport News - September 25th 1996, Cruisin' Style - 
September 1996, Metlfax - August 1996, Orlando Sentinel, Sports - September 5th 1996, Orlando 
Sentinel, Business -July 15th 1996, American Machinist - May 1996, USA Today - February 5th

Application News - January 1994, Precision Shooting - January & December 1994, Short Track 
Racing - October 1994, Gear Technology - March/April 1993, Cutting Tool Engineering - August 
1992, Industrial Heating - August 1992, just to name a few. Deep Cryogenic Tempering has also 
been featured on the Discovery Channel's "NextStep" program by Paul and Phil "the answer guys", 
episode 83 Fall 1995, as well as on TNN's "Inside NASCAR"  December 1997, hosted by Ned 
Jarret.

Still Skeptical  -  Not Convinced Yet?   -  Here's some additional background...

PERFORMANCE THROUGH ENHANCED TECHNOLOGY
CRYOGENICS: A Stress REDUCTION Process

CRYOGENICS IS A BRANCH OF PHYSICS THAT DEALS WITH THE PRODUCTION AND 
EFFECTS OF ULTRA LOW TEMPERATURES:   Researchers began studying and quantifying the 
benefits of Cryogenics on tool steels back in the late 1960's in University research labs. Since then 
Cryogenics has been used in the medical industry for preserving tissues, in aerospace for stress 
relieving alloys sent into space and manufacturers have used it to increase the performance and 
wear life of race car parts. Over the last couple of years Cryogenics has found its way back to the 
universities and in research labs such as ALCOA's. 

THE CRYOGENIC PROCESS:   The Cryogenic process consists of super cooling the bat to -300 
degrees F at a very slow rate and then maintaining this ultra low temperature for up to 36 hours. 
After which the bats are returned back to room temperature at less than one degree per minute.

THE EFFECTS OF CRYOGENICS:   In recent testing performed by an ALCOA metallurgist and a 
new product development manager, it was found that the cryogenically treated bats displayed a 
reduction in residual stress. This is consistent with the results discovered during the 1950's when the 
process was often referred to as "uphill quenching". In a separate research project conducted at a 
major university, it was verified that the Cryogenic process changes the state of residual stress in the 
bat. This is important because the effects of residual stress can increase the effects of external 
force applied to the material (in this case, impact of the ball on the bat).

HOW CRYOGENIC TREATMENT CAN INCREASE TRAMPOLINE EFFECT:  The reduction in 
residual stress along with the realignment of the molecules uniformity brought about by the cryogenic 
treatment, can result in an enhancement of the trampoline effect, which occurs in the bat's "sweet 
spot" during the time of momentary impact and kinetic energy transfer with the ball.

WHAT CAN CRYOGENICS DO FOR MY BAT?   Because the reduction in residual stress can 
influence the force of impact between the ball and the bat, as well as increasing the effective 
strength, the following benefits to bat performance have been observed:

1.   	An Increase of 2 to 4% in hit distance, as much as 20 to 40 feet
2.    Enhanced "feel" resulting from reduction of internal vibrations
3.    Improved durability to resist denting
4.   	Enhanced Trampoline effect
5.	Enhances "sweet spot"
6.	Cryo Bats are legal in all leagues of play

This was used on the F-111 and the F/B-111, as well as the EF-111, obviously. The
maintenance of the capsule was equal to around 1/4 to 1/3 that of the rest of the
airplane, increased its weight (and therefore decreased its range and performance,
and increased its cost) The capsule pressurized at a level equal to 8500 feet, and
could be entirely ejected rapidly with a built in rocket motor, even while on the
ground. It had a set of parachutes equal in size to those used on the Apollo space
capsule, as well as a rapidly deployed attenuation bag that inflated just prior to
touchdown. In the event of an ejection in flight at low altitudes, such as those
experienced by commercial airliners during takeoffs and landing approaches, the
capsule hits the ground rather hard with horizontal velocity retained, frequently
causing serious back injury to the occupants.

This concept is not used in any civil aircraft of any type for the simple reason
that its too damn expensive to own and maintain.

There are currently parachute retreival systems available for aircraft of up to
2-6 seater private types, like a Cessna 182 or a Piper. They deploy the chute with
a small rocket, and give a rather staid ride down for the entier aircraft.

Using such systems obviously is a matter of mass and economics. Considering that
air travel is safer than sitting on your own toilet, its rather obvious why there
are no commercial airliners that have large parachutes and attenuation bags to
retreive an entire plane. The long term costs of maintaining and lugging around
all of that unproductive mass far exceed what customers are apparently willing to
pay for the marginal increased safety.

I am posting this response because the author of the previous posting
has so blatantly mnisrepresented my views that I feel compelled to
respond.  I think, in all honesty, he has misrepresented my
eschatological views worse than anyone I have read, which has to be some
sort of record.  [Eschatology refers to the doctrine of the last
things.]

As I wrote before, Gary North is a religious fundamentalist who
is well known among Christian millennialists (believers in the
near-term apocalyptic events foretold in the Book of Revelations).
He has written dozens of books on religious topics, focusing on
issues related to the coming apocalypse, long before he heard
of Y2K.  Here is an excerpt from a review of one of his books, at:

NORTH:  On the contrary, I am an anti-premillennialist
(anti-apocalypticist), and I have spent about a million dollars to
publish books against apocalypticism.  For this reason I am distrusted
by the fundamentalist leadership.  I am what is known as a
postmillennialist, a position that is anti-apocalyptic to the core.  

For this reason, my stand on Y2K is not understood by my many
fundamentalist critics.  They regard my views Y2K as too apocalyptic. 
My views sound far more like what they believe.  

By the way, the biblical book is called (by Protestants) Revelation, not
Revelations.  Anyone who refers to "The Book of Revelations" exposes
himself as someone who has never read that document.  

My critic does not understand the nature of the intense rivalry of the
three major eschatological schools of opinion.  The following extract
reveals my view, clearly stated: anti-premilleninial, anti-amillennial,
and therefore anti-apocalyptic.  Read it for yourself.  My critic read
it but did not understand it.

http://metanet.net/freebooks/docs/2142_47e.htm

: Here is the main question: Will Jesus' Great Commission be fulfilled
in
: history? Will nations be discipled by the Church? Will God bring
judgment
: against His enemies in history? Most important, do we have enough time
: for the healing power of the gospel to do its work?  Two millennial
views
: say no, there isn't enough time: premillennialism and amillennialism
: ("pessimillennialism"). A third view says yes, there is enough time:
: post-millennialism. The revival of interest in this third view has
: taken both rival camps by surprise. By tying a vision of victory in
: history to the doctrine that the Bible offers specific answers to
social
: problems, a new movement has begun to capture the minds of a
generation
: of Christian activists. The movement is called Christian
Reconstruction.
: In Millennialism and Social Theory, Dr. Gary North, co-founder of this
: movement, examines why both pre-millennialism and amillennialism have
: never developed independent social theories, and why the spokesmen of
: both positions appeal to the prevailing ethics of contemporary
humanism
: as the only possible way to run society.

I believe North sees Y2K in religious terms, as an element of the "end
times" which have long been foretold.  His Y2K site is largely secular,
until you read the bulletin boards where some of his long time followers
retain their religious views.

NORTH: On the contrtary, I think the "end times" began in the first
century -- an anti-premillennial, anti-apocalyptic viewpoint.  Y2K has
nothing to do with the so-called end times promoted by fundamentalists,
because those end times are a misrepresentation of what the New
Testament teaches.  For saying this for over 30 years, I have gained
considerable opposition from fundamentalists.  As the previous extract
said, I am opposed to end-times madness (the book title by one of my
co-authors, Gary DeMar).

The point is, North is filtering the data he presents through his
religious ideas.  It is a biased presentation designed to lead to the
desired apocalyptic conclusion.

NORTH: Again, I will say it: I am an anti-apocalypticist.  No one who
has read my eschatological views, and the views of those whom I have
published, could say such a thing.  My critic has not read my books or
the books of those whom I have published.  So, he should refrain from
commenting on my eschatological views.  

Given the remarkable confusion in his critique ("The Book of
Revelations"), I doubt very seriously that the author has ever read a
book on eschatology.  He should stick with his own specialty.

Please deal with my Web site for what it is: a warning on Y2K, not a
warning about the end of the world.

By being daring athletic mental champions of optimism!  Suffering in itself
comes off as shallow when standing next to it is candor and valor.  

We must ask for what we want and do it with clear vision and commitment.

The biggest problem with doing exactly that is political: how is it 
going to look that the airlines buy that sort of protection for the 
crew, but not the passengers?

Please note that the combat aircraft had an ejection mechanism for 
the CREW compartment.  Not the CARGO compartment.

And, for that matter, the combat aircraft did not have flight 
attendants among its crew.

And here you have changed the protection from the CREW compartment to 
the CARGO compartment.

Hm... it would lose the wings, wing anchor structure, cockpit, tail 
assembly, and part of the undercarriage.  Maybe as much as 2/3 of the 
unloaded weight of the aircraft.  It would also have no fuel tanks... 
but it WOULD have PASSENGERS.  And it WOULD still have to be 
PRESSURIZED.

But there is a more fundamental problem.

Typical loss-of-airframe emergency situation involving a military 
aircraft in wartime: the plane took damage from enemy fire while at 
altitude.  The highly-trained crew is thoroughly strapped in, 
five-point harnesses minimum, to seats that are firmly attached to 
the ejection assembly and don't adjust.  Depending on the severity of 
the situation, they can eject immediately or delay (somewhat) to a 
more convenient location.  If they have to eject immediately, a small 
pod wrapped around the seat -- if that much -- ejects with them; the 
seat is equipped with oxygen gear equivalent to pressurization, which 
the crew is already wearing.  And since they are already at altitude, 
there is plenty of room for parachutes to deploy, not only cushioning 
the fall but also disposing of any forward speed.

Typical loss-of-airframe emergency situation involving a commercial 
airliner: the plane rams into the ground.  That's how much warning 
there is.  The untrained passengers are in seats which adjust and are 
in uncertain positions; the majority of them, but probably not all, 
are wearing two-point safety harnesses (seat belts).  Oxygen masks 
are available but the passengers have near-zero training and 
absolute-zero experience in their use, and they are not attached to 
the passengers.  If the passenger compartment must be ejected, it is 
*huge* compared to the passengers it contains, and will take a very 
high g-force acceleration to throw it clear of the impact.  Then it 
isn't really high enough for chutes to deploy and slow its forward 
speed, so its own impact is nearly as bad as the impact of the 
airframe.

In the United States, in the first case where compulsory-education 
laws were imposed (Boston, just before the Civil War), they caused 
riots.  Parents objected because the approved schools were so much 
worse than the schools they were already sending their kids to.

In fact, Boston (just before the Civil War) was achieving a higher 
degree of literacy among black 14-year-olds *without* 
compulsory-education laws than it now achieves among all 
18-year-olds *with* compulsory-education laws.

Yes, Boston at that time *did* have some schools that received tax 
funding.  They enrolled about 1/3 of all white students and 1/4 of 
all black students.

In the US generally, the imposition of compulsory-education laws and 
the creation of a general system of tax-funded schools appears to 
have increased total school enrollment by about 1%.  The evidence 
suggests that of this 1%, about half were kids who had been running 
the till in their family's business, but were sent to school to learn 
to add (yes, I'm serious -- I personally ran a second-hand shop for 
on my own for as much as an hour at a time while my parents attended 
to other aspects of the business, prior to entering first grade, so 
I know it does happen); or could no longer go on international 
journeys with their parents, because they had to go to school and 
study geography.  The other half were taken away from jobs that their 
family relied on to assist in providing a decent standard of living.

One cannot expect a mass good such as education to truly achieve a 
mass market, when the government's general economic policy is so 
extremely mercantilist (anti-free-market thinly disguised as 
capitalist) that the masses can barely afford food.

Taxes have skyrocketed.

The majority of inflation is in those industries most affected by 
government intervention, e.g. medicine and post-high-school 
education.  Since these industries are generally seen as not being a 
major part of day-to-day life, people willingly accept wage increases 
that match inflation in the *rest* of the economy.

The demand for "workers with few skills" is declining.

That's to be expected.  If the demand for unskilled workers is 
declining relative to the supply, the natural wages of unskilled 
workers will (not may, not might, not could possibly -- WILL) fall.  
There are three ways this can be expressed: (1)  spreading 
a reduced total wage over a similar number of workers, giving each 
one lower wages; (2) keep the wage of each employed worker up, but 
lay off a bunch of workers; (3) use armed force to transfer some 
wealth to the pool available for unskilled workers, keeping their 
wages and numbers up simultaneously -- by decreasing the wages, or 
the number, of better-paid workers.

Minimum-wage laws, of course, prohibit option (1) from going beyond a 
certain point.

That too.  Increasing the supply of unskilled workers at the same 
time that the demand for them is decreasing, doesn't seem the most 
sensible action.

Not to worry, though -- friends and acquaintances who hire unskilled 
workers, report that a high percentage of recent high-school 
graduates don't even deserve to be called "workers".  They are so 
unprepared for the reality of the workplace that they will need a 
substantial amount of remedial education before they are prepared to 
matriculate at Hamburger University.

(Start with the day a manager at a local burger joint had two 
interviews scheduled, both for 9 AM, and a new employee supposed to 
start at the same time. Was she overbooking her time?  Not to worry.  
Of the three, only one showed up.  One of the people to be 
interviewed.  Fifteen minutes late.  The manager, from experience, 
EXPECTED only one person to show up.)

Btw, you might be interested in what Sanford W. recently said:

  http://cnn.com/TECH/computing/9804/16/spam_king.ap/

Have acts of physical violence against spammers and their businesses
ever been reported? As emails are no evidence in court, and legal
action can be delayed virtually indefinitely, termination of spammers
in physical space (Achille's heel at least of the nonvirtual
merchandize) should be a natural autoregulation mechanism. It a)
provides low-latency effective deterrence b) remove individuals 
from the (small) foolhardy-spammer pool (albeit by small increments). 

Of course relying on naturally occuring Holy Avenger fruitcakes
is somewhat difficult the lack of their abundance considered, so can 
there be an effective mechanism to funnel resources of irate targets 
into spammer termination? Future crypto infrastructure may provide an 
anonymous digicash user-to-avenger nexus, allowing interactive resource
allocation to known spammers (authenticadedly indentified, to protect 
against turning lilly-white users for spammers). This provides a
nice positive autofeedback loop between number of spam hits and the 
head money allocated to termination of the offender -- to the effect
that the most pressing problems get removed first.

Wouldn't we all sometimes gladly pay $5 just for a short snuff video snippet?

ha-ha only serious,

P.S. Of course above scheme is also applicable to other unpopular
     public figures, which will probably mean it to be difficult to 
     implement.

I seem to recall some old discussions about >pets and uplifting, but
not much about their contents (I'm definitely going to write myself a
remembrance agent for list archives one day!). There is also an essay
by John de Rivaz about the future of companion animals at
http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Cultural/Society/companion.txt

Why do we have pets? I think it is because we want companionship, but
not necessarily with the demands of other humans and quite often
because we enjoy companionship with a *different* kind of being. 

So I wouldn't be surprised if we in the future keep semi- or fully
intelligent pets. They might have rights on their own; we already give
animal rights, and one could imagine a canine union acting as the
lobby for intelligent dogs (demands for fair treatment, the right to
have an owner or similar stuff). A cat union will of course never
happen :-). These pets do not need to be just animals or improved
animals, they might be AIs or biotechnological constructs. In some
sense a family already includes not just the humans, but the pets and
plants. In the future the relationship may become more like a kind of
group marriage/cohabitation contract where different beings agree on
forming a social unit of some kind.

Overall, I think uplifting of other species is a good idea, but the
ethics is quite complicated.

No, cryonics isn't that successful yet. But Mike Darwin et al have
held a dog at near freezing temperatures for 15 minutes with no
damage, which might be the source of the rumor.

I had heard that from my elementary teacher in the 80s, about the two week
thing.

We watched a film about it, they showed the dog playing, but I dont remember
that much, it was 2 weeks though supposedly, maybe it wasnt.

People have been dead for longer than 15 min, I think like 30 min or an hour
while frozen, like from drowning in ice water, before being revived.

Solar flares? These can disrupt radio communications, but is there enough
energy to actually addle the avionics?

One thing that troubles me is how blasted sensitive they are to outside
interference. There is no reason that there should be a restriction on the
use of computers, etc. on board aircraft unless the avionics are just so
badly designed and shielded that they can't reject out of band interference..

Not quite.  21st Century Medicine has been recovering dogs from 15 
minutes of body temperature cardiac arrest.  They have recovered dogs 
from around 4 hours of cardiac arrest at just above the freezing 
point with all the blood washed out and replaced (and even longer 
with intermittant  mechanical perfusion).

For a vehicle in orbit, whether it's above or below ground, there is no
force on it that would require rails, etc. for guidance. In reality, some
sort of maglev would probably be used to ensure the car remained centered
inside the tube.

The smaller the radius, the faster the orbital velocity. This would not make
much difference between running the tunnels underground or above ground, but
underground the least objections would be raised over right-of-way. Advances
in tunnelling technology are making this more and more attractive.

The basic system would use a linear motor to accelerate a sealed capsule in
an evacuated tube. Once orbital speed is reached, no further power is
required. At the far terminal, the energy in the capsule would be recovered
in another linear motor.

There have been airpressure systems proposed, but I believe they all suffer
from massive frictional losses when the velocity rises to a point where it
would be competitive with existing transport..

One thing that is problematical is how to transverse fault lines such as in
California. Large caverns with articulated guide tubes have been mentioned.
I read about this a few years back, but i don't remember where.

That may have been Miles, a dog recovered from about 20 minutes at 
just *above* freezing temperature.  He generated a lot of 
publicity in the Eighties, even though many other labs had done as 
much or more.  Much of that publicity may be due to the misconception 
that he was frozen.

I'm not sure if I like creativity and rational in the same relational context.
Why does it have to be rational?

I feel as though there's an amendment there which isn't necessary. If you think
about it, you'd have to define rational dynamically to have it really work.
What is the definition of rational if you are a mid-transition posthuman? How
does our ability to rationalize change with our accelerated evolution in flux?

Perhaps creativity becomes completely rational.


Perhaps this is one downside of the posthuman.

I seem to recall that canine specimen's age played a great role in
successful recovery. Anyway, 21CM is doing incredible work -- and we
are likely to expect even more dramatic results if the research will
go to full time mode. Yay for 21CM!

Btw, the recent week has been pretty stormy again on CryoNet. Very
good points have been made by CP/MD, I'd only wish the entire debate 
could have occured in a more constructive atmosphere. (Complacency 
in face of grave deficiencies would have been worse, though).

The only downside of being trans/post human is perhaps that you have 
too many choices. A kid in a candy store.

You can strip yourself down to become a streamlined intelligence, to
better compete with ALife golems. You can become Omega. Or impersonate 
the devil pretty well. Or go back being a bland, boring vanilla human, 
either with remembrances of godhood, or a tabula rasa existance. Or be 
a Mouse from Mars. Or whatever. You can become super-rational. Or 
completely instinct-driven. It's all up to you.

Personally, I am very fond of diverse mythologies, particularly
Chinese, Finnish and Irish. I'd like to rectify the fact that these 
persons/beings never had a chance to exist. Call me a neoromantic, if

It seems it would be a lot safer and cheaper, and cooler(to look at) if it
were above ground.  Underground has problems with earthquakes and oceans and
whales in the oceans.  I was just thinking about a transportation device
similar a couple weeks ago, using big strong, cheap plastic tubes (clear tubes
would be really cool, especially if you're going fast (300+), with super-
lightweight crafts, and just use air to blow them.  It would require stations
every few miles (maybe 1 or 50) to add additional charges. But these could go
super fast if they were light weight.  The charges wouldnt require too much
energy im  sure if they were built right.

what is a maglev?  Like magnets? I had thought about that in middle school,
tubes with crafts suspended with magnets, then I heard they use it in Japan
kinna, for their trains, I guess the trains float on the rails.

Also, how long would it take fo a craft to get into orbit in a tube? could it
be bursted into orbit like within a few miles?

Here's the web page of perhaps the leading 
scientist and proponent, Dr. Mark Carlotto, 
of the possibility that the "Mars face" 
is a non-natural formation:

http://www.psrw.com/~markc/marshome.html 

Here is his analysis of the new MGS images:

http://www.psrw.com/~markc/MiscArticles/April5anal/index.html 

The image that all the papers that I saw ran, 
was a "contrast enhanced" image, which made the 
face appear falsely to be flat. Apparently the 
MGS satellite keeps missing the "pyramids,"
which are forms very near the "face" that 
seem to be symmetrical 5-sided pyramids, 
based upon the old Viking images. 

My first impression of the new images was, 
"Well so much for the "Mars face'," but the
symmetry of the outline of the "face" and the 
perfectly straight parallel lines of the "helmet,"
wow!... I WANT to believe it was made by life.

The formation coming off the "chin" and running
to the right seems to be a natural mountain. 
Obviously much of the face appears to be 
far more natural than the Viking image
would suggest. But what would a face
carved look like after X 1000 years?

Likely that if once-existing Martians did 
make it, they would have used a large natural 
form such as a mountain as the base. Maybe they
didn't get the chin finished before doom set in?

Maybe, maybe, and maybe not...???

This regulation is because the slightest perturbation in the aircrafts own
magnetic field can change the orientation of the magnetic compass, as well as the
RFI output of the electronics of a laptop or radio is contained within the
faraday cage of the aircraft body, which is focused in the nose section. A lot of
electronics and wiring is sheilded on aircraft nowadays, but this remains a hold
over to pre-satellite navigation days...

Sometimes I have to wonder about Ettinger's motivations, though. As I
understand it, in Michigan, where CI is located, there are strict laws
prohibiting anyone who is not a mortician from performing the kind of
work necessary for a cryopreservation. 

Of course, there are workarounds for this (become a mortician, do the
work out of state, as I'm sure much of it already is), but you have to
wonder, though.

Since CI has such a fat bankroll as compared to the other orgs, it
would sure be nice if they would really fund some real research.

 If your out to protect your liver from toxins, jog down to local
General Nutrition Center and pick yourself up some Milk Thistle.
The active ingredient is silymarin (sp?) which is also found in
artichokes. Mammals at a prophylactic dose of 400mg have been found
to be immune to Death Caps, the most poisonous mushroom in North
America.

That convinced me.....

Legalon contains silymarin, as a matter of fact. Apparently "Milk Thistle" 
is "Mariendistelfruchte". The exact composition of a capsule is:
"140 mg silymarin with at least 60 mg silibinin in 180 mg extr. fruct.
cardui mariae and certain supporting substances like mannitol, 
natriumcarboxymethyl, gelatine, titaniumoxide and ironoxide." 

Another great all natural medicine is Hepar-SL forte. It supports the
degestive system and especially the metabolizing of fat. It can be used
in combination with Legalon (or any other silymarin-based medicine)
to enhance the effect.

One capsule contains 320 mgs of artichoke leaf extract.

Similar artichoke-based healthproducts are undoubtedly also 
available at your local health center, but this is one of the top
brands.

The air powered transport would indeed work, but the losses in a pneumatic
system are awesome for tubes large enough to carry passengers and freight.
The air in front of the car is compressed, and the air behind is compressed,
and this causes heating. A pump big enough to pull an active vacuum in front
of the car would be a very impressive piece of machinery. 

There are physical limitations to flow in pipes without huge frictional
losses. I am not an aeronautical or fluids engineer, so I cannot give
precise limits, but i know they exist.

Heinlein described above ground ballistic transports running in air at
supersonic speeds, with accelerator coils on hilltops at intervals. A neat
idea, but I doubt anyone would let us build one..

A maglev - short for magnetic levitation - is using a strong magnetic field
and a superconductor to produce an opposing field (Meissner effect??). The
classroom demonstration is to use a strong rare earth magnet and a
superconducting disk in liquid nitrogen - the magnet will 'float' above the
disk. The only power input is keeping the superconductor cold.

There are other systems that use two electromagnets and fancy servo systems
to regulate the levitation, but these use lots more power, unless both
magnets are superconducting.

The only limitation is how many 'g's you want to limit acceleration to. It
should take no more than a couple of miles to get to 18,000 MPH or more at a
one 'g' boost.

Good point. I negelected the cavity effect of the fuselage. Still, I would
design this equipment to work in a test chamber with at least 10 times the
worst case expected RF fields applied. Just stands to reason - it's mission
critical stuff..

That must be why magnets are considered 'hazardous' on aircraft..

A rather simple question occured to me:

"Which technology will appear first: Nanotechnology, or Uploading?"

Whichever comes first would obviously have major implications for the
way we evolve into Posthuman form.

Opinions anyone?

Yes, I agree that parachutes are impractical in most scenarios. I just
find it hard to forget the fact that 150+ people had 1/2 hr. to  bail
out in the crash I saw on TV. I mean, the plane hit the ground at 200+
mph !! I like your idea of a foaming system.

Yes, this sounds good too, as did your other suggestions.

Extrapolating here, I think in the (distant ?) future, when we have
mature nanotech', it will be possible to design full body armour for
people that will protect them from otherwise fatal accidents. But maybe
by that time posthumans won't be inhabiting "flesh" bodies anyway! And
then there's uploading...

Thank you everybody else for your suggestions

Bad idea.  Given the velocities implied by an underground ballistic 
trajectory between distant cities, the alternative to "absolutely 
perfect curvature" is "extremely loud bang".

That is extremely *slow* compared to what is being discussed.

Consider that the fastest manned military aircraft cannot fly fast 
enough to stay directly under a low-orbit satellite, and the 
satellite is going much faster than such an aircraft would need to 
go; and something down at ground level must go considerably faster 
to be considered orbital.  Heck, the main reason for evacuating the 
tube is that at that speed, simply running into air would be a 
serious problem.

   I was referring primarily to rights WRT physical property.
  
  Self-ownership seems at first sight a promising basis for (some) 
property rights;  I quite like the idea!  Alas, it has its problems.

I don't know how 'self-ownership' can be made to work without some kind of 
methodological dualism (a 'self' to own the body).  I have no problem with 
methodological dualism -- I'm an interactionist dualist; but I notice 
quite a few people hereabouts who are monists -- they believe the self is 
identified with the atoms and molecules of the physical being.

Even if we go with dualism, it is far from clear how an infant acquires 
self-ownership from its parents -- who provided the initial and necessary 
material basis for the new person in the form of sperm and ovum.   Are we 
to say that the person is wholly owned by their biological parents unless 
or until some form of manumission takes place).

Then there's the problem of title to ingested resources as the person 
grows -- does this give another whose (claimed) resources are consumed a 
literal right to their 'pound of flesh'?

There is a real problem with ingesting living organisms (or  their  body 
parts) -- do they not also enjoy degrees of self-ownership?

   Sure!  Many different (and often incompatible) schemas of property 
   rights can be developed on a pragmatic basis, as a means to improved 
   living standards etc.  I have no problem with that.  But that's not 
   what I'm arguing against. 
   
   I'm providing counterarguments to the assertion that there are are 
   Absolute or a priori property rights which can be used as the 
   primary foundation for an entire human society.  No such Utopia has 
   ever been proposed in which anyone but a madman would want to live; and 
   there is certainly no working example of such a society for us to 
   cross-compare with other alternatives.
   
   What's the practical _structural_ difference between (say) Galt's Gulch 
   and Saudi Arabia?  One person asserts ownership of the territory and 
   their word is absolute law for the inhabitants _simply by reason of 
   that ownership_.

   I was remembering Acton's dictum about all power tending to corrupt; 
   and absolute power tending to corrupt absolutely.

   Also, I am mindful that many of the greatest (and lesser) atrocities 
   are carried out by people who believe themselves to be _doing good._  
   This is why Nazism is still incomprehensible to most people -- the 
   Nazis thought of themselves as heroes, doing wonderful (albeit 
   distasteful) things for the world.  Like the 'Republicans'...

   Category error: Individual freedom is _not_ an economic system.  I 
   would insistently remind you that 50% of America's small farmers went 
   broke during the Reagan years; a whole way of life of priceless value 
   for hosts of families snuffed out by 'agribusiness', buyer cartels and 
   banks.
   
   If you fondly imagine that the USA's economic system rewards hard work 
   (and the economists do tell us that the economic system is Wertfrei, 
   remember, and doesn't 'reward' _anything_), ask yourself why, in the 
   US, there is a near-perfect _inverse ratio_ between how arduous and 
   unpleasant the work is, and how much you get paid for doing it.

   There is much truth in the wry observation that 'most people are too 
   busy working to make any money.'   Or, over here, banker Jim Slater's 
   observation that: "There are thing-makers; and there money-makers.  The 
   thing-makers don't make any money, and the money-makers don't make any 
   thing."

Unless you're saying that anarcho-capitalism is a good guide to 
profit-making (a thesis contradicted by nearly every anarcho-capitalist 
I've ever met, almost none of whom have any money and most of whom have 
appalling judgement in financial matters)  I simply have no idea what you 
mean by that. And consistent Randians would advise talented people to make 
as _little_ as possible, so as to withold resources from the looter State.

In 1990 the infant mortality rate in Washington, D.C. was the highest in 
the nation.  And there is a near-perfect inverse correlation between 
family income and and infant mortality rates.  There is also the 
progressive degeneration of childrens' health due to poor nutrition 
leading to secondary illnesses and weakened immune systems.

      Notice that I'm not defending or advocating State Socialism...
      
      Still, it is within our power to save the lives of children in 
      Ethiopia; we simply choose _not to_, preferring luxury ice-cream,

    This is bullshit for any system.  It's blatant bullshit for 
    anarcho-capitalism, where half a dozen rich people of moderate 
    cleverness can control the entire society by owning key resources.
    
    Suppose the Saudis bought up the entire US road system and made

      I don't think the US is the most 'capitalist' country in the world. 
      It does have among the world's leading per capita incomes and a 
      large poulation.  @ $8 trillion economy; 265 m people; cf. European 
      Union with @ $8 trillion economy and 300 m people.  And in spite of 
      the attempts by the Coercive Authoritarians to destroy a free and 
      decent society in the US, their project has not completely succeeded 
      thus far.
      
      I do take note that they've made the US the only country in the 
      civilized, developed world which proposes that workless parents will 
      be deprived of the means to ensure their own and their childrens' 
      physical and social survival, starting in just a few years' time.

I would say nanotech.

BUT not in the advanced form consisting of tiny robots.

U/Ling may arrive but like so many technological advances, I'd predict
its arrival as a sudden fit of technological evolution, not as a
graduated science.

Has anyone heard of a new use of MRI technology which can be used to
modulate the visual cortex? Its a rumor that sounds like super fringe
science, but I'd like to hear if there's any truth to it.

Anyhow, regarding the original question. The question seemed to be
focused on the singularity, and since the first nano tech will probably
not satisfy this function, I'd say the first singularity-oriented
advance will most likely be U/Ling..


My opinion isn't based on science, just an over active imagination.

        To me, the question of animal cryonics is one of "can we?"...not
physically, but psychologically.  With humans, the concept of cryonic
reanimation is mostly physical --generally, if a human is expecting to be
cryonically preserved, his reanimation may be quite disorienting and even
frightening, but it is, nonetheless, expected.  The problem with freezing
pets (let's say, for the sake of argument, dogs) is that there is (thus
far) no foreseeable way of training them to expect reanimation.  Could a
dog, upon reanimation, understand where it is, when it is, why and how?  If
not, then the question of ethics is indeed a pertinent one...one that
extends into the realm of volition.  Can a dog choose to be cryonically
frozen?  Certainly not.
Dogs (and most other animals) don't have the volition needed to make such a
choice.  Does this mean that we can choose for them?  An interesting thought.

Let's rephrase this: 150+ people, two of whom had ever before seen a 
parachute in real life, had 1/2 hr to bail out of an aircraft that 
was moving far faster than airplanes are normally moving when 
parachutists jump out of them.

(Me, I don't see the point in jumping out of a perfectly good 
airplane.  I also don't want to get into a boat that the commander 
intends to sink.  So I'll never, in non-emergency situations, be a 
parachutist or a submariner.)

Yes, I confused the terms. However, my point remains valid. The article
was about quantum computing, and demonstrates that quantum computing
is still primitive. IMO quantum electronics is also still primitive,
which was the point of departure for the rest of my message, which
argued that nanoelectronics is harder than nanomechanics. Basically
quantum electronics is necessary for both nanoelectronics and
quantum computing, but is not sufficient for quantum computing.

 supersonic speeds, with accelerator coils on hilltops at intervals. A neat
 idea, but I doubt anyone would let us build one..
  >>

The tubes could have gills in them, like in front of the craft the gills are
open, so it wont create compressed air in front of it (or not as much), since
it will escape into the outside air, and as the craft passes over the gills
they become temporarily sealed to hold the seal-tight air bursts behind the
craft, then they would have to be opened again for the next craft after the
first craft passes the next charging station.
The gills would have to be like super thin and lightweight (but still able to
be sealed), so it wont create very much friction for the craft.  Where and
when to get out have to be worked out, like perhaps the tubes split, and they
are diverted in a station, so it wont hold up the crafts behind it as they
pass through.

It seems this kind of transportation would be best for things that can take
the g force (im not sure what it would be) to put them in orbit (like special

would be cool to just have things in underground orbit (like continuous
orbits), Im sure it would be useful somehow.  Would the tube have to be a
perfect ring and would it also have to be relevant to the spin of the planet?

But in a vacuum no one can hear you scream ;)

Actually, you can guide a lot with linear motors, without turning the
subterrestrial astronauts into gelee. But the scheme has several
flaws, in fact. Correction of flight trajectory and maintaining the
vacuum (hitting a wall of air at these velocities is a good method to
fashion abovementioned gelee, which then gets lyophilized in situ, as
the turbovacs kick in -- yummy) requires active tunnel segments. Which 
will need juice, and cost a bit. Of course with drextech you can do
anything, but simply sending information encoding the object 
(or farcast your telepresence avatar via fibre or LEO routed 
geodetic links) is way cheaper.

Besides, but for athmosphere exit and reentry, the travel difference
between subterrestrial and LEO travel should be not that much to
require the hideously high costs of a subtersat. Also, the view out of 
the window is prettier.
 
> [...]

On an unrelated tentacle, here is a monkey catapult idea. You probably
know that liquid CPR has arrived as an advanced ER technique. Well, if 
floating in a container of saline with lungs full of oxygenated
fluorocarbon you can as well put you into a Luna-located
PV/capacitor-driven linear motor a few km long, while keeping the g's
well below monkey homogenization threshold.

Take a superconducting coil, and make sure it won't quench due to
launch forces, and mount it upon a composite (you'd have to shield the 
human, though) containment with a (anaesthesized or VR-entertained) 
monkey pickled in saline/fluorocarbon, add a fuel cell and some 
controlling circuit and hurl the whole thing from the lunar linear
motor catapult. Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

Of course you must make sure an inverse thing catches you on the other 
end, orelse this is just an expensive means of having you making a
GIANT impact upon poor unsuspecting target, and you probably won't
like the saline that much (you can remove the lung flooding while 
in transit), though one can think about protective membranes, and 
additives to saline. One will want to minimize the mass, though, which 
limits the comfort, and flight duration. (Of course you can think
nanorecycling/pocket microecology and nuclear power if the PV array
unfolded in transit doesn't suffice in the outskirts of the Solar
system, etc, but then it is slowly turning ridiculous).

And of course it will be nothing like StarTrek, and this is why people 
will hate it.

We already chose to move to other places without consulting with our
dogs, and they seem to adapt even if they don't like the change. I
think humans might have more problems with reanimation than dogs in
fact - we understand how different everything really is, while the dog
thinks it is just a new and unusual place it has never been to before.

Neither is there a way to fully prepare them for an operation (with full
anaesthetics etc), yet any "good" pet owner won't hesitate to have
his pet treated in order to save its life. Cryonics doesn't differ fundamentally
from a (potentially) life-saving operation.

>Could a

If you let it "wake up" in a familiar environment it won't suffer future shock.
Pets have proven to be very adaptable, dogs for example usually
have no problem with living in a completely unnatural environment with
alien beings (in a house with humans). So you could gradually introduce
them to the future world, and soon they wouldn't even know any better.
Apart from that, by the time we have the means to revive frozen animals
and people, there will almost certainly be very advanced emotion control 
possibilities which would elliminate stress alltogether, if so desired.

Our superior abilities give us the privilege (and the responsibility) to decide 
the fate of lesser beings. If you assume that life is better than death (and 
transhumanism does, I belief) and that we will be able to shape the future, than 
saving your pet by freezing it is the morally correct thing to do, imo. Killing
someone/thing that wants to live is worse than saving someone/thing that
wants to die, because the former has no choices left while the latter can 
still take his life later, if he still wants to. Death is the end of freedom, so
to speak. Since we don't know what our pets "think" about this, it's better
to be on the safe side. Also one could argue that a deathwish never really
is a deathwish, but the desire to end suffering. Mental and/or physical
shortcomings that make one want to kill himself can presumably be
fully cured in the future, which is another argument to freeze without
consent.

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

Though you guys probably covered this topic about a year or more ago, I'd
like to reopen -- or open if you haven't -- it.  Why?  Well, I had a little idea
which might prove helpful.  This is to test the Martian life hypothesis
indirectly.

How can this be done?  We know life now exists on Earth.  We understand
some of its traits.  In fact, the whole idea that Mars may have once had life
is based on comparing evidence from a sample of alleged Martian rock with
what we know about terrestrial life.

The idea is to try to recreate Martian life through genetic engineering -- i.e.,
trying to make a lifeform having all the supposed traits of the alleged Martian
fossils found on that rock sample from Antarctica.  This can be done either
as a thought experiment, a computer model or a physical experiment.

Any takers?

As long as curves are gentle in relation to the speeds involved, they should
not be a problem as long as a maglev style suspension is used. The tube
would need some pretty good bracing to survive the side thrusts for anything
other than a really gentle curve, though. Obviously, rugged freight or bulk
materials could take much sharper curves than passengers!

One thing that would be a concern here is how much energy would be absorbed
by the levitation system. If you compress a levitating magnet using the
Meissner effect, you are adding energy to the system. There has to be a
limit to how much you can add for a given setup. Maybe it's just a matter of
proper design for a safety margin?

On Fox News a week or two ago, there was a doctor who had a magnetic pulse
device he was using to treat severe depression. The transducer was what
appeared to be a ferrite C-core with perhaps a dozen turns of heavy wire,
connected to a cable running to a large cabinet. The device made cracking
noises (capacitor discharge?) at about a 5 to 10 Hertz rate.

He was heard saying to the patient that she would notice twitching in her
extremities when he found the right spot..

It actually seems to do some good, but I have no idea whether there have
been any actual studies done to remove the placebo effect as a reason.

This sounds like something that could be tried with a fairly low investment
= a couple of big shop vacuums and some large tubing. Perhaps we could build
a scale model for experimenting??

As far as shunting aside - there are existing diverter valves for pneumatic
mail delivery systems that could be tried...

I still am worried about frictional losses. All pneumatic systems lose a
good deal of energy due to compression heating of the working fluid..

This might well be true. A high-Tesla research MRI imager is a pretty
interesting thing. Particularly the very high field intensity in a
large coil aperture distinguishes it strongly from other mainstream
cryomagnet applications, as e.g. NMR spectrocopy. While it won't let you
levitate in field gradients as frogs and waterdrops can do, you should 
not be moved rapidly because we are an electrolyte bag.

Also, the RF power deposited is noticeable, and, together with certain 
pulse sequences can mean bad things to obese patients. One should be
able to induce potential differences, but the voxel size should be
pretty large. Meaning, tweaking being likely coarse.

If nanotech develops as I envision it, there might be a factory in every
home capable of producing things from raw materials on site. Purchases would
than be of licenses to produce items. Transport would become superfluous in
many cases.

One of the pluses of the suborbital is that the longest possible trip is
well under an hour. Too short for boredome, and if it was true orbital, you
get some time at zero gee..

Also, there is no pollution involved as is the case in virtually every
launch system I can think of. Even Liek Myrabo's Lightcraft will produce NOx
from the superheated air that propels tham. Also, no launch system except a
mass driver has the capability of recovering even a small percentage of
launch energy.

Then, there's the air drag losses inescapable with atmospheric travel for
the launch/reentry.

For the best efficiency, the evacuated tube reigns supreme, second only to
travel in space. I think, however, we will see the use of suborbital rockets
as transports MUCH sooner than underground sattelites!

My feeling is that the Star Trek transporter or anything even remotely

requirements for transmission and the precision required for the encoder and
decoder/reassembler! Damn shame. Also, too many people have seen 'The Fly'...

Sounds like transcranial magnetic stimulation. Yes, it is for
real. Change a magnetic field and you can induce an electric field
inside the brain, causing neurons to fire.

You can do a lot more. I have read one paper where TMS was used to
disrupt braille reading in blind (they seem to use the former visual
cortex for it), and other experiments in disrupting language. It is a
crude stimulus, but it works.

I'm not worried about dogs and cats adapting.  They'll be fine.  I was
thinking more about how the nature of our relationship with them may change
as we and they evolve.  I think that what we like most about our pets is
that they love us unconditionally.  But if we were to assist them in
becoming trans-pets and they become conscious and self-aware, would they
still love us unconditionally or might they want their freedom.  Would we
want to genetically arrange it so they did not value freedom?  Imagine being
the person that you currently are except that you have a master who expects
unconditional love.  This master would certainly seem god-like.  Hmmm.
Maybe the pervasiveness of religious groups on the planet suggests that we
seek such a master for ourselves.

It is unlikely uploading would be feasible without the computing power
made possible by nanotechnology, the detailled neuroscientific
know-how about how the brain works that nanodevices could give us and
the development of a scanning process, where the so far only
theoretically feasible methods have all involved nanosystems. So we
will with high certainty develop nanotechnology a long while before
uploading becomes possible.

I don't see the point, it wouldn't prove they are real fossils. We
could likely make an unicorn today (some creative surgery or even
genetic hybridization with a horned species) but it wouldn't prove
there are unicorns.

However, there is some rather hot debate about whether nanobacteria do
exist or not. So if we could produce nanobacteria the question about
their impossibility could at least be settled.

It's smart work that's rewarded.

I don't believe there is such a ratio. An off shore oil worker, a boxer, 
an ironworker, a bridge rigger, even a coal miner are all very dangerous jobs, 
many think they're unpleasant too, yet they're well paid.

If you define an anarcho capitalist as somebody who engages in anarcho 
capitalistic actions then that particular creature is as mythical as a  
unicorn, states do not allow people to be anarcho capitalists, yet.  
Just  having such opinions does not seem to be detrimental to ones economic

Yes. Except for about a dollar a day (the Unibomber lived on less) you could  
send your entire paycheck and savings to Ethiopia,  you could live on powered 
milk and soybeans and sleep on a bench at the airport or buss terminal. 
If you did that you would  save lives, no doubt about it. I'm not going to do 
that, or anything close to it, I very much doubt you are either. The human 
species is only capable of a finite amount of altruism, that's why communism 
didn't work and that's why the leaders of states are so dangerous. Instead of 
whining about something you're never going to change, try finding a system
that can turn the selfishness that everybody has into a virtue.

I make no apology for the fact that I like some dogs better than most people,

other pet owner in the world, otherwise we wouldn't spend billions of  
dollars on them.

If Bill Gates is only moderately clever and you're more than that then 
outsmart him in the marketplace and send 50 billion dollars to Ethiopia. 
               

         >can control the entire society by owning key resources.
               

Is it better for one leader to controls everything? Somebody please explain 
to me how nations are soon going to start making people more altruistic, even 
though they've never done that in the past.  After that explain how 
politicians who lead these nations will stay in power by making friends with 
the weak and the powerless.  

Tony, near as I can tell  your main complaint against Anarcho Capitalism is 
that it's not as good as a nation state where the leaders always do exactly 
what Tony Hollick wants, perhaps so, but that's not really the choice we face 
now is it.

That quantum electronics is more primitive than attempts to do mechanics 
at the quantum level may be so, although I haven't seen any especially 
good indicators of this. I look in on the quantum electronics field every 
few months, and things seem to be coming along quite quickly at the 
moment. I hope we can agree that it is worth pursuing as one possible 
path to nanotech!

Quantum electronics is not necessary for quantum computing. Indeed, the 
article posted by John Clark referred to NMR computing, which is based on 
the nuclear spin magnetic moment. I believe that the nuclear coupling is 
actually mediated by electrons, however for all practicial purposes 
this is not an electronic device. Neither is the linear ion trap, 
which is perhaps the strongest candidate we now have for medium scale 
quantum computing.

I'm quite sure that Nanotech will be first. Uploading seems like an
extremely complicated thing to do, and I would even say that from
today's point of view, it cannot be proven that it is possible at all
(if anybody has proven it - I'd love to read about it to improve my
argumentation against dualists and the like)...

It's not such a bad word -:)  And, it doesn't really take away from

Perhaps this is the upside of the posthuman.  Whether or not we hit a
Singularity, we will hit a Creativity Augmentum where creativity will be
much in demand at a period when we have not only the time, but the
brain-power to create.  The leaps in our creativity will be manifold.  Will
it be rational?  If we are rational beings, our creativity is rational.

In the same vein, I would say that all major scientific advances of the
past have come from highly creative thinkers. You cannot get these
things through "rationalism" alone. I think the place where logic and
rational thought fits in is testing the hypotheses that are made by the
creative mind. For example Einstein's creation of the theory of General
Relativity was probably the greatest example of creative/lateral
thinking of the human mind. He then used logic and Riemann mathematics
to prove that his " creation" was valid. i.e. working back to his
starting point - finding his way home, if you will

I've read that paper too (I think in Nature about five months ago), 
and it's quite nice. The fact that people blind from an early stage 
can use their visual cortex to process tactile information is one 
among several phenomena that shows the remarkable plasticity of the 
human neonate's brain. That is a good omen for the bottom-up approach 
to superintelligence. (Because if any area of the cortex can be 
trained to perform most any function, then that rules out the 
hypothesis that adult-level performance depends on highly elaborate, 
genetically determined cognitive modules.)

I wonder if transcranial magnetic stimulation could be used for 
recreational purposes, by noninvasively stimulating the pleasure 
centres? (At least it would be legal for some time before the 
legislators caught up with the development.)

Yes, however using electromagnetically actuated cylinders along the route to
evacuate ahead of the projectile and pump right behind the projectile will help
alleviate this by a goodly amount. Using this method, you not only reduce drag,
but you use it to generate thrust. Another measure would be to use ionization
effects to minimize shock wave formation along the boundary between the projectile
and the tube wall.

Of course, any tube system IMHO is not economically cost effective unless you have
a really high population density along the corridor being served, with large
population centers at each end.  While Japan might be a good place to develop
these, the US doesn't currently have the need, as there is still plenty of air
capacity to be used, especially with decentralized GPS navigation beign phased in.

Mass transit, at this point in time and in the near future is not a cost effective
investment of resources.  Current mass transit projects here in the US average an
investment of $300,000.00-750,000.00 per new mass transit system user. They are
subsidized by large numbers of people who live very far from the systems and never
or rarely use them, or even need them.  In comparison, any public agency can
reduce transit/highway system use (thus reducing pollution, energy consumption,
and road traffic) by investing in home workstations and training for unemployed
people who are dislocated by economic shifts, often for less than $10,000 per
person. Mass transit requires the construction of very dense communities at
selected stations to be of any use for large areas on long routes (a long route is
the only situation where an vacuum tube system would be of any use.) The trend in
the US here is in less dense communities...

The Seattle Rail Transit system proposed several years ago, for example, proposed
spending $9 billion to increase mass transit ridership by a mere 34,000 people.
In the same time period, they projected that as much as 8 percent of the total
workforce in the area would shift to telecommuting at a cost to the taxpayer of
$0.00.   Hmmmmm, which is the more useful thing to promote???

Good point.

In fact, from the point of view of the average dog, the information

I'm worried about this analogy.

Because if the situation actually follows the analogy, the 
government's current surrender on this point will be followed within 
a week by a *successful* prohibition of all good cryptography in any 
circumstances except under government orders.

See, the Tet offensive was a massive failure in military terms.  The 
only reason it was a success in *any* terms was that if the US 
government's statements about its previous successes had been true, 
the NV/Vietcong would not have had the capability to pull it off.  
But by the end of the week, what the US government had previously 
said about the state of the NV military was a serious overstatement; 
there would have been effectively nothing stopping us from marching 
north through North Vietnam until we ran into the Chinese.

It doesn't have to be true orbital to achieve that; merely ballistic.

(An orbital trajectory is a ballistic trajectory that goes 
completely around another body without ever impacting anything.)

In order for a mass driver to recover energy, it must *catch* things. 
 With a non-portable mass driver, this requires extremely high

If you're going to be caught by a mirror image of the launch device, 
you probably want to be caught in the same circumstances used to 
launch you, except perhaps facing the opposite direction.

To me, it isn't the bandwidth or the precision that create the 
problems; rather, it's the combined requirement of precision and 
SPEED.  You don't want to FEEL things taking you apart, and you don't 
want to suffer any symptoms (dying, for example) of being only 
partially assembled.  That'll be the big potential show-stopper.

As for "The Fly", travel agents report that the movie "Titanic" 
caused a big *jump* in cruise-ship bookings.

Yes, it would prove that there ARE unicorns.  (And, in fact, there 
are.  It's a weird abnormality in goats, that the roots of their two 
horns are very close together in the center of the forehead, so close 
that the horns actually grow together; their being so close together 
interferes with their growth pattern so they usually end up with 
straighter horns than is normal for goats of their species -- this 
has been seen in a couple different species.  Very rare, only a few 
cases known to have occurred, and AFAIK nobody has bought two and 
tried to breed them so we don't know if the abnormality breeds true.  
And of course, aside from the oddity of the horns, unicorns are 
perfectly ordinary goats.  Not immortal, not the good/evil beings of 
various mythologies, not more intelligent than one would expect of a 
goat, no odd magical properties, their horns don't cure illness or 
injury, they don't have a thing about virgins -- or at least not 
HUMAN virgins.)

It would NOT prove that there WERE unicorns in, say, classical Greek 
times.  (Not even one of those abnormal goats.)

Subject: (Bodhi)sattvas
Sender: postmaster@extropy.com

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

The recent discussion about pets let me to thinking about bodhisattvas and their 
transhuman counterparts. For those who know even less of Budhism than I, (any 
Buddhists out there should correct any errors on my behalf here) a bodhisattvas 
is a being that has gained all of the necessary knowledge and/or wisdom to 
transcend and become a Buddha but declines to do so out of compassion.  Buddhas
rarely interact with mere mortals, and so a bodhisattvas delays his own 
transcendence so as to be in a position to help encourage the transcendence of 
others.

The parallel with technotranscendence is clear. We talk about uplifting dogs and 
octopi here, but seldom about doing so for amoeba or rotifers. Creatures 
sufficiently far down the complexity ladder from us just don't seem worth it. 
The same may be true for a Power. After a while humans might not seem worth the 
effort to aid/uplift anymore. 

A Power might decide to temporarily halt its trancendence when it 
feels its abilities relate to humans as ours do to dogs. At that point it 
could still care (although WE might find it hard to understand its actions) and 
might work to uplift us towards its abilities.

More likely (in my mind) is for a Power, able to perform distributed 
multi-node processing, to spawn a whole series of intermediate versions of 
itself to form a ladder of trancendence. Each would be a minor processing node 
of the Power (a sattva?), and each would have a complexity relation with those 
'above' and 'below' it on the ladder such that communication is just possible 
and/or worthwhile.

If you want a selfish reason for doing such a thing, it could be observed that 
the space of possible transcended beings is probably immense. By leaving behind 
a trail, a Power makes it easier for others to follow it, and be guided such 
that they arrive at the Power's level as allies rather than enemies.

So, what do folks think, goofy idea, or not?

         I dont' support 'by far the largest concentration of power, the 
         State.'  I work unceasingly to find ways to reduce and fragment 
         that power, and to have the State (or State-like entities) 
         oppressing people as little as possible, while working to enhance 
         their freedom.  In Democratic Agorism, Representatives in the 
         (fully marketized, note) Agora Assembly need not elect a leader, 
         and may pass no laws at at all unless a clear majority of 
         Electors want otherwise.  Even then, laws have to get past the 
         Constitution and _juries_.  It's damnably hard if not impossible 
         to 'concentrate power' in such circumstances.
         
         And I'm not unsympathetic to the anarchist project (an Eric Frank 
         Russell fan writes) _if_ anarchist theoreticians can come up with 
         proven viable ways of organizing a society which optimizes 
         individual liberty, and is _reversible_ as and when it goes wrong.


> You may not like Microsoft

         'Microsoft' is an 'artificial person.'  I don't like the way 
         MS-DOS was ripped-off from Gary Kildall's brilliant CP/M (oddly, 
         I had a fully disassembled and commented copy of disassembld CP/M 
         source code early on at that time.  It could have been me! ).
         
         IBM at that time wanted a crippled version of CP/M for their 
         crippled 'Personal Computer' (absurd overpriced Intel 8085-based 
         thing) -- they didn't want personal computing to succeeed, 
         remember, partly for economic reasons (to preserve mini and 
         mainframe sales) and partly for social and political reasons.
         
         The Microsoft empire is founded on that looted, sad and dishonest 
         MS-DOS thing; the difference being, that Kildall and Digital 
         Research knew how to create reliable, compact fast operating 
         systems, and transport them to other platforms.  I'm using 
         CPM/68K and GEM right here and now on an Atari Falcon, and I 
         won't be changing any time soon.

         I also enjoy reading the indicators for the Feds' (or others')

        As we have  discussed, the Nazi Labour Camps program is an early

        of society, natch.  Every time a bureacrat dreamed up a new public 
        works project, they rounded up more prisoners.  And they rented 
        prisoners out to private businesses as cheap labour, which created 
        an inexhaustable demand for more prisoners.  Killing them all was 
        Mueller's contribution to hitting the Nazis' war production.

        How many examples do you need, to concede the falsehood of _that_

        The market doesn't 'reward' _anything_, except if you call people 
        impersonally following abstract price signals a matter for 
        'reward.'

         It's not that States do not allow people to be anarcho-capitalist 
         (look at the New York kid who can't even pull down minimum wage 
         dealing dope on the street); in James Buchanan's apt phrase, 'we 
         never get out of anarchy.' Since the prevailing social controls 
         in an anarcho-capitalist society (if such a beast were even 
         possible) are totally arbitrary, and can be _anything_ it's hard 
         to know what the complaint is.
         
         If you view States as strata title landholding companies, as landowners 
         they're entitled under _anarcho-capitalism_ to set whatever rules 
         of social conduct they damn well please.  You don't like it? 
         So move.

         I had a business and a dollar or three when first I read 'atlas

       I don't think 'communism' (whatever that may be) can possibly work

    If I could offer a free operating system better than Windoze (and I 
    can) I could never get it onto the market on any large scale.  The US 
    state would simply act to block it.  A global Windoze monopoly is too 
    useful to them, for reasons already given here.  There is no 'free 
    market' in strategic commodities.

          Democratic Agorism does not require a 'leader.'  Horizontal 
          reticular systems don't.  Vertical ('Capitalist') systems do.  
          You seem unable to understand the distinction.

Unfortunately, the pleasure centers (ventral tegmental area, septal
region, nucleus accumbens et al) are very deep inside the brain, so to
stimulate them you would have to stimulate most of the brain - with
nasty effects. But TMS might have other recreational uses (although
I'm not sure I recommend it; sending currents through one's brain can
be somewhat risky); stimulating the temporal lobe might cause
something akin to dostoyevskian epilepsia (i.e. a mystical experience
of meaningfulness, beauty and unity). But I think I will say no thanks
to trying it.

In the context of anarcho-capitalism it's very possible to give
hardware and software individual status, if they can operate in the
market they can be self-supportive (sovereign status for vending
machines, and people say anarcho-capitalists are cold hearted!).  A
basic definition of an "individual" in the market is any
self-sufficient entity.  In the near future it will be possible to
replace limbs, organs, etc. with artificial or augmented versions. 
Around this time technological progress is likely to be getting fast
and your average capitalist will be busy with her bank statement.  So
why not hand over control to the market?  Limbs and organs offer a
service, through micro billing (or perhaps a pre-decided quota based
on performance and use) you could pay them for this service, when a
limb feels the need to upgrade itself it will at it's own cost.  Your
limbs, organs, and perhaps even parts of your brain could become
self-sufficient market entities.

Is that paper available on the internet? I'd be especially interested in
how much "fine-tuning" is possible to stimulate smaller and smaller

Unlikely, Nature doesn't seem to have full text articles on the

library:

   abstract = {Functional imaging studies of people who were blind
from an early age have revealed that their primary visual cortex can
be activated by Braille reading and other tactile discrimination
tasks. Other studies have also shown that visual cortical areas can be
activated by somatosensory input in blind subjects but not those with
sight. The significance of this cross-modal plasticity is unclear,
however, as it is not known whether the visual cortex can process
somatosensory information in a functionally relevant way. To address
this issue, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation to disrupt the
function of different cortical areas in people who were blind from an
early age as they identified Braille or embossed Roman
letters. Transient stimulation of the occipital (visual) cortex
induced errors in both tasks and distorted the tactile perceptions of
blind subjects. In contrast, occipital stimulation had no effect on
tactile performance in normal-sighted subjects, whereas similar
stimulation is known to disrupt their visual performance. We conclude
that blindness from an early age can cause the visual cortex to be
recruited to a role in somatosensory processing. We propose that this
cross-modal plasticity may account in part for the superior tactile
perceptual abilities of blind subjects.}  }

Let's say: a great part of human society seeks a master they can love
unconditionally. Most of those people don't seek though - they think
they have found "him" already. And a part of those would die for this
master, or even kill people who might be a "danger" to their master.
There's a great variety of different "masters", and also a great variety
of behaviours towards that (imaginary or real) master.

Others are their own masters.

History written by Marxists/socialists makes capitalism look oppressive,
and the history written by capitalists makes socialism look out and out
tyrannical.  Both claim that the other's history is morally and
economically bankrupt.  So what precisely are you trying to show here?

Go back and reread what I said in my second response to you.  "...  if
organizing in another way would improve efficiency, then I suspect you'd
see more organizations incorporating it.  But I'm not sure about this."  To
state my opinion more clearly, I'm totally in favor of co-ops in
competition if that improves economic efficiency.  However, that's a far
cry from embracing the abolition of capitalism.

I'm sure that you have.  But what I suggested is that you read an
introductory *neo-classical microeconomics* textbook, not just any book on
economics.  But at any rate..

First of all, this is simply untrue.  The real income of the poor (which is
income adjusted for inflation) has undergone severe fluctuations over the
last 30 years, both up and down.  The 70s were marked by severe inflation,
while the beginning of the 80s started in recession, then pulled out again
by deficit spending, then dragged back into recession again when Bush
increased taxes and cut spending to recover a runaway deficit.  Inflation
now is at an unparalleled low and I'm proud to say that real income,
including and especially that of the poor, has been higher throughout this
decade (even including the recession of the early ninties) than in the 70s.

Care to check my data?  http://www.census.gov

>Who produce your products? The managment? Of course, the workers.

Actually, it usually takes both.  Workers must coordinate their efforts in
order to produce; one way to do so is by having people whose sole job is to
coordinate.  And before you tell me that the workers can manage themsleves,
let me also add that I AGREE that the workers can manage themselves: the
manager is a worker too.

>Only

The management ARE workers, at least under capitalism.

They need buyers to stay in business.  The management would not die if a
recession happened next year.

Please don't take this in the wrong way... I don't mean this as a joke or
as an insult, but I'm having a really hard time understanding your English.
 I think your last sentance should read "Competition forces (sets?) the
height of the price which the firms can earn in the market."  If I've
misread you, please correct me.  And if I've read you correctly, then I
agree with this.

In microeconomics, labor is not the source of all value, but rather labor
is a product which workers make using their "human capital."  The price of
this labor is ALSO set by competition, just like all other market goods;
just like how consumers can't and don't expect goods at an arbitrarily low
price, firms can't and don't expect more labor at lower wages than workers
are willing to supply.

Underlying this theory is the highly contestable assertion that "the
management" doesn't do any economically useful work.  After all, we EXPECT
value adding to happen if value is actually added, as when workers turn raw
steel into a car door.  And the fact of the matter is that capital owners
DO work, and thus deserve a just return on their OWN labor.

Owners of capital must make decisions on how to invest their capital, in
what forms, and with whom.  These are not trivial decisions, nor can they
be made lightly.  Despite what people say about "old boy networks,"
investing in one's friends simply because they are friendly is highly
detrimental to one's own economic livelihood.  The rich do not stay rich
for long with this investment strategy.  (Instead, "old boy networks"
usually tend to consist of those (WASP men, sadly) who have consistently
proven themselves to be the money makers in society, not just any old
fuddy-duddies who happen to own capital.)  The best way to invest is with
those who can make the most money:  those who can produce the most
efficiently, at the lowest cost to the greatest number; those who can
provide the greatest service to the community, as measured by the amount
which the community is willing to pay for it.  

Again, this is no easy decision to make.  It often requires intimate
knowledge of the people involved, the tools being used, the demand for the
product being offered, etc.  And there's no question that investing in this
way requires intelligence and skills which not all people have.  By
allowing those capitalists to collect their rightfully earned return on
their capital, a decentralized system of voluntary market coordination
develops, one which ultimately tends towards greater efficiency and greater
wealth for all than a democratic allocation of resources.

Capitalists do economically useful work.  Not only do they do useful work,
but their work is far more scarce (and in much greater demand) than most
other labor due to the complicated and difficult nature of their task.
Meanwhile, manual laboring, which Marx sees as the only source of value, is
in abundant supply.  Due to this, and the fact that it is under
capitalism's voluntary coordination that the richest nations have
prospered, I say with most certainty that the capitalist's task is in many
ways more valuable than the manual laborer's job.

Let's examine what you're saying economically.

I'm saying that in perfect competition, the market for labor looks like this:

Wages |\_           _/ <-- supply
      |  \_       _/
      |    \_   _/
   W* |______\_/
      |     _/^\_
      |   _/  |  \_
      | _/    |    \_
      |/      |      \ <-- demand
      ----------------------
              E*
           Employment

Wages are set entirely by the market in this imaginary model.  Workers are
unwilling to work for less than a certain wage at a given employment level
(given by the supply cuve), and will seek other firms rather than work in
such conditions.  Firms are unable to pay more than a certain wage at a
given employment level (shown here as the demand curve).  Workers make
surplus utility on their labor, given by the area above the supply curve
and below the price; firms make surplus profit given by the area below the
demand curve and above the price.  Firms which attempt to lower wages do
not receive any labor supplied as all workers substitute into other firms;
firms which attempt to increase wages operate at a loss.

However, the market for labor probably doesn't look like this.  To some
extent, it may look monopsonistic, like this:

Wages |\_ MFC>/     _/ <-- supply
      |  \_  /    _/
      |    \/   _/
      |    / \_/
      |   / _/ \_
    WM|__/_/     \_
      | // ^       \_
      |/   |         \ <-- demand
      ----------------------
           EM
           Employment

A monopsonist suffers a larger marginal cost of labor than simply the
supply curve, since the firm must increase the wage level in order to
increase the labor supply.  Since the firm will only produce until its
marginal revenue is equal to its marginal costs, it will employ a smaller
number of workers (EM) and pay them less (WM).

This is all good and well, except that if workers DO suffer under a
monopsony, then their supply is likely much much greater.  (ie they will
accept lower wages for the same level of employment).  There is very little
that one won't accept, as you note, when not accepting means not eating.
Destitution leads to a huge increase in the labor supply.  So instead the
monopsonist would face this supply curve and marginal cost: (enlarged for
clarity)

Wages |\__                 __/   <-- MFC
      |   \__           __/
      |      \__     __/
      |         \___/       ____  <-- supply
      |        __/^\__ ____/
    W*|---  __/ ->|___\__
      | ___/ ____/|      \__
      |/____/     |          \  <-- demand
      -----------------------------
                  E*
           Employment

Workers are prepared to accept much lower wages (though still not
arbitrarily low) for the same level of employment as would be existing
under perfect competition.  In all likelihood, I've probably even
overestimated the slope of this supply curve:  it should remain almost zero
for a little longer.

Now we can see that we should be asking questions like these:  Do workers
actually have a supply curve this low, and if so, how can we increase it?
I think the answer to the first question is no, for two reasons:  employees
ARE able to switch firms if wages are too low; they are also wealthy enough
to strike if switching firms would be too costly. 

How we could cause the supply curve to increase?  The answer is simple:
increase the substitution and income effects by increasing the number and
availability of firms so that employees can switch industries/firms more
easily, and by helping wealth per capita to increase.  Having more wealth
should result in an income effect, (at least with respect to "inferior
goods," if not immediately with respect to the quantity of employment
supplied,) which allows employees to invest in their wages more easily.

The fact that workers DO strike and that they do switch firms for better
pay indicates that these effects are ALREADY taking place; however, I also
agree with the argument for helping them to take place even more than they
are now.  However, this is still no argument  against capitalism.

The percentage of unionized workers says very little to me.  In fact,
considering how the unions have lobbied so heavily (and have permanently
entrenched themselves) in their right to free assembly, it seems to me that
the reason more workers aren't part of unions is not that they find it too
difficult, but simply that it is not worth the effort.  They're getting a
great wage as it is, the economy is still booming and people are wealthier
today than they were in previous decades.  What do they need to strike for?

Capitalists can't (legally) chain anybody to anything under lf-capitalism.
In this way, capitalists are fundamentally different from pharaohs.

Industrious people are in high demand in a capitalist economy; due to their
industriousness, they also tend not to get themselves unemployed.  So IMO,
this doesn't happen as much as you say it does.  However, we can't measure
industriousness, so I don't think we can have a reasonable discussion about
it.

And as to when people are or aren't able to change their jobs, I think I
have a surprise for you.  Millions of people across the country switch jobs
DAILY, for all kinds of different reasons; among these reasons (and a
popular one at that) is better pay.  Are you trying to tell me that this
doesn't happen?  That they can't?  That the capitalists won't let them?
You're wrong.

This is outrageous!  Above I said that "... there are MANY different firms
out there, each offering different wages and producing goods of different
quality," and you called it nonsense!  Now you're telling me that I don't
deal with workers of different qualifications?  Give me a break!

>A worker

No, but there's more than one car maker out there, and more than one
computer chip maker, and more than one university, and more than one
hospital, so most people still have ample room to change jobs within their
own industry without much difficulty.

Labor-saving innovations lead to lost jobs, huh?  They also bring down the
price of everything, resulting in increased wealth for everyone relative to
the price level.  What more do you want from technology?

They are spontaneous because they are formed voluntarily and therefore
spontaneously.  But even if I cede to you that corporations aren't
spontaneous, (which I don't,) capitalism does NOT require people to form
corporations: co-operatives are as much a capitalistic phenomenon as
corporations, and they're BOTH spontaneous.

Tricky. I'm not good enough at physics to say for certain, but it
looks like a very complicated problem; you want to add together a lot
of dipoles (possibly time-varying) so that the induced current given
the electromagnetic properties of the head become large in only one
small area. It might be doable, but it would be a hack.

Would it in principle be possible to arrange the magnetic fields in 
such a way that the flield strength is only significant in the 
nucleus accumbens, say, and perhaps in some regions were the

Linux is fringe. The user statistics about Linux (like the ones recently published by Wired) seem ridiculously high to me. Usually, they are simply measured by the sales. But of the hundreds of thousands who buy Redhat, how many stay with it? I had installed Linux but had to drop it for lack of usable software (mainly OCR) and usable Plug & Play support.  I suppose many who bought it didn't even manage to install it.

Anton Sherwood presented counter-argumentation 
against holistic-identity theory, arguing that 
its proponent, myself, is confusing two types 
of identity, vernacular and logical. These are
the definitions Anton gave for these identities:

 Vernacular identity: property of a thing.

 Mathematical identity: relation between a 
 thing and itself or between two equal things.

Examples of the properties of a thing (which
fall into the category of vernacular identity) 
are its color, size, speed, shape, and weight, 
all of which are derived from holistic relation,
which can be defined as "relative difference."

But Anton alleges that there is another kind
of identity that is derived from self-relation.
Requests for examples or evidence of such iden-
tity have been answered only with examples of 
relations between different things. NO example 
of a "mathematical identity" (a thing that is
itself free from anything else) has been shown.

The reason that no example of a "mathematic
identity" can be shown may be explained by the 
fact that any tangible variety of identity is
a product of the relations of differing subsets, 
and thus measurable identity is difference, not 
"same as." Therefore, the only identity that 
exists pertaining to self-relation is zero 
identity, is no, or null, identity.

We can see this expressed perfectly in the 
identity matrix, which defines the attributes 
of the identities of the entities across the top
relative to the entities along the left side: 


               1  2  3  4  5
              _______________
           1 | 0  1  2  3  4 |
             |               |
           2 |-1  0  1  2  3 |
             |               |
           3 |-2 -1  0  1  2 |
             |               |
           4 |-3 -2 -1  0  1 |
             |               |
           5 |-4 -3 -2 -1  0 |
             -----------------


3 has the attribute of 2 relative to 1, and by
symmetry, 1 has the attribute of -2 relative to 3.
Wherever a "0" appears, there is "self-relation."
The measure of identity that an entity attains by
relation to itself is zero, zip, nada, null, no-
thing, or void. Therefore, what Anton has defined 
as "mathematic identity" is nowhere to be found.

But this "0" is still important. It means that the
self-relation of anything to itself is equal to the
self-relation of any other thing to itself and of 
all things to all things (since the sum of all the
attributes in the matrix equals 0 -- the difference 
between "all difference" and "all difference" is 0; 
and therefore, difference is, as a rule, conserved).

This is the central structure of the conservation 
of identity. So Anton's "mathematic identity" IS 
valid in a profoundly holistic sense, and it is 
the center piece of radical holism: zero mechanics.

Hmm.. Because I'm not a scientist, but an artist, there's less reason in
this statement than you are probably hoping for. I'm saying this based on
intuition and a lifetime of growing up around the Silicon Valley/Bay Area.
I've always thought that bold advances in any high-technology are the
result of a synergy of theoretical ideas melding together. When it comes to
the technology needed to scan the brain, I think it will be the product of
one incredible idea/device connected to some existing technology. I'm sure
that you could argue this is graduated science.. So I guess that part of my
statement is a bit off target.. But I do believe that we'd need something
revolutionary to make this first step towards U/Ling. Perhaps it will be
Nano, but I imagine it much farther away than some alternative brain
scanning device.


This has turned into a sunday morning ramble..

IMO, uploading will require a large increase in computing capacity
just to run the upload, plus major advances in fields like
neurophysiology. Many of the uploading methods we have discussed
here depend on nanotech to derive the state of the meat brain for
flash uploading or to provide the interconnection for gradual
uploading. If you think uploading will precede nanotech, you will
have to develop a non-nanotech solution to one of these problems.

By contrast, nanotech is a much easier problem. In "Nanosystems",
in 1992, K. Eric Drexler described diamondoid nanotechnology
rigirously, and sketched out an implementation  path via
wet chemistry less rigorously. The number of problems to solve
along this path is miniscule by comparison to uploading problems.
Furthermore, the current rapid pace of research in nanotubes gives
us what appears to be a simpler path to diamondoid nanotech.
Therefore I would vote for nanotech first and uploading second,
except for one little thing:

There is the potential for "spontaneous order" and other emergent
behaviour of complex systems to create a superintelligence based
on the current internet, together with some unpredictable additional
factor. This might occur precipitously, as a "phase change"
rather than as a build-up. If so, the resulting SI may complete
the development of nanotech and use it for uploads at what
appears to humanity to be the same time.

Free association (Einstein's basic inspiration) is non-rational creativity,
not irrational creativity.  Non-rational creativity is not in conflict with
rational creativity. 

Rational creativity doesn't exclude the non-rational process of innovation,
inspiration, originality, vision and daring.  

Rational thinking is advantageous to creative thinking.   If I have a
visionary idea (non-rational creativity) and want to take it to fruition -
produce it - rational thinking is my best bet.

Wow, this conversation could really open up a large can of post-human worms, but
suffice it to say that (here comes the old somewhat naturally evolved human
speaking) a balance of rational and irrational creativity is likely responsible
for some of the more clever insights into the human world. Whenever you put a
limitation on perception you block possible avenues of thought which might lead
to revelation.

Lets think about this however. In say a post human model, presumably derived from
a nano-equiped neural/body scanning system, you could build integrate a full
electro-chemical simulation. The reason would be to give the new entity an
consistent temporal relationship to say the 'human' who'd interface with it.
Think about what would happen if you removed the electrochemical portion of our
mechanism. We might experience 1000 years of human time per second, or something
along those lines. This could make communication with this entity really
difficult. Would the model of the human mind go 'insane' because its software is
not capable of operating with these limitations removed. (i.e. could an
automobile operate at the speed of light with out disintegrating?) I think our
'physical model' which supports the human consciousness, would need to have built
into it a way of controlling the speed of electrochemical simulation. This could
be controlled by the posthuman, which would allow its software to re-write itself
as necessary to accommodate the new efficiency. (what a rant no?)

Do you think that Van Gough was a 'rationally creative' mind?


Here's a quote which I love:

"Method helps intuition when it is not transformed into dictatorship. Intuition
augments method if it does not instill anarchy. In every moment of our semiotic
existence, method and intuition complement one another."

Mihai Nadin
Interface Design and Evaluation - Semiotic Implications


Perhaps I'm wrong seeing METHOD as the rational side of creativity. To me it does
seem that intuition is rarely based on a RATIONAL line of thinking.



Finally this list is getting back into the singularity. Which by the way, is an
important element in an installation I'm working on for the ICC Modern Art Museum
in Tokyo. MAX and NATASHA would probably love what we're working on. (-;

A friend of mine recently pointed me to Speed and Photo Reading.
Currently, I read at about 250 words per minute. I found some companies
trying to sell "Learn PhotoReading" kits for about $250 through
MetaCrawler, and I'd really like to know what that's all about.

They claim that it's possible to read 25.000 words per minute, which I
don't consider realistic - but I'm willing to learn (that's about ONE
PAGE per SECOND, sounds more like a slow modem than a human being
reading ;-) ). If 1.000 or 2.000 wpm are possible without having to read
a book 4 to 8 times before you remember anything, it seems like a worthy
investment.

Anybody with experience on that?

Thanks for any information!

later,
Holger

Do you think that MRI technology seemed like "Buck Rogers" science 30
years ago?

Bare in mind, that I know very little about neuro-physiology. Is there
some type of electromagnetic signature emitted during the neurological
event? like the manufacturing of NTs? If so, could a finely tuned system
driven with supercomputing ability track the billions of reactions
simultaneously? Could such a system also be used to build a model of their
interactions?


Woah, I'm sure that sounded very naive some, but I'm curious how far away
we really are from developing brain scanning systems..

   IAN: Right, rational thinking minus creativity
   is a computer, and computers invent nothing --
   that is, unless we can digitize creativity.

   Creativity minus the rational is fantasy, and
   fantasy by itself also leads to no progress. 
   But interface the two and you have progress.

   Einstein supposedly spent quite a bit of time
   as a youth fantasizing what it would be like 
   to ride on a beam of light as a surfer rides 
   on a surf board. Such fantasy was as much a 
   part of this innovations as were the lessons
   in rational thinking he learned in college.

Yes, it is possible to track fairly quick phenomena using their
magnetic signatures; a current will produce a dipole field which can
be detected. But while this has a good time resolution (quick changes
can be seen) the spatial resolution is not very good (centimeters, the
concerted action of millions of cells). The problem is that the brain
is like an immense crowd of talking people, individual voices get lost
in the noise.

Do you have a source for the claim that free association was Einstein's 
basic inspiration?

I'm curious because this doesn't gell with the biographies I've read, but 
perhaps you have other information...

If the reponse time of the region is long enough (doubtful), you
could perhaps physically swing a single dipole around the head.
as I recall, an appropriate dipole would generate a cylinder of
approximately uniform flux along its axis between the poles,
witb the "return path" for the flux approximateing a a much larger
(and therefore less dense) sphere. If this approximation is
valid, thenswinging the entire mess around so that the opposite
poles describe a sphere about the target region will concentrate
the average flux at the target. This is the apporach that was (is?)
used in radiation treatments of cancer. the problems to solve are:
1) the diameter of the hi-flux cylinder is probably large by comparison
to the equivalent beam used in radiation therapy, and
2) the time constant for reaction to the magnetic field is likely
to be short (milliseconds?) relative to the time constant for
sensitivity to radiation (minutes to days.) You may be able to
solve the second problem by moving the field from magnet to magnet
electronically rather than by moving it physically, but as Anders
says, this could be tricky.

Right, Natasha. Many people think that scientists use a purely
rational method, the "scientific method", to solve problems and
somehow generate scientific knowledge. I feel that scientists
actually operate by first generating a whole bunch of ideas
by non-rational processes, and then pick some of them for further
analysis. A creative scientist probabpy generates between ten and
a hundred such ideas a day, and picks between one and ten of them
for further analysis. Of these, most are discarded base on simple
"thought experiments", within a few seconds. Perhaps one a week
actually gets more than one minute of careful thought. Of these,
perhaps one per month gets written down. Some of these may then
be formally subjected to the scientific method.

The difference between science and other human endeavors is that
the creative process is finally subjected to rational, reproducable
analysis before it is accepted.

I have read a "teach-yourself" PhotoReading book from the originating
company. I no longer own this book; perhaps their courses are better.

Briefly, their method involved studying the book's structure, reading for a
definite purpose, using your finger as a visual-aid and outlining. This is
all pretty standard for improved reading skill courses. Their claims of
enormous speed come from their one novel suggestion: soft-focussing on a
book's pages
and turning them at a steady rpaid rate supposedly allowing the
"subconscious" mind to absorb the information.

I got no real benefit, but I read naturally at about 400-600 wpm or better.
This varies with the material's difficulty and familiarity, of course. "How
fast can you read?" is as meaningful as "How fast can you drive?". A
familiar road under the best conditions allows high speeds; a well-loved
book with an interested reader also allows high speeds.

My (unsolicited) advice is to read "How to Read a Book," by Mortimer J.
Adler. I don't know where you can find it auf Deustch, but amazon.com may
sell it. This text covers reading skills other than speed techniques.
Instruction on these can be had from just about any "read fast" book on the
market.

Hope this helps.

There is another thing I don't understand, when you talk about "looting" and  
"ripping off" you almost make it sound like a bad thing. That's how progress  
is made, it's why everyone doesn't have to reinvent the wheel every day.  
You have a good idea and start selling it, I make a few improvements and give 
you some competition, you like my improvements and then make some of your own, 
and on it goes.

        > MS-DOS was ripped-off from Gary Kildall's  brilliant CP/M          


Gary Kildall was an idiot, Bill Gates was not, that's why Gates became a  
billionaire and Kildall didn't. In 1979 Microsoft was a computer language 
company not a operating system company, when IBM executives visited tiny 
Microsoft they made a deal to buy all of Microsoft's languages and most of 
their applications for their new PC. Then the IBM people said "naturally 
we'll want your operating system too". Gates told them they were misinformed, 
Microsoft had no operating system but that Kildall's company "Digital 
Research" did. With the IBM people still in the room Gates picked up the 
phone and called Kildall explained the situation and said IBM wanted to talk 
to him immediately. Some say Bill Gates is selfish but he offered Gary 
Kildall the greatest business opportunity in history and on a silver platter. 
Kildall blew it.

Kildall said he couldn't meet with IBM now because he was leaving town on 
important business (what could be more important than this meeting I can't 
imagine) Kildall said they could talk with his wife Dorothy if they wanted to, 
IBM agreed. As was their custom, before anyone said a word IBM insisted that 
everybody sign a non disclosure agreement, Gates had signed his immediately 
but Dorothy panicked. She called her lawyer, he panicked. After the IBM  
executives sat around the office of Digital Research for 4 hours saying and 
doing nothing they gave up and went home.


        >IBM at that time wanted a crippled  version of CP/M          


IBM wanted a 16 bit operating system your "brilliant" CP/M was 8 bit.        
Tim Paterson, a programmer at tiny Seattle Computer Corporation got tired of 
waiting for the long delayed 16 bit version of CP/M and so wrote his own 
called QDOS (Quick and Dirty Operating System). 

Gates was horrified at Kildall's blunder because he thought it would kill his 
deal to sell IBM its computer languages, he was desperate to find a 16 bit 
operating system, then he heard about QDOS and bought it for $50,000.

By the way, there is a myth that Tim Paterson became a street person and had 
been seen cleaning windshields with a bottle of Windex and begging for 
quarters. It's a wonderful story but its not true. Not long after Microsoft 
bought QDOS Paterson got a job at Microsoft, he's not as rich as Gates but 
like all early Microsoft employees he is a millionaire. For years he had a
picture of a bottle of Windex on his office door.

        >and partly for social and political reasons. 


That's true. As I said before, sometimes companies deliberately make an  
inferior product, but it's always a disastrous policy and a wonderful  
opportunity for competitors. If IBM hadn't done it Microsoft wouldn't be the  
giant it is today, if Microsoft every tries it a new giant will be created  
from somewhere.

Don't be silly, money is a reward.


        >How much does a toilet cleaner, say, earn in your locality?


Not much. I don't find cleaning toilets intellectually stimulating or much 
fun so I'd rather pay somebody who needs money more than me do it, that's 
what money is for. Many people have that particular skill so I don't have to 
pay much.

Linux is fringe. 

Uh? Hardly. I know a lot of people who use it, almost the whole of the
academia, occasional patches in business (see Sixt, many web servers), 
and the majority of hackers.

The user statistics about Linux (like the ones recently published by
Wired) seem ridiculously high to me. 

Too high, yes. But distincly less than one order of magnitude incorrect.

Usually, they are simply measured by the sales. But of the hundreds of
thousands who buy Redhat, how many stay with it? I had installed Linux

I have no data for this. I for one, have not bought my current
installation but installed it off a local ftp redhat mirror. Those
distributions I buy I lent so several people.

but had to drop it for lack of usable software (mainly OCR) and usable Plug & Play support.  I suppose many who bought it didn't even manage to install it.

PlugNPray is supported, albeit you have to configure it manually. I
for one tend to configure the PnP devices with Win95.

Perhaps some sort of standing wave effect, where the various fields from
different sources all reinforce at one point and are too low in power to
cause effects at other locations. Something akin in principle to the 'gamma
knife' used to kill brain tumors with many beams of radiation while
subjecting surrounding tissues to low (relatively) doses?

Imaging, as distinct from 'reading' or 'uploading' is already here in
several forms. PET scans, MRI, and CT are well known, and resolution is
increasing steadily.

The problem I see here is: Does anyone really know how memories are stored -
is it holographic, physical location, or wiring? Is the brain serial or
parallel in it's processing? How much of the brain's activity is electrical
and how much is chemical, when it comes to actual thought?

We are still in the infancy of learning exactly how the brain works...

The problem is that the current methods all have rather strong limits
to their resolution (PET is limited by the mean free path for
positrons, MRI by heating of tissue by changing magnetic fields and CT
by the risk of radiation damage). Of course, new methods might (more
likely, *will*) appear, but we cannot say for certain how good imaging
can get. I have a suspicion that it will never become scanning, since
it has to measure the brain from a significant macroscopic distance
(centimeters) while we want data on the micron scale.

> The problem I see here is: Does anyone really know how memories are stored -

The current model is a bit of all three: memories are stored as
changes in synaptic efficacies across the brain, possibly also the
growth nof new dendrites and synapses. That means they are fairly
non-local, although they are more sensitive to damage to certain
subsystems than others. 

> Is the brain serial or parallel in it's processing?

Parallel, at least when you look at the low-level systems of
perception, movement and memory (fairly natural when you have 10^100
independent neurons active together). High-level cognition might be
more serial, but it is not settled yet.

> How much of the brain's activity is electrical
> and how much is chemical, when it comes to actual thought?

They are the same. The signals that rush along neurons are
electrochemical processes where ions move in and out of the cell. At
synapses the signals release neurontransmittors that cause electric
changes in the postsynaptic cell. There are purely chemical processes
and signals, but they seem to act much slower than the electrochemical
signals and hence are unlikely to be part of normal thought.

> We are still in the infancy of learning exactly how the brain works...

Indeed. That makes it so fun to study!

     From the April 17,1998 Vancouver Sun - Canadian Press

   Corbeil, Ontario - Marie Loise Meilleur, the world's oldest person, has
 died at the age of 117.
   Her daughter Olive Therrien said Meilleur died peacefully Thursday
 afternoon at the Nipissing Manor nursing home where she had lived for the
 past 10 years.
   "She's been very well until last week," said Therrien, 78 of
 Peterborough, Ont. "She got a blood clot in her leg, and it moved from
 her leg into her lung."
   Meilleur had 10 children from two marriages, most of whom have died,
 Therrien told the Peterborough Examiner.
   "She looked after her family. She was a wonderful person."
   Meilleur is survived by three daughters and one son. The oldest is 89,
 a daughter who lives in Barrie, Ont.
   Born Aug. 29,1880, in Kamouraska, Que., Meilleur celebrated her 117th
 birthday last August at a celebration attended by family, friends, and a
 host of dignitaries, including Premier Mike Harris.
   At the celebration, her 72-year-old daughter Rita Gutzman explained the
 secret (of) Meilleur's long life was hard work.
   "She said hard work could never kill a person," Gutzman said.
   Because she was almost blind and could barely hear, it's not clear
 whether she realized she had been designated the world's oldest person.
   She assumed the mantle after the death of Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment at
 age 122. The Guinness Book of World Records accepted Meilleur because
 some of the other contenders didn't have the documentation Guinness
 requires.
   She had 85 grandchildren, 80 great-grandchildren, 57
 great-great-grandchildren and four great-great-great-grandchildren.
   Affectionately known as Memere to her family, she had walked into the
 Nipissing Manor home with only the aid of a cane in 1988 at the tender
 age of 107. She had been living in Deep River, Ont.
   No arrangements have been made yet for the funeral, Therrien said.
 Endquote.
 Note:
   Marie Meilleur had a propensity to get a lot of exercise, in common
 with Jeanne Calment, who rode a bicycle until the age of 100.
   Exercise has been found to be a protective factor in old people in
 (Arch Intern Med 157: 2249-2258 1997). The following is Table 6 from this
 report listing a mutlivariate analysis of all-cause mortality in

I wouldn't call it support. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. And I don't install Win95 to run Linux.

Very often the psychology is that of a parent-child relationship.  This is
true not only for the human owners, but also possibly for the pets.  For
example, if you watch the behavior of cats, much of it is based on their
perception of humans as mother cats.  That's not surprising.  If you're a cat,
mother is the one who feeds, cleans, and protects you.  So, your human owner
fits that definition pretty closely.

Speak for yourself!  I don't acknowledge any rights of animals, and AFIAK the
law here in Texas doesn't either.  Neither does most of society, I believe,
except for the few animal-rights extremists.

Animals, like most things, have the value that people assign to them.  My pet
cat is beloved to me; I would be hurt deeply if anything happened to him.  But
a scraggly feral cat prowling around my back yard at night has no value to me;
I would shoot one without even blinking.  I don't think there's anything
abnormal about that.  It's human nature.

This reminds me of the abortion debate.  When does a fetus become a person? 
My answer is that it happens whenever people -- mostly the parents, but also
possibly others -- have invested enough physical and emotional resources in it
to /care/ about it as a person.

AS> and one could imagine a canine union acting as the lobby for
AS> intelligent dogs (demands for fair treatment,

That sounds like a particularly amusing vision of Hell.

I'm opposed to the whole idea of animal rights for exactly this reason -- it
sets a bad precedent for the future.  If you recognize animal rights, what's
next?  It all comes down to economics.  See if you can follow my reasoning
here...

You could recognize rights of robots, if they meet some certain level of AI. 
At some point you would have to call it "sentient" and recognize it as a
person instead of a mere machine.

THEN it might be considered improper to own them.  That would be slavery. 
They would have to be set free and be paid for their work.  (Why do you call
them FREE if you have to PAY them?  No, don't answer that!)  Under these
circumstances, the robots change from being *servants* of humanity to being
competitors.  Instead of finally lifting the burden of WORK from our
civilization, the robots would simply take our jobs and leave us with nothing.

There are four basic economic resources: land, labor, capital, and
entrepreneurial ability.  I see the coming era as a change from a
labor-oriented economy to a capital-oriented economy.  This change has already
started, it happens whenever workers are replaced by machines.  The ultimate
goal should be for *all* workers to be replaced by machines, and all the
former workers become capitalists -- owners of the machines.  But if we grant
that sufficiently advanced machines might also be /people/, then it throws a
monkeywrench into the whole plan.

It may seem I've rambled a long way from the subject of pets, but this is all
inter-connected.  The same technology that will blur the distinction between
labor and capital will also blur the distinction between machines and living
creatures.  It's hard to say that life is sacred unless you can define life. 
Likewise, it's hard to say sentience is sacred unless you can define
sentience.  I haven't yet heard a convincing definition of either, and this
may lead to many conflicts.

AS> These pets do not need to be just animals or improved
AS> animals, they might be AIs or biotechnological constructs.

There, you see?  Exactly what I was saying...

AS> Overall, I think uplifting of other species is a good idea, but the
AS> ethics is quite complicated.

I don't see anything to gain by it.  In a way, animals are too much like us. 
Although not as intelligent, they share the same basic drives we do,
programmed by eons of survival and reproduction.  That means ultimately they
will probably WANT the same things we do.  Biology is destiny.  Even if you
shed the biology, its legacy remains.  So, I am more interested in creating
entirely artificial creatures that can be programmed from the ground up. 
Without an evolutionary legacy, they can be given /drives/ that are completely
unlike natural life forms: innate compulsions to do things that are useful to
US.

Am I reading you correctly?  That sounds like an odd thing for extropians to
believe.  (Although, I have certainly heard stranger.)  If you accept the
concept of uploading in any form, it's based on an assumption that the person
is software -- a pattern of information.  So, you can move this software from
one hardware "platform" to another, and it's still valid.

I certainly wouldn't say that.  It's a gradual shift, as the child grows and
becomes more and more responsible for his own person and well-being.

One amusing aspect is that current law assumes the whole process works on a
fixed 21-year time schedule, as driven by human biology.  What happens if
someone designs a child that will never grow up?  Is is morally wrong to do
such a thing?  Or what about the opposite, someone creating a new person fully
formed and ready to enter life as an adult, like Minerva springing from Jove's
forehead?

If you're raising a kid, that's an investment in your own reproduction
imperative.  Your payback is the success of your offspring, carrying your
genes into the future.

No, they don't.  They would have to be sentient persons in order to OWN
anything, including their own bodies.

Since I posted my introduction to Project Star Net, I've beeen anxiously
looking for responses -- any responses!  I'm surprised that I haven't got any.
 I was prepared to possibly be flamed, but deafening silence was the last
thing I expected.  Have I unwittingly committed some breach of ettiquette?

I think something like PSN is probably inevitable.  But maybe it really is too
early to do anything useful about it.  Sort of like the L5 Society, too far
ahead of their time.

But won't this same technology also blur the distinction between people
and the other categories?  What happens when someone alters his DNA to
make himself more like an animal?  Or what happens when he incorporates
computer parts into his brain, or uploads and adds parts of his mentality
to AI systems?  I don't see how you are going to be able to draw the line
you want to draw.

I could see having some test for intelligence in order to have rights,
since that could conceivably be made objective, but it seems impossible
to have a meaningful test for "humanness".

When I pay you for your labor, we BOTH benefit: I for receiving your labor,
you for receiving my payment.  Robots would be no different.  The argument
that anyone could do our work and leave us WORSE off as a result is dubious

If the robots ARE people, then we're right back to a labor oriented economy
again, only with a different type of people doing the work.

Try thinking about it this way:  each sentient robot we create is like
giving birth to a new child.  Now, since people on average produce more
than they consume, it has long been true that increasing population
increases economic wealth per capita, and that successive generations have
become increasingly productive.  The nations of the world, including the
world's poor, have grown richer as a result.  The upshot of all this is
that a labor market with lots of sentient robots is not only not bad, but
may be the best thing that could possibly happen to us.

With respect to ANIMAL rights...

I've been uncertain about animal rights for a long time now.  I'm basically
a utilitarian, and I support a libertarian conception of human rights
because I believe that doing so will help to maximize human utility.  From
the perspective of the human race, then, respecting the utility of animals
(especially that derived from owning the property where they live) would
cost us dearly with respect to our utility.

However, this is not a valid argument for neglecting the utility of
animals; it only shows that in doing so we would have to make certain
unpalatable concessions.  This same argument could have been used by a
slave owner to justify the economics of racial slavery.

What I can say is this:  animals cannot and do not respect law, contract or
the utility of other animals.  Some animals do respect the land of others
or engage in "altruistic" behavior with respect to other animals, but
others are carnivorous, aggressive and/or selfish to the point of killing
others to achieve their ends.  We would not accept such behavior if it were
a human doing so to others.

Similarly, we cannot treat animals' transgressions of "animal rights" in
the same way that we treat a human's.  In human society we can contract
with someone not to destroy the animals, we can imprison them for not
respecting animals' homes, we can educate them as to why this may not be in
their self interest.  We cannot even begin to hope to do this sort of thing
to other species.  Animals cannot understand a contract, nor would they
understand the nature of imprisonment and would not therefore adjust their
strategies on a game-theoretical payoff grid.  Carnivores, with few
exceptions, cannot be taught vegetarianism.

For the reasons I have described, I cannot use the utilitarian argument to
support a libertarian conception of rights; even if the animal would
benefit from my respecting its rights, it would not and could not respect
mine.  Thusly, at least for now, I reject the argument for animal rights.

<sigh>: go to   http://www.pir.org  first.  Assume I know most of what 
you read there.

Linux is a good example of what I'm talking about.  It doesn't matter how 
good it it, nor how cheap it it - it cannot succeed (network effects); and 
if it looked like it was going to, its producers would come unglued.  
Like Amiga.  Like Atari.  Like Mac.  Like OS/2.  Like everything else.

  The Feds like the 'take' from the Microsoft 'Backdoors'; and the 
  'commercial intelligence' take (which is worth unvouchered billions) 
  they open into far to much to give them up, even though they're 
  blatantly unlawful and illegal.  Then, there's all the 'law enforcement' 
  stuff.  And the 'political intelligence.'  And the military 
  intelligence.

I hope I don't 'boast' about these.  I might mention some of them from 
time to time, when it's relevant.

  You have to understand that POTUS (the President of the United States) 
  gives the orders to the intelligence agencies; via the Director, Central 
  Intelligence (George Tenet) for the Intelligence Community; and via the 
  DoD for NSA.
  
  You may also have noticed he's a 'Friend of Bill's.  I don't imagine 
  he'll be putting America's most profitable company out of business and 
  a friend of his into deep doo-doo any time soon.


  Remember: I've discussed all this with NSA, GCHQ and NATO's Technical 
  Directorate.  And a few other people besides.  No boasting, I promise.

Animals do not kill meaninglessly and aggressively. Within an animal
society, even dyads and trios, indivduals must conform to a social code
which obviously, however, differs from our social code. If you are saying
that we can not "contract" animals into conforming into our social code
you are right but it is silly to even suggest that. Actually, I think it
is outright wrong in the egocentric human sense to think that everyone and
thing should conform to self. Furthermore, animals only kill others for
food or defense. There are two and only two species that kill others of
the same kind in a ruthless manner. Ironically, they are very related
species, chimpanzees and humans (See Richard Wrangham's Demonic Males)

The basic idea has merit, I always thought the huge star ship Enterprise was  
dumb because there is no point in hauling millions of tons of matter around 
the galaxy when you can send the really important part, information, much 
easier. The seeds would be very small and if it's a Von Neumann self 
replicateor you'd only need to make one. Even if they moved no faster than
existing space probes (a very unlikely possibility) there would be several in 
every star system in the galaxy in just an instant of time, less than 
50 million years. I don't see any such probes in our galaxy and that's one 
reason I think ET's are unlikely.
 
However, before any of this happens we will have achieved immortality and  
mastered Nanotechnology, uploading and artificial intelligence, and it will 
be a radically different world. I don't think an organization to promote 
this idea could do much good, by the time it happens any ideas we have now on
the subject won't be of any use, it would be like Pikaia, the first animal 
with a spinal cord that lived 570 million years ago worrying about the year 
2000 computer bug.

Just read an article about a group at Cornell U. who created a nanoguitar 10
microns wide (length of an average cell) with 6 clearly distinguishable
strings each of which are 50 nanometers (10 atoms) wide.  Story was in the
Washington Post.  They just did it to illustrate the technology, I guess.
Anyway, it's exciting to live in a time when these kinds of advances are
being realized.  Please hurry!

Depends on what you classify as "meaningful," I'd say.

Anthropomorphizing a bit, aren't we?  The behaviors animals adopt towards
one another are genetically based and not at all memetic, which I'd say is
a prerequisite for any meaningful definition of a social code.  Why not try
Dawkins's _Selfish Gene_?

I don't think everything should conform to humanity.  Animals are not at
all human, nor would I expect them to be so.  My whole point is that
animals have no qualms over killing one another if it is in their own self
interest, and that they would continue to do so if we chose to respect
their utility.

(To this extent, animals are MORE ruthless than humans: at least some of
the humans think they're killing for a noble cause.  A dubious distinction,
but worth noting.)

What it boils down to is this:  by respecting animal rights, the animals
have everything to gain, and we have everything to lose.  Think about all
the goods which we use and work with which have been taken away from the
use of animals.  The cities we work in were once wilderness which housed
animals.  The food we eat is grown on farms which were once prairies.  The
highways have paved over buffalo trails.  The woodlands, the swamplands,
the open plains, even the deserts were first held by animals; to take from
them and theirs would be to deprive them of any meaningful sense of private
property.

And what do we have to gain by respecting such rights?  Nothing, unless you
gain a whole lot of utility from depriving yourself of almost all of the
technological advances mankind has ever wrought.  In this case, it seems
that we suffer from at best a zero sum game, if not a net utility LOSS for
respecting animal rights.

HUMANS get around this problem through contract and cooperation, but
animals cannot be contracted; it is silly to suggest that they could be.
Nor can they cooperate with humans in a way which respects the life,
liberty and property of others.  I will stand by this point until you can
find me an animal which understands and respects property rights.  (Not
urinating indoors does not count.)  And unless animals are prepared to
respect human rights, it seems morally dubious that humans should respect
animal rights.

>Furthermore, animals only kill others for
>food or defense.

I would not find it at all acceptable if you killed another human, even if
you ate them afterwards.  (In fact, especially not in that case.)  So why
exactly should we grant animals the same license?

>There are two and only two species that kill others of
>the same kind in a ruthless manner. Ironically, they are very related

Some humans are ruthless.  Some aren't.  Personally, I'm proud to be a
member of the human race, happy to be alive, and don't consider myself
"egocentric" for thinking so.  How about you?

Are you sure you're not confusing Linux with Windows NT? I've read of
many people who bought NT and then switched to Linux because NT was
unusable, but few who bought Linux and switched to Windows.

Anyway, there's an interesting report about NT and Unix at
http://www.gartner.com/public/static/datapro/industry/indnews6.html,
which claims that 14% of the corporations they surveyed used Linux;
that's hardly fringe.

Yeah, pet peeve. That and mailers that make a simple text message into

Universal Mailbox Converter that understands the stored email format

human brain, I doubt it's possible.

Radio spread spectrum uses a pseudorandom spreading function to hop from one
frequency to another. Both the transmitter and reciever are synchronized to
this sequence. In the case of the brain, all the signals are more or less on
the same 'carrier' frequency, but are spatially separated. 

A problem wiht decoding brain signals is that there is no assurance that
human brains have the same 'wiring' in anything but the grossest
comparisons. A pickup and transmitter that works for me would most likely
not work for you. If this hurdle can be passed, we should see rapid progress
in TRUE VR.

I dont have the article with me, but in the latest issue of Mondo 2000 there's
an article about lasers, and he also talks about technology to detect any
human being, like everyone has their own distinct frequencies, like
fingerprints, and its possible to detect these, even via satellite, and
perhaps through walls etc..

These are common myths and have been dispelled by animal
behaviorists. Many animals have been observed killing for reasons
other than food, defense, or territory including:

Numerous primates (man,chimp,baboon)

Members of the cat family (lions,tigers, etc)

Members of the Bear family

Members of the dog family (wolfs, coyotes, and worst of all feral
dogs)

killer whales (Orca Orcannis)(sp?)

snakes, especially members of the mamba.

These are just the ones I remember off the top of my head. In many
cases the observers concluded these animals killed solely to kill.

This of course does not mean all of the species, all of the time.

Yes, indeed. In fact, the old saying 'like a fox in a henhouse" would
apply here. If you go into a henhouse after a fox has been in there,
you will find all of the chickens dead and perhaps only one or two
eaten. The fox likes to kill and has it in his genes. I have seen a
panther catch a bunch of sheep in a pasture and break the necks of all
of them and eat only one.

People do idealize animals while often denigrating humans in many
ways. Chimps for example, our closest primate cousins. I have seen
videotape of chimps hunt down other monkeys and tear them apart and
eat them.
 
Another example of people idealizing animals is dogs: I find them to
be considerably less than human.Some years ago I worked as a  cable TV
repairman, who had to go into backyards where the homeowner was not
around. This often ocassioned confrontations with  territorial dogs. I
found something out: no dog will attack you if you are on guard and
facing them. Almost all territorial dogs will attack you when your
back is turned and you are moving away from them (e.g. climbing over
the fence to leave). Dogs are basically cowards, when it comes to
humans, anyway.

Sounds good, wanna go for it? Would probably require a lot of hacking as I
do not assume that the file formats are documented. (Actually, the most
tricky part is the indices, and I think all major packages are able to
rebuild them.)

I recently watched "Contact" (I'm probably the last to do so on this
list) and something's been annoying me ever since.  In the movie it is
claimed that 95% of the worlds population believe in a "Supreme Being"
and therefore anyone who doesn't believe in God shouldn't represent
Earth.  Now, forgive me if I'm wrong, but isn't Hinduism the most
'popular' religion?  Even if it's not, my point is that many religions
have more than one god, so I would presume that 95% of the worlds
population don't believe in a "Supreme Being" or "God" (which I take
to mean one Supreme Being, after all how many Supreme Beings can you
have?)  Added to this, it's a well know fact that religious groups
don't exactly appreciate each other's views.  Anyone advocating the
Christian God isn't likely to go down well with other religions that
make up the majority of that 95% (I'm certain 95% of the world aren't
Christians, despite what some of them would like to think).  So
clearly a religiously neutral candidate would have been the best choice.

Is it any different in the book?  And does anyone have figures on the
numbers that make up different religious beliefs, just in case I'm
ever a candidate for first contact and find myself in need of a good
defence?

I'm not sure they will suit you:

Bahism, 6.1 mio.
Buddhism, 323.9 mio.
Christianity, 1928 mio.
    - catholics 968 mio.
    - protestants 396 mio.
Hinduism, 780.5 mio.
Islam, 1099,6 mio.
Jewishness, 14.1 mio.
Confucianism, 5.3 mio
New religions (created after 1950 Hare Krishna, Transcendental Meditation),
121.3 mio.
Shintoism, 2.8 mio.
Sikhs, 19.2 mio.
Natural religions, 99.2 mio.

I also have EB online so if something is unclear I can lookup there, too. I

>So clearly a religiously neutral candidate would have been the best choice.

You cannot be "religously neutral", that's a contradiction in terms. Either
you say that you believe in the presence of supernatural power(s) or you say
you don't. There are a few who don't believe in God but are afraid that they
are hit by a lightning when they admit it. They are called agnostics ;-)
(Anders, I know that your definition of agnosticism is probably slightly
different :-). I wouldn't call them neutral either.

   IAN: Hinduism does have one supreme being, Brahman.
   It is said that all the other gods, such a Shiva, 
   Kali, Gahnesh, Uma... are but faces of the supreme
   being that is Brahman. Brahman has no form or personal 
   identity and is said to be "The Great Void -- in zero 
   mechanics, this it the zero-sum of all difference.

   Of course, Hinduism is an extremely complex system 
   of "sub-religions," each with it's own unique spin.

   The example of Buddhism and Taoism tend to fit with 
   your argument, but not in that they have many gods,
   but that their concept of a "supreme being" is very 
   difficult to define, and not dissimilar from Brahman
   in that the supreme is nonpersonal and void, or zero.
   I believe that zero mechanics maps out this "supreme
   being" and absolves the need for religious mystique
   and custom http://www.erols.com/igoddard/meta.htm 


>Added to this, it's a well know fact that religious groups
>don't exactly appreciate each other's views.  Anyone advocating the

   IAN: We've been brought up in a world where religion,
   almost as a rule, defines all others as bound for hell,
   as false religions, or even Satanic plots to deceive.
   Hindus and Buddhists are far more tolerant of other
   religions than we see in Christian tradition, which 
   is pretty much defined by the claim that all non-
   believers are bound for hell. Hinduism embraces
   Buddha as a great saint and even Jesus in many 
   cases. This may be a good strategy to keep the 
   folks at home, so to say. If your religion embraces
   all religions, it may also embrace all people, i.e.,
   have a large and profitable following. Why leave 
   Hinduism for Buddhism if Buddha is also a Hindu saint?

   Here's a good quote from The Oxford Companion to 
   Philosophy (page 355) that highlights the far-more-
   tolerant nature of eastern religious traditions: 

     "Unlike Christianity or Islam, Hinduism is a 
     nonproselytizing religion based on the Vedic 
     principle that 'Reality is one, but different 
     religious teachers speak of it differently'."

Isn't it amazing how these old myths prepetuate?  Only a city dweller,
isolated from the reality of wildlife...indeed ANY life not viewed thru a
television...could come up with such an idea...Yet it continues dispite
repeated disproof.

A sure cure for the above animal glorification....raise hogs for a while.

Interesting to note that there were no numbers for atheists and agnostics.

And don't forget the agnostics, who either say "we don't know" or "we
*cannot* know" when questioned about the supernaturals.

No, they are the theophobes... :-)

Hmm, a small idea that hit me: maybe Brahman is similar to Sasha's
"functional soups", a big storehouse of potentiality, power, skills,
knowledge and personality that locally coalesces into teleological
threads - the deities. They usually reside in the divine cyberspace,
but sometimes interface with the physical world through an incarnation
as an Avatar. Hmm, maybe one could concoct a form of cyberhinduism
this way :-)

The reason they can convert matter to energy but somehow find it
easier to transport the matter is because shows about networks of
self-replicating seeds don't exactly hold the fish-like attention span

Only on this, or possibly a palaeontology list, could 50 Million years
be referred to as "an instant of time."  It is kind of strange that we
don't see this kind of thing, personally I doubt the "going into VR
worlds" idea is likely.  I'm quite sure we wouldn't upload without
leaving a giant "We were here" sign.  Of course, the one possibility
that's commonly overlooked is that they have a reason for hiding. 
Maybe the Intergalactic Council has a policy against interstellar
eyesores.

There's always the possibility of sending other information through
the network (for telepresence, etc.)  BTW, does anyone know how
research into self-replicating robots is going?  I haven't heard
anything about this for a long-time.  And while I'm here asking
questions, what's the current timeframe for nanotech and/or
immortality, I remember Drexler had some figures for this (didn't he
say that anyone under 40 has a good chance of immortality in _Engines
of Creation_ back in the early 80's?)  I'm currently feeling very
sceptical about everything.

So my International Standards Committee for Quantum Probability

Well, they don't have a church and they are no religion, so it's very hard
to give numbers. Even estimations seem terribly difficult to do, as I, for
example, was an atheist since the age of 13 but have only left church at
16 -- many atheists may still be member of one or the other church.

>And don't forget the agnostics, who either say "we don't know" or "we

The problem is that if you don't have any information about something, it
does not exist. We don't have any information about supernaturals -- all
speculation is irrelevant & leads to nothing.

I agree with that, but that doesn't mean some technologies just
appears overnight. Just look at the history of the personal computer -
it was a quick evolution by many standards, but it still took several
years and involved a gradual refinement of the technological synergy
that made it possible.

You bet :-) My scenario is like this: in 2030, nanotechnology has
helped neuroscientists to understand neurons so well that they can be
simulated with high fidelity, and some research teams have managed to
"scan" the nervous system of trained C Elegans individuals into
computer models by hand. Some bright nanoengineer comes up with a good
disassembly process that can disasseble solid matter, recording its
structure with a high precision. There are already useful pattern
recognition software out there, and one just has to combine the
different processes to get uploading. Everybody in the neuroscanning
business realises it, and tries to make it work. It turns out to be
much trickier than it seems for a variety of reasons (like scaling up
the pattern recognition process to work on nanoscans and linking it to
the creation of a neuromodel, and the unexpected tendency for the
disassembler to gum up in the presence of myelin). But after a few
years, a mouse is uploaded, then a monkey and then a frozen cryonicist
who wrote in his testament that he volunteered for the process. The
first runs of him are less than satisfactory - it was never clear that
the fine-tuning of serotonine receptors had such a subtle effect on
the mental state, something the animal models never could have told
you - but in the end, the upload appears on CNN and is forced to
answer inane questions.

The whole process, from the time when all the pieces are there to the
upload, may take several years. It is fast, but not instantaneous. A
lot of people will be involved however remotely (neuroscientists,
nanotechnologists, image processing experts, computer scientists,
cryoengineers, virtual reality designers, psychologists, animal
breeders, biochemists, ethical comittees...), even if the original
"wow, we could do an upload!" idea was from a single brilliant
graduate student in Minsk.

You don't even have to search the code--just search the archives
of /this list/ to see that the Alien Quarantine code was repealed
years ago.  Of course, even if it /were/ still in effect, how
does that give any credibility at all to their existence?

(P.S. I removed the attributions here because I think they're
wrong--I know the man who is credited with the original comment,
and he has a brain, so I assume it wasn't really him).

Hmm... how does this account for the population of China?  Even if there
were no other Buddhists in the world, all the natural religions were
located in China(which I assume would be Taoism), and all Confucists were
located in China, this would still leave over 0.7 billion Chinese having no
religion-- has Christianity become the predominant religion in China, or is
there a large number of athiests?(maybe Maoists are under-reporting their
figures)  Do either of these options seem reasonable?  I really don't think
so.  If these figures *are* right, it seems that under 80% of the world's
population even has a religion, supreme being or not. (if I've done my math
right)  However, I don't think not belonging to an organized religion
implies that one does not believe in a supreme being, or vica versa.  So, I
would say the 95% figure is probably an overshot, and at the very least it
is not grounded with solid evidence.

Hinduism probably counts as one "Supreme Being" even though it's
clearly a different one from that of the Abrahamic religions;
we'll put Zoroastrians in that camp, too, and some Pagans as well.
But certainly Buddhists are more than 5% of the Earth's population,
along with many of the former Soviets, who, while they are no
longer "officially" all atheists, probably haven't all changed
overnight, either.  Add a smattering of secular humanists,
principled atheists, agnostics, Taoists, and others, and I'd
guess a number more like 10-15%.

It's PGML, and it's still pretty rough around the edges.  As is
support for XML/HTML mail (although there is at least a draft on
that topic to encourage some standardization).  Yes, it would be
nice to create a list specifically to experiment with extended-
content mail (not this one--the public list should use proven
standards), but I doubt the value of added content will outweigh
the immaturity of the standards for at least a year.

There is hope on the horizon--the Mozilla source release includes
its next-generation fully HTML4/CSS1-compliant extensible layout
engine, which will probably form the foundation of many free apps
in the not-so-distant future (it, too, unfortunately, is immature),
which will hasten standardization of extended formats.

This discussion of animal behavior makes me wonder just how anthropomorphic
our studies of animal behavior are. All the studies I have seen are opinions
of WHY the animal does what it does, and these opinions are of human origin...

This is the closest we are going to get to learning to communicate with an
alien species, until we actually get a first contact..at least the animals
share the same basic environment with us..

   IAN: Interesting ideas. Does Sasha have a page on this?
   I think that many central religious concepts are simply
   (usually poorly defined) expressions of real truths that
   are what they are independent of the religious contexts 
   we have come to associate them with. The tendency of the
   scientific community is the write off the whole set of
   religious ideology as "superstitious nonsense." But I 
   think to do that is a great mistake. Ancient religious 
   traditions are full of diamonds in the rough just waiting
   to be rediscovered polished off for a new generation.

   The principles of fuzzy logic are an example of this:
   what most saw as the epitome of mystical nonsense and 
   double talk, once carefully mapped, turned out to be
   not only logical, but opened the door to great advances
   in logic and its application to real-world problems.

   The process of redefining ancient wisdom has two effects:
   (1) it shows that the mystics weren't spouting pure non-
   sense, and in this way adds weight to the mystical tradi-
   tions, and yet it also (2) demystifies the mystical and 
   in this way sort-of pulls the rug out from under mystical
   traditions. A truth properly defined tends to lose its
   mystique, its power over us. What we cannot or have not 
   properly defined tends to belittle us, overwhelm us, 
   make us surrender to some "higher mystical power."

   There are some really weird UFO cults out there. They'd
   fall apart overnight if aliens were proven to be true
   and came to Earth and integrated into Earth societies.
   It's the mystery that fosters religious/magical thinking.
   Science is the process of demystifying the mystical when
   possible, not necessarily exclusively of disproving it.

   Even as I claim to have verified the mystical experience,
   I believe that the process of properly defining what those
   mystics were talking about is a process of dismantling 
   religion even as one shows that some of it was valid.

I wish to add further to this problem: the idea that you can have 
only one religion at a time, seems to be mostly confined to those 
religions that originated in the Middle East.  Given that, the total 
number of people following various religions, plus the total number 
of areligious people, ought to be larger than the total world 
population.

The final step in the technology will be one incredible idea/device 
connected to some previously-existing technology.  That 
previously-existing technology MIGHT not exist YET.  At least one of 
those technologies will be invented for some purpose not obviously 
related to uploading, and will exist for several years before anyone 
interested in uploading realizes its potential.  It is quite possible 
that the final step in creating the uploading technology will involve 
the assembly of five or six different pieces of technology, each one 
of which has been readily available for more than a year.

Maybe hyper-radio has some bandwidth limitations?  The transporter 
system can obviously work in both directions with a mechanism at only 
one end (I suspect that scanning a person for upload -- and 
disassembling him in the process -- while he's on land and your 
equipment is in orbit is rather a bit futher out than the basic 
scan/upload process), but it obviously has incredible bandwidth.

So then this figure was not in the book? ( I wouldn't know, I haven't read

hi

and they also kill within their own species, including the chimps, there was a
story about how some chimps (i think a mother and her son) would find and kill
the babies of other chimps (im not sure if they ate them or not).  And there
are also wars between groups of chimps.

I don't envy you the experience of being close enough to see that 
happen.  (What if the panther decides you're an oddly-shaped sheep?)

Add to the list of things "you don't see in animals" that you see in 
animals (not suggesting that they are all as abhorrent as those who 
proclaim "you don't see it in animals" wish us to believe -- but some 
are):

   adultery in monogamous species
   homosexuality
   prostitution
   infanticide
   use of intoxicating drugs

And you can find ALL of those without looking at the species that 
might be written off as "too closely related to man".  The first 
three, I know for certain are found in birds; the latter two, in 
cats.  And most likely in many other species as well.

They even occasionally hunt other chimps.  But usually it's 
orangutans, so they mostly evade a charge of cannibalism.  Many 
non-primate species of carnivore and omnivore won't hesitate to eat 
their own kind.

Sure. But assembling disparate technologies can be very easy
(computers and phones into internet telephony) or very hard (computers
and mechanics into robotics), it is nearly impossible to predict
which.

Does 'natural religion' include Wicca, etc.? Or are these considered 'new'
religions?

Just remember that the character in the movie was a religious fundamentalist
type, and some of these people sincerely believe that the world literally
revolves around their particular vision of God...They tend to be very bad
with statistics, too.

The book was quite a bit different. There was a team of travelers, no
terrorists, no second machine, and the group was sequestered after their
return for fear of what they would tell the world. I guess since Carl Sagan
was dead, they had greater 'artistic license'...

A supreme being is theoretically absolutely possible. We are striving to
become supreme beings ourselves, so it is possible that other beings have
already achieved this. The problem is only that so far we do not have any
information about any supreme beings. We can look for such information, but
while we do not have it, supreme beings do not exist for us. Period.

In the old joke, a boy asks in sunday school, "if god can do anything,
can he make a rock so big he can't lift it?"

Imagine what it would be like to be omnipotent.  Suppose you are running
uploaded into a virtual world which you own.  You have direct access
to the software which runs the world, including the software which runs
your own mind.  Using this access, you can do anything to the virtual
reality, alter the laws of nature, alter your own mentality.  You would
be omnipotent in that world.

Could you make a rock so big you couldn't lift it?

Suppose you set out to do so.  Given that you were running with a simulated
physical body with some limitations, you could cause the creation of a rock
which your body could not lift in its current configuration.  However,
you would then be able to alter your body so that it could lift the rock.

A different strategy is called for.  You must suppress your ability to
alter your body.  You create the large rock, and alter your own mentality
so that you will not be able to change your body to lift the rock, for
some period of time.  You might even change yourself so that you will not
*want* to change your body to lift the rock, even under dire circumstances.

In that way you might be able to lift the rock in some hypothetical sense,
but under the circumstances you are effectivelly prevented from doing so.
So it would appear that you can create a rock so big you can't lift it,
at least by some definition of the words, without impairing your
omnipotence.

Something similar seems to be done by the character of god in the jesus
story.  In this story, which may be familiar to some readers, god chooses
to experience earthly life.  He causes a woman to become pregnant, and
imbues her son, jesus, with god's own divinity.  In a sense, jesus *is*
god.  This divine power allows him to work various miracles over the course
of his life and he attracts a considerable following.

However, god's purpose (which is never made very clear in the story)
is apparently not merely to experience life on earth, but especially
to experience human suffering.  He arranges for jesus to be arrested,
tortured, and killed.  Jesus is shown as having something of a dual
nature.  He has access to the divine power of god, but in his last days he
refrains from or is unable to use his power.  He expresses understandable
fear about the torture which he knows he will experience, and which he
must withstand.

In the throes of hideous pain and near death, he cries out to god,
asking why god has abandoned him.  It seems that at this point, if he
were able to, he would use his power to save himself from the pain.
In appealing to god he is appealing both to the power within himself
and to that aspect of god which is outside of him.  However, there is
no apparent result, and presumably jesus/god has arranged to restrict
his own omnipotence as in the example above.

It is interesting how these old stories can shed light on some of the
problems and issues we will face as we become gods.

To further complicate the problem, I suspect that there are a number of
people who are atheist or agnostic but still claim an affiliation to a
particular religion out of fear of rejection by friends and family.

Hi Michael.  I think both Ian and Dan gave fine examples of this subject in
their 4/19 postings.

Inspiration comes from free association (spontaneous, logically
unconstrained and undirected association of ideas, emotions, and feelings),
brain storming, musing, day dreaming or pondering or reflections, for
example.

Nothing wrong with that, anthropomorphizing is a useful tool, of course like

Not true, if it were animals would be in no need of a brain. Most animals 
that were born in captivity can never be released into the wild because they 
don't have the education to survive. A songbird that has never heard another 
bird only develops a stilted much simplified version of the song 
characteristic of its species. The song of the Humpback Whale consists of
extremely elaborate variations on a simple theme, a Bach Fugue does the same 
thing and is no more complicated. The song changes from year to year,  
different tunes top the pop charts, and the difference is even greater from  
decade to decade, as great as the change in musical styles from Classical to 
Swing to Jazz to Rock.

Not so. It would be in the self interest of a bitch to kill her puppies, yet 
she does not do so.

They're the most dangerous sort, but regardless, do you have any evidence 
that animals think  differently in that regard?

Why not, seems an important point to me.

I've also noticed that when I walk my dogs on my (our) property and they meet 
a strange dog they're usually aggressive and the other dog submissive, but 
when we're far from my home the situation is reversed.

We don't. Sometimes humans engage in cannibalism but it's rare, the same is 
true of all mammals.

I don't have the book right here to refer to, but as I recall there was in
fact more than one nation attempting to build a machine and get "there"
first.  The coolest thing that was in the book that wasn't in the film was
near the end.  We were instructed to run out the value of pi (sp?...22 / 7 =
3.141........) out as far as we could.  As all of you recall, it is a
non-repeating decimal.  A program was designed to monitor the run for any
non-random deviations.  After pi was calculated out to millions or billions
of places a binary sequence of numbers suddenly started appearing (1's and
0's) creating a message.  The idea being that "God" had chosen to provide us
with irrefutable evidence of his existence by placing a message inside of a
geometric constant that any advanced civilization would discover.  That's
heavy.  To think that there's a message from a superior being hidden
somewhere in the fabric of the universe for those advanced enough to
discover it.  Too heavy for the film version, I guess.  Actually, I'm a bit
surprised to see this plot point given Sagan's book, The Demon Haunted
World.  How could he summarily reject superstitious nonsense and retain some
belief in a supernatural being that creates puzzles for us to solve?

One of the latest stories on the news is about the Hubble's discovery of a
group of planets forming around a star and how this will affect our
expectations that extraterrestrials exist.  I, personally, have sided with
Robin Hanson and have grave doubts that there anyone else is out there.
There may, in fact, be no one to contact.  It may well be us who are
eventually "contacted" by others.  If we make it.

Actually, there is some evidence that he suffered from Meniere's
Disease--an inner ear disease that causes sudden "drop attacks" of
severe vertigo complete with vomiting and sweats (which at the time
were thought to be epileptic seizures), along with some hearing
loss, tinnitus (Van Gogh described "screaming"--it's not clear
whether he heard voices or just ringing) and balance problems.
There are certainly times I might have cut my ear off if I could
have stopped the constant noise.

The disease most of the time goes away (mine has been in
remission for a while now), but in those few cases where it
progresses, it can become very disabling, and lead even a normal
healthy mind to have problems coping.

If he had had access to the tests and drugs I've had, he might
have been a perfectly ordinary fellow like me--only a more
talented artist.

Dear all,

Here in the Netherlands they are starting with 
a national database of all the people in Holland, in
which they record what you would like to be done
with your organs should you die. We all have to fill
in a form and express our wish. Up on our death the
doctors will immediately contact this database and ask
for the wish. 

Since "we" sign up for Cryonics it is not wise to express
the wish, that we would like to donate our organs.
Also on this form there is no room to put in writing what
wish you may have (a missed opportunity IMHO).

However, there is the option to give an other person the
right to choose for you. So, I could appoint a member of
Transcedo to make sure that they don't use my organs.

The beauty of this is, that he/she will be contacted ASAP.

Second: they will keep me "alive" until the decision is made,
this could be very valuable I think.......

Please share your opinion. Is it a good thing to use this 
option? or do we risk a lot of damage by the "waiting"
period. Is anyone a doctor, and does he/she knows what
the procedure is with donations.

THANKS !! :)

Believe it or not I only recently saw the movie too.

Yes Hinduism is the largest active religion.  This is because Buddhism is
not allowed in China and no longer practiced much in Japan.  However,
Hinduism has a metaphysical component (sort 0f like the Trinity idea) in
which all of the Hindu pantheon of gods are aspects or manifestations of one
deity called Brahman which includes Brahma (spelled similar huh?), Shiva,
and Vishnu as well as all the other avatars and incarnations that are in the
pantheon.  Interestingly, Buddhism at least in the old school called
Theravada does not believe in any gods at all but anicca or "nothingness".

Something like 95% believe in a religion of some sort but that includes
animism, shamanism, pantheism and other types of theological positions that
are not monotheism.  Therefore, that comment is not accurate at least in
what it was implying.

Also, in the movie the extraterrestrial creature from Vega himself never
said that he was any deity nor was he her father.  He said that his
appearance was because "we thought it would be easier for you" thus the
experience was not of Heaven.

I agree a religiously neutral person would be more objective.

I think most agnostics would object to the above definition. Agnosticism
is centered around the idea the question of whether God exists or not is
not provable (whether through limitations of the human mind or whatever).

My own idea is that the question of God is a nonsensical question created
by a meme. We're infected by the virus and thus feel compelled to address
the question. Brodie's "Virus of the Mind" does a wonderful job of outlining
how completely useless questions arise from memes.

As for Contact, the 95% figure was probably accurate in that such a figure is
probably accurate for the percentage of people that believe in some form of
supernatural something. Whether that means such a person should embark on the
first representative is another issue. By selecting arbitrary criteria you disqualify
virtually anyone from being the first representative. The obvious choices would be
military-trained individuals (similar to the Gemini and Apollo astronauts) who could
deal with the variety of unknowns and psychological stress that such an encounter would
probably entail. However, what percentage of the world populace is military-hardened
to such a pristine degree?

I agree with the idea, as I would guess most people on the list would, that the first
representative should be a scientist (perhaps even a mathematician) since that would
be the common language we might share. Additionally, a scientifically trained mind
would be able to adapt, process and toleratethe "strangeness" of the aliens much easier
than a Southern Baptist minister from Augusta, Georgia.

My scenario is like this: in 1997 (?), a group of researchers become
interested in creating a realistic model of C. Elegans, including data 
from cryosections, immunostaining, voltage-sensitive dyes, mutant data,
morphogenesis, cytoskeleton simulators, soon to become available total 
sequence data, etc. They initiated the 'Cyberworm' project. Somewhen
between now and 2030 they succeeded. Of course the Aplysia emulator
crew gave them a head race ;)

We have such proceses. The nematode is so small you can flash-vitrify
it, and use e.g. progressive vacuum sublimation of water glass whilst
imaging the surface with an AFM and/or immunolabeled-cell SNOM or
plain transmission EM. A complementary etch could be UV laser
photodissociation, or a very thin plasma/ion beam etch.

Yes, after DSP filtering the voxelset you can apply contrast
enhancement, outline tracing, segmentation, whatever. Neural and GA
DSP should make this relatively easy.

What really bugs me that we have a very good outline of the process
already. The rest is just a lot of drudgery, and some serious money,
and perhaps a few advances in the SPM/EM/Xray microcopy,
high-performance computing areas, high-density memories, video DSP 
algorithms, etc. Don't get me wrong, immense work still has to be
done, but it is not Science Fiction anymore while the mainstream still 
thinks it is.

Indeed, most people are fools. I'd like to see a 
socio-ethnic breakdown for the 5% by the way, does anyone

Obviously the first person to go should be transhumanistic

At the risk of sounding like a pro-ET freak, I'd like to say that there are
a lot of opinions out there that continue to perpetuate the 'face on mars'
is real and only proves the existence of martian intelligence. How much
have you really researched this topic? or are you taking the photos at face
value??

Doesn't surprise me a bit, It never, ever dies. This sort of thing is based  
on emotion not evidence, so counter evidence has no effect on the believer. 
Take the shroud of Jesus crap for example, after carbon 14 proved it was at  
least 800 years too young the believers were quiet for a while but now they're 
back. 

Actually I think the face is a portrait of almost photographic realism, it's 
just that Martians had a face that looked like a badly eroded hill.

It was only a joke.  That's what the ":-)" smiley was for.  I don't
really believe the face looked like a face.  I believe the new photos
show the same topology in greater detail.

I don't claim that dogs are completely different, but rather sufficiently
different that we should not respect "animal rights."  And by this I don't
mean that we shouldn't take care of animals, love them, respect their
space, etc., but rather that we should only do so when we gain utility from
it.

I agree with much of this, and retract my point about animals following a
social code.  However, it is still worth noting that many animals often do
not respect the rights of other animals or humans, and that it would be
practically impossible to teach them to do so, barring some intelligence
enhancing technology which, to the best of my knowledge, we do not wield.

>Not so. It would be in the self interest of a bitch to kill her puppies, yet 
>she does not do so.

I disagree.  A rational bitch will nurture her puppies if she gains a lot
of utility from it, as I believe she does; this is not contrary to her
self-interest.  And while I also believe that dogs would benefit greatly
from agreeing to respect the rights of humans, I don't think that dogs are
capable of making that kind of agreement.

You're right.  I should have said that not urinating indoors is
INSUFFICIENT; that urinating outside is not sufficient to show an
understanding or a respect of property rights.  I grant that it is a step
in the right direction, but nowhere near the point where I could reasonably
say that dogs respect human rights.

>I've also noticed that when I walk my dogs on my (our) property and they
meet 
>a strange dog they're usually aggressive and the other dog submissive, but

This is true.  Dogs do have a sense of territory.  However, this is again
not sufficient to show an understanding of property rights.

Actually, it was not the cannibalism which I was reacting to, but rather
the implicit assertion that some animals are justified in their killing,
because they "only kill others for food and self defense," (Russakoff) and
that there is or should be a system of universal rights for all living
things.  If we accept this, then we conclude that killing is morally
acceptable if we eat our kill.  Since this moral theory results in an
absurd conclusion, I reject the argument.

My point is this:  if animals will not respect the "right" of other animals
not to be killed and eaten, then we have nothing to gain and much to lose
from respecting this special right of animals not to be killed and/or eaten
by people.  In light of this, it does not make sense from a utilitarian
perspective to respect animal rights.  In contrast, it does make sense for
humans to respect human rights, because (if done under voluntary contract)
it ensures that others will respect ones own rights.

A few years ago I had an idea for my very own work of art which I have
yet to act on.  Commonly the value of art is directly associated with
its rarity.  So I propose (assuming I'm not too late) a kind of
"Network Art" which increases in value when it increases in ubiquity
(like all good networks).  I propose this as a sort of play on the
popular definition of what makes art "valuable" and a homage to the
network age.

The problem comes with putting this idea into practise.  It would be
easy to network over the Internet and/or running it on a computer, but
I would rather it retain some ties with "traditional" works of art. 
Even then it would have to work on the principle of some sort of value
adding interaction between each artwork, which is hard to implement. 
(Although not impossible, and with it's own hardware and wireless
communications this method could work).

A simpler solution would be some sort of fractal that increases in
complexity with each new print, but I'm not sure that this constitutes
what I'm aiming for.  Perhaps an algorithm to make each new artwork an
amalgamation of its ancestors would be coherent with the idea.  But
I'm still not sure what "increased value" this would bring.

Possibly the most ambitious idea I've had to date are artworks that
distribute some property from their location to their copies.  Perhaps
the resulting artwork could be an amalgamation of video and/or audio
input from all the places that copies are located.  Or even more
ambitious could be the use of the physical senses, maybe a robotic
statue with "arms" that can be moved.  These could be put in various
locations around the globe but directly linked, so that when a person
in France moves the "arm" in one direction she feels the force of a
person in Australia pushing the "arm" in the opposite direction. 
However, I'd really like to make something far cheaper that could take
pride of place in anyone's home.

Has this sort of thing been tried before?  Does anyone have any other
ideas of how to do this?

You're right, we almost never do; but some people (such as animal rights
activists) think that we should out of moral obligation, and to that end
pass laws which restrict the utility of others.  This, I argue, is a bad idea.

Speaking of "animal rights" lumps all animals together, but in fact there
are many differences among animals.  Not all animals eat others, for
example.

It also suggests that there are only two cases, animals with full human
rights and animals with none.  Actually it would make more sense to
propose that animals should have some rights.  Most states protect
animals against cruelty, for example, while still allowing them to be
humanely killed.

Some humans, such as children and the mentally disabled, don't respect
property rights and are not able to commit to contracts, but we do accord
them limited rights.  So this ability in itself does not seem to be the
basis on which we draw the line.

But even those who think that we should pass animal right laws out of moral
obligation usually think they gain a utility from doing that. Getting closer
to god, better Karma or just a good conscience.

The question is only where you draw the line. I would say animal rights must
be respected where the ability to store and process information is
significant. Apes and dolphins are good examples. But if you want animal
rights for dogs, why shouldn't you want rights for insects as well? Just
because they're harder to see?

Someone forwarded my earlier comments about Gary North and the Y2K problem
to North, and he took issue with my interpretation of his theology.
Some of the information below comes from an anti-North site,
http://www.serve.com/thibodep/cr/y2k.htm, some from an anti-Y2K-hype
site, http://www.erols.com/steve451/doom.htm, and some from my own
research.  Many of North's books are online at http://www.freebooks.com/
if you want to learn more about his religious views.

I am not very knowledgeable about the theology of the religious right,
including the Christian Reconstruction movement, of which North is a
founder.  However it is clear that North has been a survivalist since
the 1960s.  From http://www.serve.com/thibodep/cr/jan.txt

It's hard to say to what extent his survivalism is based on his
theological views versus more secular concerns.  But here is an
excerpt below from the 1980s in which he lays out his fears of
impending doom due to banking and financial problems, all wrapped up
in religious language:

This was long before North became involved with the Y2K problem.  He
is predicting doom based on the financial problems of the 1980s, as
did many survivalists in those days.

One interesting point is that North does not see the impending
destruction as a totally negative thing.  He sees the opportunity for
a "Christian reconstruction" after the disaster.

Now North has fastened onto the Y2K problem as the latest
justification for his doomsaying.  And even though he thinks it will
lead to a complete collapse of civilization, the end of the world as
we know it, he still thinks it's a good thing:

Based on this information, I continue to believe that North sees the
Y2K problem in religious terms, as an opportunity to wipe the slate clean
and rebuild a society founded on Christian principles.  If this is true,
it is in his interest to fan the flames of the Y2K crisis, and to work
to bring about the collapse he is predicting.

Use the links above if you want to learn more about North, both from his
own writings and from his critics.  His site, www.garynorth.com, is a
useful source of information, but use your judgement as to whether it is
presenting a complete or unbiased picture.

True, but I nonetheless argue that almost none respect human rights in any

What about Moeller's bug example?  What makes it okay to, say, poison ants?

As I've already said, we SHOULD afford them rights if we gain utility from
doing so.  I would say that this is definitely true in the case of
children, and is usually true for the developmentally disabled.  Much of
their care is performed by voluntary legal guardians and/or non-profit
organizations; although there is a lot of government money going to asylums
and other such systems, much of this could be covered privately (and
covered better) if we weren't paying for it with taxes.

I'm not sure what you mean by "the ability to store and process
information."  Where would you say the threshold lies, and what would we be
looking for?  Memory?  Problem solving?  Intra-species communication?

Don't ever apologize for your opinions or your honest observations.
If your opinion steps on some toes, then they deserved to be stepped
on.  I am precisely the militant atheist you described: I believe
strongly that anyone who spends more than 10 seconds even entertaining
the idea of God without dismissing it as groundless speculation is at
best in need of education in reason, at worst dishonest with himself.

A libertarian perspective on the governmental assault on Microsoft.  
http://www.moral-defense.org

Excerpt:

The alleged purpose of the Antitrust laws was to protect competition; that
purpose was based on the socialistic fallacy that a free, unregulated market
will inevitably lead to the establishment of coercive monopolies. But, in
fact, no coercive monopoly has ever been or ever can be established by means
of free trade on a free market. Every coercive monopoly was created by
government intervention into the economy: by special privileges, such as
franchises or subsidies, which closed the entry of competitors into a given
field, by legislative action. (For a full demonstration of this fact, I
refer you to the works of the best economists.) The Antitrust laws were the
classic example of a moral inversion prevalent in the history: an example of
the victims, the businessmen, taking the blame for the evils caused by
government, and the government using its own guilt as a justification for
acquiring wider powers, on the pretext of "correcting" the evils.

Indeed, atheism is (often) more than just saying "it's extremely
unlikely that god exists", but also "it is not _desirable_ that god
exists". It's about understanding that, certainly for a transhumanist,
the existence of god is _not_ "neutral", but very, VERY bad. All our
efforts would be futile. After all, don't we want to become gods
ourselves? No such luck if the job has already been taken...(remember:
if god existed he would _not_ be "nice", just look at this deathist
planet and universe. Being omnipotent = being responsible for all that
happens.

And I shall continue as a quite vocal atheist until someone can present 
sufficient evidence of god's existence and/or that this would not be a
disaster for humanity and transhumanists in particular.

Is real omnipotence actually possible? With reference to which environment?
How can you know that there are no other physical environments than those
you can create and dwell in? Certainly, entities can become so powerful that
they would *seem* omnipotent to us. Just like horsemen could seem like
halfgods to people who have never seen horses or cars. But real omnipotence?
I cannot think of a single point of existence when it would be reached.

> Is real omnipotence actually possible? 

I don't think so. Immortality seems possible, but omnipotence requires
being able to cause anything. Conflicts with other omnipotent beings would
indubitably occur, and then what would happen? Also, the nature of
"quantum causality" seems as if it would prevent omnipotence.

Recently the list saw an impassioned attack on abortion by Reilly Jones,
who construed this procedure as equivalent to murder and thought it
revealed a profound moral decay in those who supported its ready
availability.  An interesting treatment of new genetic issues by Lee Silver
throws light on this topic.  I don't have time right now to go into detail,
but I believe Silver's survey shows that Reilly's views are untenable *just
on the facts* (and leaving `souls' out of the discussion).  For what it's
worth as a teaser, I'll append below the text of a pop science review I've
just done on Silver's book.  Mild warning: I've adopted a kind of
spoon-feeding approach that feigns a measure of ignorance of the topic,
because that seems to work best when introducing hard topics to a mass
newspaper audience.

==============================

Remaking Eden: Cloning and Beyond in a Brave New World
By Lee M. Silver, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 315 pages, $39.95


I thought I knew about the birds and bees, but Lee Silver, molecular
biology professor at Princeton, taught me otherwise.  It turns out my
mother didn't have just one brother, my uncle, but several other siblings
just as close - because her father was a clone.

I've been vaguely aware of this since childhood, when I first met
grandfather Chris's identical twin brother.  I'd never heard of Dan, who
lived interstate, until the creepy day I greeted a familiar, beloved man
who didn't know me.  Laughter from the adults - but I howled at this
uncanny duplication.

Maybe just such unease is what makes people nervous, even revolted, by the
prospect of human cloning and other disturbing feats of what Silver dubs
`reprogenetics'.  When identity itself is up for grabs, what's to hold onto
in an uncertain world?  

Such anxieties fuel the persistent anger and alarm in the abortion debate.
Does human personhood begin when parental DNA strands fuse into a unique
living being?  Or is an embryo, or even a two-trimester foetus, not yet
sufficiently complex or aware to be deemed a person?  In light of genetic
profiling, bio-engineering, and now cloning (very soon, surely, of humans
as well as other mammals), can science help us unpick these ethical issues?  

Yes and no.  Our received values often derive from the best available
scientific opinion - of the fourth century BC.  Is abortion murder?
Adapting Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas taught that the male embryo only becomes
a human being at six weeks, when God infuses a soul into the developing
flesh.  Females have to wait until 13 weeks.  

More recent Christian theologians update their science to about the middle
of this century.  Human life, many hold, starts precisely at conception (a
distressing opinion, given that at least 75 percent of all pregnancies
abort spontaneously without benefit of baptism).  Silver, drawing upon
molecular biology and IVF evidence, shows this can't be correct.  Indeed,
an embryo doesn't even blend its parents' DNA until the two-cell stage, on
the second day.  Even then, each cell in the replicating ball of tissue is
identical until the fourth cycle of doubling.  Then the 16-cell clump
splits into a core that will specialise into a baby and an outer shell
growing into a disposable placenta.

This developing tissue with its unique DNA pattern usually goes astray in
various ways, most of them lethal.  Sometimes it splits, yielding twins or
quins - natural clones.  Hence, the children of Chris and Dan shared
exactly the same paternal inheritance: not cousins, but genetic brothers
and sisters with different mothers.  

Twenty years ago, Dr Sherman Silber transplanted a testicle from Terry
Twomey into his sterile identical twin, Tim, afflicted with a rare
developmental disorder.  Weird hi-tech incest?  Tim and Jannie's child
can't be distinguished genetically from any that Tim might have fathered if
he'd been born whole.  Yet Tim's son is also plainly the brother of Terry's
three kids. 

Modern reprogenetics multiplies such conundrums dizzyingly.  What's a
father and mother, and who's their child?  An unethical scientist might
take 10 very early embryos prepared for 10 random IVF couples, and tease
apart the eight cells of each.  Implanted into surrogate mothers, each of
the 80 cells could now grow into a healthy baby.  We'd end up with 10 sets
of octuplets.

Go back a step.  While the 80 cells are segregated, pick one cell from each
of the ten Petri dishes and fuse them together into 10 entirely new
eight-cell mosaic embryos.  This is not fantasy - using mice and other
mammals, it's common lab procedure.  Now you might have 10 babies born,
each with numerous parents.  

Here's the puzzle for theologians - if each original embryo has its soul
divinely infused at conception, how are the souls reassigned when the cells
get randomly recombined?  This is not a blasphemous thought-experiment -
every year, natural errors cause twin eggs to merge into mosaic
individuals, or chimeras.  Usually they grow up without special problems,
though some intersex chimeras (boy and girl twins fused into one
individuals) have ambiguous genitalia.  Do they have a double helping of
souls?  How do such facts bias our moral evaluation of abortion?

These are just the simplest starting points in Silver's astonishing,
elaborate examination of next century's molecular revolution.  He helps us
think through the facts and ethics of many wilder possibilities - children
for gay couples sharing the heritage of both, detailed genetic scanning
allowing parents to learn broadly how any given embryo would develop, so
they might launch the life of one potential infant instead of another.  

Eugenics?  Perhaps - but not, Silver argues, as stigmatised by association
with Nazism and other abominations.  Yet the outcome might be a swelling
genetic apartheid of rich and poor - enhanced GenRich with extended
longevity and other gifts, resolute or desperate Naturals.  Silver blithely
embraces this fate as the fruit of the American dream of consumer
capitalism.  

I don't expect this split to happen, actually, since other technologies
like intelligent computers and molecular manufacturing - necessary anyway
to foster advanced reprogenetics - will spread these options cheaply to
everyone who chooses them.  It's likely, though, that humanity will
speciate explosively - branching into something old, something wonderfully
new, something borrowed and, by today's standards, something bleugh.

Bill Calvin's new book (with Derek Bickerton), *Lingua ex machina*, tries
to solve the evolution of language:

============

... it has been difficult to identify nonlanguage predecessors of
structured language.     Most books on language evolution seem to dissolve
into a series of vague generalities when it comes to deal with specific
issues, such as how language acquired its universal characteristics, or
what novel processes in the brain made language possible. The linguists
haven't known the relevant neurology or evolutionary theory, and the brain
researchers haven't known enough linguistics to realize what features
required a detailed explanation. And there is, in addition, the requirement
of continuity: How do your proposed mechanisms create an easy series of
improvements or conversions of function, stages that span the whole
distance, starting with chimpanzeelike utterances, working up to words and
protolanguage, and finally to the phrases and clauses that enable you to
say "I think I saw him leave to go home" with its nested embedding?

     We do it here with about two-and-a-half preadaptations, yielding both
argument structure and phrase structure or, if you prefer, the newer
minimalist grammar. The coin in which these improvements were purchased was
that of reciprocal altruism, cognitive categories handy for detecting
cheaters, and of ballistic movement planning, handy for toolmaking and
hunting.

Maybe true omnipotence *can* be achieved if only one Power remains (it
has either killed or absorbed the competition). Given infinite time it
may learn to control everything that exists simultaneously, down to the
smallest particle. It has then effectively *become* the universe.
Unlikely but not impossible.

Another characteristic of the Judeo-Christian god is that he (yes, of
course he's caucasian male ;-) has *always* existed (and will always
exist). Could this be done? Maybe, if time travel somehow were possible,
one could send copies back "indefinitely", effectively establishing
"presence without beginning or end"?

Actually, this might not be clear. The ethics of creation is tricky.

If I start a huge game of life simulation, I cannot predict exactly
what will happen and while I am omnipotent from the perspective of the
simulation (I can change any state at any point in the run) I would
have a hard time determining the eventual outcome unless it was very
simple and obvious. I expect the same for other creators (be they
omnipotent entities, posthumans playing with planet-sized cellular
automata machines or myself at my workstation); they cannot be held
responsible for the individual events in their creations, although
they are responsible for the creation as a whole. It might be
impossible to prevent nasty (from the perspective of inhabitants)
events without constantly intervening and wrecking the autonomy
of the created world. 

Isn't it fun that we are soon going to face theodicy problems
ourselves? :-)

A fascinating idea. What about running it as a distributed
evolutionary system where each node allows users to breed new
artworks, which then diffuse to appear at other nodes or become part
of the art produced there? The more people who used the system the
more diversity and computer power there would be. One could even have
slightly different nodes, some where one creates 3D objects a la
Latham and some that produce 2D art (which can be used as textures for
the 3D stuff) and so on.

Yes, that would be delightful. One possibility is that some of the
"nodes" are installations with (say) cameras so that people standing
in front of them become part of the input to the evolution of 2D
pictures elsewhere.

I like your idea, it would be a wonderful way of expressing our values
and ideas!

That is one of the views I have held for quite a long time. The Christian
Old Testament god is a particularly nasty critter..if this is the way things
actually run, I will be quite happy to take my rightful place in Hell.

However, I don't think the universe is 'deathist'. Life is just localized
reversal of entropy. As such, it appears the universe is out to get
us...Actually, for the universe to be 'deathist' would presuppose some sort
of controlling organization that cared one way or the other, would it not?

If there are gods or a God, I have a hard time seeing any reason why this
being would have any particular interest in the goings-on of Terrans or any
other lifeform, except as far as these beings could evolve to a level
capable of providing stimulating conversation or competition...

Good point. I have this bad habit of attempting to be 'polite'. Must be
early conditioning.

I believe that if you out of hand eliminate a possibility because of no
PRESENT evidence, you may miss healthy speculation that may uncover the same
evidence you seek. Many great discoveries were made by people saying 'what
if', often in direct opposition to what was well known at the time.

The particular species of atheist I meant seems to have a mindset similar to
the fundamentalist who will never change his/her beliefs regardless of
evidence to the contrary. When presented with such facts, they invoke God's
(Ungod's?) help to resist temptation..

I have to agree about those who unconditionally accept what others tell
them, never looking to find out for themselves the basis for these beliefs.
Especially those who 'interpret' writings such as the Bible to support their
own personal agendas. Pick your own examples from the myriad available.
These people have caused more human misery than any other single cause I can
name. 

The fact that the US Government has various referneces to 'God' in our
documents, in a society where religious freedom is supposed to be a basic
right, is hard to understand. It just gives fuel to the individuals
mentioned earlier, and their followers.

Most religions I have had personal contact with seem to put a premium on
'suspension of disbelief' as a critical part of the ceremony. Perhaps
humanity has an inborn need to disbelieve that we are actually all alone,
and responsible only for our own behavior and the resluts of it?

Omnipotence is knowing everything, even everything you don't or can't know.
And we can go on in this vein for years...

Thank you very much, Til, for this piece of advice. Amazon sells the 
second edition, co-authored with Charles van Doren. My copy arrived a few 
days ago, and I have found it to so extraordinarily useful in that short 
time that I'd like to add my own praise.

As an example of the benfits, I gave A. G. Cairns-Smith's book, "Seven 
Clues to the Origin of Life", what Adler terms an "inspectional" reading 
last night. I got a great deal out of a 40-50 thousand book in only 25 
minutes. Most importantly, I understood that I wish to go back and give 
the book a much deeper, "syntoptic" read. When I do give the book the 
syntoptic read it deserves, my level of reading will be much deeper and 
more engaged than it would have otherwise been.

I truly had no idea how much there was to learn about reading until I 
started reading this book. Obviously, I'm having a ball with it, and can 
only imagine that all but the very best of readers would find a wealth of 
new information in the book. The only "drawback" of the book I've found 
so far is that my mind comes  so alive while making use of the book that 
sleeping becomes very difficult. That's a difficulty I'm happy to live with.

Cheers,

Michael Nielsen

Why just one? I assume the energy needed for interstellar
communication would be relatively manageable if it is properly
collimated (no need for Forward's wonderful megascale lasers needed
for fast interstellar solar sailing), so even if there are scale
factors making it economic to have large transmittors there is likely
no reason to have just one. The same goes for receivers.

Charlie Stross has a StarNet-like network in his novel Scratch Monkey,
where some of these issues are discussed. I recommend it, even if I am
doubtful about some of his solutions (which on the other hand makes
the novel more interesting).

I have started writing up a nanotech seed for this purpose, I have a
(not very finished or well planned) draft at
http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Hx/seed

My idea is to use a laser-driven solar sail to propel it, with perhaps
a magsail to brake and a small solar sail for traveling
in-system. Asteroids are seeded with nanomachines that build a
receiver, which then recieves further instructions. My guess is that
the whole seed would be fairly small, likely less than one meter or so
(possibly much smaller).

Maybe we could develop the draft together, hopefully with useful input
from the list?

Why not every system? There are likely asteroids everywhere, and extra
capacity is likely a good idea.

My communications technology knowledge is limited, but I would guess
we want short wavelengths for maximum bandwidth (drawback: requires
more energy to send than long wavelengths). Lasers sound fine to me.

Rough estimate: 10^11 neurons, 10^4 synapses each, five bytes per
synapse (where it is connected, synaptic strength) = 5*10^15 bytes. If
you want to scan the whole body, you will need *huge* amounts of
bandwidth (remember, one mol is 10^23 atoms...).

I think the Internet model works fine: make it easy to connect, you
only pay for your node in the network which both gives you access and
acts as a part others can use.

Note that if you use reproducing probes, you only need to pay for the
original probe, and then it will expand on its own giving a huge
return of investment. A good start might be an interplanetary net.

Protocol trouble, but hopefully the SNETF (StarNet Engineering Task

need to be given good emergency programming.

Look at the net: an overloaded router tells the other routers that it
is busy, and they route signals elsewhere. If travel is done by
sending a copy of the traveller to the destination, keeping one copy
inactive, and then waiting for a receipt (if received, delete the
inactive copy, otherwise awaken it and tell it "sorry, access
denied"), there is no big problem with occasional blocks. 

Stross has an interesting scenario in Scratch Monkey where some
desperate people flee just by broadcasting themselves in the same
direction, hoping they will be picked up.

Error correction (= redundancy) is important. Encryption is best left
to the application layer, although it might be a good idea if the
nodes in the network use some autentification software. Sounds like
conventional internetworking problems.

> Does it makes sense to form an official organization at this

I'm torn between "no" and "maybe". It would be interesting to think
about the project, but it is still rather far in the future and the
form of StarNet will be highly dependent on unknown future
developments in information technology, nanotech and AI. I suggest the
idea is developed further, and StarNet is designed to be an initial
proposal others can refine. Then, in a few decades, it might be time
to form the real organization.

BTW, are there any standards yet for domain names in space?

There is a 'pyramid' image on the Web somewhere, I think it's on Hoagland's
site (I thought I bookmarked it but obviously didn't). Oddly, it looks a 
lot like a bunch of rocks.

You know, when I predicted this face denial a few weeks ago I really didn't
expect it would be as widespread as it seems to be. These people are really

Structuring your worldview solely to satisfy your ideology strikes me as a
dangerous project.  Gods may or may not exist at present.  Most understandings
of theology make the question utterly unresolvable in a theoretic sense (thus
encouraging principled agnostism).   Practically speaking, of course, sensible
people find it useful to assume that gods do *not* exist, and to act like
atheists in a day-to-day sense.  But none of that justifies embracing
*theoretical* atheism from fear of the anomie that could follow facing
possible truths.  Better, I think, to cut the bluff and learn to live with
limited facts.

I take it that an atheist in fact asserts that gods do not and cannot exist--a
claim that cries out for positive proof.  But, again, most understandings of
theology deny that scientific methods will suffice to resolve the question of
god's existence.  Scientists typically agree that they have little to add to
theological disputes.  Defending atheism thus take more than mere rejection of
theism; it calls for the sort of proof that, ex hypothesis, cannot obtain.

I used to think myself an atheist--until I decided that even denying the
existence of gods gives too much credit to theology.  I now cheerfully admit
ignorance about whether gods exist . . . though that does not prevent me from
theorizing about what I might make possible.

I like to think that personal responsibility is what holds us together, not
what keeps us apart.  It is, at least in part, personal responsibility that
makes love possible.  Atheism is not solitude.

Hmm, I'm too uninformed to know what's going on over there at JPL/NASA, but it
seems like an odd omission since the piramyds appear to offer the most likey
proof in terms of geometric evidence.

I guess only time will tell.

If people keep bugging them, perhaps they'll spend more money and time
diverting the probe..

What is the purpose of these celestial probes if not to search for life
elsewhere?

I guess planetary studies are more complex than that. There's plenty to know
about rocks and alien weather.

I was browsing through the abstracts for the second
conference of the Association for the Scientific
Study of Consciousness (ASSC) to be held from June
19-22, 1998, in Bremen, Germany, on "Neural
Correlates Of Consciousness: Empirical And Conceptual
Issues", see
http://www.phil.vt.edu/assc/Bremen/bremenabstracts.html
, and found the following article on a interesting
psychotropic substance that I, being the 'aging
home-body' that I am, had never heard of:
=================
MICHAEL SCHLICHTING, European College for the Study
of Consoiousness (ECSC) Gttingen 
"Consciousness Research Using Hallucinogenic Drugs.
Psychotropic Effects of the Phenethylamine DMMPEA"

[CUT] In a non-comparative human study the
psychoactive properties of DMMPEA
(2,5-Dimethoxy-4-Methyl-Phenethylamine) were
evaluated in 18 subjects.  In this paper the
experimental design of the study und the results are
presented and discussed in view of the implications
for consciousness research. 

The specific Altered State of Consciousness (ASC)
produced by hallucinogenic drugs like DMMPEA is
characterized by an increase of body awareness and
receptiveness of inner stimuli, activation of
individual affective patterns, eyes-closed imagery
and dream-like subconscious material. The
consciousness remains clear and enables the subject
to observe, to control und to communicate the
intrapsychic changes. Embedded in an anxiety reducing
psychotherapeutic setting no true hallucinetions,
delusions nor psychotic reactions are observed.   All
subjects recovered completely within few hours and
showed no adverse reactions or unwanted after
effects. Psychometric tests and clinical evidence
revealed an improvement in emotional insight,
self-esteem and ego-strength. 
=======================

Someone recently asked about an online forum for
discussion of nootropics & psychotropics.
There seems to be an interesting collection of
annecdotal accounts at the following organization
(the particular URL given is a good overview of what
I assume is the popular version of the substance
discussed above, 2-CB).
http://www.lycaeum.org/drugs/synthetics/2cb/2cb-dmturner.html
which notes: "On some occasions 2-CB has given me
visibility into what I will call the "assembly" or
"machine" language of the mind."

Or a god...That was the point: if you assume that the Judeo-Christian
God is real, than you also must assume that he doesn't give a crap about
the well-being of his creatures. Fortunately the chances that the bible
even remotely approximates the truth (where the supernatural is
concerned) are very slim, and it's much more likely that all is just a
big ol' coincidence. That would explain a lot.

This being would _by definition_ be a ruthless sadist, because it is
supposed to be absolutely 100% omnipotent. It could have made things
infinitely better for us but it didn't. It wants mindless worship from
creatures it has equipped with intelligence and "free will" (what is
free will if God knows everything in advance). What kind of being would
torture people forever in hell for the slightest transgression? People
it has programmed *itself* to commit those transgressions. It's like
making a creature that's always thirsty, and punishing it when it tries
to drink. The Judeo-Christian God does NOT value stimulating
conversation -- he only wants blind worship. Competition? I don't think
so! When Satan and Adam & Eve got too "emancipated" they got kicked out
of heaven with a death sentence slapped to their ass...

That's why we should be glad that He is just a myth. 

Strong atheism should definitely be a part of the transhuman package,
certainly if you want to teach the philosophy to novices, because
otherwise they would be easy prey for any religious fanatic. "If you
don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything". God (and the rest
of the "supernatural") does not exist until he comes down from the
heavens in all his glory etc. People really need to get rid of that
"there must be some higher force"-meme in order to make truly rational
decisions (about cryonics, for example). The god-meme is very powerful,
in order to beat it one has to have a powerful counter-meme, not the
maybe/maybe not agnostic approach. People are going to get infected
with memes (programmed/brainwashed etc.) one way or another, that's
how we work, so better make it the transhuman/atheist/rationalist meme.

Oh dear, I have been preaching again...:-)

the pyramid image is everywhere, heres a site:

it looks a lot like a pyramid, and even if its not a pyramid it definately
looks like just one rock, or mountain.  That image looks like it might be
modified, but there are links to the original photo, from that site.

I disagree with sending a scientist as a first contact.

I would think that the first priority with ETs would be to a establish 
"friendly" relationship to ensure that the human race is not considered be 
expendable, enslavable, etc. This would mean sending sending the best 
diplomat available.  A diplomat would be able to quickly and fully 
understand the motivation for the contact and the political situation the 
human race is about to step into.  The potential to adapt politically to 
the situation would require a certain amount of moral and ethical 
"flexibility" that is the forte of diplomats not scientists.

I don't think "athiest" is that strong a positive claim of non-existence,
just a commitment to (1) that blind speculation is a waste of time and
energy, and most theories of God are blind speculation, and (2) most of
the theologically-defined properties attributed to God are inconsistent
with themselves (like "omnipotence") and therefore impossible.  I do
not deny that there might possibly exist some entity that might satisfy
some more reasonable speculations about God, but that doesn't prevent me
from being a militant atheist.  I use "atheist" as one who believes that
belief in God is wrong, not that disbelief is necessary.

Although in this case the diplomat would most likely need to be
cross-trained with anthropology or ethology in order to be able to
employ his or her skills - most diplomats are good only at being
diplomatic with humans.

Uh, but that's the Viking low-res image. The MGS image (or the supposed
MGS image) of one of the pyramids on Hoagland's site is at:

http://www.enterprisemission.com/images/mars/pyr-comp.jpg

And it's just a rock. A mildly strangely-shaped rock perhaps, but a
rock nonetheless. There is no evidence whatsoever that anything so far
seen is not a natural formation.

Although I agree with most of what you say, militant atheism does not fit
into the Extropian concept of maximized individual freedom. In this concept,
evereyone can be stupid and *those who _militantly_ try to prevent others
from being stupid* are considered as subversive elements. One of the many
reasons why I am a militant Anti-Extropian.

And who's to say that any aliens we meet wouldn't be anarchic scientists
who would regard politics as quaint and 'diplomacy' as plain old lying? If
we're anything like correct I think that's far more likely than Star Trek
or Babylon 5...

The northern part of that pyramid was imaged in the very first Cydonia
strip, at the very bottom, below the "face".  It looks like the edge of
a hill, a completely natural object.  I like to use the mirror site at
http://www.mars.sgi.com/mgs for the latest images.

I share the sense of surprise and disappointment that the Face fans
are continuing to maintain that the new pictures show evidence of
artificiality.  I thought people would have more integrity than that.
No doubt it is difficult to abandon the idea after investing so many
years in it.

Richard Hoagland's web site at http://www.enterprisemission.com has new
blowups of the Mars Global Surveyor images which claim to show structures.
But surprise, they are once again at the very limits of detail in the
new pictures, even though these have many times the resolution of the
old ones.  No matter how close you get and how well you see, there is
always going to be a limit beyond which things get fuzzy.  It is in that
realm, where the imagination can roam, that Hoagland lives these days.

As an amusing aside, there was a minor controversy over the weekend
when a caller to the Art Bell radio program claimed to be a former JPL
employee who was fired when he accidentally caught sight of pictures which
proved that JPL was covering up the reality of a Martian civilization.
However, the caller, "Kent", was tripped up by Hoagland, who had his
phone call analyzed by David Oates, a so-called "reverse speech expert"
(http://www.reversespeech.com).  Oates plays the audio backwards
and attempts to pick out English words in the eerie-sounding noises.
He claims that you can find out what people are really thinking as they
subconsciously tell the truth in their reversals.  Using this technique
Oates and Hoagland decided that Kent was lying, and when he was confronted
he admitted the fraud.

Talk about the blind leading the blind.

The third and last Cydonia image will be taken today and released
on Friday.  No matter what it shows, Hoagland and company will no doubt
find more to feed their fantasies.

While I agree with your other comments on this thread, I don't agree here.
"Atheism" = a-theism. Since "theism" means a belief in a god, "atheism" is
the absence of belief in a god. In that sense, I am an atheist. An atheist
*may* actively deny that there is a god of any particular description, and
may even claim that they can prove that there is no god. However, that is
not the essence of atheism. The essence is simply the absence of belief.

I would not call myself an agnostic, since I do think that knowledge of
these things is possible. If you define "god" in some clear enough way --
the standard sense being a single being who is omnipotent, omniscience, and
all-good, then I would say I know there is no such being. "Know" here is
contextual and not absolute -- but that's always the case with knowledge.

I would take the same position if someone claimed that an invisible,
intangible elf lived on top of the Empire State Building, where it
controlled the minds of the heads of state. Since there is zero evidence
for such a belief, and any predictions such a beliefs makes are going to be
either unfalsifiable or plain wrong, I would reject that belief. I would be
an atheist (or an a-elfist) not an agnostic (or ag-elfist)! That doesn't
mean I claim that I can definitely prove that there is no such elf.

Atheistically yours,

Max

What is this "Extropian concept of maximized individual freedom"?

What's this about subversive elements? Anyone is free to (non-coercively)
prevent others from being stupid. For instance, I'm doing that every day I
teach a class.

Before deciding that you're militantly anti-Extropian, it would help if you
understood what is extropian.

Right, and I know that no (well, probably, but you never know) Extropian
would hold a grudge against this. But Lee Dee called himself a "militant
atheist". Maybe I have a lingual problem here, but "militant" comes from
"military", and military is certainly not what I would call non-coercive.

You might be interested in Harold Cohen's robotics.  He first created a
robotic interactive art piece in the late 1970s.  His work mentored
subsequent interactive/robotics pieces, namely Ken Goldberg's interactive
robotic "Garden" which was set up on the Internet some years ago.  People
at various locations could participate in watering the plants steering the
robotic arm that did the watering.

There is the "Nerve Garden" at http://www.biota.org/nervegarden/index.html

If you decide on your idea, I'd be delighted to exhibit it on the
Transhumanist Art Web site gallery.

Yes, you have a lingual problem. It should be perfectly obvious that Daniel
did not mean that he likes to go around forcing people to recant their
religious beliefs at the point of a gun. What he meant by "militant" is no
different from the way it is standardly used: it means you like to pick a
fight. The kind of fights some atheists like to pick are
verbal/intellectual fights, not physical ones.

Sure, Erik.

BTW, if you're militantly anti-Extropian, you don't belong on this
particular email list. It's intended for Extropians and fellow travellers.
You're completely free to criticize extropian thinking elsewhere, such as
the Transhuman list, but it's not the function of *this* list.

Given that definition, your approach to theological questions sounds quite
reasonable.  But, I'm left wondering, where does that leave the distinction
between atheism and agnostism?  Cannot an agnostic hold, after all, that there
exists no solid proof of gods and that believing in gods constitutes an utter
waste of time?  That is, cannot an agnostic agree with you that it is (for the
practical reasons you described) "wrong" to believe in god?

It makes more sense, I think, to hold that atheists believe that gods do not
exist whereas agnostics shrug off such questions as beyond rational discourse.
That is, atheists disbelieve in gods; agnostics do not believe in gods.

Just a brief follow-up, since I must leave...

"Agnostic" -- a-gnosis -- means someone without knowledge of god(s). The
weak form of agnosticism is held by one who believes they *do not* have
knowledge of any possible god(s). The strong form is held by one who holds
the positive view that they *cannot* know whether there is a god or gods.

The strong form of agnosticism implies a certain view of human knowledge.
Essentially it implies that questions of the existence of gods lies
definitely beyond human knowledge. I suspect that many people are attracted
to this position because they equate knowledge with absolute,
non-contextual certainly. I think that equation is thoroughly wrong.

If you have a reasonable standard of knowledge, or of rational belief, then
you can look at the arguments and the evidence and conclude that there is
no reason to believe in a god. That lack of belief, that a-theism, makes
you an atheist. The agnostic, by contrast, has a standard of knowledge such
that they may think they can never know or rationally come to a conclusion
on the issue.

Fact check: the Old Testament god is Judaic, not Christian, and Hell is not an
Old Testament concept.  

An interesting afterlife is not a Judaic concept, unless you go to the
mystics.  However nasty the behavior of Jehovah he at least inflicted his idea
of justice in the real world.  Adam and Eve weren't sent to hell when they
died, but sentenced to labor and death in this world (along with their
children.)  The snake got to crawl.  When the Jews ticked off God he went
ahead and killed them, or let them be enslaved.  When he was happy he let them
genocide the natives.

The Jews did have 'sheol', which as far as I know was similar to the default
Greek afterlife.  Real dull.  "We have a soul, but there's not much point to
it."

At any rate, I share Max's view.  I am not a theist, therefore 'a-theist' is
a perfectly appropriate label.

Let's try a little experiment.  I'm about to ask you a question about the
existence of some thing, X.  At the moment, you have no belief about X's
existence, since I have not named it.  And yet it would seem *very* odd to say
that your "simpl[e] absence of belief" qualifies you as an "atheist" with
regard to X.  (Oh, here's that question I promised:  Is there such a thing as
"aXist"?)

Hence my conclusion that atheists do more than simply not believe in
gods--they affirmatively disbelieve in them.  To judge from later comments, I
think that you would embrace that description of *your* atheism,  Max.  You
claim,   

> I know there is no such being,

which certainly seems to imply that you have some sort of proof.  Perhaps you
are one of those extraordinary atheists (I'd expect nothing less!) who go
above and beyond what you call the "essence" of the doctrine, to offer proofs
of nonexistence and to make affirmative claims.  Well and good--but what is
the "essence" of atheism if more than mere lack of belief and less than a
claim of proof?  I think that, in fact, your sort of atheism is the only sort
that makes sense:  You claim to have a proof that "no such being" exists.

I would reject elfism, too, as utterly useless for anything but amusement.  I
suppose the question for me, then, is, "Are you an agelfist?"  It would sound
strange, I admit, to say that I do not affirmatively disbelieve in the empire
(sitting *and* directing) elf that you describe.  But it would be logically
consistent for me to claim agnosticism with regard to that and all other such
nonfalsiable claims--and I long ago decided to opt for logical consistency
over strangeness.  Heh.

Let me offer an alternative and somewhat risky response, though:  I regard
some gods as more plausible than the empire (but not empirical!) elf.  I can
imagine one of us eventually attaining something quite like the powers that
some religions attribute to gods (granted that omniscience/omnipotence looks
tricky by any measure; I'm talking about lower-case gods, here).  Who of us
would assume the elf's form?  Nobody with taste, to be sure.  But Jupiter
brains and nano-clouds sound quite stylish, and would certainly evoke
religious awe from most humans.

Upper-case theism remains problematic, I admit.  But I cannot solve every age-
old problem while typing on company time.

Pick a fight, yeah. Maybe with people who don't even want to fight. And
still battle them, until their beliefs are shaken in their fundamentals.
Maybe drive them into suicide.

I work with fundamental Christians. Although I have all the knowledge to
refute their beliefs completely, I don't. Why should I interfere with other
people's lives? But a militant atheist could destroy these lives, even with
words only. That's specific for religion, because it is irrational, it is
always attackable. But the emotions connected with the religous beliefs are
not. And that's why you cannot predict how someone whose worldview has just
been destroyed will react.

I wouldn't call that mindfucking. I would call it mind rape. And it's a type
of coercion, too.

>>I think I've understood it. Probably better than you, the founder.

>Sure, Erik.


Well, just like I think I understand Catholicism better than the Pope.
Religous cults can usually not be correctly interpreted by their leaders,
unless those are perfectly aware of the fact that they are just brainwashing
a horde of money-bearing idiots. The intellectual level of Extropy is
higher, but nevertheless it is a cult and you are its leader.

OK, I summarize: Extropian thinking must not be criticized on this mailing
list. Your fundamentals are built on sand, and that's why you cannot take
criticism. Of course I haven't even started to seriously criticize Extropy.
But even a little rant in my spare time seems to be too much to take. If my
postings disturb you, why not set up a mail filter? Might make life easier.

Perhaps some history can shed some light on this discussion. Agnosticism,
as originally conceived by T. H. Huxley, was more of a method (very much 
like PCR) than a statement of belief (or lack thereof):

  IAN: Here are some images of one of the pyramids seen

  IAN: Well, what if one or both of the pyramids were
  not like "a bunch of rocks" but were perfectly formed,
  or about 95% perfect, would that alter the possibility
  that they were not of natural origin? Well they ARE both
  about 95% perfectly formed 5-sided pyramids.  There are 
  other formations in the area, however, that are pyramid 
  like, yet do appear natural, so it could be some freak
  geological formations. Or maybe the others are badly
  eroded Martian-made structure 10,000,000 years old.?

  That fact that so many symmetrically converging straight 
  lines and angles appear in one area is simply noteworthy.


>You know, when I predicted this face denial a few weeks ago I really didn't

   IAN: But Dr. Mark J. Carlotto, a scientist who has
   done more research on the face than probably anyone 
   alive, is not bizarre at all. He has published many 
   articles on the face in leading scientific journals.
   
   Here's his page: http://www.psrw.com/~markc/marshome.html 

   I think that the many perfectly straight lines around 
   the base of the face are remarkable in and of themselves.
   The best case against the face is that there are other
   objects in the area, clearly nature, also have similar
   unique features. But that is all certainly interesting
   from a geological stand point if not an ET standpoint.

  IAN: Is anyone aware of a critical review of the

No, it's NOT a type of coercion, for two obvious reasons:  first, it is
entirely under the control of the believer to believe or not to believe,
and second, it is entirely within the believer's power to stop listening to
the atheist.

If the believer is under control of their own beliefs, then I cannot force
a believer to change them, only (at best) convince.  And if I cannot even
force the believer to listen, then I can't even convince them by force.  It
is non-coercive to the core, and a significant reason why I believe the
first amendment was an awfully good idea.

Syllogisms:
1)  Axiom.  I cannot force someone to do something which is entirely under
their control.
2) Observed.  It is entirely under the control of the believer to believe
or not to believe.
3)  Therefore.  I cannot force someone to not believe.

and

4)  Observed.  It is entirely under the control of the believer to listen
to me or not listen to me.
5)  Therefore.  I cannot force someone to listen to me.

I am an extropian.  Max More is not my leader.  I am under no obligation to
do anything at all for Mr. More.  If he told me to do something I didn't
want to do, I would not do it.  I wouldn't even consider doing it.  I don't
take orders from him, do not believe everything he says (and in fact,
disagree with his views semi-regularly) and don't think he is in any
supernatural way better than anybody else I've ever met.

6)  Axiom.  Leaders are capable of giving orders to their followers.
7)  Observed.  I do not take orders from Max More.
8)  Therefore.  Max More does not lead me.

In fact, by the very nature of extropianism, I might make the stronger
(though less defensible) claim that NO extropians follow Max More, because
extropianism tends to reject that mindset.  So

9)  Assertion.  Extropians do not take orders.
10)  Therefore.  Extropians do not take orders from Max More.
11)  Therefore.  Max More does not lead any extropians.

And just as I do not follow Max More, nor do I follow extropianism
axiomatically.  I agree with extropianism because I agree with OTHER
fundamental principles which agree with extropianism.  When I make a
decision, I do not ask myself what extropy, what my other fundamental
principles tell me is right.  Cults claim to be true by assumption.  They
presume that their tenets are axiomatic and undoubtedly true.  Their
fundamentals are simply right, and there is no argument to be made.
Extropy is not a cult.

12)  Definition:  Cults consist of a set of unquestionable fundamental
principles.
13)  Observed.  Extropianism does not have any unquestionable fundamental
principles.

(13 deserves a bit of defense, but only a bit:  The "Extropian Principles"
document is in version 2.6 last I checked; any part of the document can be
changed.  Moreover, most extropians endorse pancritical rationalism, a meme
which tends to reject unquestionable fundamental principles.)

14)  Therefore.  Extropianism is not a cult.

>OK, I summarize: Extropian thinking must not be criticized on this mailing
>list.

This is misleading.  It's fine for extropianism to be criticized; that's
what keeps us all rational.  However, we also like to have positive
discussions about extropy, in which we aren't defending extropianism from
criticism but rather discuss ways to bring extropy about.  As you can see,
both discussions are perfectly normal and proper; we only make the extra
leap to say that we would prefer to have these different discussions on
separate lists.

>Your fundamentals are built on sand, and that's why you cannot take
>criticism.

The fundamentals of extropianism are not inviolate columns of stone; the
fact that you seem to think so (IMO) belies your misunderstanding of the
philosophy.  And if we cannot take criticism, how and why would I reply
with syllogisms rather than insults?

>Of course I haven't even started to seriously criticize Extropy.

They don't disturb me.  We just like to talk about different things in
different lists.  Is that cultish?

Any aliens who make it here will probably be at or above our level, at least
technologically...

If we are going to worry about meeting aliens in space, we ought to be a bit
more concerned about letting NASA have a virtual monopoly on exploration.
Happily, they should have some real competition in the next few years...

You read that upside down! I meant most theists are the disbeleivers in
personal responsibility. After all, if God is omnipotent and we are all
doing God's will, why should we be concerned about taking any responsibility
for our own lives? 

I gladly take responsibility for my own actions and the results thereof.
It's my way of controlling my environment.

OK, but the least thing a creator could do is to check if 
sentient entities occur in his simulation (e.g. universe). 
If so, he (/she/it) could make backup copies of their states 
just prior to their destruction. The saved backup copies could 
then be restored in a separate simulation (heaven/hell?).

This way he doesn't disturb the simulation, but he does save 
the sentient beings, which after all are indirectly created 
by him and therefore are his responsibility.

Of course that separate simulation is the same as a separate 
universe is to us. There is no way the sentient inhabitants 
of the original simulation can find out about the other 
simulation, but only to wait until they are restored there 
themselves.

So, IMO a creator *can be held responsible* for the individual 
events in their creations.

(Isn't this the same issue as a creator being responsible 
for any artificial sentient being(s) he has created.)

By the way, at Transvision98 we will show a television documentary 
which will illustrate exactly this issue: "A creator of a simulation 
containing sentient beings is being held responsible" :->

My personal definition of agnosticism is that I feel (not 'believe') that
there is some force behind the Universe, but that this force has not made
itself personally known to me. None of the religions I have seen make sense
to me, so I am still looking for some evidence to suit me. This search does
not occupy very much of my time at present.

I still don't see why a god or God must follow the hell and brimstone route.
What if this personage created the universe as a child might create a
sandcastle, and then 'grew up' and away from childish things? It might not
have any idea that life arose, and even if It did, It might care as little
as we do for an anthill 'way out in the woods...Why must we assume evil
intent? Yes, of course, the lack of positive interaction might appear evil,
especially if you are getting the short end of things because of it.

In my younger days, I was 'born again' by close association with friends in
bible churches. I outgrew this in a few weeks when I realized that they had
the same lack of answers and proof as all other churches I had

I'm an atheist who was raised as a Catholic and spent a bit of time reading
in theology and mysticism.  It seems to me that what Max is saying here is
*way* too easy.

The claims for a deity of the Judeo-Christian-Muslim variety are far
stronger than the utterances of a lone lunatic hallucinating an invisible
elf.  Mystical experiences, which tend to be excluded or invalidated by
those who've never had them, are frequently conceptualised and framed in
terms that take language to its very boundaries.  But so too do QT and much
of mathematics.  Besides, like concepts of infinity and physical
singularities, deity can be teased out of our sense of the world's limits
in a special way utterly unlike delusions or even the indwelling
`life-force' or gods of animist belief systems.  We need to give our
metaphysical foes credit for the depth and subtlety of their claims.  (BTW,
to me *every* cognitive structure is metaphysical; I'm not using the term
as a swear word.)

This is all just a matter of definition rather than substance, but
when it comes to what one describes oneself as to others, it is
often important to use words with the right connotation.

I think the impression left in the mind of most English-speakers
when they hear someone describe eirself as an "agnostic" is that
this person merely is unconcerned with religion; ey does not go to
church, baptize children, etc.  But the label "agnostic" does not
imply any disrespect for others' religious beliefs--if I hear
someone call emself "agnostic", I would expect em to have no
qualms about having close friends and associates who are dedicated
theists, maybe even marry one, or support eir child's choice to
believe, or even have some measure of respect for clergy.  

When someone calls emself "atheist", I expect that such person
might actually distrust openly theist folks, to entirely discount
the opinions of clergy and even ridicule them, to actively oppose
religious-based laws and practices, to oppose prayer and teaching
creationist nonsense in schools, etc.

It is for this reason that I call myself "atheist" even though
Tom's more logical definition might not apply.  I want there to
be no doubt in anyone's mind that even though I may rationally
refuse to assert that there is positively no God, I nonetheless
want to make it clear that I think those who assert that there
is a God have lost my respect, and decisions of any kind made
from theist doctrine are bad decisions, not merely different.

   IAN: That's a very good site. No, the image was not 
   altered. If you search around the NASA JPL site you'll
   find some Viking images of that area, and there it is.
   There are two 5-sided pyramids. The edges and angles 
   on them are perfect, and they caste shadows that con-
   firm their perfect form, even a perfect tip (one how-
   even seems slightly damaged). This is a good analysis:

   http://www.geocities.com/Area51/Vault/4698/pyramid.html 

   What kind of geological forces or events could create
   perfect 5-sided pyramids? Notice that the base lines
   are also perfect. This just doesn't happen in nature,
   at least not that I know of. I don't see how people 
   can reduce all these symmetrical forms to "crap."
   Isn't the basis of inquiry to wonder "What if?"

   IAN: The MGS has NOT imaged the pyramid, and 
   what Hoagland shows is not either one of them.
   Visit the NASA JPL site and you will see that 
   stips that show the areas covered or hoped to 
   be covered by the MGS, and the pyramids are 
   out of the strips, or the plan altogether:

   Here you will see the planned second sweep 
   and the actual sweep. It was going to get 
   one of the pyramids, but D'oh! missed: 

http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/msss/camera/images/4_14_98_cydonia2_release/ind
ex.html 

   In these Viking images you can see both pyramids.
   Notice the largest one on the lower right side.
   While the Viking images may be fuzzier than the 
   MGS images, the hard lines are hard lines. And the 
   MGS images of the face reveal perfectly straight,
   parallel running lines and perfectly ovoid curves.

   Here we can see the final sweep of the area, which
   is planned to miss everything of significance:

Oh you horrible horrible man! My world view is based on Extropian thought, my

You big bad intellectual bully you, don't you know how deeply your words hurt?  
Extropians are delicate creatures, but you use cold logic to prove that all 
that we thought was true and beautiful is really meaningless and ugly, and 
that my life is nothing but one big lie built on a foundation of sand. Oh

I'm laughing outloud.

This is a funny, funny show.

My favorite shows are the ones where Art says, if your a warewolf call the ww
line at xxx.xxx.xxxx. I think this is SO funny. The people who call in are
absolutly hysterically funny. Easily the best late night entertainment
anywhere..

-= deluxe =-

ps-sometimes he has serious stuff too.. and I've heard that over 15 million
people listen every night.. that's a LOT of people listening to AM.

And AMEN to that! Regardless of any intellectual games or "official"
definitions this is the real difference between atheism and agnosticism.
Atheists *reject* the god-meme out of principle, they think it's wrong
and should be fought (mostly verbally) whenever possible. It's a stupid,
dangerous (killer!) meme that has caused enormous damage throughout
history, and it deserves every ounce of criticism it gets.

Agnostics on the other hand seem to have something of a lukewarm
attitude towards the whole matter. It seems that they refuse to see
religion for what it really is: dangerous and stupid, not "neutral".
Just go to Iran or the Bible Belt and see how "harmless" it is. Mass
insanity really is quite scary.

In general I like what you say.
But just one question? "lost my respect" When is that ?
at what age. I mean, a lot of us are raised in family's
where religion is part of their daily lives. It took me quite
some years to get rid of this an find out that there was
more to life then the principles I was raised with.
So, because of this, I do respect people with an other
view on life. But I want it back too. My boss is a "fanatic 
believer" We disagree basically on everything. But we shared
our visions and just let it be..... He doesn't want to change
me and I don't "want" to change him. But I keep letting
him know, that I think he has it all wrong :-)

To Erik:  respect for an Innovator is not the same as blindly following
his meme's ...............

That's quite an interesting thing. I've been thinking about putting up
that sort of thing with a friend, but it's way too much work to do with
only 2 or so people.

The idea was to create a virtual world, which could could be transmitted
through VRML (on the internet, "how" you see it depends on the browser),
HMDs or even CAVEs (imagine a bar with only the most simple functional
interior - the environment is rendered). All kinds of different artists
could work on 2d and 3d-Designs as well as sound-environments (music,
different sorts of atmospheric noises etc.) The most important thing
about it is that everything needs to be linked smartly. For example,
there could be some sort of 2d-FX-show (like cthuga, which inspired that
whole idea). Now, you can either project that upon a screen in 2d - OR
use it as a texture in a 3d-world. Same thing with sound: there could be
some techno-trax for a certain "world", which for example are modulated
by certain events of the interactive objects - but the same thing could
be transmitted to a club with just a fancy light-show.

Most most important (I almost forgot, but it's obvious from the
context): the whole thing needs to be networked. Let's say we have that
CAVE-Bar, which is linked to the Internet via VRML, as well as to some
CAVE-Club, maybe in another country, and also some VR-Studio on still
another place. Now, each entity has a "location" within some virtual
space, a "location" consists of
a) The actual "world"
b) The position within that world

Worlds could be logically hyperlinked (like, there could be a exits at a
world, which lets you chose where you want to go next, or certain exits
lead to do determined other worlds). Whenever two real world entities
(for example someone browsing the VRML-Space and the VR-Studio), there
should be ways of interaction. For example, if you modify certain
objects within the world, this should be visible to all other
"visitors", or, you could actually SEE the visitors (via avatars or with
real-video mapped into screens or whatever within the world) and
communicate...

> > The problem comes with putting this idea into practise.

That was our major problem, too... one would have to start little by
little, but always keeping the "big goal" in mind.

I'd like to see "ties" with the party-scene ;-)

That sounds nice, but it might not be easy to do. First, some of the
entities might suffer a gradual decline (like humans with Alzheimer's
disease), would it be nice to save backup copies of their final,
degraded state or should one save copies from an earlier state? If so,
why just one, why not several? Second, it might not even be clear to
the creator which entities are sentinent and which are not (there
might be a lot of intelligence hidden in the apparent chaos of type
III CAs, invisible until you look at the principal fourier
components). Third, the afterlife is rather underdetermined: how to
keep the entities from pain *there*?

Even when the creator has no idea about what sentinent beings will
emerge? If you create a world top-down, in the genesis fashion ("Let
there be animals, to the following specifications... Let there be
chemistry to implement the animals, to the following
specifications...) it is fairly easy to say you are responsible for
the entities you create (but note that they might have free will,
which might give them some responsibility themselves). But if you
create a bottom-up universe (like in game of life: "Let there be an
initial state and the following rules...") you will not know what will
emerge (unless it is a very uninteresting rule set) and you cannot
predict the eventual outcome.

The unpredictability of Turing machines and complex systems is IMHO
the basis for our free will, and puts a limit on the amount of
responsibility we can place on any creator.

Okay, I have a 'lukewarm' attitude. Granted.

Please tell me how having an overbearing, in-your-face attitude, where 'I am
right and you are wrong' (assuming you are a religious type as described) is
going to make you change your mind? More likely, you will come after me with
sword drawn, screaming 'Infidel!'.

(No, I am NOT calling you a fundie. Unless you are an atheist fundie!)

The best one can do is to peacefully and by example teach those around him
about tolerance and logical thought. Particularly one's own children!

Screaming and fist waving are the province of the fundies, and these
critters are NEVER going to change their minds. Why don't we wait for the
present crop to die out, and work to change things here?

In the US, supporting laws that continue and enhance separation of religion
and government is worthwhile. Writing letters and emails to legislators who
propose religious slanted laws can't hurt! These people will back away from
dumb laws if they see the lack of public support. 

Unless you want a bloody religious war, atheists vs. fundies and all others,
I suggest restraint and attempting to support education and freedom instead
of coercion.

The deepset power of this meme is the reason that force cannot work. This is
the basic reason for most if not all religiously based wars. And again, this
is the reason I will continue as a 'lukewarm agnostic' rather than a
firebrand atheist..

>>* What are the data requirements of transmitting a

memory -- do you charge by the gigabyte, or have a
fixed rate for everybody?

>Rough estimate: 10^11 neurons, 10^4 synapses each,

bandwidth (remember, one mol is 10^23 atoms...). 

There is an amusing scenario in Greg Egan's story
"The Planck Dive" (Asimov's Science Fiction, February
1998) where some folks are 'faxing' themselves across
a StarNet-like system:

"The first of the two visitors was still standing
patiently at the end of the pier ... Her fellow
traveler, still in transit, was represented by a
motionless placeholder. Both icons were highly
anatomical-realist ... 

'You're here to observe the Planck Dive?' Gisela
chose to betray no hint of puzzlement; it would have
been pointlessly cruel to drive home the fact that
they could have seen everything from Athena. Even if
you fetishized realtime data over lightspeed
transmissions, it could hardly be worth slipping 194
years out of synch with your fellow citizens". 

Gisela & Cordelia then go off to tour a "scape" of
the black hole while waiting for Prospero to finish
his transmission because he's brought his entire
castle along with him! Gisela winces: "It was a good
thing they'd compressed their accommodation more
efficiently than their bodies, or they would have
tied up the gamma ray link for about a decade". 

BTW, Prospero turns out to be a type that Extropians
would love to hate: he's an anachronistic flesher
bard "come to create enigmas, not explanations" and
thinks that "To extract the mythic essence, mere
detail must become subservient to a deeper truth".

Odd, because that's an MGS image (see the original at http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/target/CYD2/cydonia2m_tjp_bot.gif) and Hoagland,
'Mr Face' himself, claims it's a pyramid. Quite clearly it's not, and only
looks a little like one because of the human's natural tendency to 'draw
lines' between dots.

It was probably part of THE CONSPIRACY that FAKED the Mars Face photos...
but now we're onto them they don't DARE fake any more so they had to 
miss it. The Face-Freaks are TOO SMART for NASA.

Of course out in reality-land they only said they had a 30-50% chance of
getting the images, so I was amazed that they got the 'lumpy-bumpy rock 
thing' on the first try.

Uh-huh, but most of the 'lines' don't really exist; as far as I can see
they're just optical illusions like Hoagland's pyramid image. The remainder
are no more unusual than mountains on Earth, and as for the 'perfect shadows'
you talk about, you should really try looking at the shadow of a mountain
sometime. I've watched sunrise from the top of Mt Fuji, and its shadow is
just as 'perfect' a triangle as any of those 'pyramids'.

Look, it's not a face, it's a lumpy-bumpy rock thing, OK; it looks nothing
like a face to anyone but those who have too much invested in the whole
face hysteria to change their minds. I, for one, have seen no 'perfectly
straight, parallel running lines' or 'perfect ovoid curves', nor any
evidence to imply that anything about the rock is artificial.

Frankly, this is probably my last comment on this pointless thread, except
to point out what I find most bizarre. The original justification for the
face hysteria was that there was a rock which supposedly looked like a
face. Now that there's a high-resolution photo which shows it looks nothing
like a face, rather than give up, we get all this stuff about 'but it would
have looked like a face before erosion wore it down'. If we'd seen this rock
first in the MGS photos we would just have ignored it; the only reason we
considered it at all interesting was because the Viking photos were too
low-resolution to show its real nature.

    Mark

P.S. I think I'm going to write a book telling the TRUE STORY of how the
CIA and MAJESTIC-12 used the ROSWELL UFO to fly to Mars and blow up the
Mars Face after the Viking photos became public, so the Aliens had to
resort to making Crop Circles to get our attention instead. I'll be a
millionaire in a few months.

Besides... What is sentience anyway? One thought experiment is that
there could very well be such a system in effect right now, but humans
are just not considered intelligent or sentient enough for a god/power.

I agree with you Anders, but I think that most diplomats are only
_capable_ of being 
"diplomatic" with other humans.  If diplomats were really good, would
we not, as a species, have avoided many wars if the diplomats had
really been good at their purported jobs?

On that note related to James' post....I do not believe that trying to
establish a friendly relationship would necessarily be the most
prudent course of action.  I do not contend that we should be hostile
with every alien species that we might encounter.  However, by what
rationale would aliens have the same goals that humans do?  Once
humans can figure out that wars and other destructive means of
expression are extremely counterproductive, then I hope that we as
humans will gain a sense of species consciousness or at least a
consensus about developments that should be avoided or encouraged.  

I think that another course of action prior to full scale contact with
other species would be to make our planet and our species appear to be
strong.  I do not believe that humans should use aggression, but that
we should be able to show any other potentially hostile
extraterrestrial race that bothering earth for reasons other than
peaceful contact will be extremely dangerous.  Another possibility is
to show other species that earth is not worth their time.  Of course,
since we have only our context as a reference all of this is
completely random speculations.  Any thoughts?

Although authors like Sagan think that a spacefaring species would
most likely be friendly, I do not think that will be/is always the
case.  Is there not the possibility that extremely hostile races would
not destroy themselves?  Instead they might have a sense that they are
supreme and all other species should be subject to them or simply
annihilated?

I don't have any problem with that.  DNA doesn't interest me much -- if all

I don't see how this matters.  The human personality is an information

morally /care/ about from one that we don't consider to be a person?

HF> I don't see how you are going to be able to draw the line you want
HF> to draw.

I don't either.  It seems like we need to find some way, though.

I had an idea at one time, based on what I said before about an evolutionary
legacy.  If a creature has evolved to have instincts and emotions for its own
survival and reproduction, and if it becomes sufficiently sophisticated to
demand rights, then it should have rights.

So, most animals would not qualify, since they aren't intelligent enough to
understand "rights" and ask for them.  At the other extreme, you could have a
bush robot 100,000 times as intelligent as a human, but it's only programmed
from the ground up to obey its owner -- it has no "natural instincts" or
emotions for serving its own ends.  That wouldn't be sentient either, though
it could be mightly useful to those of us who are.

If you took an animal and boosted its intelligence, then it could be a
sentient being, and thus accrue all the rights we normally recognize for
people.  From a legal standpoint, this might simply be an exotic way of having
children.

Also, if you created an artificial intelligence based on a neural net, which
is "programmed" by a regimen of stimulus and feedback instead of cut-and-dried
rules, then it *might* be sentient.  This is one reason why I find neural-net
research vaguely distasteful.  It could lead to some form of sentience, and I
feel this is not a high-priority goal.  We already know how to create sentient
beings, we've got almost six billion of them.  Do we really need more?  Far
more useful to create intelligent but non-sentient servants, IMHO.

That was my idea.  However, I've continued thinking about it, and I see that
there could still be some problems.  Depending on how radical things get, we
could end up with entities splitting and recombining right and left in various
ways.  Under such circumstances, it could be hard to keep track of such an
arbitrary definition of sentience, and the system could be subject to abuse. 
There's not any obvious /test/ you could perform, short of digging into
their minds and seeing what makes them tick.

There's also the political obstacle -- I'm talking about a *legal* definition
of sentience.  A legal definition isn't useful unless you can explain it to
enough people and convince them to accept it.  I'm afraid my ideas don't
exactly have mass appeal in their current form.  :-)

There are other reasons why TV tends to lag years (if not decades) behind SF
literature.  It's hard to introduce new concepts on a TV show.  You can't stop
and spend 10 minutes explaining something.  So, SF concepts tend not to reach
TV until after they've already penetrated the cultural consciousness.  You
can't do a show about alternate worlds until most people already understand
the concept of alternate worlds.  That's why we haven't seen any shows
featuring nanotechnology in a meaningful way.

I've seen shows that /mention/ nanotechnology in passing, using it basically
as a buzzword.  Most of them seem to think a nanomachine is some kind of
artificial virus.  Ironically, the one TV show I've seen that was reasonably
accurate in depicting and explaining nanotechnology was an episode of
Gargoyles.  Yes, Gargoyles!  It's a children's animated series from Disney.
In this one episode a large part of the Australian outback was overrun by
gray goo, which rather resembled a self-replicating utility fog.

It's sort of like the 1920s when many people sneered at the idea of
spaceflight, or simply didn't understand it.  Yet, there was the Buck Rogers
comic strip with surprisingly well thought-out depictions of how spaceflight
could work.

Well, the timeframe is the big question, isn't it?  I will say this...  I
think nanotechnology is at the same awkward stage that spaceflight was in the
1920s and 1930s.  The technology doesn't exist yet, but it's visible on the
horizon to those few who are inclined to look.  The basic principles are
understood.  So the question is, when are we going to get the nanotech
equivalent of an A-4 rocket?  Based on the historical pattern, I would guess
about 20 years.  But there are so many variables...

I've known some people who said with a straight face that it would be more
like 200 years.  I don't believe that, but I can't prove them wrong either. 
After all, researchers have been saying commercially viable fusion energy is
"about forty years away" for decades now.

It's not a choice between the work being done or not being done, it's a
question of HOW.  Under the current system, you pay a laborer to do it.  Under
the future system, you can lease a robot to do it.  You are paying for the
same productive result either way, but in the first case you're paying someone
to toil for you.  In the second case you're paying someone for the use of his
capital (in the form of the robot).

I prefer the second system, since it becomes less likely that I'll have to
work for a living.  It is an opportunity to lift the burden of work from
humanity, by making us all cyber-capitalists!

Of course there is some precedent in history...  There was the unfortunate
practice of human slavery.  I live in Texas, a state with the dubious
distinction of having gone to war /twice/ in defense of slavery.  This leads
to a certain degree of soul-searching.  If we ever attempt an economic system
using robots in the place of slaves, we must be /damn/ sure of our ethical
grounds before starting.  There must be a system in place to ensure that the
robots -- no matter how versatile and competent they might become -- are
always in FACT soulless and emotionless automatons incapable of either
desiring or appreciating freedom.

Well, Star Trek was created a long time ago.  And besides, TV shows are
created for a mass audience.  Their concepts usually lag years behind the SF
literature.

But yeah, if you take the laws of physics as we currently understand them, and
you work out the most efficient way to cross interstellar distances, this is
what you come up with.  At least, I haven't heard any better ideas yet.

I read a short story in which Earth was bombarded with such seeds.  They were
microscopic, so they didn't have to really be aimed or guided.  Instead the
aliens manufactured zillions of them and "sprayed" them toward our solar
system with some kind of accelerator.  The idea being that if you launch
enough of them, there's a good chance one will land someplace viable where it
can grow.  It's an interesting idea, but I don't know how practical it would
be.

50 million years?  That may be an "instant" in the cosmic scheme of things,
but I hope we can do much better!  I once read an estimate that the whole
galaxy could be colonized in about 200,000 years using starships.

As for ETs being unlikely -- I tend to agree with your reasoning, but I would
prefer not to make a judgement on such skimpy information.  There's a lot we
still don't know.

Hm...  I dunno.  I'll have to think about that.  I do think the problems
related to the operation of the network itself should be straightforward.

Here's something else...  The coming times will be marked with upheaval and
chaos.  Already it seems like few people care about achieving greatness.  Too
many want only safety, security, and lots of toys.  It might be nice for

Yes. Seafaring nations sure weren't always friendly towards other
cultures, so why would this change when they get into space?

And then there's also the possibility that the visitor is not a race,
but a single (planet-sized?) entity. Maybe it's the only survivor of a
titanic battle between Powers. Or maybe it's a super-AI that turned
against its masters...If it's powerful enough, it can be as hostile as
it wants to be. No, benevolence is far from a sure thing when it comes
to extra-terrestrial life.

When the creator has enough power to simulate a universe, he most 
also have enough power to merge the backup copies of earlier states 
with the later backups of the degraded states, and to construct 
from those multiple states a "healthy" state, containing all memories 
of the being. Of course one has to define what a "healthy" state is 
first.

OK, this is maybe the most difficult part. Indeed it's possible 
that the creator will not be able to detect all sentient beings. 
But I'm fairly sure he will be able to detect most of them. 

If sentient beings will develop (that are also able to selfreproduce) 
it is very likely they will transform their environment considerably. 
This process is exponential. (Look at how the human beings have 
already transformed our environment (Earth). And how we could likely 
transform are whole galaxy within a million years.)
This reasoning presumes that reproducing sentient beings will at one 
time develop a technological civilization. I think however that this 
is quite likely. 

At a point in time the technological civilization will have transformed 
its environment a considerable amount, it should then be quite feasible 
to detect this pattern in the simulation. Now, the creator only has to 
play back the simulation and extract al the sentient beings of the 
earlier generations of this civilization. 

Of course, sentient beings that will not develop a technical 
civilization are much harder to detect. 

And how does one determine if a being is sentient enough to be 
worth being restored.


>Third, the afterlife is rather underdetermined: how to
>keep the entities from pain *there*?

When the entities are restored in a separate simulation there 
is now no reason anymore not to communicate with them. So the 
creator could ask the sentient beings themselves if they are happy 
or not. Or even give them the capabilities to alter themselves 
in to a state they individually prefer.

Indeed.

So you're saying that a creator could have a certain degree of 
responsibility for the sentient beings created in his simulation.

I'm not saying a creator must be hold responsible, I'm just saying 
he could be hold responsible. So then we are saying the same.

Sounds like a good model to me, although one likely has to interpret

Interesting. I must admit I have also thought about this. I daily
create, train, use and erase neural networks in my research. Do they
have some kind of experience? Do they have a right to existence? As
for the nets I'm currently using (small fully connected
autoassociative networks with an incremental Bayesian learning rule),
I realize that their complexity is less than the chemical networks of
many bacteria, so I don't feel too bad about them. But this may become
a real problem in the future - the other graduate students here (me
included) are quite interested in creating a sentinent system if
possible, and once we start to get close to that, then we are going to
need to think much more about ethics.

No, but we might need *different* kinds of entities. I think it would
be healthy if we humans weren't the only kind of intelligent entity in
society, the existence of other kinds of thinking and experiencing
might have profound and healthy effects on ourselves.

Sure, for practical work. But sentinent beings are ends in themselves
in some sense.

This might not be a very strong objection, the basic idea might be
sound even if it is hard to implement in a society we could
imagine. It might be a good starting point for further examination.

Huh? This doesn't follow. I can set up a big game of life simulation
(or something similar, perhaps Tierra) right now on this computer, but
even if I discovered intelligent entities inside it after a while I
wouldn't know what to do with them. Sure, that huge stretch of digital
code is an intelligent entity, but I have no idea of how it works, how
to merge its memories (which might be impossible even in principle for
an Alzheimer-like case, where the memory substrate would be
non-isomorphic over time) or what it would consider "healthy" ("Poor
humans, guts riddled with bacteria. I'll resurrect them completely
without any bacteria, then they will be healthy and happy!").

Even if I happen to be a posthuman jupiter brain, I will still be
limited in my knowledge about the behavior of complex systems such as
simulated universes.

Only in worlds like ours where there exists objects that can be used
as tools. I would expect that an intelligent game of life pattern
might live in a world where this is almost impossible - there is no
way of moving anything without changing it. And in Tierra, the tools
might be code integral to the entities or symbiotic creatures instead.

I think you are on the right track, looking for changes creating
highly ordered states that spread quickly is a good way. But it is not
trivial, since the order may be well hidden.

This assumes we can easily communicate with them. But how do we start
exchanging communication with entities with a fundamentally extremely
different world (like Tierrans, with a world consisting of computing
nodes and nonlocal memory indexed by templates and energy appearing if
you do certain things but not other things)? I think it can be done,
but it would be extremely hard to do, and the process might be rather
painful for the entities again (imagine being resurrected all alone in
a weird caricature of the real world where *something* tries to
communicate with you - and if you die, you are immediately
resurrected).

Not to mention the fact that we need profound knowledge of neural nets and

 But isn't it possible that a superior being might not view us as sentient
enough to bother with?  Perhaps we overestimate our importance or
significance in the universe.  If I were driving down the road, I would
certainly swerve to avoid hitting a dog.  How about a turtle....yeah, OK.
How about a worm or an ant...ehhh, don't think so.

If I was god I would certainly concern myself with the dogs and the turtles
of the universe even if they were a lot less sentient than me, but I would I
feel responsible for the painful experiences of the lower life forms?  In
other words, what if we're at the worm level on the universal sentience
scale relatively speaking?

Scott Badger
Might we not  our level of sentience as significant enough

I have many questions of the christians. like why , if god is so 
powerful, would he have to kill his only son to save our souls. 
couldn't he have just waved some magic wand and it would all be 
better. this seems to me to be one of the many oddities of this 
world. my biggest question is:  why didn't god make us perfect. i 
mean he tried once wasn't satisfied and got pissed-off and wiped the 
world out, then tried again. wasn't this a mistake, he picked a 
drunken farmer to "renew life". 

my biggest question of all why if someone is muslim do they have to 
follow the christian life style, and don't say that they don't . take 
a look at time!
aren't christians kind of odd they follow a jewish man, who even the 
jews say was a fake?

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

On pp.395-396 of the 17Apr98 Science, John Wilmoth has a thoughtful
article, "The Future of Human Longevity: A Demographer's Perspective".

  "The extrapolative approach to prediction is particularly compelling in 
the case of human mortality. ... Preductions of future life expenctancy 
by extrapolation yield values that are not too different from what is 
observed today. ... An independent study, based on a purely extrapolative 
technique, yielded more optimistic results (U.S. life expectancy at birth 
in 2050 of 84.3 years for both sexes combined) ...  Although short-term 
fluctuations have been common, long-term mortality trends have been 
remarkably stable. ...  Quite simply, a projection based on less that 20 
years of experience that extends 50 to 100 years into the future is 
imprudent, if not foolhardy. ... 
   In recent years, the extrapolative approach to mortality prediction 
has been challenged by assertions that future changes in average human 
life-span may come more or less quickly than in the past.  The more 
optimistic view that life-span partly will increase rapidly in the near 
future is the result of the acceration in rates of mortality decline 
among the elderly in developed countries during the past few decades (5).  
But from a historical perspective, this change is recent and should be 
extrapolated into the future with caution.  If the new pattern persists 
for several more decades, it will then constitute strong evidence that 
the old trends have been replaced by new ones.  
   Another source of optimisim about future mortality rates likes in the 
potential application of existing technology (for example, nutritional 
supplememtns and reductions in smoking) or the unusual longevity of 
certain groups (such as Mormons and Seventh Day Adventists) (6). Such 
discussions may be a god way to improve health behaviors, but they are 
not so good at informing predictions, largely because this same srot of 
advocacy influenced past trends as well.  For purposes of prediction, 
we need to ask whether future positive reforms in life-style are likely 
to be implemented faster of more effectively than were similar reforms 
in the past.
   From time to time, technological breakthroughs provide another source 
of optimism about future mortality rates.  Recently, the manipulation 
of a gene that halts the shortening of telomeres during the replication 
of human cells in vitro was a source of great optimism in the popular 
media, provoking rather extraordinary claims about the possibility of 
surviving to unprecedented ages in the near future (7).  Talk of cures for 
cancer and vaccines against AIDS promotes similar hopes.  Such discussions 
should not be dismissed as mere wishful thinking but should also be seen 
in historical perspective.
   As wonderous as they may be, recent scientific advances should be 
compared, for example, to Koch's isolation of the tubercle bacillus in 
1882 - which provided confirmation of the germ theory of disease and led to 
a great flourishing of public health initiatives around the turn of the 
century - or to Fleming's discovery of the antibacterial properties of 
penicillin in 1928, an event that led to the anibiotic drug therapies

  IAN: I don't know why Hoagland is showing what

  dots" to see the pyramids that are pyramids.

  The URL you point to is also NOT the pyramids

  looks new," what's going on here? The pyramids
  in question were clearly visible on the sites
  I pointed to, including NASA (which you can trust
  since it's a Govt page). Again, MGS has not imaged 
  the pyramids. The NASA pages tell us just that.

   IAN: Your missing the actual evidence again.
   Joking about conspiracy does not explain what

   just as willing to believe natural as not, but 
   making jokes and throwing "crap" isn't useful,
   at least to some trying to figure this out.

   IAN: What your saying is just false. I don't
   know why Hoagland is showing what is not the 
   pyramids, claiming it is, but images of the 
   actual physical objects in question have been 
   made available to you, yet you seem to prefer 
   Hoagland's error over the actual evidence.

   There are hard lines that are not an illusion
   in both the Viking and around the base of the 
   "face" in the MGS images, and those lines also
   showed up perfectly in the Viking images.

   IAN: You should try to observe the actual

   you can actually start to analyze the facts.
   In short, you don't even know what your

   IAN: To say that it's similarity to a face 
   = 0% is just flat-out false. It has a striking
   resemblance to a face even in the MGS images.
   And then all around the base of the "face" 
   are perfectly straight lines and formations,
   perfect ovoid lines and a sharp right angle.

   Would a perfectly (or nearly so) carved face
   not erode over time? Ancient human structures
   erode. Why should we not ask these questions?
   The reaction to the "face" on the ExI list
   seems to be anti-inquiry, anti-questioning,
   just throw "crap" at this issue. Bizarre.


>but those who have too much invested in the whole

   IAN: I cuts both ways, a lot of people have
   invested in throwing "crap" at the face and
   are not about to allow that to change. For 
   anyone to look at the face and write it off
   as "crap" is entirely reactionary and anti-
   thetical to truth inquiry. There are forms
   in and around the "face" that are highly 
   anomalies/unusual at the very least.

   Should those not be explained? Does science
   say, "We need to explain everything, except 
   those pyramids and sharp liner formations 
   on Mars, they are crap."


>I, for one, have seen no 'perfectly

   IAN: Glasses might help.

   IAN: It does not "Look nothing like a face."
   It has strong face resemblance, but that's 
   not all (in fact by it self, I'd probably
   agree it's natural), what is most interesting
   are the sharp parallel running lines and forms
   and perfect ovoid curves around the "face" base.

   If you can't see them, I find that most bizarre.

   IAN: Not sure how much of what you say is joke 
   or not. I would say that the joke that the 
   phenomena of erosion is caused by disease is
   silly to even raise as a joke, for it is known 
   that erosion is caused by natural forces, so we 
   need not introduce any other causes of erosion.

   The argument that the "face" is not artificial since
   it shows signs of natural erosion is not a logical 
   argument, for artificial structures made out of 
   natural material will erode just as well as natural
   formations will erode. The "face" has similarity
   to a face. The logical question is, if it was 
   an artificial face, how would it appear after
   X years of exposure to natural erosion causing
   forces? Why is it that the intelligent people 
   on the ExI list are not asking logical questions,
   but lining up to throw "crap" at these anomalies?

   I would not give the face a second thought were it not 
   for the fact of the sharp liner formations around the 
   base of the face and the pyramids in the area, which 
   are all in and of themselves anomalous formations.
   There proximity tends to increase their "anomalimity."

   Why is it wrong to wonder? Why is it wrong to explore 
   all the possibilities? Why is it right to throw crap?
   This seems more like group thinking than free inquiry.

Reading comprehension time: "as far as I can see they're just optical 
illusions *like Hoagland's pyramid image*." How could that sentence
possibly be referring to Hoagland's image and not the Viking image
you pointed out?

It didn't; there are no five-sided pyramids, because several of the 
'edges' in the Viking images clearly do not exist except as optical 
illusions.

I think that the MGS just got one of the pyramids: 

http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/target/CYD3/cydonia3m.gif 

It's a very big file and the 
pyramid is toward the bottom.

It looks both pyramid-like and natural. If it's
50%, the weight of logic falls to natural, since
the change of advanced life is less than not-life.

The best case I can think for artificial is that 
a layer of dust rests on the pyramid, and this dust
causes it to appear natural. We can see a the sharp
liner base line. It is at the least, or most, an
unusual geological formation, and there are two,
but this image could only capture one of them.

This certainly knocks extrapolations drawn from
the Viking images down, down way toward natural.

I certainly don't expect children to know better, but at
whatever point a person becomes responsible for eir own
beliefs, and has free choice, my opinion of em will depend
on those choices.  If ey chooses to believe in God, I will
certainly still show em the benevolence due all sentient
beings, and be happy to trade with em (though I may be more
reluctant to extend credit to someone who believes the
world is ending soon:).  But "respect" is something given
freely, not "due" anyone, and I would not choose to give
it here.

My own values respect honesty greatly--and science, which
is just methodical honesty--and so I cannot respect one
who willfully chooses to value speculation over evidence.
Such a person is not to be trusted in other matters where
honesty is important.

And I suffer from having had to pay you for it.  However, we wouldn't have

Unless, of course, the robots are sentient, in which case you still pay a
laborer to toil for you, only this laborer happens to be made out of
diamondoid polymers.

The burden of work could only be lifted if supply increased so fast that it
outstripped the demand for labor.  Now, while this might happen in the food
market, particularly if an increasing percentage of our population doesn't
need food, there's no evidence that the demand for labor will ever stop
increasing.  People just seem to want more and more stuff, particularly
since our population is growing, and would grow even faster if we had robot
citizens.  Sentient robots would create jobs by stimulating demand,
probably at least as much as they would fill jobs to participate in the
economy.

In other words, there may indeed come a time when you won't have to work
(much?) in order to get food, housing and medicine.  However, there will
also be so much more stuff available and at such convenient prices, that
you'll probably want to work, and you'll want to buy what your fellow
citizens are offering; even if those citizens are robots.

If I had to choose (from an economic standpoint) between creating mindless
robot slaves or sentient robot employees, I would choose the sentient
robots hands down.  A sentient robot could participate in the economy,
performing labor and buying goods, creating jobs and filling them, making
everyone better off in the process.  We would have just as much to gain
from a sentient robot as we would from a slave, if not exponentially more.

Also, if you consider utility a form of wealth, as I do, then we can
immediately see that a sentient robot would be able to create many kinds of
wealth which a mindless slave could not; art, for example.  Empathy.  Love.
 Many of the forms of wealth which we consider "non-material" could be
offered by robots...  Though they'd presumably want someone to love them in
return.

And I'll be the first to agree that that's a good thing.

He put Eric on to talk about the Atlantis Project.  In hindsight, that
probably didn't attract exactly the kind of attention we hoped for...

   IAN: Even the new MGS images show the sharp edges. 
   BUT, now, even as they are sharp, they are not so
   straight, and that's a key factor supporting a
   natural conclusion. I think, as I said before,
   the best case against the "face" (including all
   things the in area) is that other, clearly natural,
   formations have similar features, suggesting a
   uniform geological phenomenon. Notice how most 
   hills in the area seem to have sharp-edged tops
   and som fomrations have sharp sudden-rising slops.
   These natural features tend strongly to define 
   most of the theorized to be artificial features.
   As such, the "artifical theory" is fast sinking.

   If we're to dismiss the artificial theory, we have 
   to do it properly, not with name calling and such.

   One thing I think we can dismiss is the theory 
   that there's been a cover-up. I think that NASA 
   has made genuine images available and has responded
   to public demand that they do so. Cydonia is the 
   foremost thing I see mentioned on their pages.

   IAN: You were commenting on my comments of the lines
   on the pyramid. The "like Hoagland's image" implies
   that the Viking formations you referred to are the 
   same formations that Hoagland referred to, and since
   you rejected the pyramids on the basis of what he

The third and last cydonia picture has come in from MGS.  They missed
what Hoagland calls the "fort", a triangular landform with a hollowed
out center, but they got Hoagland's "city center" and "main pyramid".

The pictures don't look any more artificial than the others, but they
are quite spectacular in their own right.  I am looking at the bottom
of http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/target/CYD3/cydonia3m_mipl_bot.gif and
the variety of formations is amazing.

The region just to the left of the "fort", down towards the "main pyramid",
has some very interesting terrain.  Hoagland described it like this in
his study of the Viking prints:

   "I noticed a small smudge between the Fort and the main pyramid that
   I hadn't caught before, just southwest of the abrupt and maddening
   cutoff of the 'rocket motor' aspect of the Fort.  I focused the
   magnifying glass...

   "And realized I was staring at a tiny pattern of honeycomb-like cells.

   "Several seconds passed as I slowly comprehended what I was seeing.
   Moving the magnifying glass down a bit I traced the 'honeycomb'
   across the two-mile region which had nagged me for so long... and
   saw the shadow of the main pyramid falling across this tiny region,
   clearly outlining a raised, three-dimensional relief.

   "And suddenly, it all fell into place.

   "'Oh my God,' I said softly, in the night with no one to hear me
   except the clock and the cat."

Hoagland interpreted this region as an open-topped pyramid honeycombed
with tiny cell-sized "rooms".  He goes on to describe it as a multi
level structure, "decking" or "open girder framework" or "scaffolding".

Now the new pictures reveal that actually this terrain is covered with
small craters.  It is more heavily cratered than anything else I have
seen in the Mars pictures, with craters touching craters in many places.
It must be very old terrain, perhaps protected from erosion by the large
structures nearby.  It is this cratered area, which was not visible in the
Viking pictures as other than a hint of unusual texture in the surface,
which Hoagland interpreted as a honeycombed structure.

In a way it is to Hoagland's credit that his many hours of staring at
the Viking pictures identified this region as unusual.  It's too bad
though that he immediately jumped to the conclusion that it was an
artificial construction.

My joke was meant to imply that martians made the face look disfigured
by erosion because their own humanoid faces were similarly eroded by
some horrible disease...

No way to do that in most cases, especially with fundmentalists. Take a look
at the story of Masada: When they realized that what they believed in, that
God would save them when their trouble was greatest, did not happen, they
all killed themselves and each other.

I wrote that you *could* destroy other people's lives with facts. It is
certainly not a walk in the park, but it can happen.

This especially applies to Christian religion which has one severe bug which
can easily be exploited: Jesus. The historical Jesus, whose name was not
Jesus but Zaddik or Zadduk, is an entirely different person than the one
pictured in the Bible. Read "The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception" by Michael
Baigent and Richard Leigh. I don't want to go on further as their might be
Christians on this list.

But if the operation kills the patient?

So, are you a mind rapist, too, Erik? You like to attack free markets which
form a tremendously important part of some people's worldview. They might
be very distressed if they lost their belief system under your barrage.
Apparently you find it important enough to change their minds, since you
keep working at it. 

Maybe Lee Daniel Crocker feels it is at least as important to change the
minds of religious believers. After all, these are the people who attempt
to kill us by forcing autopsies or burials on cryonics patients (that has
happened), who try to and sometimes succeed in banning or slowing
biomedical research, these are the people who made women suffer pain in
childbearing because anaesthesia was against God's will, these are the
people who try to control us according to their irrational beliefs and values.

Personally, I don't feel the need to go around beating down people's
beliefs. However, if someone shows interest, I do explore their views
critically. I do this all the time in my Philosophy of Religion class.
Could this lead to a breakdown in their worldview and considerable
distress? Yes, it could. I went through that myself. It is difficult but
that's how you grow. I don't think this is coercion. I would agree with you
that it could reasonably be considered a form of coercion to push someone

only have to say "I don't wish to discuss this anymore" and walk away.
Somehow, I don't see Lee Daniel Crocker tying up Christians and forcing
them to listen to his atheistic views. (Or do you have a secret life like
this Lee? :-) )

Those are fighting words. Put up or shut up. I'm tired of people like you
casually throwing off statements like this without substantiation. That's a
very serious charge, and I say you are lying. Unless you are using the term
"cult" in such a loose sense that, say, Carl Sagan would be a cult leader
for science or rationalism, you are wrong. 

Retract what you say, or else prove it. Otherwise I *will* have you removed
from this list.

Criticism is fine, but this is not the place for it. The Transhuman list
and many other places are available for that. I think the reason you cannot
seem to grasp this simple point is that you don't want to. You would rather
attack than understand. If you set up a list for the specific purpose of,
say, discussing evolutionary theory in order to refine it and explore
mechanisms by which it works, you would not be too pleased to have it
invaded by creationists. It would waste your time and weaken the focus.
That does not mean you would want to prevent creationists both having their
own discussion lists, or joining in on lists intended to be open to that
kind of debate.

By violating the charter of this list, by your own standards, YOU ARE
COERCING US. Stop it.

You see, just that Extropy is a cult doesn't mean that it's as stupid as
Christianity. Especially your postings on this list have often been
enlightening to me and usually of high quality (although you have a
psychical bug that often causes you to rant like this. Never mind, have the
same bug). It's just that the _basics_ of your worldview are beliefs and
wrong assumptions that do not correlate with reality. That's why I wrote
"your fundamentals are built on sand". The building itself may be made of
steel concrete, but it's still no safe place to live in.

Maybe I will dissect the Extropian Principles some other day. For now, I
just advise you not to be too one-sided. Revise the basics of your thinking
often, for if they are wrong, all further work will be negatively biased.
You probably guessed that I mainly refer to the idea of free markets. For a
start, don't evaluate whether they are good or bad but whether they are
pratically possible in today's political and economic power structures. You
have agreed with me in the past that today's big industry supports
government because they get in trouble without them. Do you really think you
stand any chance against The Powers That Be [TM]?

Of course I also refer to your idea of individual freedom, which has other
problems. If people are uneducated, they will make the wrong decisions --
you can either force people to do the right things, which is tried in
current systems, or you can educate them better.  *Or* you just leave them
do anything they want to do and watch the world go to hell. Guess which path
I would take. And -- of course -- I refer to the idea of freedom itself,
which is only possible in a physical sense. There is no freedom of mind, no
free will or whatever you call it. Decisions are dependant on information.
You can make the masses think what you want if you got the media.

Then there's this strange desire for immortality, which I do not oppose but
cannot understand. You get immortal through your deeds, not through your
biological existence. If you live forever but achieve little or nothing,
what's your immortality worth? Then there's Extropy itself, the idea of
bringing order into the universe, colonizing space & building up space
industry. Most of these ideas are either derivated from the false free
market meme or from old thinking (strive for room to live in, colonize other
continents).

That's the most common meme bugs in Extropian thinking. There are others,
less common ones, like the gun advocacy and the cryo discussions. They are,
however, not characteristics of Extropy. The beliefs above are, they are
part of the Extropian ideology (even if not clearly expressed, they are
commonly shared).

But if you do not even allow criticism on the list, these points will never
be discussed and revised for most Extropians. If you give me a tag to
include in messages criticizing Extropian thinking, I'd be happy. This way,
they could be easily filtered for those who just want to believe. Why do you
think am I still here? Because I hate you all so deeply? Certainly not. But
we'll have to fix a lot of basic stuff before we can start serious
discussions on this list.

Regards,
Erik Moeller

PS: I wish you long days and peaceful nights -- may your sleep be better

Oh, well then, I'd say you qualify not as an atheist but as a militant
agnostic.  Heh.

FWIW, and in contrast to your views, I harbor close relations to many, many
theists.  Although I find their judgements about matters theological quite
dicey, that by no means prevents me from respecting their opinions about other
things.  Sometimes I even think that their theological notions merit
respectful treatment.  Think that's heretical?  Get this:  I even know and
respect many *statists*!

I suppose that tolerance for ideological differences varies widely; I often
find that I enjoy the frisson that comes from rubbing up against different
opinions (even woefully misguided ones).  When it comes to intellectual
companionship, I would rather talk with someone who gets things wrong in
interesting ways than I would with someone who agrees with me in
stultifyingly.

I tried reading the entire New Testament, and was appalled at the things
that are supposed to be taken for granted by the reader. The way life back
then was described was unreal. It almost reads like some sort of satire..I
gave up somewhere in the middle.

The Old Testament reads like bad science fiction mixed with soap operas,
with a bit of Conan the Barbarian thrown in.

All religions are odd in some way. Some are more genteel than others,
though. Fundamentalists of any stripe tend to be extremists in all their
dealings, I find..

There are few, if any, free markets today.  There will be few, if any, by
sunrise tomorrow morning.  This does not demonstrate that there could not
be or should not be a lot more free markets in the future.

Frankly, yes, and I'm not alone.  Yes, BECAUSE I'm not alone.

>*Or* you just leave them

Obviously, we don't think the world goes to hell when the people can have
what they want.  Why?  Because people don't want their world to go to hell.
 So instead they take steps to protect themselves from others who would
harm them, and work with others to make their own lives better.  As a
result, the world gets better, not worse, when people can do what they want.

>There is no freedom of mind, no
>free will or whatever you call it. Decisions are dependant on information.
>You can make the masses think what you want if you got the media.

Partly right, partly wrong.  I'm a soft-determinist: I think that you have
free will if you do not know your own fate.  However, with respect to the
media, CAN I actually make the masses think what I want, given control of
the media?  It seems to me that in most places where the government has
taken control of the media, most people don't believe the media, especially
with respect to the government.  (Singapore leaps to mind.)  So I think
you'd have to defend this a little better.

My immortality is worth nothing if I don't do anything with it.  That's why
none of us wants to become immortal and then do nothing forever.  :)
Personally, I want to become immortal so I can do MORE "deeds" with my
life, achieve more, build more.  I also doubt the meme that a well
remembered dead man is not dead.  This is at best a misleading metaphor,
and at worst a euphemism.

Actually, I know several anarcho-socialists who think it would be fun to
visit Mars and to explore the rest of our galaxy, at least one of whom
would like to build a city off planet.  Not because it's too crowded on
earth or because there isn't enough here to live for, (I think there is, so
do they,) but because it's an exciting idea.  This is not a free market
phenomenon, nor is this the argument from overcrowding.

>But if you do not even allow criticism on the list, these points will never
>be discussed and revised for most Extropians.

This is not the only place where I talk about extropianism, and I DO
endorse criticism.  Why do you presume that whenever we try to have a
positive conversation on extropy, we're trying to crush its critics?

>If you give me a tag to
>include in messages criticizing Extropian thinking, I'd be happy.

This bears some merit.  I recognize that this list is for positive
discussion, but would it hurt much to change the policy, adding that people
who want to criticize extropianism should have to add the subject prefix
"ANTI:" to their posts?

   IAN: Yes, I came within an inch of suggesting
   that maybe the "Mars face" deal was a NASA
   conspiracy for exactly that reason, since 
   it would compel people to want to send a
   satellite to Mars, and thus to finance NASA.

   For NASA to suppress information about Mars
   life would be antithetical to its own interests.

>entirely under the control of the believer to believe or not to believe,

Wrong. The believer does only have the illusion of control of what he
thinks, just as any human. Consciousness is not really control, just the
illusion of it. Information processing is what counts, and it is entirely
handled by the brain, without any control. If I feed you with the right
information, I can make you anything I want. This would require a LOT of
experience and a very big brain, though. A posthuman could do it.

>and second, it is entirely within the believer's power to stop listening to
>the atheist.


It's usually within his freedom of actions, unless he is tied to a tree. But
he may not want to, because he believes that nothing can shake his
worldview. For example, Christians usually don't think much about Jesus'
historical existence, they just believe in "what is written" and what they
are told. And when you tell them about the historical Jesus, they might be
fascinated at first. But when a fanatic Christian realizes the full
implications of the Dead Sea Scrolls, everything is possible. From Amok to
Suicide.

Wrong assumptions, wrong conclusions.

Wrong assumptions, wrong conclusions.

Maybe the word 'leader' is too strong. I meant to imply that people have
centered around Max and his ideas, many of these people absorbing these
ideas without deeper consideration (they cannot consider them, because
criticism of the basic ideas is forbidden on this list, and with whom should
they discuss them if not with the Extropians themselves?). I did NOT mean to
imply that you are all following Max and his 'orders' sheepishly and I
apologize if it has been understood this way. The right expression is
probably 'guide', not 'leader'. Would you agree that Max More has been a
guide for you?

>Cults claim to be true by assumption.  They

>Extropy is not a cult.

If I look at the discussion policy here, I get an opposite view. Your
fundamentals are considered as being simply right and you do not want to
discuss them. By saying "go to a different list", you do not, as you have
tried to convince me, just redirect traffic somewhere else. No other list
but the Extropian mailing list is read by so many Extropians -- this is
obvious. On the other hand, discussion of Extropian views would be totally
inappropriate on the transhuman mailing list, as many of the people there
are not Extropians and have rejected the Extropian ideas long ago. The
Extropian mailing list is the only list where the fundamentals of Extropy
can be discussed. Disallowing it is cultish.

>(13 deserves a bit of defense, but only a bit:  The "Extropian Principles"

You could add such a note to the Bible, too, without having to be afraid
that it would have any effect, because the majority would reject any
changes. And I bet that the basic Extropian Principles will remain mostly
unmodified for the next decades.

Sounds good.

Understandable. That's the missionary role of your cult :-)

See above.

Because my mail contained mainly opinion and little facts. It was not
criticism but critcism of not being allowed to criticize. It was written
without any source, without any document refered to. I agree that such
provocative postings should be kept to a minimum. I am opposing your
non-criticism policy, and I used harsh words to do so.

>>Of course I haven't even started to seriously criticize Extropy.
>
><quivers with fear>

Don't. As it looks now, Max would rather remove me than allow anything like
this. I am not on the transhuman list and I will not resubscribe because I
cannot keep up with the traffic (it was very high when I was subscribed the
last time), so that probably means that you can have your little party
without me.

   IAN: The power of a right idea properly presented is
   more powerful than lots of money and The Powers That 
   Be that have it. Of course, the ability of bad ideas
   to overcome good ideas by lots of money is still there.

   One can show that the best case out of a set of cases
   is that the Govt, the "The Power That Is," killed the 
   230 people found dead, and because it IS the best case
   out of a set of cases, many people will believe it and 
   then the "power of a right idea" wins! But The Powers
   That Be aren't going to take it sitting down.  Their 
   money can reach 1000x more people than the little guy
   with the right idea, and with that extra power they 
   can pound the little guy into the ground with false
   and misleading information. I know this first hand.

   So it could be that Power CAN defeat right ideas.
   BUT, I found that it was believing that that gave
   the Power its power over me, since I tried to run
   from the power, and that was a nearly fatal error.
   I think that pessimism feeds and fulfills itself.
   If you think all hope is lost, THEN it will be.

If we stay with the analogy, those were just slaps in the face. Not polite,
but it can wake people up. I would be more careful with posting a complete
analysis of free markets and their implications on this list, although I do
not think that you are *that* far from reality.

I agree with what you say about religions. But I prefer to fight the
institutions than to fight their followers. What's the use in destroying the
beliefs of a happy family? If the institutions vanish, the religous cults
will be reduced to a toleratable minimum. I do my best to collect facts
about the church and the crimes of religion (knowledge monopolization in the
Middle Ages, the crusades, Vatican participation in the Holocaust,
Jasenovac, the role of the church in Ruanda, abortion, prevention and
overpopulation, maybe even the shroud of Turin fake). If you want to destroy
religion, you gotta do it slowly.

I never said that Lee Daniel Crocker wants to destroy anybody's lives, I
just said that it could happen and this would contradict with the idea of
non-coercion.

>Retract what you say, or else prove it. Otherwise I *will* have you removed

I retract from saying that you are the Extropian leader. Sorry, this was the
wrong choice of words.

Not really. I just see a danger in locking out people with strongly
differing opinions. I did not want this debate, it is a waste of time for
both of us, but I don't want to be mistaken. If you allow me to question the
basics of Extropy on the list, I propose that I will restrain myself to
posting criticism founded with facts instead of my usual rant. Is this OK
for you?

Erik Moeller

I'm looking for a list of company's (Alcore included) which are providing this
service. Can someone point me at a website or resource that has a good list?

Also, I'm looking for a similar comprehensive list of Prosthetic manufacturers.
Both Bionic and solid form.


Any suggestions?

Prof. Nadia Thalmann
Prof. Daniel Thalmann
Bernie Roehl, and other members of the VRML H-anim group.

The Metaborg Consortium is an emerging international initiative which
aims
to bring together the principal v-humans standards activities, so that
software subsystems from different developers can be integrated into
composite v-humans ('Metaborgs') and readily incorporated into
applications. The Consortium will produce and demonstrate reference
implementations of multiple-source virtual humans, define standard APIs,
and guide the formal standards-making processes.

Initial participants comprise the research labs and standards groups
represented by the speaker panel, together with Prof. Loftin's VETLab at
the University of Houston, which has agreed in principle to act as the
primary independent integration, administration and support center for
the
Consortium. Other Executive Members of the Consortium are expected to
comprise major applications developers. There will additionally be
membership categories for academic and commercial groups interested in
participating or receiving information.

In this session the panelists will outline current standards activity,
discuss integration requirements, problems and opportunities, and seek

Is anyone here familiar with the writing of Julian Huxley? He really
suggest the first transhumanistic philosophy in his various writings,
although he did think of himself more as a humanist that embraced
change. As far as I can tell, he coined the term transhumance when
discussing his own bran of humanism, called EVOLUTIONARY HUMANISM.

Any takers?

Over the last several years I have become a big advocate for
free-markets.  However, there has been some nagging questions that I
have yet to answer without resorting to some form of socialism in order
to solve.  Can any free-market advocate answer any and/or all of the
following questions:


1) Is there a single field which is intrinsically safe from automation
in the course of the next 20-30 years?  If you can think of more fields,
please elaborate.

2) Are these remaining fields if any, sufficient to employ the majority
of humanity?  If not, what will the rest of humanity do in order to
survive?

3)  For those who are unemployed and do not have sufficient investment
income, is death the inevitable result?  If not, how will they survive?

4) Will most people alive today be able to save enough before their jobs
become automated?

5) If how much money one has saved is the the key to surviving
automation, does this not portend very badly for young people who have
had less time to save for their forced retirement?  If this is true,
does this mean that the future is going to be populated almost entirely
of rich and old people and their children?

Damn spellchecker. The term I believe he coined was transhuman, NOT
transhumance. I feel really silly that my post was so confusing.

Huxley coined the term `humanism'.  Interestingly, `transhumance' means
moving your livestock every season to a different region, usually up and
down mountain slopes.  Bran means moving your bowels frequently.  Sorry, it
must be this muesli.

The following is from a 1957 (reprinted in 1968) article by Julian
Huxley:

	Human life as we know it in history is a wretched makeshift, rooted in
ignorance; and....it could be transcended by a state of existence based
on the illumination of knowledge and comprehension.....
	The human species can, if it wishes, transcend itself--not just
sporadically, an individual here in one way, an individual there in
another way, but in its entirety, as humanity. We need a name for this
new belief. Perhaps _transhumanism_ will serve: man remaining man, but
transcending himself, by realizing new possibilities of and for his
human nature.


The 1957 version can be found in a book called _New bottles for new
wines_ printed by Harper & Brothers.

The 1968 version can be found in an article called TRANSHUMANISM in the
_Journal of Humanistic Psychology_, 8(1).

See my post earlier today (4/24) on the "abolition of work."  Jobs would
only vanish if supply outstripped demand.  This does not seem likely in the
near future.  Even as output keeps increasing thanks to increased
automation, demand for labor keeps increasing at least as fast, if not faster.

First of all, I should state that I am one of those economists who believes
that unemployment happens by choice; that workers rationally choose to be
unemployed (except when there is a legally enforced minimum wage).  Most
people find this antithetical to their current worldview, so it will
require a bit of defense.

First, I assert that anybody could work as a volunteer if they so desired.
This is not what most would consider a job, but the fact is that they could
do so and would have no trouble at all finding people who would appreciate
their service, if not pay them for it.  So I take it as self evident that
there is ample (if not infinite) demand for free labor.  :)

Next, I adopt the law of demand, which simply states that the market will
demand a quantity of a given good based upon its price, and that the higher
the price of a good, the fewer the market will wish to buy, all else being
equal.  It is this law which is normally used to presume the existence of a
demand curve in microeconomic markets.  It is represented like this:

Wages |\_                         
      |  \_         
      |    \_     
      |      \_ 
      |        \_
      |          \_
      |            \_
      |              \            
      ----------------------
            Employment

This graph simply repeats what I said above, only visually.  When wages are
low, or zero, the amount of employment demanded is great.  However, as
wages increase, less and less employment is demanded, up until the point
where wages are simply so high that no workers are demanded at all.

Finally, I assert that there is a minimum wage which almost no workers will
accept.  This is also self-evident.  Just as most workers will not work for
free, they will also refuse to work at the wage of one cent per year.
(Though in some post-colonial nations, it's getting pretty close.)
However, the point is that they COULD work for this wage; they just choose
not to.  Similarly, we can represent this with a supply curve, based on the
law of supply which states that the greater the wages paid, the more
employment workers are prepared to put out.  Set against the demand curve,
it looks like this:

Wages |\_           _/ <-- supply
      |  \_       _/
      |    \_   _/
   W* |______\_/
      |     _/^\_
      |   _/  |  \_
      | _/    |    \_
      |/      |      \ <-- demand
      ----------------------
              E*
           Employment


Almost no workers work for 0 wages, while more and more are willing to work
as wages increase.  Eventually, the supply curve intersects the demand
curve.  Workers would be prepared to work at a higher wage than where these
intersect, but there is no buyer who demands labor so much that they are
willing to pay that wage.  Similarly, no buyer can cut wages lower that the
supply curve without cutting back the number of workers employed.

So as you can see from these assertions, there should be no involuntary
unemployment, (except for temporary or "frictional" unemployment which may
result from, say, having been fired VERY recently).  X workers will not
accept wages lower than wage W, but the market only demands Y workers at
wage W (where Y is less than X); therefore, X - Y workers will simply
refuse to work.

In saying this, I am not saying "Oh, those silly poor.  They COULD have a
job if they'd just turn the other cheek and accept a lower wage," because
quite frankly some wages are just so low that they are simply not worth the
effort, particularly to someone who is starving or who must support a
hungry family.  1 cent per year, for example, is not worth the effort, and
I would not consider someone lazy for not accepting it.  Unemployment is
real, and the ability of a person to feed themselves in many cases may not
be within their grasp.  I'm not trying to say that the poor are poor
because they are lazy.

However, I DO contend that we should stop examining the question from the
perspective of "where are all of the jobs going?" and instead ask ourselves
the question "why are wages so low?"  Because, as I think I have shown, the
jobs go when the wages drop, and the jobs reappear when wages increase.  In
other words, if buyers were prepared to pay more for the same employment,
more workers would be willing/able to work at that wage.  What this would
mean is an increase in the over all demand curve, which might look like this:

      |\_
      |  \_
      |    \_
Wages |\_ -->\_     _/ <-- supply
      |  \_    \_ _/
   W* |____\_ ___*_
      |______\_/ ^ \_
      |     _/ \_|   \_
      |   _/     \_    \_
      | _/       | \_--> \_
      |/         |   \     \      
      ---------------------------
                 E*
           Employment

So what we see here, and which was my whole point, is that so long as
demand keeps growing, more and more workers will be employed.  For
comparison, automation leads to an increase in the aggregate supply curve:
more total output at a lower price; as a result, the wage level drops in
order to be able to compete with the low cost of capital; eventually, the
wage is so low that it's not even worth going to work.

So what can we do about this?  As noted, if demand for labor keeps
increasing, then we can keep unemployment low.  Alternately, if we can
increase wages by any other means, this would also decrease unemployment.
One good way to deal with this is through education, which increases the
wage which people can get on the market.  Finally, by keeping the price
level low (ie avoiding inflation,) workers will find it increasingly
acceptable to accept a lower wage, because the price of goods will remain
low, and will keep getting lower if automation does everything it's
supposed to do.

And luckily for the unemployed, the free market is already out to do all of
these things for us; though perhaps not as quickly as we might like.  The
demand for all goods is increasing, particularly as the population
increases, people get more ambitious, and advertising gets more prevalent.
Moreover, the poor's income/consumption adjusted for inflation as a general
trend is rising, and continues to rise and fall with the growth of the
economy (which, for now, is strong).  Similarly, the poor do see the value
of education, and the income effect can be seen most readily in people's
demand for education.  College enrollment is many times what it was earlier
in this century, and other low cost sources for education are becoming
increasingly prevalent.  And finally, inflation is at an all time low,
thanks in part to the very automation which you fear, and in part by the
skillful meddling of Alan Greenspan.  (Nota bene, lf-capitalists:
sometimes, when you get REALLY smart people in government, you almost do as
well as you could under competition. :))

So if you're worried about the poor being replaced by capital, stop
worrying.  Instead, we should think about ways we can streamline this
economy and eliminate the impediments to its growth.

The claims are no stronger than those presented by the founders of those

Yes, that sometimes happens, but not nearly as often I as wish it did. It's 
one thing to be deeply moved by your own mystical experience, quite another 
thing to be influenced by somebody else's.  I could be wrong but at least I 
have some criteria for evaluating my own subjective experience and judge its
significance and accuracy. I can't do  that with your mystical encounters 
because such things by definition can not be fully communicated, like trying 
to explain to a man blind from birth what the color red looks like. 
It's logically possible (but I wouldn't bet the farm on it) that a mystic 
somehow has access to information that can't  be obtained by the scientific
method. It's also logically possible that the  mystic just has indigestion, 
we have no way of telling if he's correct or not, so there is (almost) no 
point in listening to him. In the unlikely event that I ever have a mystical 
experience I intend to keep it to myself, no point in making  a fool of 
myself by trying to talk about things that can not be communicated.

I must admit I could be wrong about all this, I was once. At one time I 
thought  all mystics were fools, then I read a great book called 
"The Tao Is Silent" by Raymond Smullyan and it was a revelation to me,  
Smullyan is a mystic and he didn't convince me, but he's certainly no fool. 
I still think most are however.
                 

          >[mystical experiences] are frequently conceptualised and framed in        
          >terms that take language to its very boundaries. But so too do QT         
          >and much of mathematics.  
                 

But there is an important difference, some pretty abstract mathematics are 
used in quantum mechanics and the mental models it asks us to form have 
little relation to those we're accustomed to, but the predictions it makes, 
even if sometimes they're only probabilities, are anything but vague; 
an electron makes a spot on a phosphorus screen or it does not, a photon 
makes it through a polarizer or it does not. It is for this reason that I 
prefer a brand of mysticism that's repeatable and consistent. There is a  
name for that type of mysticism, it's called science. IF voodoo could  
predict how variations in doll manufacture effected  performance of the curse, 
and if a Fundamental Theorem Of Voodoo could  determine the shape of the
"needle penetration of doll versus distress of  victim"  plot, then voodoo 
would be as much a science as quantum mechanics.

The important difference between magic and science is NOT that one deals in  
chants, incantations and crystal balls and the other deals in equations,  
lines of computer code and electron microscopes. The difference is that one  
works and the other doesn't.

If I thought that was true then I'd be a very religious man, as would anybody

That's exactly the problem, as hard as I try I can find no depth or subtlety  
in religious ideas. They take everything that is unexplained  and mysterious, 
rap it up in a big package, paste a label on it called "God", and  then  
refuse to pursue the matter any further because they insist the problem is 
solved. If their God would be asking himself the same deep questions that we 
do (and he would be, like "why have I always existed, why haven't I always  
not existed?") then the problem have not been solved, just kicked upstairs.

This is valid.  I think you still accept axiom 1 with the provisions
provided; I think you would agree that force is possible if and only if the
coerced are not under control in the given situation.  However, you contend
that 2 and 4 are false, and therefore conclusions 3 and 5 are unsound.
Since 2 is less defensible than 4, I'll leave 2 alone for the time being
and focus on 4.

It is difficult, if not impossible, for me to demonstrate my ability to
choose what I believe.  After all, I could TELL you that I believe
something differently, but how would you know it empirically?  However, I
seem to be able to demonstrate my control over whether I listen to
something or not by, say, turning on or off the television, or by
observably listening or not listening to someone else.

However, this is not a sufficient demonstration.  I think we both take it
as an axiom that I am only capable of exercising this form of "control" if
I WANT to do so, and I presume that you would argue that my desires are NOT
under my control.  I may listen or not listen only as my desires dictate,
and my desires may be given by circumstances beyond my control.

In this case, I think we are arguing about different definitions of
control.  I would say that the ability to choose between alternatives
according to my desires is a suffficient condition to say that I control my
decision.  You would disagree, arguing that I do not control my desires,
and it is my desires which dictate my decision; therefore, I do not control
my decision.

I will assume, for the purposes of discussion, my definition of "control,"
which I will set in quotes because it is obviously not agreed upon.

- From a utilitarian moral standpoint, I put forward that "coercion"
(which, according to axiom 1, is characterized by a lack of "control") is
important because people are made fundamentally better off when they get
what they desire, and that "coercion" restricts what people are able to get
for themselves.  However, if we assume your definition of control, then
coercion has an ambiguous effect on a person's well-being, even from a
utilitarian standpoint.  Coercion is not necessarily wrong, if we accept
your definition.

I put forward that under your definition, the atheist IS coercing the
believer; but that this is irrelevant from a moral standpoint, because
coercion is not necessarily wrong.  Whereas, under my definition,
"coercion" is necessarily wrong, but the atheist is not "coercing" the
believer.

So we can choose one of either:

A
2.1)  Axiom.  Reducing the well-being of others is morally wrong.
2.2)  Axiom.  A person's well-being is reduced when they cannot get what
they desire.
2.3)  Definition.  Coercion prevents people from getting what they desire.
2.4)  Therefore.  Coercion is morally wrong.

OR

B
2.1)  Axiom.  Reducing the well-being of others is morally wrong.
2.2)  Definition.  Coercion does not reduce the well-being of others.
2.3)  Therefore.  Coercion is not necessarily morally wrong.  

Either way, what the atheist is doing is not morally wrong, and that's what
I had originally intended to prove anyway.  :)

Other people on other lists; alternately, HERE, to some degree.
(Particularly if we implement that ANTI:  tag...  Eh?  Anybody?)  Note that
criticism IS happening as we speak.  :)

Perhaps, but I have an awful lot of guides in this world.  For example, I
had not previously considered the above argument before you made it.  My
first reaction was simply to presume that I could demonstrate that you were
wrong by not listening to something.  However, upon deeper reflection, I
realized that you had a deeper point, one which was not so easily
disproved.  To some extent, I consider you a "guide," for this evening, by
helping me to rethink the question in a way which I had not considered it.

So, yes, I'd say that Max More has been a "guide" for me.  However,
considering that you have also been a "guide," this isn't really a
particularly strong claim.

<sigh>  Look, you might try to argue that my desire to discuss them was not
under my control, but the presence of two non-trivial replies to your
postings should sufficiently evince that I DO want to discuss them.  I WANT
to discuss them, with you and with others, somewhere else.  Is this
closed-mindedness?

Are you trying to tell me that extropy can be discussed in one place, and
one place only, and that this is it?  Please defend this assertion; it is
certainly not self-evident to me.

The Extropy Institute only BEGAN in 1992, and already the "Extropian
Principles" have undergone several revisions.  To my knowledge, the
majority of extropians did not reject the changes in each revision.  How
can you then claim to know what will happen in the next ten years, which is
more than 150% of its current lifetime???

As Max pointed out (in a much cruder fashion than I would have liked), you
have in no way proven that extropianism is a cult.  I think we're all
anxious to see this proof, ideally in a syllogism like mine.  Please
provide some substantial proof that extropianism is a cult or stop making
that assertion.

As I noted, I'm still in favor of an ANTI: tag.  Any takers?

I would love to read your "aboliton of work" post, but I just re-joined this list
a few hours ago.  Could you re-send it to me?

Wow, as for the rest of your post, it is very well written and thought-out.
However, perhaps I'm missing a key element to your argument, but I somwhow missed
how it addresses the trend of increasing automation.  My concern will take some
explaining:

Here are some job sectors that will most likeley no longer require humans over the
coming years:

1) The Retail Sector:  This sector employs 10's of millions of people.  With the
advent of e-commerce and online stores, retail store fronts will find it
increasing difficult to compete with online direct channel lines - they are
cheaper because they cut out the costs of physcial store infrastructure and
distributor chains.  Car dealers are a good example of a punishing buying
experience that most people would rather avoid.

2) The Service sector - online banking and automated tellers will almost
completely obsolete the need for phyical banks and human tellers.  Banks are just
itching to jump into the online e-commerce revolution.  Consider the demise of the
postal service, as
telecommunication is taking hold.

3)  Industrial Workers - of course this sector is an obvious one that has already
succumbed to automation.  Either manufacturers will resort to automation as it
becomes increasingly cheaper or rely on cheaper and cheaper labor in desperate
third-world countries.  Whichever is cheaper.  However automation is getting
cheaper and more sophisticated all the time.

So here is my question:

With the 100's of millions to be displaced by this sophisticated automation, what
kinds of jobs will they be able to do instead?  Are you suggesting that eventually
all of us will become doctors, sceintists, engineeers, designers, artists and
writers?  Because those are the only types of jobs that I can see that will be the
last to succumb to automation.

Hi Tom,

I enjoyed your response more than any
I've seen so far. It makes me happy to
know that people such as you live on
this planet. I sure would like to meet
you if you ever happen to find yourself
in Northern California, please stop by
(no kidding).

Cheers,

I haven't seen any copy of it (I would really like to read it too),
but there is an excerpt at

Not much, but at least a little.

Likely hard to do, there are a lot of firms working in this
area. Biomedical technology is a funny field, there are a few giants,
but also hordes of small, high-tech firms doing great jobs in
specialized niches. Try doing a web search, looking in Yahoo or
possibly taking a trip to a medical store and look at the manufacturer
labels.

Taking a look at the presence of what you call "free markets" now and in the
past however gives us an idea of how likely such a system is. Learn from
history.

>Frankly, yes, and I'm not alone.  Yes, BECAUSE I'm not alone.


A little known part of German history is the German revolution from 1918 to
1919. Hundreds of thousands of workers in Germany protested against the
power elite after WW I. They were mainly defeated with propaganda ("Jews
caused the World War"), but some protests were simply shot down. They wanted
a mild form of socialism, nationalization of some big enterprises. The
German foreign minister, Walther Rathenau, was a main initiator of the
treaty of Rapallo, which was made in 1922 and where Germany and the Soviet
Union agreed on economic cooperation and the renunciation of reparation
payments. Rathenau was killed by nationalists on the 24th of June 1922.

Just one example of a failed revolution. You could also look at the
1968-movement, which was defeated with propaganda -- again.

And now a few hundred persons want to change the world economic system. And
they think that they will succeed because they are not alone. Sorry, even if
you were a million people, you could not succeed.

>Obviously, we don't think the world goes to hell when the people can have

Some people want that. Not to hell, but to heaven. It is called the
apocalypse.
Many of these people are in high power positions.

The other problem is local power. In a decentralized market, you have local
powerlords. Some of them could easily get hold on nukes, biological and
chemical weapons.

Why are there people who harm others?

In Ruanda, it was sufficient to kill about one million Tutsi (CIA

What nonsense. People believe whatever they are told. There are really
enough examples for this.
The Vietnam war, the Gulf war, WW I, WW II, the Watergate affair,
*anything*. There's no chance
that Saddam's people would ever revolt against him unless he loses control
of the media.

This is obvious. Most Scientologists would probably also be annoyed when
Scientology was called a cult by others.

IAN: It's an easy cheap shot. Unfortunately
  any group with a set of principles and unique
  beliefs can be framed as "a cult." The more
  unique the beliefs the more easily framed.

  But, clearly, no honest person could ascribe
  to the ExI any of the attributes of a cult,
  such a brainwashing, unswerving obedience,
  surrender of one's possessions... So the
  charge is just a baseless and malicious
  insult intended to inflame, don't let
  it. It is a meme that feeds off the
  energy of the inflammation caused.

Let's clear the definitions first.

cult n, often attrib [F & L; F culte, fr. L cultus care, adoration, fr.
colere to cultivate--more at wheel] (1617) 1:
formal religious veneration: worship 2: a system of religious beliefs and
ritual; also: its body of adherents 3: a religion
regarded as unorthodox or spurious; also: its body of adherents 4: a system
for the cure of disease based on dogma set
forth by its promulgator <health ~s> 5 a: great devotion to a person, idea,
object, movement, or work (as a film or
book); esp: such devotion regarded as a literary or intellectual fad b: a
usu. small group of people characterized by such
devotion -- cul.tic adj -- cult.ish adj -- cult.ish.ly adv -- cult.ish.ness
n -- cult.ism n -- cult.ist n -- cult.like adj

(Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition)

I am referring to definition number 2: a system of religious beliefs and
ritual, its body of adherents.

A system

    (the ExI)

of religous beliefs

re.li.gious adj [ME, fr. OF religieus, fr. L religiosus, fr. religio] (13c)
1: relating to or manifesting faithful devotion
to an acknowledged ultimate reality or deity <a ~ person> <~ attitudes> 2:
of, relating to, or devoted to religious beliefs
or observances 3 a: scrupulously and conscientiously faithful b: fervent,
zealous -- re.li.gious.ly adv --
re.li.gious.ness n

be.lief n [ME beleave, prob. alter. of OE geleafa, fr. ge-, associative
prefix + leafa; akin to OE lyfan] (12c) 1: a
state or habit of mind in which trust or confidence is placed in some person
or thing 2: something believed; esp: a tenet
or body of tenets held by a group 3: conviction of the truth of some
statement or the reality of some being or
phenomenon esp. when based on examination of evidence

    the religous belief in a free will and individual freedom
    the religous belief in extropy which is considered as an ultimate
reality
    the belief in the solution of today's problems through the use of
superior technology

and ritual,

ritual n (1649) 1: the established form for a ceremony; specif: the order of
words prescribed for a religious ceremony
2 a: ritual observance; specif: a system of rites b: a ceremonial act or
action c: a customarily repeated often formal act
or series of acts

    Although it is not obvious, the regular meetings of Extropians could be
considered a ritual.

its body of adherents

    Extropians, obviously.

It is not my fault that cults generally have such a negative image.
Certainly,  "brainwashing, unswerving obedience,
surrender of one's possessions" are not the attributes that make up a cult,
although many cults have such features.

Give me an example for a successful "right idea".

Wrong. Governments can be easily exchanged, and when they are exchanged, it
is not due to the great democracy but due to shifts in power relationships.
The Morgan Banker group owned both US political groups, the Democrats and
the Republicans, for a long time. Presidents can be shot or destroyed with
the mass media. Examples for the former are Kennedy and Lincoln, examples
for the latter are about everyone else, including Clinton. Take a look at
the recent events in Belgium. And read Quigley, Carroll: "Tragedy and Hope".

If I hadn't sent my last mail to the list, you would not have replied. If I
had written something different, you would have replied differently. If you
had written something different in your original posting, I would have
replied differently or not at all. If you hadn't replied, I would have let
the thread die out.

The exchange of information determines our actions entirely. If I had locked
you in a sensory deprivation tank for the first 10 years of your life, you
would probably be an uneducated, extremely aggressive asshole, or maybe a
suicidal pessimist. If you had grown up in a socialist environment with all
its propaganda, you would probably be a socialist today.

Even now, I can determine your future actions regarding this thread with
sufficient likeliness (although or even _because_ now that I've told you,
you would probably act differently than expected)  -- i.e., it is likely
that you would stop the discussion if I called you a mindless troll and it
is -- surprise! -- also likely that you stopped if I said that I agree with
all what you said.

>- From a utilitarian moral standpoint, I put forward that "coercion"
>(which, according to axiom 1, is characterized by a lack of "control")

It is not. Actually, there is *only* coercion, but there are different
degrees and types of it.

- unconscious informational coercion, I would call it soft coercion, like
every normal communication
- deliberate informational coercion, I would call it hard coercion, also in
verbal
- unconscious physical coercion
- deliberate physical coercion

A militant atheist exercises type two, deliberate informational coercion, on
others, although it is often a mix between type one and type two -- he is
not necessarily aware of the degree of coercion he exercises.

>Coercion is not necessarily wrong, if we accept
>your definition.


Definitely.

>I put forward that under your definition, the atheist IS coercing the
>believer; but that this is irrelevant from a moral standpoint,

Depends on the degree and the consequences of the coercion.

No, certainly not. But we are currently breaking the rules of the Extropian

No. I am trying to tell you that the Extropy mailing list is the best place
to discuss extropy. Not the transhuman mailing list, not the sliced-bread

It's only a matter of time before machines can do everything better than any 
human, 20-30 years might be long enough for this to happen, or it might take 
a little longer. I think the jobs most resistant to automation may not be the 
ones that people naively assume. They might not have much bedside manner but 
even today I'll bet a good expert system could diagnose most diseases better 
than most doctors most of the time. On the other hand, no machine yet built 
can drive a truck nearly as well as a nearsighted rookie with a hangover. 
Truck driving in an inherently more difficult task, it just doesn't seem that 
way to us because evolution made us very good at profoundly complex things 
like pattern recognition, an ape that was good at spotting a saber toothed 
tiger hiding in the bushes had lots of descendants, an ape that was only good 
at memorizing long lists of facts did not.

No reason to think that humanity will survive. The probability that in a 
hundred years biological humans as we currently know them will exist anywhere 
in the universe is low. In a thousand years I would rate the probability as 
zero.

I recently said there was one thing in _Contact_ that's been on my
mind recently, now thanks to the flurry of responses there's another. 
At the end of the film the overall message seems to be that science
and religion don't have to be opponents because they both seek to
attain the same goal - truth.  I think this is wrong and is a
fundamental reason for the religious opposition to science.  Science
does not seek "truth" that is the sole aim of religious groups. 
Instead science seeks to develop theory, these theories are judged by
their applications in the real world.  For instance, it doesn't matter
if quantum mechanic's is true or false as long as I can build a
working quantum computer.  I think science needs to make a clearer
distinction between truth and theory, especially in areas that clash
with religious beliefs.  Evolutionary theory has clashed on many
occasions with creationism, I think this is largely due to scientists
wrongly suggesting that creationism is entirely untrue and that
evolutionary theory proves this.  Creationism is not of importance to
science simply because it has no application in it, whereas evolution
has bread artificial life, genetic research, game theory, etc.  This
abundance of applications does not mean evolution is true and
certainly does not mean creationism is false.  But scientists
increasingly "attack" religious beliefs, which means religious groups
have to defend themselves and look at science as an opposing belief
system.

Hi Natasha.

I went back through the extropy archives to find the posts, and
found Ian Goddard's example of Einstein's "travelling on a thought beam"
experiment, which he is often quoted as having come up with as a 16 year
old. Unfortunately, I have a high threshold for believing facts about
Einstein, because there are so many popular urban legends (that he used to
help a little girl with her homework, that he did poorly in school, and
many others).

I'll have a look through the biographies I have to see whether they
mention the light beam example; perhaps Ian could comment on a primary
source if he knows of one. It's certainly a very interesting idea! (I
couldn't find any Einstein examples from Dan Clemmensen, although he did
make an interesting post about the nature of creativity in general.
Perhaps this is what you were referring too).

I do remember that Einstein said (in a note to the mathematician Jacques
Hadamard, who was trying to determine the origins of mathematical
creativity) that his primary mode of thought was non-verbal. I thought
this was especially interesting in connection with the problem of
education, which is largely approached through verbal means.

Einstein also wrote an essay in which he opined that an interest in
epistemology was a characteristic shared by creative scientists.

One thing I find interesting about your list is that it contains two
different types of sources for inspiration. One is the "idea fairy" who
pops, unprompted, into your head on occasion. For me, that oftem means in
the shower, or while out walking, often when some stress has been
relieved. The other sources are more directed -- for example,
one can deliberatiely "brainstorm", to come up with new ideas. This seems
to be a much more directed form of creativity.

One of my favourite authors is Edward de Bono, who has investigated and
invented methods for enhancing an individual's creativity. Two of my
favourite books by him are "Po: Beyond Yes and No", and "I am right, you
are wrong". The latter, especially, synthesizes much of de Bono's 30 odd
years work on the subject. Contains many good ideas for developing
creativity.

CHeers,

Michael Nielsen

No, that's omniscience.

It is debatable whether omniscience necessarily includes complete 
knowledge of the future.

For some possibilities on this -- and a darn good set of books, too,

Whether there is a real god or not, there is little doubt that "God", 
as worshipped, is created in man's image.  Look at the crap Moses 
himself says *he* ordered, and see if it isn't a lot like the crap 
"God" was pulling in the Pentateuch.  Which is reportedly written 
entirely by Moses.

Also there has been some acknowledgement of late that early Judaism, 
through sometime after the original Temple was built, practiced human 
sacrifice.  This is hardly unusual, most religions -- 
specifically including almost all storm-god-based religions -- did so 
at the time.

(Looking at the biblical Jehovah, it's fairly obvious that he's Thor 
with delusions of grandeur.)

All through the Old Testament, it is clear in virtually every book 
that Jehovah is a lot like the guy who was writing that particular.
book.  As another example, Isaiah was the sort of asshole who would 
call down the curse of an almighty and attentive god on a bunch of 
little kids for teasing an old man about his baldness -- and Isaiah's

I found out I was a transhumanist even before I had even heard of Max 
More. (I think it was the site of Anders Sandberg where I first 
encountered the term transhumanist.) Of course I had to come to the 
Extropy website en get a member of this list first to recognize that 
I have a quite extropian philosophy of life myself. 

IMO most people who now call themselves transhumanist or extropian 
already were so before they even knew these terms. 

The most important thing that Max More did was creating the Extropy 
Institute and thereby bringing people with the same transhumanist/
extropian philosophy of life together. Not because they want to 
follow Max More, but because they want to communicate with other 
persons supporting the same philosophy of life.

Whoops!  Here's where I've got to stop you.  Of course extropianism is a
system of beliefs by this definition, but then, so is any philosophy.

However, you neglected the most important part of your point, which is the
definition of FAITH.

1 a : allegiance to duty or a person : LOYALTY b (1) : fidelity to one's
promises (2) : sincerity of intentions
2 a (1) : belief and trust in and loyalty to God (2) : belief in the
traditional doctrines of a religion b (1) : firm belief in
something for which there is no proof (2) : complete trust
3 : something that is believed especially with strong conviction;
especially : a system of religious beliefs

Well, let's run down the list, shall we?  I think I already discounted 1.
Using 2a or 3 as a definition would create a circular definition for the
purposes of our debate, since we looked up faith to define religious.

Most importantly, we do NOT have complete trust in the extropian
principles.  Again, I for one believe in other principles from which
extropianism seems to follow.  I do not "trust" extropianism in any way,
shape or form.  And while you might assert that we believe in these things
prooflessly, you have not proven this at all, and I might just as easily
use it with respect to a Marxist or a Kantian moral philosopher until I had
actually SHOWN that their theories were without proof.

So it seems to me that in order to show that we agree with extropianism
prooflessly, you'll have to disprove it; I hope to give you a run for your
money in the process.  :)

I think al this can be solved in principle. The question is only 
how much time it requires. I think that all intelligent sentient 
beings can be detected in principle. Of course I can't prove that. 
This would equal creating a formal definition of sentience, which 
nobody has been able to do yet. 

You could for example record al the intermediate states of the 
simulation. (When the simulation is deterministic you wouldn't 
even have to do that. You would only have to remember the 
beginning state of the simulation and its total duration.)

Then afterwards, the creator could in principle examine the 
simulation in detail. Dependable on the complexity of the 
sentient beings he wants to detect this examination could 
take a time extremely much longer than the duration of the 
simulation itself. The question is only, does it take longer 
than time the creator will exist.

I expect it will not be that difficult for the creator to 
detect sentient lifeforms in simulations. For example it 
is also not so difficult for humans to detect selfreplicating 
systems and moving systems in the "game of life". Of course 
these current universes are much to small to create sentient 
or even intelligent beings.

Systems in "game of life" worlds can alter their surroundings. 
When they do this in an indirect way, this could be considered 
using tools. I don't see why tools can't also exist in "game of life" 
worlds.

I didn't assume it should be very easy. But it shouldn't be to hard 
to communicate with other intelligent sentient beings. We will have 
enough in common. It should be just as hard as communicating with 
any other intelligent sentient lifeform.

Interesting, where can I find more about these Tierrans?

The idea was they would be resurrected together with other 
individuals form their world. And why should the resurrection 
world be made a weird caricature of their real world. It could 
just as well be made as familiar as possible to their real world.

This whole issue reminds me a bit of the Riverworld saga by 
Philip Jose Farmer. Here all the people who have once lived 
on Earth are resurrected on another planet along the banks 
of an extremely long river. The river is spiraling the whole 
surface of the planet and the river valleys are separated 
by insurmountable mountains. The people are restored with full 
health in 25 year old bodies. When killed they will 
immediately be resurrected at another location. I enjoyed these 
books very much. :->

some
>explaining:

I do understand this concern.  However, there's also lots of evidence that
we should still see lots of humans in many different areas of production,
even in the areas which you consider the most easily automatable.  It
involves the theory of "comparative advantage," originally posited by David
Ricardo.

Suppose 10 robots could make 100 cars in a day or 100 supercomputers, where
10 comparably equipped humans could make only 80 cars in a given day and 50
supercomputers.  Obviously, the robots are better at making cars AND better
at making supercomputers.  They have "absolute advantage" over humans.

However, examine this from a different perspective.  If the humans decides
to make 80 cars, they need sacrifice 50 supercomputers; they can make 1.6
cars for every supercomputer they give up.  However, if robots decide to
make 100 cars, they must sacrifice 100 supercomputers; they can only get 1
car for every supercomputer.  What we see then is that the humans have
COMPARATIVE advantage over the robots in making cars; the humans need
sacrifice fewer computers to make more cars.  In contrast, the robots have
comparative advantage over the humans in making supercomputers.

To demonstrate this, let's see what happens when humans make only cars, and
robots only make supercomputers.  Clearly, the robots and the humans will
get 100 supercomputers and 80 cars.  Whereas if they tried it the other way
around, society gets 100 cars and 50 supercomputers.

What the theory of comparative advantage shows is that trade and
specialization work to increase productivity, even if one producer has
absolute advantage over the other.  While there is ample evidence to
suggest that robots may have absolute advantage over us in all goods and
services (maybe even in programming themselves!), it is profoundly unlikely
that they will have comparative advantage over us in all goods.  So we will
specialize in the goods in which humans have comparative advantage, and
sell them to the robots.  :)

>1) The Retail Sector:  
>2) The Service sector 
>3) Industrial Workers

Also, remember that the jobs aren't vanishing per se, but rather that the
wages are falling.  And what I think you're overlooking here is the
trade-off here between falling wages and falling prices.  Wages are getting
lower and lower, but they are able to buy more and more.  So long as wages
aren't falling faster than the price level, we should be fine.

Sadly, I should mention that the market often gets stuck here, especially
where government is involved.  Rather than accept lower wages, people use
unions and political pressures to force wages higher than they are worth.
This is the REAL source of involuntary unemployment.  If firms find it more
politically acceptable to lay off workers than to cut their wages, or are
unable to accept low wages due to minimum wage laws, then involuntary
unemployment results.  So to say that such transitions are smooth and clean
and costless would be false, and the government doesn't make this any
better.  However, at least in this case the problem seems soluable: change
government policy and you eliminate this problem altogether.

If you're right, and these are indeed the areas in which humans will have
comparative advantage, then yes.  Remember, the increasing automation will
also mean that it will be cheaper and easier to get an education than it
was in the past, and that doing an hour's worth of labor will be worth much
more than it was in the past.  So in the not so distant future we can
expect that people will not only be able to accept lower wages and still
get by, but get an education on the side.

Summary: Paul is concerned about the economic impact
of total automation on humanity. I respond that
total automation implies transhumanity, so he should
refocus his question to the transhuman era or to
the transition era.

Even the most "conservative" singularitans place the singularity
before the year 2030. IMO, unaugmented humans will be completely
economically obsolete. Your questions should therefore be directed
at the economy of transhumanity, and perhaps the economics of the
transition, because there will be no human economy.

The best humanity can hope for is that transhumanity is altruistic,
If so, then transhumans will help humans become transhumans.

There is a real possibility that technology will evolve more rapidly
than
the financial system can react. If your savings consist of productive
assets, then the value of your savings can disapear if the assets become
obsolete. I'm not an economist, but as I understand it the amount of
money you have represents your share of the economy's productive assets.
This is more obvious when your savings are shares of stock, but remains
true in any event. Very rapid increases in productivity caused by
nanotechnology or AI may have the effect of a dramatic deflation. If
so, the rich may not be in much better shape than the poor: Your money
is useful only as feedstock for the nanotech, with exactly the same
value as dirt. On the other hand, the necessities and luxuries of
life will be essentially free, so who cares? On the third hand, you
will be transhuman, so there is no way that a simple human such as
myself can judge whether this will make you happy.

Hi everyone! :-)
I`m looking for german extropians (or at least germans who are interested in
extropy)
who want to discuss about the topics appearing in this mailing list (in
german, of course).
I joined this extropy mailing list some months ago. But it`s quite hard
for me to understand everything, cause my english, as you will recognize, is
quite bad.<g>
If anyone is interested, please mailto: Verdop@gmx.net
thx!

Bye, Verd

PS: I assume there`s no german extropy-website and other information on
extropy, am i right?

Right, of course.  This all makes sense under your definition of control.
However, as noted, I maintain a different definition of "control."  And
again, remember that I'm using MY definition in quotes, to keep them
distinct...

... which it seems you forgot here.  Of course everything is coercive when
there is no control.  However, as you should also be able to see, there is
"non-coercion" under my definition of "control."  I really do understand
your point, even if I disagree with it.

>>I put forward that under your definition, the atheist IS coercing the

See my point about morality below.

>C

THIS, I think, is the axiom over which we most disagree.  *I* would say
that if a person desired to listen and thereby have their fundamentals
destroyed, and they did so, then they would actually be BETTER off as a
result, because they got what they desired.  (By axiom A2.2.)  I would go
on to say that since your axiom does not seem to take this into account,
you have an entirely different system of moral value than I do.  As you may
have already noticed, I am a utilitarian, and believe utility to be
intrisically valuable.  What, precisely, is your theory of morality?

(As a side note, I'm pleased to see that we're so rigorously challenging
each other's assumptions in this debate...  it helps keep the mind alert.)

I've snipped the further discussion aboubt whether you're allowed to
critique here as I'm waiting for someone to reply to the "ANTI:" point.
Also, I'll reply to your "cult" post later today.

  IAN: Erik, what your saying is illogical by the 
  very facts that you concede. Your trying to imply
  that ExI is a member of a subset of cults that even 
  you admit does not exist. IF (a very BIG if) ExI does 
  fall into the set of cults (and by your standards, so 
  would any organization with a set of principles), it's 
  then a member of a subset of cults that does NOT inter-
  sect with the  subset of cults of which cults such as 
  Scientology are a member.  However,  as your reply to 
  Natasha proves, you are implying that ExI is a member 
  of the subset of "bad cults," even as in your latter 
  reply to me above, you admit it's NOT such a member! 

  So your case is both a fallacy (it relies on subset 
  membership that does not exist) and is contradictory, 
  since you both (a) concede that the membership is null
  and yet (b) directly imply that the membership exists.


  It seems to me, Erik, that your simply engaging in 
  gratuitous cruelty against some  very  good people. 
  You argue that ExI falls into the definitional set 
  of "cult," then note that it's not your fault that 
  "cult" has negative connotations, as if your just 
  an innocent bystander in this, and yet then you do
  all that you can to rub that negative connotation 
  in a deeply as you can (as illogical as I've just 
  shown it to be), obviously, simply  BECAUSE  you 
  know it's hurting some very decent people. Why?

  I don't know why you would engage in such cruelty,
  but I would say that such persecution falls into the
  set of "traits of bad cults." Since you most assuredly 
  hold some principles, and since they probably conflict
  with ExI principles, it follows that not only is your 
  line of attack false,  not only is it contradictory
  (since the set membership implied, you admit does 
  not exist), but it's also a contradiction since
  your attack falls in the set you erroneously 
  attempt to frame ExI as being a member of.

Not at all. I just wanted to show that the members of a cult often do not
like to be called members of a cult, and I needed to give an example we
agree on.

You completely and probably deliberately misinterpreted my reply to Natasha.
Although I see fascist tendencies in some of the consequences of Extropian
ideas, especially the free market meme (a wrong subset of the individual
freedom meme, wrong because enterprises are no individuals), I do not think
that the ExI directly supports or conveys such tendencies.

I would not call the ExI a sect, but I would call Scientology a sect. I
would, however, call both cults. Because "cult" is a very broad word, many
groups fit under this description. Most, but not all of them are negative.
The ExI is, in my opinion, negative because it promotes ideas that are,
based on my knowledge, harmful to humanity. That's why I am an
Anti-Extropian. The ExI is, however, not negative because it robs its
members of their possessions, executes brainwashing or has a strong (if any)
hierarchy. AFAIK, none of these attributes apply to ExI.

Some very decent people? Define decent. I indeed said that it is not my
fault that "cult" has negative connotations. These connotations are, again,
brainwashing, loss of possessions, strong hierarchy and so on. That doesn't
make ExI positive, and I never said that I like the idea of Extropy. See my
reply to John Clark's "Words Hurt" for a summary of what I dislike about
ExI. Most of these attributes, however, do not make ExI a cult and one
attribute which I both totally reject and which is "cultish" is Max More's
policy not to allow criticism on this list. As I *am* still on this list,
and criticism has taken place, I am not sure what to think about it now. I
would need an "official" statement from Max on this.

To summarize: Extropy is a cult, but that's not the main reason why it is
negative.

I have no interest to hurt anybody. I don't think that I have hurt anybody.

   IAN: What? You think Religions are seeking truth?
   I'd say that that pretty much defines what they 
   are NOT doing and what science IS doing. Almost
   without except, religions consider their definition
   of truth to be defined, like, case closed. On the 
   other hand, in science the supreme truth, which
   might be the "Unified Field Theory," is yet to 
   be found, and admittedly so. So what is actively
   being sought in science is absolute knowledge of
   truth (that's why people are still researching).
   The "religious seeker" may be looking for truth,
   but virtually any given religion has "found it."

   Religions have truths generally in spite of them-
   selves. Because they had some wise observers at 
   their roots, or along the way. Yet in the broad
   definition that Erik applies to ExI, we could 
   even define science as a religion, since it 
   has principles and de facto rituals. But a
   scientific ritual of investigation seeks to 
   gain new information, whereas most religious
   rituals seek to simply repeat old information.

   There is a difference between science and religion,
   but that difference is not that religion => truth.


>Instead science seeks to develop theory, these theories are judged by
>their applications in the real world.  For instance, it doesn't matter
>if quantum mechanic's is true or false as long as I can build a
>working quantum computer.  


   IAN: That's the principle I see people here
   applying to my holistic theory: "Ya, OK, so 
   it's true, but so what? Does it get a better
   mouse trap, a faster car?" Utility over truth.

   I think that principle, "utility over truth," 
   is actually pretty religious. Religions serve
   a utilitarian purpose to those therein. It gets
   them feeling better, it gives them stability,
   it gives them fraternity, hope, and so forth.
   Show them that the underlying claims of truth
   their religion stands on are false and that 
   doesn't really matter to them, since truth
   is NOT the real goal they are after. So I
   see your definition of the goal of science
   as more fitting to the goal of religion.

   I think it falls apart totally in that I 
   believe that the degree to which science 
   yields material outcomes is the degree 
   to which science has discovered truths. 
   And future benefits from science will
   come from future discoveries of truth.

  IAN: The membership does not exist, not the 
  subset. Also, Erik did not explicitly say that 
  "bad cult" traits are not found in ExI, but
  it was implicit. The best he could cite for 
  "ritual" (a necessary trait of a religion)
  is the holding of "regular meetings." Good
  grief, a baseball team holds regular meet-
  ings, and may even have a set of principles,
  so is a baseball team a religion and thus 
  a cult? If so, that dissolves the word.

  Also, ExI is democratic in nature. Religions
  don't have votes on changing their "Bible."

  Erik, get off this "cult" attack. I think that 
  ExI is always open to construct critique, but
  yours is clearly designed to be destructive.

 What nonsense. People believe whatever they are told. There are really
 enough examples for this.
 The Vietnam war, the Gulf war, WW I, WW II, the Watergate affair,
 *anything*. There's no chance
 that Saddam's people would ever revolt against him unless he loses control
 of the media.

I don't agree.  I remember that government in the US used to be held in rather
hi regard.  In my observation the only people who hold government in high
regard now IS the government and not all of them.  I know some government
(state) employees personally and they are very cynical....it's just that the
job is soooooo easy that they don't want to do anything else...that might
require some effort...so they don't quit.  But their consciousness hurts them
somewhat.

Sorry, I did not mean to. The questions are: Do you want to fight against
"the powers that be"? Are they evil by definition? Or is there maybe a way
that we can change the world by changing their worldviews? Haven't the worst
mistakes in human history, most wars, only been the result of a lack of
education of economic leaders?

Don't preach revolution against governments, it is futile. But during my
work as a journalist I have found that trying to spread the right
information is *not* futile. I have written two important articles against
different internet censorship approaches, which is too coordinated to be a
spontaneous manifestation but must be the movement of one power group in the
US. Especially the first article has generated some impact. Currently, I am
researching the alleged harmfulness of pornography. This is more important
than anything I have written before. You can make a change, but not by
placing yourself in the long line of attackers. Try to help, not to defeat,
lest you won't be defeated. Evolution instead of revolution.

Well, if the mass media is friendly towards government, people are. If the
mass media is skeptical, people are skeptical. If the mass media says that
the president must resign because he received a good blowjob, then the
president *will* have to resign. People are a mirror of the media, media are
a mirror of the people who make them. Informational feedback loops can cause
problems, i.e. those who design the media content can in the end be victims
of their own propaganda.

If the baseball team claims that the ball must be covered with red goo to
fly well, and it does so without any evidence, yeah, then the last missing
feature for it to be a cult, the religious belief in something without
evidence, is fulfilled.

Your red goos are individual freedom, free marketship and extropy.

   IAN: So "some cults are negative" and you think

   Maybe you should also consider such with

   them, not to insult and demolish them.

One also has to contend with the fact that a certain individual in 
this "healthy" state will simultaneously remember:

  * the semi-trailer truck bearing down on him as he lays helpless;

  * the radio announcer talking about the incoming nuclear missiles;

  * the stupid stunt he pulled as a college student, involving the 
ROTC building and a bit of explosive that went off much too soon;
 
  * the college roommate that he talked out of blowing up the ROTC 
building; 

  * the pain of a fatal childhood illness;

  * many years of happy marriage;

  * and several other interesting, mutually contradictory life 
experiences.

If you would describe someone trying to reconcile all these different 
memories -- all of which are true -- as "healthy", then you have a 
much different definition of that term than I do.

Unfortunately, there is another analysis that is at least equally 
valid.

Theism = theos + ism, god + belief.

Atheism = a + theos + ism, absence + god + belief.

The latter can be parsed from left to right (absence applied to god, 
then the whole applied to belief = an affirmative belief that there 
is no god) or from right to left (belief applied to god, then the 
whole applied to absence = no belief on the subject of god).

Or if you really want to be weird, it can be parsed from the outside 
in: god has no beliefs.

Since the languages we are working with here -- Greek and English -- 
typically read from left to right, the left-to-right parsing, which 
gives an affirmative belief that there is no god, is most likely 
correct.

This fits well with another word: agnosticism = a + gnosis + ism, 
absence + knowledge + belief = "I don't know, I believe", read left 
to right.  A right-to-left reading would be, I don't believe in 
knowledge.

You should separate the "cult" discussion from the "principles" discussion.
As I've already written in a private mail to Anders, I am a very lingual
thinker and prefer to use the correct words. And I still think that the word
"cult" applies to the ExI. It doesn't have anything to do with whether the
ExI is positive or negative, it just means using the right terms to describe
things.

I have followed your analysis of the TWA-800 cover-up and forwarded it to my
friends. It was certainly interesting, but on the other hand, you have to
ask yourself what you can achieve with this kind of information? Of course,
you have to understand power structures -- but although I have much
information about the JFK "incident", I will not try to convince anybody
that the CIA are a bunch of killers, liars and generally evil guys. How
could that possibly help anyone?

I am sorry if you feel like I do. I have to admit that my reply to Max was a
bit feverish (especially the "leader" part), and the only thing I can say to
justify that is that I only had 5 hours of sleep and don't like it when
people say that I haven't understood anything. But I don't think that my
last postings were irrational or abusive.

Oh, how much room do I get? Basically, high-quality information is "good",
low-quality information is "bad", but there are several criteria for
quality, one of which is the context in which the information is presented,
and if the context is that you're talking to a fundamentalist lunatic and
you know that the information you present can harm this person, the quality
of your information is not optimal, because you would have to present it in
small, digestable chunks instead of revealing everything at once.

I suggest we cease discussion about the fundamental principles of Extropian
beliefs for now (regarding the definition and evidence for faithfulness), I
will do a in-depth analysis of the Principles as soon as my time allows it,
and it is better to discuss on such a basis than to simply exchange
opinions. And probably less annoying to the rest of the audience.

[Sent to me, so I'm forwarding it -- Damien R. Sullivan]

Bruce Sterling's "Maneki Neko" in Fantasy and Science Fiction  attempts
to recount a world not far from our own when artifical intelligences
use/work with human networks to manipulate political and economic
systems. The discussion you've been having on open networks has been
really interesting to me, but the dialogue has always seemed to assume
that it will be the individual and the national political establishment
battling each other for secrecy control. John KClark assumes that
Tempest technology will not be as effective as quantum cryptography,
while you cite that the physcial infrastructure can always be tapped and
exploited. Codes can be broken by distributed computing and Java is
already being drafted to tap unused cycles on host machines connected to
the world wide web, so I tend to fall on the side of the pessimist when
it comes to secrecy. But having read Sterling's story, as mentioned
above, I began thinking that it might be possible to join a neo-tribal
communications group. I know the idea sounds far out, but Brin's
watchdog seniors and Sterling's anonymous network agents seem to be the
best possible ways for dealing with increasing encryption and
surveillance. These groups balance the power of the state and the
individual in ways that seem constructive. I foresee problems like "My
clique cracked your clique's codes: Nahhh!!" and even possible tribal
warfare like the Hatfields and McCoys or even Scottish clan structure,
whereupon the state would be caled in to finalize the dispute. And if
individuals are hassled by a larger power structure like the federal
government or a criminal syndicate, the tribal group could be called
upon for protection. The individual and the state are not surmounted by
the tribal identity, only complemented. Of course, the federal
government starts tapping everyone now (which John K Clark says is
unfeasible), before these organizations develop, then I'm just whistling
Dixie.

            With thanks, Clay Draper

Ever time I have seen you try to attack free markets with any sort of logic
or empirical evidence, that logic and evidence is flawlessy refuted by
members of this list,(eg. John Clark, Lee Daniel Crocker, Anton Sherwood)
who cite a larger body of contradictory evidence and well-thought-out logic
which supports the benefits of a free market.  

Let me put it in a baseball analogy for better comprehension:  Most of the
people on No-Goo Baseball List(created specifically to discuss baseballs
without red goo, under the recognized *assumption* that red goo is bad)
think that a baseball will fly the best without red goo.  This idea comes
from scientific research, practical experience, and the fact that whenever
a red goo supporter comes on to the list, all his points are easily and
completely rebutted.  You come along, telling everyone that playing or even
thinking about playing without red goo is not only in error, but bordering
on fascism.  You drop a couple book names (maybe Noam Chomsky is a linguist
and a baseball player?), give some vague evidence about how un-gooed balls
are morally repugnant, and throw out a bunch of red-goo propaganda that has
been heard by everyone on the list a million times over.  Your points are
destroyed by evidence, yet you consistently claim that *everyone else* is
faithful to un-gooey balls, that this belief is not supported by evidence,
and that you are doing everyone a favour by revealing
non-gooey-baseball-supporters as cult-members.  You also accuse the creator
of the Extropian No-Goo Baseball List of being a cult leader because he
created a list that does not involve talking about red goo, and because
*some* people on the list have opinions on red goo that contradict yours.  

Do you really think anyone is going to take you seriously using a strategy
such as this? (beside playing silly logic games with your posts ;-)  What
are you trying to acheive?

IMHO, the only thing you are achieving here is wasting everyone's time by
throwing out a statement like "you all belong to a cult" to a bunch of
anti-cultists,(who are justifiably perturbed by such a negative label) then
not backing it up with any evidence, or contorting the meaning of cult
until it basically describes every philosophy ever postulated, including
yours.

ciao,

Geoff.

The claim "I harbor close relations to many, many deities" would have

Yes.  Most of Earth is underpopulated.  We haven't begun on the rest

Ah, yes, and such a look at history would have no doubt
given Benjamin Franklin a good idea as to whether, say,
horseless carraiges were likely.
History is so influenced by accident and starting conditions
that it is practically useless for determining the possible.

"Anybody can manage given complete information.  A good manager can 
manage with incomplete information.  A perfect manager can operate in 
perfect ignorance."

We don't have complete information.  We have to manage with 
incomplete information; to do this we make guesses about the 
incomplete information, we allow safety margins, we hedge our bets, 
and we use a variety of other strategies.  All of these are things 
that the media can't really control.

If the media feed us false information, we can learn from experience 
not to trust the media; then controlling the media has less value.

If we are truly intelligent we will examine the media, find out what 
the media wish us to believe, and use the fact "the media wish us to 
believe xxx" as information in our management of our lives -- whether 
we actually believe xxx or not.

Original Christianity is a direct offspring of Judaism, which is the 
descendant of a storm-god cult within a previous body of religions in 
the same area.  Islam is a direct descendant of another cult in the 
same budy of religions, and heavily influenced by Judaism.

To put it in individual-human terms, Sue Islam was raised living 
right next door to her mother's sister Jude, and now you're asking 
why has the same approach to child-raising as her cousin Chris.

(Original Christianity was soon modified by Mithraism 
and other Greek/Roman religious cults.  But, aside from being a bit 
less harsh, the Greek/Roman religious environment wasn't massively 
different from the religious environment of the mideast.)

Every time I have attacked free markets with any sort of logic or empirical

_Not a single time_, I have received statistics or quoted sources.

Retranslated:

I accuse the creator of the Extropian maling list of being a cult leader
because he created a list that does not involve criticizing Extropy, and
because some people on the list have opinions on Extropy that contradict
mine.

I have retracted from calling the creator of the Extropian mailing list a
cult leader.
I have not retracted from calling Extropy a cult, one of the reasons for
this was that criticism was not allowed on the Extropy mailing list. I am
still waiting for a reply by Max on this to find out the current status, but
right now, it looks good.

I have presented other reasons for calling Extropy a cult, and you say that
I am

>contorting the meaning of cult

Don't you think that Webster's is a valid reference for defining a cult?
I don't care about what you think  a cult is or should be, I care about what
it is defined to be, and by this general definition, Extropy is a cult.
Period. Maybe transhumanism is a cult, too, and the red-goo baseball players
are also cultish. Cults are part of culture.

Dear Erik, only times thanks for the response! I know the Extropianer to some
extent (thus, the principles, in approximately) I look up people, with which I
can discuss on German! The principles of the Extros I find, and which most can I
agree interesting.

Hallo Erik und Verdop, hoffe ich, da Sie viel mehr deutschsprechende Leute

Dieses bildet es einfacher, damit andere deutschsprechende Leute Sie finden.

Gutes Glck,

(A) Creativity will require human effort for the foreseeable future.  
So will a lot of diagnosis and repair work.

(B) Many fields have proven not to be "safe from automation" and as a 
result employ many *more* people than they did formerly.

Babelfishing is a lot of fun, but not *that* useful (you can basically
understand the results, but most high-level information gets lost in
transit). I replied to Verdop via private mail, but he redirected it to the
list, probably by accident.

I'm getting the feeling that I've sent off thousands ofreplies to this list
today. Well, I'm one of those guys that cannot leave a mail unanswered.

You cannot compare technological innovation to social and economic models.
Most social and economic models of today can be found in the far past.
Primitive cultures often have councils or single leaders, the Roman Republic
is often compared to democracy and so on. Although the names differ, there
are not many possible power constellations and economic systems.

World history should give some examples for free markets in larger
societies, if they were possible and useful. According to my knowledge, it
doesn't.

I've been using a Mac for web connectivity and having an awful time. My
browser keeps crashing (hanging) at Yahoo and Hotbot. But when I am
sucessful in connecting and searching, the links usually hang. So I've
been tearing my hair out trying to get in touch with some of these
companies..

I was hoping that the links you'd provide might not crash at connect...

Hmmm... maybe my memory is going.  Unfortunately, I have having
difficulties finding out how bad my memory must really be.  I tried
searching the archives, but I was unsuccessful.  Could someone else do this
for me?  Your posts from the first time you were on this list give the best
examples of what I'm talking about (because I think people took you more
seriously back then, and tended to put work into their posts) 
Unfortunately, when I tried to search the archives, I kept  getting this
"Erik's Fallacy" thread and nothing else.  Also, I searched for "Rick
Knight" and got nothing... does the search function not go back that far?

You've said this many times, and since I am having problems searching the
archives, this isn't a very good example, but it'll do for now (sorry, I'll
get more later)

Ditto.  I'm sure Crocker, Clark, EvMick, et al. can recall simply by the
memory the many times they have successfully rebutted your socialist ideas.
 Unfortunately, my memory is very poor, as you have seen, so I need a
search engine.

And now you call him the "guide" of a cult.  How is that better?  Sounds
like a silly euphenism to me... one created so you don't have to admit you
were wrong.

> I have not retracted from calling Extropy a cult, one of the reasons for

Let's reverse the situation.   You start up a list to discuss socialism. 
You explicitly say "this list is meant to discuss socialism, not
anarcho-capitalism.  Capitalist/Socialist debates take up too much of the
lists content, and are not what the list was created for, therefore, I
would ask that if you join this list, take these discussions somewhere
else.  Those who break the rules will be removed from the list."  Now, I
take my anarchist beliefs to your list and start telling everyone on your
list that socialism is flawed and immoral.  You tell me to stop breaking
the list rules since I voluntarily joined the list after I had read the
disclaimer.  I tell you that you are a cult "guide",  that your mailing
list is a cult, and that the members of your cult "believe" in socialism
which I know is bad for humankind.  How do you reply?

> I am

So you think it is good that Max is allowing you to break list rules, and
annoy pretty much everyone on this list?  Good for whom?  Aren't you the
one always talking about a "common good" or "what's best for everyone"?

Cults involve belief.  The extropian principles have a version number,
implying that they are not set in stone.  Max also states that someone does
not need to adhere to all the principles to be an extropian.  Where are you
seeing these beliefs that make Extropy a cult?  The only belief I see is
yours: you believe that free markets are inherently bad.  I, on the other
hand, am not sure whether they are bad or good.  What I do know is that
every time I see a debate between a socialist and a capitalist, the
capitalist always comes out on top, and the only way a socialist can
convince himself that he has not lost is by playing with the definitions of
the words he uses until it sounds like he wasn't wrong.  What I also know
is that everything I learn in economics (which comes from empirical
evidence) supports the free-market as a superior system.  This seems to
indicate that free-markets are *probably* better, given the evidence I
have.  Who is the cult member here?

> Maybe transhumanism is a cult, too, and the red-goo baseball players
> are also cultish. Cults are part of culture.

That's a fun little play on words, but you are really destroying the
usefullness of the word "cult."  When "cult" becomes synonymous with
"philosophy", then the usefullness of the word is gone, it is just
redundant.  It seems to me this is what you are doing, since I see Extropy
as nothing more(and nothing less) than a very general and brilliantly
adaptable philosophy, based on the evidence at hand.  Max has said himself
that he cannot guarantee that Extropy will always keep up with the evidence
at hand, but that is what he is attempting to do.  If it cannot, it will be
replaced by something else.  I see you giving no better replacement.

l8r,

Geoff.

Details matter.  Universal (including women) suffrage is recent.  The English
common law developed over the past 1000 years.  Fast communications make
things like credit cards and really large democracies possible which couldn't
have happened in the past.

Ideal free markets, no.  Ideal versions of anything are rare.  Widespread 
private property and generally free exchange are common to all materially
prosperous societies.  The freedom varies; so, in positive correlation, does
the adaptability of the society.

Arguing about anarchic free markets may be like arguing about the Singularity
coming in 8 years, catalyzed by a web browser.  Interesting theory, but so out
of whack with current reality that it can't gain acceptance until it actually
happens.

This all seems silly. If true, their plan backfired in some ways.

I think NASA might face equally damaging risks promoting ETs. They could
loose their credibility. Which, in my mind, is a valuable tool for
getting research cash.

        So again, a post comes down to semantics.  According to Erik's
citations of Webster's dictionary, Extropy --not to mention *any* formed group
with objectives-- can be defined as a cult.  However, how the use of this term
is received by the majority of people, is usually negative.  The word has
too much baggage to be used loosely like it has been in recent discussion.
As a result, why use *this* word --which is potentially harmful to the
public view of extropy-- when many other words would do just fine?  Is
there a good reason
to repeatedly use the word "cult?"

Also, I'm interested in contacting any companies who manufacture or R&D
posthuman devices of any kind.

Things that come to mind:

1. Artificial Hearts, and other synthetic organs
2. Digital eyes
3. Futuristic hearing aids/replacments
4. synthetic hair, skin etc..

Suggestions?

ps- thanks for the fine responses on prosthetics.

D'oh!  I was thinking of Julian's granddad Thomas Henry Huxley.

Good to see that quote from Julian H.  He's an extremely important
evolutionary thinker whose cultural thinking has tended to be neglected
lately.  On the other hand, he did (to some extent at least) fall for that
loony fraud Teilhard.

I think the word that Thomas Huxley coined was AGNOSTIC, not humanist.
Anyone out there have an idea?

He really did fall for Teilhard, he did write the preface of one of his
books, but it did mention he was skeptical in the preface. What Julian
Huxley liked was the idea of the Noosphere, that there was another layer
of complexity beyond the geosphere and the biosphere, but the
"thinking"sphere.

Gad, I've really got to get a grip.  I just checked the index to the two
volume Adrian Desmond biography and it doesn't show `humanism'.  August Comte?

 This all seems silly. If true, their plan backfired in some ways.
 
 I think NASA might face equally damaging risks promoting ETs. They could
 loose their credibility. Which, in my mind, is a valuable tool for
 getting research cash.

They keep their credibility when the source of the inquiry of Mars
installations is not from NASA but from outside of NASA. They benefit from
these inquiries because they push exploration.

In order to get from 1 to 3 you must pass through 2.  People will not have
access to nanotechnology if they have already died of starvation from the
automation leading right up to nanotech.  If what your saying is only the
elite of the elite will survive to become transhumans then I could give a shit
about any transhuman economy, thank you very much.

?That would be ideal.  But 'altruism' is one particular value than has been
given a bad rap by several on this list.

This is all very true, but it dodges the question of how the majority of
people will survive just getting to that nanotech transhuman phase.  It's the
sophisticated automation leading up to nanotech that first poses a problem.
Again, you can't get from 1 to 3 without passing through 2.  2 is what I've
been talking about.  How do you survive the *transition*?

Your arguments are very compelling! :-)

In three years, you are the first free-marketeer to address my concerns in a
detailed, precise and substantiated manner.  Thanks for the input.  I'm going to
have to digest your last few posts over the next few days before I can have an
opinion on them.

   IAN: Well, assuming it's a serious theory,
   it's not like they'd promote it under the 
   banner of NASA. But they really wouldn't
   need to promote by any means, since some 
   people would promote it anyway for free.

Dr. Carlotto's animation/morph from the Viking
image of the Mars "pyramid" to the MGS image
is a must see, it shows that the hard-line 
base-line is geometrically perfect around
the base of the entire form. Whatever it 
is, it is indeed an unusual formation:

Erik, 

I go on alert whenever anyone quotes a dictionary in this kind of 
context. Dictionaries are always behind -- they cannot capture all 
usages and they cannot be kept current. Words have connotations, and
those connotations can not be ignored when convenient.

Like it or not, "cult" is now a pejorative. If you don't want anyone
to hear a pejorative tone, you will have to choose another word.

If you meant to characterize extropianism as a secular religion, you
could just say that. Perhaps for some people, extro-trans-humanism is
a low-fat religious substitute (Religion Lite(tm)).

This belongs in the FAQ if it's not there already, it's a hardy 
perennial. My take is that non-religious people use a lot of memes to 
fill the niches vacated by traditional religion, and there's nothing 
wrong with it, especially if they see it for what it is. There is of 
course a trap to fall into, of bringing over blind faith, misplaced 
zealotry, and other baggage from religious conditioning.

IMO, individuals are actually reasonably civil and reasonably altruistic, up
to a point. Each person has a different threshold. As the cost of doing a good
deed goes down, the cost eventually goes below the threshold and the deed
is done. If newer technology makes it easy to help others at low cost,
more help will be provided. Speaking personally, If nanotech provides
a "universal factory box" for me, I'll make another for free and give
it to anyone who asks.

Good, we are in agreement. The transition is the problem. However, you couched
the problem in terms of traditional "rich" and "poor" which IMO assumes a fairly
slow transition. If the transition ruptures the economy, then the rich/poor
axis is not relevant. The nerd/technophobe axis may be more relevant.

If you have time, please sketch out your concept of the transition era, its
length, and its outcome.

My own conception is considered fairly radical. I feel that the existing
economy will take us to the point that a superintelligence (SI) will
emerge effectively overnight. The SI will then do whatever it wants,
with unpredictable results. I hope the SI will ask each human to join
it, either as elements or equals, but I have no way to evaluate the
probability of this.

So, as you see, my concept is a "snap transition." Most economists
appear to believe in an "infinite transition", i.e, that humanity
and human economics will define the economy forever. Others on
this list favor something in between. My point is that each scenario
has a different set of economic problems for individual humans
and humanity in general during the transition.

WHat is to keep the 'integrated' person from having these memories available
in a context similar to a novel, wherein he is the central character? The
memories are all there, but at arm's length, and the book can be put down at
any time..As the personality grows in understanding, more and omer of the
memories could be dealt with in a logical fashion..

I have been aware of the Robotopian Law of Economics for over ten years.

With modern technology, it will soon be possible, in fact impossible to

avoid, to spew out all the goods and services humanity can dream of. .
.and everything will be free and no one will have to work. 

A few days ago, Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape described how
competition and the Internet are falling in line with the Robtopian Law
of Economics exactly as I have been predicting all these years.

"We've got thousands of developers focusing their energy on this,"
Andreessen said. "It's going to prove to be almost impossible to fight
this.

How do you fight it? It's free."

Andreessen Predicts Freeware Push
(04/24/98; 4:42 p.m. ET)
By Lee Pender, Computer Reseller News

Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen predicted a breakthrough year for
freeware today at a meeting of the Massachusetts Software Council.
Netscape released the source code for its Navigator browser at the site
www.mozilla.org in late March.

Since then, Netscape has recorded hundreds of thousands of downloads,
Andresseen said. He predicted freeware, such as the Mozilla project and
the Linux operating system, http://www.linux.org will experience rapid
commercial adoption beginning this year.

"These projects are resulting in software that is more stable and
supports a faster rate of innovation than any software company,"
Andreessen said.

 "It's capturing the hearts and minds of the technology industry like
nothing since the Web.

We're going to see broad-based use of Linux for commercial
applications."

Andreessen pointed to the rapid rate of innovation and development that
results from the collective work of worldwide developers, as one
advantage freeware has over slower-moving products from software
companies.

He also said freeware faces no competition because software companies
cannot create an incentive as attractive as the complete lack of a price

tag.

"We've got thousands of developers focusing their energy on this,"
Andreessen said. "It's going to prove to be almost impossible to fight
this.

How do you fight it? It's free."

As a result, software companies are going to have to create new
incentives in order to attract customers to their products, Andreessen
said. Many software companies will turn to service offerings in order to

make their applications attractive to potential users, he said.

"Software companies are going to have to figure out how to give
something away to start with, in order to get something later," he said.

"The opportunity exists for many software companies to become service
companies."

Andreessen also said the rise of freeware has begun to even the playing
field between his company and rival Microsoft. Microsoft has been
rapidly gaining market share recently with its Internet Explorer
browser, which is currently at the heart of an investigation by the U.S.

Department of Justice.

"It's become much more of a Coke versus Pepsi thing than a Windows
versus Mac thing," he said.

Andreessen took a shot at Microsoft when discussing the future of the PC

industry. He predicted the PC will eventually become a giveaway product
tied to a service contract, usinga plan similar to those that cellular
phone companies now use.

That will happen, Andreessen said, because software development,
specifically by Microsoft, is not keeping up with hardware advancements.

Consumers and organizations will not need to buy new, high-end
PCs,because they can run almost every known softwareapplication on
standard PCs, for which prices are constantlyfalling, he said.

"There's an old saying in the computer industry that Andy giveth but
Bill taketh away," Andreessen said, referring to former Intel Chairman
Andy Grove. "And Microsoft comes out with software that runs much
slower. A modern $800 PC is capable of running everything we know
today."

As a result, the PC itself will eventually experience price drops down
to negligible fees or no price at all, he said.  "PC prices are going to

go straight to zero and below zero,"

Andreessen said. "You start to envision a world in
which you have companies trying to get you to use their PCs."

The result, he said, would harm chip maker Intel but would be a benefit
for Microsoft, which could continue to sell its operating system. The
result could be a split in the partnership of the two companies that are

commonly referred to as the Wintel monopoly, he said.

"Microsoft would love to see PC price points go to zero,"

Andreessen said. "Intel would hate to see it happen."

Andreessen took one final shot at Microsoft when he mentioned a new
initiative that would incorporate Windows technology into heart monitors

at hospitals.

"It's the kind of product that creates its own market," he said.
"You have heart problems just thinking about it."

Getting off the track of this theme, I am interested in the concept of 'free
market'. 

Today, of course, it does not exist due to government rules and corporations
who control production and much technology. But, will this status quo
continue in the future?

I conceive of a world without corporate entities, in fact, where these
creatures could not survive. The key to this revolution will be the
universal availability of self-contained manufacturing systems that can be
self-replicating and can use the raw materials present in the local
environment to create anything the operator desires, in whatever quantity.
The only limit would be power input, and here I must postulate easy access
to cheap energy from an as yet undiscovered source. Okay, so it's science
fiction right now, but...

Commerce would be by trading, buying, and selling the templates for
controlling the manufacturing machines. Any individual could publish these
templates. Again, there needs to be a universally availible communication
net. Advances in RF technology could make such a net possible without any
'infrastructure' other than the terminals themselves, if only they were
sufficiently many.

If everyone can instantly communicate and trade templates, there would be no
market for transportation as we know it, and large factories would become
obsolete.

I see huge resistance to the start of this system from existing corporations
and governments, but once the first 'replicators' were built, their
dissemination to the world would be inevitable..

Comments?

Yes, a bad choice of words from me. I couldn't find a more fitting 
term quickly enough. Actually that was the reason I put the word 
"healthy" between quotes. (I surely didn't mean "mental healthy" 
but at most "biological healthy") 

I was using this word with respect to the damage to the mental systems 
of a sentient being resulting from physical degradation prior to 
its death. I could have used the word "complete", but not only all 
its memories would have to be restored, but also other mental 
systems that perform certain functions (like communication centers, 
sensory input processing centers, etc...) Because I was also thinking 
about these latter parts of the mental system I think I used the 
word "healthy". (But you can see that I was already having doubts 
about this choice of words because I said the word "healthy" should 
be exactly defined first.)

Perhaps more correct would be :

"to reconstruct a normally functioning and completely memory intact 
mental system for the resurrected sentient being"

Hey, no problem...  If you're interested in this sort of thing, there's a
number of good texts you could pick up.  First, a lot of the material from
the last several posts could be found in a good microeconomics textbook.
For a less mathematical and more conceptual treatment of the topic, I'd
reccomend _Principles of Microeconimocs_ by Karl Case and Ray Fair.
Alternately, I'm told a lot of this is covered in _Price Theory_ by David
Friedman, which should be awfully good, based on some of the other stuff of
his that I've read.

Good luck!

thx! :-)

Another thing I`d like to know: where could I find a summary, and then a
longer description of the extropian philosophy in german language?  Are
there any books on this topic?

Verd

PS: I`m sorry about having posted those german messages. Please forgive me!

I realized my mistake some minutes too late...

It is also important to compare this to what is available to the
creator. An infinite superbeing might not have any problems, but here
we are talking about more modest superbeings like what we might become
in the future. I think there is a very real possibility that the
simulation can become so complex that the creator will have a hard
time understanding it and dealing with the emergent moral dilemmas. It
might be fairly easy to set up a huge cellular automaton with a fixed
rule set, and extremely much harder to discern what is *really* going
on and how to deal with it. Remember that the fate of class IV CA
rules is Turing-uncomputable, which means we cannot predict it easier
than running the automaton itself.

We are good at recognizing moving systems because we have evolved in a
world where this is essential. Self replication is much harder, so far
it has required fairly careful study or very simple worlds (like the
parity automaton, where everything self-replicates). If the automaton
internally organizes itself as a 16-dimensional fourier component
space we will have a lot of trouble figuring out what is going on,
what is sentinent and what it is doing.

Up to the limits set by complexity; even given an arbitrary number of
examples of class IV automates I would not become better at predicting
the behavior of a general class IV automaton (unless Penrose is right
and the CT hypothesis doesn't hold for some systems, but I don't
believe in that). Of course, if I just limit myself to a certain kind
of worlds I might become a good creator for that kind, but I have
greater aspirations than that.

What is a tool, what is an object and what is a creature? Very hard to
distinguish in this case, and likely impossible in other cases.

I think you have a view of intelligence as fundamentally convergent -
all intelligent beings will have things in common. I doubt it -
intelligent evolved in a different world will have other ways of
perceiving it, motivation and planning, and this might make
communication nearly impossible. 

[spoiler for Greg Egan's Diaspora!] As an example, Greg Egan invented
a form of intelligent life living in the 16-dimensional fourier
component space created by the growth of Wang-tile equivalent
polysaccharides forming large sheets in the ocean on an alien planet
(yes, they are my favorite aliens so far :-). What can we discuss? We
live in fundamentally different worlds (different even on the
ontological level!), have a different physics, interact with the world
in different ways (no light, just touch) and doesn't even share the
same kind of time (as a sheet splits, history splits). What can we
discuss with them? [Spolier end]

Tom Ray has written an amazing alife system called Tierra, and is now
working on a net version of it. If there ever emerge intelligent life
in the Tierra-world we might call them Tierrans. There are likely
links to the project from the various alife sites on the net, it is
fairly famous.

OK, I resurrect everybody into a world exactly like ours, with the
slight change that miracles occurs so that nobody dies or stays
dead. I think most people would regard that as a weird caricature. The
big problem is how to communicate - the creator might have to try out
all kinds of weird schemes ("What if I send serial messages? No, they
just eat them. Parallel messages? Oops, they died again. And they seem
to have killed my remote-manipulated Avatar...").

Apropos dealing with simulated worlds and the relationship
creator-creation, Egan's _Permutation City_ has some half-baked
ideas. This is really virgin ethical territory, with links to
computation theory, xenobiology and Conway knows what else. Fun!

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

   I've been lurking on this list of quite some time, but I'd finally like to
put a few words in.
   The Atheism vs. Agnositicism debate has been going for ages, but what it
really comes down it is simple definitions.  Most of the following is
paraphrased (badly) out of Atheism: The Case Against God by George H. Smith.

   Atheism by definition means the absence of theistic belief. 
Whereas, agnosticism is the idea that something is inherently unknowable. 
Notice that by definition agnosticism has nothing to do with any beliefs, it
simply says whether something is knowable or not.  Therefore by these
definitions agnosticism isn't a third alternative to atheism/theism. Only when a
person defines atheism as the actual denial of God is agnosticism an
alternative.  But otherwise there are only two choices, atheism or theism.
   For example, when a baby is born it (probably) has no concept of God or any
other form of theistic beliefs, therefore it is an atheism.  On the other hand,
some religions believe that God is unknowable or beyond our simple human
comprehension, therefore they are agnostic theists.

  So don't fall into the common misconception that all atheists assert the
nonexistence of God.  There are degrees to atheism, some that do assert that
the concept of God is unintelligible and therefore God can't exist, and then
there are some atheists that are without theistic belief because the theist
cannot provide sufficient evidence to the existence of God(s).

email addresses!! Targeted email addresses are by far
the most expensive... but for a limited time, we are
offering the Master Marketers Resource CD for $169.00

Do not be mistaken... this offer is not like any other
you have received. We have seen randomly gathered
email address CD's selling for as much as $249.00
Just one I received today was offering 15 million for
$149.95... and the addresses were mostly AOL!! They
were not targeted... categorized... nothing! Just
15 million email addresses of who knows what.

We also have AOL addresses on the Master Marketers
Resource CD... but they are only a small part of it.
We also have addresses of; Business Opportunity Seekers,
Adult Web Site Subscribers (this list alone is over
100,000 addresses - we sell this list alone for $250.00
but it is included on this Resource CD), Investors,
E-Mail addresses sorted by city, General consumer
lists, those interested in Health... and many more!
Make no mistake!!... this is by far the best collection
of email addresses available anywhere. 

In all... there are 11 categories of targeted email
addresses. We have also included a remove/undeliverable
list that's over 100 meg in size!! We have already 
cleaned the addresses on the Master Marketer Resource
CD using this massive remove file... they are ready to
mail right now.


As A Special Bonus...

In addition to the email addresses... we have also included
on the CD over 30 CGI Scripts (one will hide where your
mail is being sent to on your forms - must have for 
taking orders). There are forum scripts, chat scripts and
just about any other cgi script you will ever need.

We have also included over 50 java scripts! Many are
scripts for adding rotating banners to your site, adding
scrolling ticker and marque messages and scripts that password
protect a page on your web site.

We have also included demos of over 15 of the top bulk
email programs on the Internet. Stealth, Rapid Fire, NetContact
and many more! We have also included demo's of email address
harvesters like Hurricane, Grabber and Atomic Harvestor that
let you extract fresh email addresses out of forums and
web pages. 

There is much more on the CD than we can go into on a short
letter like this one (there is over 10 html editors, over
200 marketing reports and more). In all... in addition to
the bulk email and html editors... there is over 20 of the
top software programs on the Internet. From programs that
keep you connected to the Internet... to programs that let
you accept checks online! 

You will save hours (if not weeks) in download time as we have
included the top shareware and freeware programs available
anywhere. 

If you are serious about making money on the Internet... you
must have the Master Marketers Resource Cd! There is nothing
like it currently available! 

If you are ready to target your advertising... you can order
the Master Marketers Resource CD by completing the form
below. Don't miss out... we are only selling a limited number
of the Master Marketer Resource CD's. In order to preserve the
quality of the addresses, this offer may be withdrawn at anytime.

------------------------------------------------------------
Please note: Most of the software on the CD is shareware. If
you like it... buy it. We have included the programs because
we feel most are pertinent to Internet marketing.

Actually, I think the pious become defensive more over the facts that
science brings to light rather than personal attacks, but otherwise you
raise a good point.  What you said explains perfectly why science
doesn't need religion, but you left out an important point:  the
emotional reasons that people need religion, and need to see it as some
kind of "truth" and not just an educated guess.  In nearly all cases
this stems from some sort of fear, whether it's fear of no life after
death, isolation, etc.  I think this is the reason scientists tend to
look down on religious people.  They see the religion as nothing more
than a crutch to pacify a person's weak emotional fears, with no other
potential for good.  Personally, I believe there's a great deal of
validity in this, though such a person's weaknesses always manifest
themselves in more concrete, destructive ways than going to church on
Sundays.  I think most scientifically inclined agnostics realize that if
the masses are taught better logic than religion will decline on it's
own.  Those logically educated individuals I know who still claim to
believe in God have reduced their so-called religions to such a vague,
undefined state that they remain only a blemish on their otherwise
secular lifestyle.
    But enough about that.  I also have a few problems with "Contact" as
a film that the over-fawning reviewers seem to consider irrelevant.
First of all, am I the only one who thought the entire movie reminded
them of the juvenile discussions you used to get into when you first
renounced religion but still hadn't been sufficiently educated in
philosophy to make a good case on your own, that is without a Nietzsche
textbook to quote from?  I actually read the book before I saw the
movie, and for someone of Carl Sagan's stature it kind of reeked of a
sell-out.  Kind of like he thought he could get society to immediately
embrace science if he just admitted "God's OK."  The only problem is he
makes a completely backward case for his cause.  For instance, at first
the climactic meeting with the aliens seems to make a juvenile fairy
tale of Christianity, until for no apparent reason Sagan has the alien
representative admit to Ellie that the worm holes they use to traverse
the universe were "there when they got here", ie it could very well have
been God that made them.  What???  In a book full of cop-outs this one
takes the cake.
    Another point the reviewers have focused on is how long it's been
since a woman held such a prominent and dignified part in a mainstream
Hollywood film.  That may be true, but despite the superficial sense
that in the end science and religion have been reconciled on equal
terms, deeper analysis reveals that it is Ellie who has been defeated
without any real compromise on the part of Christianity (yes, the movie
criticizes the masses' perception of religion, but this seems a poor
tradeoff considering science is pissed on from the highest of academic
standpoints).  I found Sagan's symbolic representation of the sexual
union between Ellie (science) and Palmer Joss (religion) to be equally
revolting.  And what good does it do to have a strong female in a lead
role if at the end she is sent home defeated in the triumphant arms of a
male?

We've all heard the fears that manual laborers are too resistant to
losing their jobs as a result of technological progress- what do we do
with these people?  This is a relevant concern and one I don't wish to
delve into, but instead I'd like to address the white-collar capitalists
and their role in the scheme of things.  No, I'm not a
socialist/Marxist/anarchist, and I certainly don't intend to bash
capitalism as a system.  But the fact is, not only in America but
increasingly overseas, businesses have been taught to push their
products- to either fulfill a social need or create a desire for a new
one.  My question is not "what do we do with these people?", but how the
needs of humans/transhumans will evolve along with progressive
automation.  How much of a public demand will be required for any given
product to make it worthwhile to produce?  Exactly how much wealth will
there be to go around?  What new forms of entertainment will arise out
of the ashes of the market-driven archetypes?  As you can see, this is
really more of a speculative question than a problem to be solved, and
as such might be deemed to trivial to warrant attention by many, but I
welcome comments from all interested parties.

I think it's more appropriate to look at it from the POV that "atheism"
was defined as a reaction to "theism".  Since theism we've all agreed
means "belief in a god", then atheism from this perspective would yield
"absence of a belief in a god".  In other words, there's no reason to
suspect that the original Greek was consulted when defining atheism.
Think how little English would make sense if we had to trace the origins
of each compound word back to it's etymological source!

I would say that you cannot consider social and economic
models without reference to the assumed technology, since
various models are more efficient at different levels and kinds
of technological progress.

What is more interesting, to me, is that there seem to be only 
a few models that work even relatively well, at our technology.
Nearly every nation, today, has a variation on the same basic
type of government, with one head of government, ostensibly
elected, and some governing body of more than a few people,
whatever it is called (congress, soviet, councilors, or parliament).

I agree.

First, there have been only a few "larger" societies, before
our era, because technology did not usually permit it.  The
only one that I can think of in ancient times was China, 
which also had the highest technology.  Coincidence?
I also would say that initial conditions seem to have 
played a large role in the emergence of the world we 
have today.  
It seems to me that centralized control is simply
not possible in a large-scale, high technology
(nanotech, AI, etc) society.  The controllers must
have some advantage over the citizenry (numbers,
in putting down revolts at low tech; artillery or nukes
at high tech), and after the advent of nanotechnology,
it is difficult to see any way for them to retain that 
advantage.

Several recent interesting posts sent me scrambling through a dusty old
pile of my magazine tear-sheets, whence I dug out an article I published in
an Australian mass market magazine in October 1967 - is it possible to be
so ancient? surely not - entitled whimsically `If there is no God, who
pulls up the next Kleenex?'  Diverting to see what curious intimations of
transhumanism were afloat in those dim lost days...

==================

...biblical religion... simply is not hooked into the dynamo of our age.
It is too firmly entrenched in patterns of thought and emotional response
long superannuated; it has a weight of centuries on it.  Stripped to
fighting weight, it comes out punchy, its jab is short and feeble and
directed at shadows painted on its own eyes.

Yet there remains that brooding violence in our culture's belly, the large
reality which magic and religion, before our day,  handled not
unsuccessfully.  Perhaps, with Julian Huxley, we can call it *the divine*,
the latent potency which is not supernatural but *transnatural*.  It is, I
suggest, the same coiled spring which drove primitive man, in a fury of
invention, to build gods as its representation.  It is the subterranean
torrent of dread and exultation which is the twin realisation of our
blurred insignificance before the towering presence of the universe and our
inevitable personal extinction, and the full, rich, scarcely-glimpsed
flowering of human possibilities.

Here, perhaps, is the central existential reality we must neither
propitiate nor ignore, but embrace.  It finds a statement in Huxley's
scientific panorama: "This new vision is both comprehensive and unitary.
It integrates the fantastic diversity of the world into a single framework,
the pattern of all-embracing evlutionary process." [...]

There seems, as I mentioned at the beginning, to be something ludicrous in
the assertion that our having relinquished religion might be the betrayal
of our civilisation to vast undirected energies.  Yet it is not
implausible.  In casting off a belief in God "which has ceased to be
scientifically tenable, has lost its explanatory value, and is becoming an
intellectual and moral burden to our thought", we have carelessly lost
sight of the divine which ante-dated gods.

Norman Mailer has spoken of the plight of our time, that our world "reduces
one's sense of reality by reducing to the leaden formulations of jargon
such emotions as awe, dread, beauty, pity, terror, calm, horror and
harmony", that it "leaves us further isolated in the empty landscapes of
psychosis, precisely that inner landscape of void and dread which we flee".

And yet it may not have to be that way.  "Maybe we are in a sense the seed,
the seed-carriers, the voyagers, the explorers...; maybe we are engaged in
a heroic activity, and not a mean one".

=======================

More than three decades later I would distance myself from the last wisps
of teleology and crypto-religiosity in that piece.  Still, perhaps it
catches a moment (perhaps shared by FM-2030 in another part of the world at
around the same time) when we started to see the plausibility - indeed, the
inevitability - of a transhumanist trajectory.

(Incidentally, some of that old article was later recycled in my 1982 sf
novel *The Judas Mandala*, with its explicitly transhuman cyborgs, virtual
realiy, and Tiplerian Omega-mind.)

I've recently read a book written  by Ken Wilber that does a very good job of attempting

I  have not observed this  behavior in 'extropianers'. But I have observed  a  kind

I discuss this problem in THE SPIKE, and suggest that we might take another
look at Robert Theobald's 1960s' discussion (recently revived) for a
minimum Guaranteed Income.  Libertarians will have problems with this
notion, especially in the presumed need for a centralised or governmental
agency to collect and redistribute the revenues.  Since we already have
such structures in place, I believe the meliorative effects of shifting
most social services to a GI structure would be appropriate and acceptable
from various idelogical standpoints.  The core of my case is this:

==============

As an inviolable constitutional entitlement, a guaranteed income would
offer people who'd been made technologically redundant the chance to engage
in dignified self-help.  At present, it is difficult for jobless people to
get a bank loan to start a small business, or buy and fix their house, or
pay for the protracted study and skill development that might lever them
back into still-vital parts of the work force.  `Further, and of
potentially great significance' Cyert and Jacobs suggested, `a guaranteed
minimum income would make it more feasible for private industry to sponsor
long training programs, for it would no longer be necessary to pay
substantial wages through the period of training and low productivity.'

Theobald was more optimistic still.  Productive groups, which he termed
`consentives', would come together on a voluntary basis, working simply
because they wanted to.  Decades later, this is a pattern we recognise from
garage bands, high-tech start-ups, and internet special interest groups.
All those, of course, tend to be funded by doting, well-paid parents.
Consentives might produce goods that embody, both in themselves and in the
workers' sense of creative satisfaction, the virtues of hand-crafted design
in a machine world, as brilliant shareware does today.  Since wages and
salaries would be irrelevant, cost of goods would be minimal, hardly
greater than raw materials and transport - comparable with computerised
factory production.  The rise of nano minting, naturally enough, will make
even these fond hopes pass, but cheap minting will not rise above the
horizon for at least another decade or two.

It's fair to judge that national investment in such a scheme might
ultimately be much more than a costly exercise in humane
conscience-salving, and perhaps preferable to continued post-Cold War
military stock-piling and planned obsolescence.  Still, many will reject
any redistribution  of national wealth, beyond a pittance paid for in
humiliation.  Poverty, it's supposed, is a character defect.  Perhaps that
claim was once true.  In the era of structural unemployment, it is no
better than cant.  

The work ethic (better, the job ethic) cannot survive long while a culture
of machine abundance disintegrates mores - themselves only, at most, a few
thousand years old - of austerity and fanatical toil.  It's undeniable,
though, that a guaranteed income would run straight into the hostile
defensiveness of the work ethic.  Societies remain stratified, after the
fashion of a scarcity economy, according to the jobs its members hold.
Since the policy of full employment is faltering and doomed, we must do an
about-face and realise the merits of unemployment.  

Fear of being out of a job has two roots that need no longer be axiomatic.
One is the loss of adequate income.  The other is loss of meaningful
activity.  Without the framework of discipline and satisfaction that brains
and hands obtain from meaningful work, people start running amok with
boredom, diverting themselves with the ancient, arbitrary and zestful
customs of tribal hierarchy and conflict.  Force a generation of kids out
of the loop, and expect them to trash your Porsche, murder each other, and
burn out their furious grief with neurotoxins.

[...]

The run up to the Spike, therefore, will deepen today's dreadful problems,
but also ease their solution, if we keep our nerve and use our brains.  A
corporation that downsizes its entire workforce in favour of robots
survives as a parasite on the investment of the past.  Its earnings, after
all, are the product of every erg of human effort that went into creating
the economy and the technological culture which made those robots possible.
 We need not see a guaranteed income as a natural right, in some absurd
lofty a priori sense, like the supposed innate rights to freedom of speech
and liberty.  No, it is an inheritance, something owed to all the children
of a society whose ancestors for generations have together built, and
purchased through their efforts, the resource base sustaining today's
cornucopia.

Considering the degree of control which I imagine posthumans could have

What is their alternative?  Sounds to me like anarcho-capitalists don't give a
damn about the poor ~80% of the world!  In several days of hashing out these issue
out on both the transhuman-list and now the extro-list, not a single person has
been able to come up with a free-market alternative.  They conclude that either we
will have to work like dogs until the end, or if we're very lucky, compassionate
transhumans will give the rest of us a hand up as we approach the singularity.I
have always liked the idea of a minimum guaranteed income and others similar to
it. Unfortunately Damien, you appear not to be a rabid free-marketeer, and my
challenge was to *them* to come up with a solution.  So far they have failed to
so.

****  So again I ask, is their any anracho-capitalist who can demonstrate how the
free-market can support and sustain a wide-spread liesure-class society without
resorting to "faith" that it simply will.  If your conclusion is that we must all
continue to work in some form or another, then I DON'T WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU!

I've been reading a little about an incredible idea taken very seriously in 
the late 50's and early 60's but today is almost completely forgotten, it was 
called Project Orion. The idea was to make a spaceship big enough for 150 
people and all the equipment they could ever want and blast it into space.  
They wanted to make it 135 feet in diameter and 160 feet high and they wanted  
most of that space to be usable by people not wasted on fuel. They figured 
weight would be no problem, if a crew member wanted to bring along his  
antique bowling ball collection and his own personal barber chair there would  
be no objection. The advocates of this approach were not interested in low 
earth orbit or even the moon, they were certain they could be on Mars by 1965 
and Saturn by 1970, the leader of the project was determined to visit Pluto. 
And they figured all this would cost less than 10% what the Apollo moon 
project did.

You might think that these people must have been a bunch of crackpots, but  
it's not so. Nobel Prize winners  Niels Bohr, Hans Bethe and Harold Urey were  
all enthusiastic advocates of the idea. Freeman Dyson thought the idea was so  
brilliant that he took a one year leave of absence from the prestigious
Institute of Advanced Study so he could work full time on the project.

Yes, there is a catch, Project Orion needed nuclear energy, even worse it 
needed nuclear bombs. The Orion spacecraft would contain 2000 nuclear bombs, 
most in the 20 kiloton range, the size of the bomb that destroyed Nagasaki. 
A bomb in a tank of water would shoot out the back of the ship, when it was 
100 feet away it would explode, the water would hit a carefully designed 
75 ton pusher plate and accelerate the ship. Between the pusher plate and the 
ship were 50 foot long gas filled shock absorbers to even out the jerk. They 
wanted everything to be as cheap as possible, so they asked the Coca-Cola 
company for the blueprints of one of their vending machines, then they scaled 
it up a little and planed to use it as the mechanism to dispense the bombs.
                
The pusher plate was obviously the most important part of the design. If you  
explode a powerful bomb near a circular plate of constant thickness it will  
shatter because of the uneven stresses that build up, but it turns out that 
if you carefully taper the plate and make certain that the explosion is dead
center, the plate will be extraordinary  resistant to damage. A layer on the 
plate will be vaporized by the heat but if some heavy protective oil is 
spayed on it before each use it would be good for 2000 blasts. This beast was 
tough, if it was properly oriented the Orion Spacecraft could survive a 
16 megaton H bomb blast from only two thousand feet away, a fact of more than
passing interest to the military. Orion needed lots of radiation shielding to 
protect the crew, but weight was never an issue so this was no problem.
 
Wernher von Braun though all this was a dumb idea, then he saw a movie of the 
launch of a one meter working model of Orion that shot 6 carefully timed  
high explosives chemical bombs out the back of the model, it rose 300 feet  
into the air in stable controlled flight. Wernher von Braun became a vocal 
supporter of project Orion.
  
They planed to launch Orion from atop eight 250 towers in Jackass Flats  
Nevada. The first bomb would be tiny, just .1 kiloton (100 tons of TNT)  
exploded 100 feet below craft and 150 feet above the ground, then a new and  
slightly larger bomb would be spit out the back every second for 50 seconds, 
the last bomb would be the largest, 20 kilotons, and by then the craft would 
be out of the atmosphere, the total yield of the 50 bombs would be 200 
kilotons. The launch would have been a spectacular sight, it'd make the Space 
Shuttle look like a bottle rocket.

Project Orion was lead by Ted Taylor, a mediocre physicist but a good 
inventor. Taylor had one unique talent, he has been called by some the best 
nuclear weapon engineer on planet Earth and the Leonardo da Vinci of nuclear 
bomb design. Taylor is the man who figured out how a two foot long 200 pound  
bomb could be made as powerful as the 12 foot long 10 ton World War 2 
Nagasaki bomb. The reason the Orion  spaceship was so much bigger and faster 
than anything we have today is that pound for pound such bombs have about a 
million times as much energy as any chemical rocket fuel.

Orion wasn't the only thing Taylor was interested in, he found a way to make  
new type of nuclear bomb, one that would produce a highly directional blast.  
He designed a little one kiloton bomb that could blast a 1000 foot tunnel  
straight through solid rock, he wanted to build a cheap tunnel between  
New York and San Francisco and have a supersonic subway 3000 miles long.  

Considering the big controversy we had last year when a deep space probe was 
launched with just a few pounds of non weapon grade Plutonium on it to power  
the electronics it may seem incredible and irresponsible that anyone would 
even consider something as environmentally unfriendly as Orion, but we live 
in a very different world. At the time Orion was under serious study the USA 
was blowing up one megaton bombs deep under the sea and 300 miles in space 
and the USSR was blowing up 57 megaton bombs in the atmosphere, Orion seemed 
and indeed was pretty benign compared to that.

It all came to nothing of course, in 1963 the test ban treaty was signed 
stopping all nuclear explosions in space or the atmosphere making Orion  
illegal. The project died, but to this day most say it would have worked  
technologically if not politically.
  
Idea for a science fiction novel: A huge nickel iron asteroid is heading for 
Earth, it would take a 200,000 megaton bomb to divert it but no existing 
rocket is nearly powerful enough to deliver such a huge payload to the 
asteroid. The Earth seems doomed, then our hero remembers Project Orion.

Well, first of all, as I think I may have already showed, it's very likely
that people will WANT to work.  There's always another planet to colonize,
after all.  ;)  So this question may be ill-founded.

However, your point.  Even if a couple of essential goods DO become so
cheap as to be free, (food for example,) there are a number of ways
capitalism can deal with it.  Consider how we've dealt with matches,
drinking water, etc.  I imagine food machines as ubiquitous as bathrooms
(which were a luxury within my grandmother's lifetime).  Expect to see free
lunches being offered wherever there is something worth selling.  Hell, if
there's even one charitable organization interested in distributing food,
and it becomes cheap enough to do so freely, we can expect that
organization to distribute food like there was no tomorrow.  Similarly, I'm
imagining free hospitals set up to advertise other goods... stuff like
that.  We've dealt with water in abundance, we can deal with honey just as
easily.

Satisfied?

Yes I know you do Dan and your arguments have been compelling, but your eqaution
still included the *necessity* of work.  With increasing automation why should we
be forced to choose between work and destitution?

Great idea!   Assuming that people will have enough money to do that. :-)

> Grrr.  Last time I write an essay for YOU, smarty pants.  :p

I should have been more precise in excluding you.  You have come closest to
addressing my concerns.  I am quite grateful for your input depite my smarty-pants
shoulder-chip.  :-)

Work as forced labor which it is now is definitly something I DON'T WANT TO DO.
Working on colonizing space - that wouldnt be forced.  You'd have to pay me alot
of money to keep me from doing that kind of work!

Elaborating on recent threads...

Operating system: constitutional "monarchy".

Automatization is pushed to the max in all fields -->

-- no-one is forced to work for a living anymore, there is a decent "bottom
standard" (free housing, food, clothing, gas, water etc.)
-- everyday life gets more user-friendly because machines
are faster, better, considerably more reliable and politer than humans
-- the road is cleared for massive progress, now that one of the major
obstacles has been eliminated
-- those who want more than just the minimum and those who like to 
keep busy will still be active in those jobs that can't be automated yet.
They have a fairly standard (money) economy, buying services from
eachother and/or goods from specialized (private) shops etc. Anyone
can at any time try to join the regular economy, failure has no serious
consequences (unless you make debts with the wrong kind of people, 
of course;-).
-- some people will abuse their newly found freedom, so the justice system
needs to be swift and sure (see the "Justice & punishment" thread). Note:
only truly harmful acts should be punished (I think it's clear what that means).
-- in return for the freedom and unpredcedented welfare people should take
fewer, preferably none, children. The system cannot maintain unlimited
numbers of non-working individuals. For the same reason immigration
would have to be strictly monitored, preferably only allowing those who
have the skills and willingness to work (actively contribute). As the level
of automatization and efficiency increases, these rules can be adapted
(allowing more children/immigrants).
-- education is also free (and of course as automated as possible) and is
focussed on teaching people critical thinking skills (and transhumanism,
of course ;-) apart from the more standard subjects like maths, languages
etc.
-- of course the transition must be _gradual_, the state using tax money (and
income from national lotteries, sex industry, narcotics sale and other such 
lucrative businesses (with high quality standards, of course)) to build the first 
automated, largely self-maintained factories. As automation increases taxes
can be reduced until there is nothing left. What can't be made for (virtually)
free will be paid for with income from the abovementioned "lucrative businesses"
(preferably no state monopoly, btw).

Inevitably at a certain point the Singularity hits, and all becomes obsolete,
but untill then this just might work.

warrl@mail.blarg.net (Warrl kyree Tale'sedrin) sent me a "heads up" that my
email might have been mangled en route.  My thanks to him (though he will be
disappointed to see that I do not claim the company of gods).  Let me try a
resend:

FWIW, and in contrast to your views, I harbor close relations to many, many
theists.  Although I find their judgements about matters theological quite
dicey, that by no means prevents me from respecting their opinions about other
things.  Sometimes I even think that their theological notions merit
respectful treatment.  Think that's heretical?  Get this:  I even know and
respect many *statists*!

I suppose that tolerance for ideological differences varies widely; I often
find that I enjoy the frisson that comes from rubbing up against different
opinions (even woefully misguided ones).  When it comes to intellectual
companionship, I would rather talk with someone who gets things wrong in
interesting ways than I would with someone who agrees with me in stultifying
ways.

I think it more plausible that the "a" in "atheism" stands for "not"; to wit:

Atheism = (not + god) belief in the preceding claim

Steve Butts very helpfully recapitulates George H. Smith's comments on the
distinction between atheism and agnosticism.  George does great work, but I do
not agree with him (or Max, who offered a similar argument) that we should
define "atheism" so as to equal "without belief in god."  As I noted to Max,
that definition would make an atheist one who had never even encountered the
notion of god.  George apparently embraces this oddity:

> when a baby is born it (probably) has no concept of God or any
> other form of theistic beliefs, therefore it is an atheism.

At the same time, however, George would have "atheist" embrace the ardent
rationalist who has scrutinized and forthrightfully rejected the possibility
of any divine existence.  I think this range of meanings gives the word an
unhelpfully broad definition, not to mention one that does not jibe with
common usage.  Dictionaries typically define "atheist" as "one who denies
God's existence" or the like.

What about the linguistic argument?  Proponents of the broad definition of
"atheism" miss there, too.  The roots of "atheism" do not, contrary to
George's claim, mean "without theistic belief."  Rather, the word comes from
"atheos" which means "without god."  

"Atheos" refers the (non)existence of god--not about the prescence of a
belief.  And "atheists" are people who consider themselves "a theos."  A baby
thus does not qualify; rather, only one who consciously denies the existence
of gods qualifies as an "atheist."

Given that agnostics have so often faced the claim that they are "atheists
without the courgage of their convictions," I find it curious that some
atheists are trying to assume the diffident attitudes of agnostics.  It would
fit common usage and etymology better, I think, for atheists to suck it up and
claim they disbelieve in gods.  

My advice to wavering atheists:  Ignore the agnostic's claim that you cannot
disprove the existence of god, arguing instead that you have as much proof as
you need.  After all, reasonable people believe a variety of things without
logical or scientific backing; common sense works well enough, and it simply
does not support the notion that gods exist.

I'm not saying an atheist would convince me with this claim.  All I'm saying
is that I'd respect the atheists for sticking up for his/her (dis)beliefs.

I suggest defining the terms this way: Agnosticism (literally, "without
knowledge") means that one doesn't know whether god exists, and atheism
(literally, "without god") means the disbelief in god, or, equivalently,
the belief that god does not exist.

Defined this way, there is no reason to struggle with the implicit XOR
frequently associated with these terms.  I am both an agnostic AND an
atheist; while I acknowledge that it is impossible to _know_ (i.e.,
prove) god's (non)existence, it is my belief, based on an absence of
evidence for a god, that god does not exist.

Yes, atheism is clearly a choice, and often the result of a long hard struggle
with oneself and one's surroundings. Calling babies 'atheists' would be insulting
a lot of great independent minds. Babies are a-ideological/philosophical, not
a-theists. When it comes too relegion it is often a lot harder to determine
whether this is a 'choice' or not. I'd say that in most cases religious belief
is nothing more than conformism out of fear and/or mental laziness. Religion
*is* for the weak (and those that wish to exploit them, of course).

That strikes me as pretty sensible, though I imagine that theists would assail
you with claims that they *have* got evidence of the existence of god(s).  You
might well counter with an argument about what constitutes valid evidence,
quickly leading to deep epistemological waters, but at least you would have
moved off of theological territory.

I suggest that the surest way out of this fix is to move away from questions
of whether you do or do not believe in divine entities.  In fact, it often
proves helpful to discard entirely talk about beliefs.  Rather, I prefer (when
trying to keep on epistemologically solid ground) to speak about working
hypothesis about the world, which I hold with greater or lesser conviction.
Like Laplace, I have little need for the god hypothesis.  But the atheistic
certainty in god's non-existence strikes me as a bit too cock-sure.

Theists may also pose a question for anyone (including me) who adopts the
agnostic line: " Well, then, what *do* you know?"  I'd respond that I know
precious little--just my own sensory experiences (that, eg, I'm now seeing
black and white patterns, that I hear a light humming I attribute to my
computer's fan, and so forth).  By posing this question, the theist wouuld aim
at showing that the agnostic has too-strict standards for knowledge, and thus
has little of value to say about theological matters.

The agnostic could reply using the sort of epistemology described above:  "I
may not *know* much, but I have a *lot* of good working hypotheses about the
world.  And most of them I hold with far, far greater certainty than the
putative hypothesis that gods exist."

I found many of the same things when I read the bible, though I read 
it from cover to cover.  At the time my parents "tricked me into 
being christian, but now that i have learned more I have revoked my 
religion completly.

I don't know that there *is* a social solution.  That is, one that
we can plan for ahead of time.  The difficulty is that the first
posthumans will be far more powerful than any group or 
organization that we could now form, and so we cannot 
enforce 'good' behavior.  I don't know of any substitute for
effort, whether capital effort or actual work, if one wants to
keep up, but if one is willing to stay at the same standard
of living, a continually (and sharply) decreasing amount of
work will allow it.

Is this the only oddity you found in the Bible? I'd say it starts with
Genesis 1,1. Check out http://www.inifidels.org, a very useful resource for
any active (but not necessarily militant) atheist. You can use the search
engine on the site to search for "contradictions", will get you some nifty
lists of Biblical contradictions.

Being sure of your case (or at least pretending to be sure) has a memetic
advantage, and if you're wrong and there *is* a "god", so what? Nothing

Dan Fabbulich, referring to the poor:

>I also happen to think they'll be just fine under capitalism,
thankyouverymuch.

OK, let's see whether the poor are fine under capitalism today. It has been
often expressed on this list that the US are "not great, but certainly the
best system there is".

The facts (I cite from "Fifty Facts about Poverty" by Nancy Leidenfrost, see
http://www.excelsior.org/~erik/facts.txt for the complete list together with
the references):

*    In 1991, the United States had approximately 35.7 million
     people living below the poverty level.  This represents 14.2
     percent of the Nation's population (U.S. Bureau of the
     Census, 1992).

*    One in five children (14.3 million) lived in poverty in
     1991, the highest number since 1965.  The majority of poor
     children are white; most have a parent that works; and most
     live outside large cities, in rural and suburban America
     (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992).


*    The United States, compared to other countries, ranks 20th
     in infant mortality (UNICEF, State of World's Children,
     1992, U.S. Data from NCHS, 1991).

*    The United States, compared to other countries, ranks 17th
     in the world in percentage of
     1-year-olds fully vaccinated against polio (UNICEF State of
     the World's Children Report 1993, 1992, U.S. Immunization
     Survey, 1985).

*    The United States, compared to other countries, ranks 14th
     in life expectancy and 4th in literacy (Howell, B., 1990).

*    The United States has one of the highest degrees of
     inequality in distribution of income (Smeeding, T.M.,
     O'Higgins, M., & Rainwater, L., 1990). (I have more sources on this, if
anyone wants them, just ask. -- EM)

*    The United States has higher child poverty than seven other
     major industrialized western countries (UNICEF, State of the
     World's Children Report 1993, 1992).  The U.S. child poverty
     rate is dramatically higher than those of Canada, Germany,
     Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

*    America's wealth as  measured by the gross national product
     (GNP) reached  an all-time high in 1990.  Between 1979 and
     1989, GNP grew by more than one-fourth, but child poverty
     increased by 21 percent (Johnson, C.M., Miranda, L.,
     Sherman, A., & Weill, J.D., 1991).

*    About half of the Nation's poor in 1991 were children under
     18 years of age (40.2).  Children are almost twice as likely
     to be poor than any other group of Americans, including the
     elderly (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992).

*    In 1991, the poverty rate among children in female-headed
     families was 55 percent, more than five times the rate among
     married-couple families (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992). (so much for
equal chances -- EM)

And for those who believe that the poor are not "really poor":

*    Poor families are less likely to have nutritionally adequate
     diets than nonpoor families.  Children who have inadequate
     diets lag in growth and have more frequent, more severe, and
     longer-lasting infectious diseases.  Inadequate nutrition,
     including iron deficiency (with or without anemia), may also
     affect cognitive development and social behavior, with
     undernourished children being more apathetic (Kotch, J., &
     Shackelford, J., 1989).

*    Poor children are believed to experience mental and
     emotional problems more frequently than nonpoor ones (Gould,
     M.S., Wunsch-Hitzig, R., & Dohrenwend, B., 1981).  The 1987
     report, Children's Mental Health: Problems and Services,
     noted the relationship between poverty and minority group
     membership and environmental stresses.  These stresses posed
     risks to children's mental health (Dougherty, D.H., Saxe,
     L.M., Cross, T., & Silverman, N., 1987).

Those were just extracts. Go check out the whole file.

What am I asking for? Socialism? Certainly not, although many Extropians
still seem to believe that if one isn't a free market capitalist, he must
automatically be a defender of the big evil governments and possibly a
potential socialist (or a real one). These facts just show that a
deregulated economy tends to produce more poverty and inequality than a
correctly [!] regulated one. Add automatism to this, and you got the High
Tech Middle Ages.

Erik Moeller

The extropians ML has once again grown pretty noisy in recent weeks, and 
the long-promised new list structure seems not to be arriving yet. As my 
workload has also increased recently, I think a vacation from the list 
has become necessary. I thank all low-noise contributors (you know who 
you are) -- the only boon I ask is that those who still doggedly
persist to bounce any technical material to transhumantech@excelsior.org.
Thanks!, and

G'night to you all,

One of the first expert systems was named INTERNIST, it was better

Erik, please either shut up or at least make some kind of meaningful points.
"Poverty level" means absolutely nothing, because it's an entirely subjective
term... 'poverty' in the US is utterly incomparable to real poverty in the
third world and elsewhere.

And how the hell do you intend to 'regulate' an economy without a big evil
government? The free market is the natural state of an economy; only big
government can convert it into the kind of mess we see in the modern world.

Frankly, I'm really tired of reading all this crap; I will debate the merits
of the free market on other lists (and often do), but I sure as hell don't
want to come in to work in the morning and have to delete 50 or 60 of these
messages on this list every day.

  IAN: I addressed that before: it seems to me that 
  your implying that your defining of ExI as a "cult"
  is simply an objective linguistic analysis, no harm
  or insult intended, but then you attempt to imply
  "Scientology" and "ExI" are same thing since you 
  have defined both as "cult," even as you admit that 
  the two are not the same thing. In short, why not 
  just say: "I hate ExI and I'm going to attempt to 
  fit it into any demeaning category that I can" ?

  If it can be so fit, then it is properly fit, but 
  I think ExI fits into "cult" only after considerable
  stretching, so much so that the term "cult" is nulled.

   IAN: If they are killers, why should they 
   not be defined as such? How is defining a 
   killer not as a killer going to help anyone?
   I think such would only ensure future killing.

   You may follow up by saying, "If ExI is a 
   cult, why should it not be defined as a 
   cult?" To which I would reply that the 
   application of that definition to ExI is 
   strained at best, and as such serves no 
   useful function except to the extent that
   it facilitates the application of an insult.

   Your objections over the principles may or 
   may not be valid, but it seems to me that 
   this foray into "cultism" is tangential.

As Dan Fabulich <daniel.fabulich@yale.edu> and others have pointed
out there is no faith in extropianism, and by definition, no faith,
no religious beliefs, and by your selected definition #2 of "cult",
no religious beliefs, no "Cult".

Under 2c possibly (formal?), but this makes us neither a religion
nor a cult.

I don't have a personal problem with a rational examination of the
basics, but it is again'st list rules, and by charter Max More is
the final arbitrator.

If he decides it is permitted, I suggest the meta [ANTI-BASICS]

You're missing one important fact; if banks and retail don't need many 
employees because most of their work can be handled over the Web, then the
sacked employees can set up their own retail and banking sites in
competition with their old employers. If all you need to be a retail company
or a bank is a web site, then anyone can do it; though obviously in the
banking case reputation could be a problem.

Dear Mr. Clark,

	You made the rather startling statement that in 100 years, 
and certainly within 1000 years, biological humans as we 
currently know them will have ceased to exist.

	Although I don't question that this result is 
theoretically possible, don't you worry about a very 
profound reactionary response in the general "God-fearing" 
public to this type of "threat" to us creatures made "in 
God's image"?  Do you really think that public attitudes 
will change that quickly?


	Sincerely,

Dear Yak,

	 I think that both science and religion look for truth, 
and that's *why* they construct theories, but science 
knows about falsifiability whereas religions still think in 
terms of conscious assured possession of truth. 

	I think that religion and science also differ because
religion seeks an explanation of things in terms of a
transcendental agency Who communicates only very
sporadically to humanity and doesn't stick around for a 
lot of questions, whereas science looks basically for 
testable regularities without regard to the issue of an 
ultimate agency "behind" the universe, although I must 
qualify this by saying that people thinking along the lines 
of Frank J. Tipler (*The Physics of Immortality*) do 
envision a God-like entity of some kind.

	As far as Contact goes, the movie really alters the 
novel's ending in terms of "reconciling" science and 
religion.  For Sagan, proof of God's existence would 
consist of His leaving a message in the number pi. The 
movie never even gets into that part of the novel.

	Two other points come to mind. (1) What did Sagan think of 
the cosmological anthropic principle(s). (2) Has anyone 
read the fascinating book by Steven J. Brams, *If 
Superior Beings Existed, How Would We Know?*?  If so, any 
comments?

	Sincerely,

I can find no evidence that rabid anarcho-capitalists such as myself have 
less compassion then socialists, we just realize we're dealing with human 
beings not Euclidean Geometry so proofs are not available. I refuse to give 
guarantees on social issues, politicians are quick to give such assurances 
because it makes voters happy, but if one respects the truth it must be said 
that in any system that sort of certainty is impossible.
                                 

        >I have always liked the idea of a minimum guaranteed income 


Me too, I'd love to have one, unfortunately it's impossible. Government can't 
guarantee such a thing, at least not honestly, because to do so they would 
have to guarantee that they will always continue to be successful in their 
ability to extort money of any amount from anyone anytime they need it, and  
also guarantee that future politicians will always want to make handouts to 
the weak. Both assumptions are very questionable and in fact almost certainly 
wrong.

No, not with any certainty. If there is a wide-spread liesure-class that is 
unable or unwilling to support itself then obviously it will have to be 
supported by the non wide-spread non liesure-class. If the productive class 
is compassionate and willing to do this then the non productive class will 
have no problem, and if they aren't then they will. The productive class is 
the powerful class and no government can stay in power if they do things the 
most powerful class doesn't like, not even if the weakest class is crazy 
about the government. This has nothing to do with morality, it's nobody's 
fault, it's just a fact of nature.

Erik Moeller:

>OK, let's see whether the poor are fine under capitalism today. It
>has been often expressed on this list that the US are "not great,
>but certainly the best system there is".

>The facts (I cite from "Fifty Facts about Poverty" by Nancy
>Leidenfrost, see http://www.excelsior.org/~erik/facts.txt for the
>complete list together with the references):

*    In 1991, the United States had approximately 35.7 million
     people living below the poverty level.  This represents 14.2
     percent of the Nation's population (U.S. Bureau of the
     Census, 1992).

Below the poverty level in the U.S. means ahead of 90% of the rest
of the planet, visit a large housing complex like Chicago's Robert
Taylor homes sometime, you'll find the majority below the poverty
line, with cars, color T.V.'s, VCR's, microwave ovens, and even
cell phones.

*    One in five children (14.3 million) lived in poverty in
     1991, the highest number since 1965.  The majority of poor
     children are white; most have a parent that works; and most
     live outside large cities, in rural and suburban America
     (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992).

There are alot of factors involved in this, one of which is that
many of these are single parent households, usually a single
mother, often the primary breadwinner has abandoned the family.
This points to bad social policy i.e. letting someone else pay,
rather than any failing of capitalism.

Why anyone so poor would choose to have children is beyond me.

*    The United States, compared to other countries, ranks 20th
     in infant mortality (UNICEF, State of World's Children,
     1992, U.S. Data from NCHS, 1991).

You can't make people not smoke or drink during pregnancy, nor eat
the right foods and avoid the unhealthy crap. You can't force them
to go to the doctor for regular checkups. Again, nothing to do with
capitalism

*    The United States, compared to other countries, ranks 17th
     in the world in percentage of 1-year-olds fully vaccinated   
     against polio (UNICEF State of the World's Children Report   
     1993, 1992, U.S. Immunization Survey, 1985).

Polio vaccinations are free, score one for capitalism, and social
policy. Minus one for bad parents.

*    The United States, compared to other countries, ranks 14th
     in life expectancy and 4th in literacy (Howell, B., 1990).


I'll bet extropians rate 1st in both. Again other people chose
differently. Eating poorly, lack of exercise, driving cars, all bad
if widely available, but a personnal choice.


*    The United States has one of the highest degrees of
     inequality in distribution of income (Smeeding, T.M.,
     O'Higgins, M., & Rainwater, L., 1990). (I have more sources on 
     this, if anyone wants them, just ask. -- EM)


So what? Some people take higher risks/work harder/just plain
luckier than others.


*    The United States has higher child poverty than seven other
     major industrialized western countries (UNICEF, State of the
     World's Children Report 1993, 1992).  The U.S. child poverty
     rate is dramatically higher than those of Canada, Germany,
     Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

We dealt with this above.


*    America's wealth as  measured by the gross national product
     (GNP) reached  an all-time high in 1990.  Between 1979 and
     1989, GNP grew by more than one-fourth, but child poverty
     increased by 21 percent (Johnson, C.M., Miranda, L.,
     Sherman, A., & Weill, J.D., 1991).

Same again, already been there.

*    About half of the Nation's poor in 1991 were children under
     18 years of age (40.2).  Children are almost twice as likely
     to be poor than any other group of Americans, including the
     elderly (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992).


Huh? half the poor were children? If you're poor and you have
children, they will also be poor.

*    In 1991, the poverty rate among children in female-headed
     families was 55 percent, more than five times the rate among
     married-couple families (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1992). (so 
    much for equal chances -- EM)

Bad social policy, every child has two parents, make them both pay.

And for those who believe that the poor are not "really poor":

*    Poor families are less likely to have nutritionally adequate
     diets than nonpoor families.  Children who have inadequate
     diets lag in growth and have more frequent, more severe, and
     longer-lasting infectious diseases.  Inadequate nutrition,
     including iron deficiency (with or without anemia), may also
     affect cognitive development and social behavior, with
     undernourished children being more apathetic (Kotch, J., &
     Shackelford, J., 1989).

Once again come to Chicago, and watch the poor trade food stamps at
half value to blackmarket dealers for cash, used to buy cigarettes,
booze, drugs, and more junk food. Bad social policy. 

*    Poor children are believed to experience mental and
     emotional problems more frequently than nonpoor ones (Gould,
     M.S., Wunsch-Hitzig, R., & Dohrenwend, B., 1981).  The 1987
     report, Children's Mental Health: Problems and Services,
     noted the relationship between poverty and minority group
     membership and environmental stresses.  These stresses posed
     risks to children's mental health (Dougherty, D.H., Saxe,
     L.M., Cross, T., & Silverman, N., 1987).

<sigh> self evident again, people who do all of the above are going
to have a lousy family life.

It still sounds like socialism Erik (a correctly regulated one?) I
would appreciate you explaining the difference. I would also like
to know what you mean by Automatism.

Capitalism <def> n. the economic system in which the means of
production and distribution are privately owned and operated for
profit.

The problems you've cited seem a result of bad social policy and
poor choices by individuals. Unless you can somehow attribute them
to the above definition.

 I don't see that "commerce" is needed in an information society. As I see
it, commerce is you giving me some object or benefit in return for me
parting with some object or benefit. However, the unique thing about
information is, if I give it to you I don't part with it. So why should I
want something in return? Taking something from you is an extra hassle I
can do without.

 I think I do get something from you "automatically" if you take
information from me. I get your attention. And in an information based
economy, as others have pointed out, attention is the scarce resource.
Thats my personal experience on the Web and on mailing lists anyway.

 The problem is trading information for real objects and resources that
people have to part with for you to have them. That leads to all the
copyright hassles, and patents, attempts to "scarcify" and "objectify"
information. I hope those attempts don't succeed, but they might.

 Being by nature lazy, I hope Dan is wrong about people wanting allows to
work. For myself, I find play more satisfying, and more creative in the
long run.

Call me evil, but I just love to see someone get backed into a corner when their
DOGMA is challenged.  I personally love the free-market.  I consistently back
free-market proposals over government-centered ones.  Thats why I am asking other
free-marketeers if they can conceptualize a market-mechanism which would
alleviate the poorer segment of humanity without resorting to some kind of
regulatory socialist system.  So far only Dan Fabulish has been able to do so
with any degree of logic and demonstration.

Is your *particular* free-market philosophy so weak that it cannot withstand
debate?  And you call yourself an extropian?  If you can't deal with healthy
debate within your own community (I am an extropian and have been so for at least
8 years) how to you expect to deal with it in the rest of the world?

I agree here, assuming access to the internet gets sufficiently cheap and complex web site administration doesn't require the rigorous
training it does now.  I just can't imagine the typical back teller learning the ins and outs of HTML, CGI, PERL and/or SQL. It must
become simpler to implement.  Then we could see a full-scale Bazaar on our hands!  That would be fun!

I think "religion" is seeking truth.  Religions have generally found
it.  Just like "science" seeks knowledge (or the creation of theory)
and General Relativity has found it.

Even if science were seeking "the supreme truth" what scientists would
claim to have found it?  As it happens quite a few, and they were all
wrong.  And when we find the Theory of Everything that defines
everything from Quantum Gravity to why I'm on this list, it'll still
be false.  I honestly have no use for the truth.  The truth bores me. 
If you're looking for truth in science then it's going to be a long
day.  Religion offers instant satisfaction (a great thing in this
consumer society).  So which of the two is better?  Fortunately
neither science nor extropianism claims to offer the truth, so we're
safe.

[BTW, I'm fully aware that I'm contradicting some previous posts,
"Open Truth Networks" for instance.  However, I still think it's
possible for an open society to exist under the illusion of truth (as
John K. Clark said at the time, in reality the truth could be any
number of things, we can never be entirely sure).  Perhaps a closed
society (via increased personal privacy, cryptography, anonymity,
etc.) would lead to the disillusion of "truth" and "reality" and the
advancement of society.]

Science seeks to gain knowledge, not information.  Knowledge advances
us by creating more knowledge; information doesn't have this property.
 Perhaps we could say science is a religion by Erik's definition, but
that would contradict my definition so I'd rather not.

So your theory yields absolutely no benefit, creates no knowledge, and
has no application?  In that case I would question whether it is
theory or just noise.

If your seeking truth then religion is the perfect answer, so it does
have utility.  Knowledge simply leads to more knowledge or
information, which is (from my point of view) beneficial.  However, in
a utilitarian sense knowledge is not always beneficial, in fact
religion is probably the best answer to any utilitarian philosophy.

Truth is what they seek, which truth doesn't matter since all truths
were created equal.  Tell them their ideas are false and of course
they won't listen.  Prove to them that their ideas are false and
you've done the impossible.  Science and truth do not mix, science can
never discover a truth because *everything* is open to question.

>From my perspective (I expect we agree in more ways than our semantics
allow) what is true and what is false are one and the same.  Anything
that you consider to be true I can offer a counter truth, neither and
both of these are true.  The truth is unknowable.

Whether or not a claim has a "memetic advantage" hardly settles the issue of
what claims to make.  Back when people spoke of "rhetoric" rather than
"memetics" (a fine distinction, I suppose, but one must stay au courant the
buzzwords), they widely recognized that persuasion should stop short of
falsehood.

thanks!  i agree.  the word "cult" has strong negative connotations, but
perhaps we extropians should not be so quick to disown the 
title.  if we wear it with a certain pride, that derogatory connotation
could lose its sting.  i have no problem being called a cultist, if that
cult
is one that promotes disciplined thinking, positive messages,
observation and analysis of emperical data instead of blind faith... sj

I was wondering if we could use exi-euro for multi-lingual
communication? Any "vetos"? Personally, I'd find it rather interesting
to read stuff in different languages... as long as it's in ASCII ;-)

I've been thinking about translating some of Max's texts on Extropian
Principles, but this is a LOT of work and I don't have much time. If
there were any people interested in doing that kind of work, it
shouldn't be too hard putting up a German site (I'd be willing to do
some help with that)...

later,
Holger

I see no falsehood in the claim that "the existence of (the Judeo-Christian)
god is so unlikely that it can be treated in the same way as the [potential] 
existence of elves: it is irrelevant to everyday life. Furthermore, the existence
of a Supreme Being, especially one with the characteristics of the Judeo-
Christian god is not desirable to the more serious transhumanist, because
it would likely frustrate his tecno-ascension and severely curb his freedom."

I don't know whether or not the above should be called "atheism", 
"agnosticism" or something else, but it seems like the most rational
approach. As for the "memetic advantage": transhumanism and religion
(and most political ideologies etc.) are competitors in the memetic 
field, they both hunt for the souls of the undecided. People tend to
go with the strongest (loudest) speaker, and since many of the competing
philosophy's spokespersons are loud and cocksure, similar tactics
must be employed (sometimes -- depending on your audience) to stand 
a chance. In this case, the end justifies the means, IMHO of course...

Questioning your beliefs is good, but there is also something like too 
much of a good thing. Just like we assume that the sun will rise 
tomorrow, we must also (for the sake of practicality) assume that 
god isn't going to come down from the heavens to save/kill/whatever 
us.

The central government with its' legal monopolies and arcane tax laws is a
great contributor to the present horrible state of the poor in the US. The
minimum wage law and welfare are two more problems.

We have never seen a true free market on Earth, far as I can see. Maybe we
need to try it before dismissing it out of hand..

All bought on credit, stolen, or bought with the proceeds of illegal
activity, unfortunately. These things give little comfort when you have to
share them with rats and roaches and drug dealers..Our poor might have
material things, but are still in true poverty in the healthcare and
nutrition areas in many cases. Not to mention the spiritual and educational
areas!

I think it's about time the CHA pulled those anthills down. I just wish they
had figured out where to move the tenants first..

A true "free market" world could very well work (I really don't know, and neither
does anyone else), but it is utopic. There will always be concentrations of
power ("governments"), and people that will use that power for their own benefit 
and at the expense of others (as long as there *are* people, that is). It makes
more sense to improve the concept of government than to pursue some
free market anarcho-capitalist illusion. Maybe Powers will have a free market
...maybe not.

But whom do you propose to steal them from?  And
if theft is okay, for people who've been laid off, then
why not have them do it themselves?

I assume you are not serious, as this would significantly devalue a
company, effectively offseting the economic reasons for the lay off in the
first place.

There is a bigger problem with your hypothetical leisure class.  Free
material replication and automation still won't create a leisure class in
any permanent sense.  

First, there is the problem of energy, which is neither replicable nor
renewable.  Yes, the creation and transport of energy can be automated, but
ambitious individuals could conceivably utilize more energy than could be
transported or generated locally without a mechanism for purchasing
additional energy.  I can easily conceive of situations where the leisure
class would have to get off their collective asses, as it were, to move to
a location that could provide the increasing energy requirements of said
society.  I can't think of a plausible situation where energy would not
have a finite value for these reasons.

Second, intellectual properties and similar abstractions will likely have
to be purchased as long as people are willing to produce them.  Having the
sole copy of something useful is of great value in a society where
replication is free.  The replication template for a second generation
transmorgifier might very well be worth exclusive access rights to a local
high-density energy source for a society that has free replication and
automation.

I have a couple comments.

1) I don't want to rehash an old topic, but you are demonstrating a lack of
understanding as to the function and legal ramifications of corporations.
The power, impunity, and immunity of corporations is popular myth,
generally set forth by people who do not understand the corporate legal
structure.

2) Your model economy does not make a corporation non-competitive.
Templates are essentially software.  Companies that spend a lot of time
designing and marketing useful templates will be able to make plenty of
money.  The only thing that may change is the definition of money.  In this
free replication scenario, I would expect intellectual property, like
Templates, to be the medium of exchange.  Generating original Templates
would be roughly equivalent to minting your own money.

Also, depending on how far things go, raw mass may also become a commodity
of finite value.  However, I would expect mass consumption to be balanced
by the ability to obtain more mass through application of your replication
technology.  I will assume moving mass will be accomplished via your
infinite energy source.

A double "HUH?".  I am aghast at the engineering naivet of that statement. For
transhumanity's purposes well into the next millennium w/o any significant
scientific breakthroughs, their is enough energy to power global output at its
current rate of consumption for several trillion years.  That energy source is the
Sun.  It may not be infinite, but it is renewable for all intents and purposes.
Another source of great promise is the thermal differential of the oceans which
can be tapped using OTEC generators.  Again this is not an infinite source of
energy but very renewable.  The differential tapped by the OTEC is renewed again
by the thermal output of the sun.  With the combination of solar panels on land
and OTEC's on the ocean, their would be enough energy output to easily transport
all human culture right into the nanotech era; and with minimal impact on the
environment.

HUH?  Perhaps you have missed the evolution of this thread.  So I will try to
repeat it in brief:

The Scenario is that before we reach productive nanotech, the economy becomes
so productive and efficient through automation that people become superfluous.
So why not allow everyone who is automated out of a those jobs (i.e. layed off)
become shareholders in the company?  And since when is owning some stock in a
company equivalent to a devaluation of same?

More importantly, if people are on the street with no money, they can't
contribute to the economy except through begging.  With some invested income
they can at least buy YOUR products and services and perhaps make a
contribution back to society.

Or are you sugesting that as more and more of the economy becomes automated
less and less people are needed both as employees and consumers.  So at this
point one must ask why is their an economy at all if it isn't there to serve
the people?  What is the point of a business if there are no customers?

What is your alternative?  To let them eat cake? To die off?

Paul

Naivete?  The Sun will burn out in 5 billion years, a thousand times less than
several trillion years.  Unless you meant that the full output could be stored
for later.  But a transhumanity extended into the solar system would
presumably not be operating at the current rate of consumption.  Hell,
"transhumanity" and "current rate of consumption" seems like an odd
combination.  So does "next millennium" and "current rate of consumption".

And someone has to build and maintain the solar collectors or OTEC generators.

My engineering naivete?  I was simply talking thermodynamics.  I see energy
consumption increasing by many, many orders or magnitude in the transhuman
near future.  Most of the things worth doing that haven't been done are
limited by either energy or technology.  Remove the technology barrier to
the entire population of the planet and energy consumption will skyrocket,
just to feed the technology.  Energy consumption is increasing rapidly as
it is.  Readily available energy only seems abundant by current standards.
When your average engineering project starts having peta-watt energy
requirements on a 24/7 basis as a routine part of transhuman life, finding
local, high-quality energy sources will become an issue.  I think a
not-too-far-future society could burn up the useful energy of the Solar
system pretty quickly without trying too hard.  Power technologies like
OTEC could be widely useful now, but the energy density is probably
insufficient to meet the needs of the not-so-far future.


I am quite certain that I will not be the only person spending their time
(as part of the new "leisure class") finding really interesting ways to
burn cosmic quantities of energy, given that technology is no barrier and
cost is no object.

Right.  But a system with non-sentient robots is preferable.

The assumption I'm making is that people would like to avoid working if they
can.  They would prefer to live by selling some economic resource other than
their own labor.  (I know I would!)

Or the demand for labor could decrease.  Or both.  The demand for labor could
decrease due to the availability of capitial (i.e. robots) which can be
readily substituted for labor.  And if we assume such robots can be
mass-produced "on demand" in huge quantities by nanotech factories...

This begs a more basic question.  An economy is a system for distributing
limited resources among people with unlimited needs and wants.  But is it safe
to assume that needs and wants are unlimited?  What if they aren't?  What if
the number we are looking for is very large, but not infinite?

Every time you add a sentient robot to the work force, you are adding
production, but you are also adding a CONSUMER.  Then you need to add more
robots to serve the needs and wants of those you already have.  It becomes a
never-ending cycle!  Where does it stop?

Same here.  The only difference is that the sentient robot also becomes a
consumer.  We don't need more consumers.  I would rather let my non-sentient
robot do the producing, and I'll do the consuming.

If you want to create sentient machines for this purpose, that's fine.  That
seems to me like the moral equivalent of having children.  I'm only saying it
doesn't make sense to create them for the purpose of doing work.  I've already
admitted that I don't want to work; why should I want my children to?

I don't know about the timeframe of 20-30 years, but I *hope* it will be

exactly what I meant when I started the whole "Abolition of Work" thread.

Obviously they will have to sell some other economic resources instead of
labor.  According to economic theory, all economic resources fall into these
categories: land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurial ability.

Whenever jobs are replaced by automation, it means capital is being
substituted for labor.  What we're facing is the transition from a
labor-oriented economy to a capital-oriented economy.  So, the ideal solution
would be for the displaced workers to become capitalists: owners of the
machines that took their jobs.  (Of course, there's a certain gap between this
ideal situation and reality.)

It's a sticky problem.  The problem with a capital-oriented economy, as Marx
observed, is that capital tends to aggregate in the hands of a few.  In a
labor-oriented economy there's a certain democratizing effect, since each
worker is limited to providing one man-year of labor per year.  If you need
more labor, you must hire more workers, thus spreading the economic benefits. 
In a capital-oriented economy you can go to Chase-Manhattan and get all the
capital you need in one stop.  The more capital you have, the easier it is for
you to sell it: tycoons prosper, others may fare poorly.

The government might have to step in and forcibly redistribute wealth in some
manner.  Heaven forbid!  Certainly we should try to avoid that outcome if at
all possible.  I don't know what the answer is.  I wrote an essay on this
subject a few years back.  I'll see if I can dig that up and possibly post it
here.

I remember vaguely that I had a debate on this subject with another fellow.  I
was pleased to discover somebody who saw the problem as clearly as I did, but
puzzled that he came to a completely different view of how to solve it.  He
wanted a socialistic system where the government would set up a huge
investment fund, and everybody would be forced to own some number of shares in
it.  The fund would be managed by an elected committee.  I was repulsed, and
came back with a plan that reduced the role of government and kept more
economic decision-making dispersed, in the hands of the people. 
Unfortunately, I no longer remember anything about how *my* plan worked! 
YAARGH!!

It probably depends on how hard they try.  Hardly anybody today sees this

If there are too many people without the resources to make a living by other
means, there will be political pressure to do /something/ about it.  Just
consider the absurd redistribution-of-wealth programs that are kept alive
today with far less reason, such as Social Security!

What about signal interference?  I assume we have limited EM bandwidth to work
with.  You probably can't directionally distinguish signals from two stations
at interstellar distances.  So, I reckon the most efficient way is to have one
directional transmitter and receiver for each adjacent node your station is
linked to.

Indeed so.  But I'm not sure how much EM bandwidth we have to work with, in
practical terms.  This could be important to know, in terms of predicting what
sort of capacity the network will have.  Potential investors would want to
know what sort of return to expect on their investment, for example.

That sounds good to me.

There may be practical obstacles.  I would not jump to the assumption that
asteroids are everywhere.  Our own solar system resembled a demolition derby
in its early history, but that might not be typical at all.

As many as 80% of all stars are part of multiple star systems.  The orbital
mechanics that are possible in these systems are rather mysterious.  Nobody
knows if those systems can contain asteroids or planets at all -- and even if
they do, the orbits might be so eccentric that establishing a station and
keeping it running would be impractical.

Finally, a large majority of stars (I forget the exact statistic) are brown
dwarfs that may represent dark, cold, energy-starved planetary systems where
operations would be limited, and hardly anyone would want to visit anyhow. 
These are really what I was thinking about when I asked the question.  You've
got all these zillions of "dark stars" that are hard to even detect and don't
seem like they have much to offer.

Lasers?  Can you distinguish the signal from the glare of the star that your
transmitter is orbiting?  You said something about signal/noise ratios, but
the star itself could be the biggest source of noise around.

AS> I think the Internet model works fine: make it easy to connect, you
AS> only pay for your node in the network which both gives you access and
AS> acts as a part others can use.

I don't understand at all what you're saying here.  Pay for your node?  What
does that mean?  The nodes are self-constructing and self-maintaining!

I considered an idea that each node would manage its own economic system by
issuing virtual "tokens" of some sort.  These would be issued regularly --
say, once a month -- and would be valid during that time period.  Sort of a
"use it or lose it" situation.  Anybody could sign up to recieve one token per
month.  Investors would automatically get extra tokens.  Then the tokens can
be traded among different people, and used to bid for transmittor access.

(NOTE: It only makes sense to bid for transmission, not incoming data.  With a
time lag of years between stations, it's not too practical to request
something from another node.  You couldn't have anything like WWW, or at least
not within reasonable time-lag limits.)

If the station is located in a star system where material resources are scant,
it could issue access tokens to buy what it needs from the inhabitants.

So, if you were a non-investor in an otherwise un-inhabited star system, you
could sign up for your one "free" token, and that would be enough to buy
passage to somewhere else.  After all, nobody is bidding against you for
access.  On the other hand, if you were in a populated star system with lots
of network usage, your one token wouldn't be enough to ride.  You could either
sell it to somebody, or you could buy enough tokens from other people to get a
passage.

I don't think "return on investment" can have the usual meaning in this
instance.  I mean, it doesn't matter how many nodes are created, the investor
can only benefit from the one in the star system where he's currently located.
 

An interplanetary net would be fundamentally different, since it could exist
within the bounds of a single economy.  You can't really have an interstellar
economy for the same reason you can't have an interstellar government: the
distances are simply too great.  There's no interchange of resources.

AS> Look at the net: an overloaded router tells the other routers that it

That's only helpful if you're making a transmission across long distances. 
I'm assuming, or guessing, that most people faxing themselves on the network
would want to go directly to an adjacent node.  Then re-routing can't help. 
Also, if a node has any kind of failure, it can take adjacent nodes /years/ to
find out about it, and they are transmitting data all that time!

That would be really rough, wouldn't it?  You were going to visit Alpha
Centauri, then you wake up and find NINE YEARS have passed and you're still
here, because the A. Centauri station refused to accept you for some reason. 
Obviously, this is a type of failure we would like to avoid as much as
possible.

AS> BTW, are there any standards yet for domain names in space?

Not that I'm aware of.  A whole lot of new domain names are supposed to come
into service real soon now, so maybe there's something.

That "socialist fallacy" falls very closely in line with historical fact in

And if anyone finds an example -- such as Microsoft -- then we'll ignore it,
since it does't fit into our theory.  Although to be fair, Microsoft's
monopoly *is* enforced by the power of the US Government, in the form of many
copyrights and software patents.  Just imagine how quickly Microsoft would
crack down in the courts on any company that produced a MS-Windows compatible
OS!

Microsoft *obviously* have a monopoly.  No other company is legally able to
produce operating systems compatible with the huge majority of software
available on the marketplace -- software designed for MS-Windows.  There are
not only legal obstacles preventing any other company from muscling in, but
also technical roadblocks: MS have very intentionally made their OS large and
complex, and its inner workings occult, and subject to periodic change, so
that it's impractical for any competitor to attempt cloning it.  (They were
stung once by DR-DOS, so obviously Mr. Gates doesn't want that happening
again.)

I make no secret of my antipathy toward Microsoft.  This company has
single-handedly set back the development of the computer industry 10 years or
more.  They've built incredible success upon grossly inferior (often downright
bone-headed) products and lucky historical accidents.  They've used their
"compatibility standards" as a mallet to bludgeon down any competing platforms
or innovative products that might have challenged them.  They bought and
buried competitors who they couldn't otherwise crush.  Worst of all, Microsoft
have colluded with hardware makers and retailers to lock PC owners into a
never-ending spiral of hardware and software upgrades (driven by
ever-more-inefficient MS operating systems), a scam that has bilked consumers
out of untold billions of dollars.

A couple of days ago I saw a telling clip on the news.  They were talking
about possible legal trouble for the release of Windows98.  They had an expert
who said THE INDUSTRY REALLY NEEDS WINDOWS98!  Why did he think we need it so
badly?  Because it's a better product?  It will allow people to do more with
their computers?  No...  He said WE NEED IT TO STIMULATE SALES OF HARDWARE AND
SOFTWARE.  Of course!  Win98 will need more RAM, more processor speed, more
hard drive space -- so, people will have to upgrade their computers.  That's
good for business!  And all the software companies will jump in with new and
improved software, designed to "take advantage of the advanced features of
Windows98".  The new software won't actually be any more useful than the old
software, only somewhat bigger and slower, but it'll sure be good for sales!

Many people in the industry are not afraid to admit publicly that this scam is
taking place.  Why should they care if people know?  It's not like there's any
other viable platform that people can turn to.  Oh, there's Macintosh, I
guess, but Mr. Gates now has a finger in that pie too.

Finally, an observation that was recently published in The Funny Times:

As a Libertarian, I would argue such laws exist not because animals are
considered to have "rights", but rather because some humans simply find these
activities unpleasant.  It's the same way we get misguided laws against
gambling, prostitution, possession of narcotics, and other victimless crimes.

So, what do you think about rule-based AI projects, like Cyc?

Yeah, but an end that must be very carefully considered.  

I've thought about what kind of philosophical /purpose/ or role such artifical
sentient beings could fill.  They would, in practical terms, be a branch of
humanity.  They would be products of our culture, our civilization --
essentially humans in different form.  No identity of their own.

When I was young I read lots of SF stories about aliens.  Aliens were cool! 
There's something to be said for the idea of humanity not being alone in the
universe.  But, it now seems unlikely that our galaxy is teeming with aliens
just waiting for us to come and meet them.  We need to create our own aliens.

I would like to find an Earth-like planet somewhere, or maybe terraform a
planet, and create a race of beings to inhabit it.  Drop the first generation
on the planet's surface with nothing: no language, no tools, no experience. 
Then sit back and watch as they build their own civilization from nothing: a
slow and painful process, no doubt.  But, everything they had would be theirs,
not something borrowed from us.  They could develop a complete identity of
their own.

AS> Just you wait until the first AI is interviewed on CNN and starts to

I shudder.  What if that AI turns out to be one of the non-sentient ones,
under my definition?  The bush robot I described earlier could certainly put
on that sort of performance, if it's owner told it to.

What happens when a highly sophisticated, non-sentient AI can pass the Turing
Test?  How do you convince most people that a machine is non-sentient when it
can so convincingly /pretend/ to be?

I think we are operating on different timescales, here. Paul is worried about
the transtion era, starting as automation accelerates and ending at the singularity.
After the singularity, as Damien points out, An SI will certainly be able to
concieve of projects with a high demand for resources. In particular, an SI that
wants to maximize its computational resources may very well decide to convert
all available mass in the solar system to neutronium, in order to minimize the
distance (and therefore the delay) between the computational elements. Obviously,
this is likely to have detremental effects on anybody else that is still around.

Actually, it's BECAUSE cost is an object that society will probably buy and
sell energy in exchange for services, information, or whatever.  It's for
this reason, at least in part, that innovators will still work to find the
next energy "gold mine," and why people will want to pay these innovators
for their secret.

No sane economist would argue that there are absolutely no natural
monopolies.  However, there are also limits as to what a natural monopoly
can do to its customers.  For example, if it jacks up the prices too high,
it will become more profitable to compete with it.  If the product is
shitty, then competitors have a profit window.  Whenever a monopoly tries
to abuse its power, it risks loosening its grasp on its industry.  So there
are some limits.

Actually, there's a great body of evidence that (at least at the time of
the study) electricity was a natural monopoly.  So, to be fair, the
government took over.  <throws his hands in the air>

Yes.  Imagine how cool Windows would be if it had open source.  :)
Copyright is synonymous with government enforced monopoly in an information
market.

The problem being that we seem to reap such benefits from copyright, that
it's hard to come to the conclusion that we should ditch the idea
altogether.  Not to mention the fact that you've got at least three or four
large and incredibly rich industries which would be levelled if we
eliminated intellectual property:  Hollywood, books, software...  I think
there's at least one more, but it's not coming to me this instant...  

Ah, well.  At any rate, Microsoft IS receiving government protection, and
it couldn't exist without it.  So at least in this example, the free market
is cleared.

Well, I am biased since I do neural nets, mingle with connectionists
and read neuroscience, but I think rule-based AI is too brittle to
work in the real world. It is great within a clean domain, but runs
into trouble when the complexity is too large. Of course, I think this
is also a property of our own high level thinking: it only works when
our low-level systems have cleaned away all the disruptive complexity
from our sensory information. Most of the real work is filtering,
categorizing and abstracting, not thinking.

Yes and no. They would not be true aliens, but they wouldn't be yet
another form of humans (unless designed that way). Even a small
difference in basic motivations would make them quite alien, and if
they also have other differences (such as new forms of perception or
no bodies) I think they would diverge quite quickly - while likely
enriching humanity with a different point of view.

An interesting and somewhat cruel experiment. [ARISTOI SPOLIER ALERT!]
This is what the villains in Walter John William's _Aristoi_ do; one
of the more interesting questions in the book is the ethics of doing
this - is it needless cruelty or giving life?

How do you convince other people that John K Clark is non-sentinent
when he is so convincing?

IMHO, if it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it is a duck or
at least a good approximation. :-)

if you have mread the bible it read that, "over all the world there 
came a dark cloud and it rained for fourty days and fourty nights."
Now this could be taken in several ways:
1. their known world was the middle east.
2. it realy rained over the whole world
3. it was wrong?

But this is not the definition of "government" that most 
anarcho-capitalist/agorists use.  All we want is to have
a purely voluntary system, whereby someone could
choose to use or not use any service from any one
or more competitors.  That is to say, we want the 
absence of legalized initiation of force.  If someone
calls themselves an anarchocapitalist, and doesn't 
agree, lemme know. :)

It makes

In a pure free market, one maximizes one's own
benefit by *helping* others, rather than at their
expense, even though the form is one of 
competition.

This was my point.  Even if all material products are produced by nanotech
assembly and work eliminated by high levels of automation, energy will have
value in any quantity, although larger and larger quantities will be
preferred as technology driven demand increases.  An obvious transition
with the advent of strong nanotech is from a strongly material-based/weakly
energy-based economy to one that is strongly energy-based with only minor
emphasis on materials.

There is no such thing as an inviolable consitutional entitlement.  A disruptive
transition may also disrupt the governments you expect to maintain this program,
and the public good will that is essential to continuing it.  

If the purpose is to insure people against risks from who will benefit from 
a disruptive transition, why not just have people buy private insurance now?
And why not work to get government out of the way of such private insurance?

But aren't you going to have to put huge taxes on those goods to finance
this minimum income?  The income has to come from somewhere you know.

Economist have a lot to say about variations on minimum income schemes,
and I really think you'd benefit from reading more of that literature.

Stock *options* are a corporate liability, and therefore devalue a company.
 Issuing stock is not a liability per se, but without receiving fair value
for the shares, the existing shareholders will have their value diluted
significantly.  BTW, in many localities it is legally required that fair
value be given for issued stock i.e. the corporation can not give it away.

A person whose only skill in this economy is labor (or begging) is
worthless.  If replication is truly free (or cheap enough that everyone
else doesn't mind picking up the tab) then they will likely get fed,
sheltered, but largely ignored.  Fortunately, most people have value beyond
their labor.  I expect an inability to adapt to an information and
creativity economy to be a major "impoverishing" factor during the
transition period.

In your scenario, business as we know it is dead anyway.  All this "free"
replication technology did not come out of thin air.  For there to be free
replication technology and resources for all, there has to be a *serious*
abdication of ownership at some point between here and there.  Such
abdication might be altruistic, but I would not call it good business.

Automation will mean that your average "poor" person will have the
ability of one of today's large corporations.  Their standard of
living won't just be higher, it will be transhuman.

You're attributing automation with centralism.  Autonomous
technologies can produce other autonomous technologies at near-zero
prices, when this happens *everyone* will have these technologies, not
just large corporations and governments.  Currently automation looks
bad because of centralism, think of a world where you send your
automaton to work for you rather than be replaced by it.  Every person
already consists of many autonomous components, adding to these does
not mean outmoding ourselves.

If markets become a ubiquitous means of resource sharing, I would
expect transactions to become a reactionary (autonomous) response. 
That should take care of all our "money" problems, and we can worry
about other things.

In an earlier post Damien Broderick voiced the opinion that there might be a
problem in the transistion period between todays market based economy and
tomorrows replicator based economy.  He speculated that a type of gauranteed
minimiuim might be useful to ease the transition.

I found the following information to be interesting in that regard.

A MEDICARE MUTUAL INSURANCE SYSTEM

A mutual insurance model for a new Medicare system is proposed by 
Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), and Texas A& M University economists 
Andrew J. Rettenmaier and Thomas R. Saving in the New England 
Journal of Medicine.

They propose that over a 50-year transition period, Medicare be 
changed from a transfer payment system to one in which each age 
group -- defined as all the people born in any given year -- 
would contribute to an investment fund to pay for the health care 
needs of that group in retirement.

   o   Workers in each age group would pay a set percentage of 
       their wages throughout their working lives for health care 
       in retirement.

   o   The annual cumulative funds collected from each age group 
       would be divided equally and deposited in each person's 
       account to grow until retirement.

   o   Investment account providers would be subject to 
       reasonable requirements with respect to the safety and 
       soundness of their portfolios and required to take all 
       applicants.

   o   If a person died before retirement, his contributions 
       would be redistributed to other members of the respective 
       age group.

As each age group moves through its life cycle, the contribution 
rate would be adjusted to take into account changes in 
experience, just as other casualty-insurance rates are now 
adjusted.

Since all workers in an age group would pay the same tax rate, 
workers would subsidize nonworkers and high-income workers 
subsidize low-wage earners.

Funding the transition cost from the current tax transfer system 
would have a present value cost of about $1.4 trillion, say the 
authors, compared to unfunded liabilities under the current 
system of $2.7 trillion.  Workers 43 and under would be fully 
covered by the new system -- initially paying a higher tax rate 
to help fund the Medicare benefits of current retirees and older 
workers.  

The contribution or tax rate on younger workers would fall for 
each age group as they accumulated enough funds to pay for their 
retirement medical expenses, and the cost of funding 
benefits for a shrinking pool of retirees under the old system 
fell.

DEMONSTRATING THE VALUE OF INTELLIGENCE

Innate intelligence -- rather than environmental and social 
factors -- largely determines how much people will earn, claims 
Charles Murray in a new report from the American Enterprise 
Institute.  

His findings, contained in the study "Income Inequality and IQ," 
are based on an analysis of 2,859 young adult sibling pairs.  The 
pairs were raised in the same home and had the same parents, but 
their Intelligence Quotients (IQs) differed.

   o   "Very bright" siblings, with IQs above 120, earned a 
       median of $33,500 a year -- $11,500 more than their 
       "normal" siblings, whose IQs ranged between 90 and 109.

   o   "Normal" siblings earned a median of $9,750 more than 
       their "very dull" siblings, whose IQs were less than 80 
       and who had median earnings of $7,500.

   o   Wondering what would happen to siblings if the very best 
       social advantages were introduced, Murray set up a 
       "utopian" sample -- siblings who spent 14 years in an 
       intact family with median earnings of $50,000 a year.

   o   The "utopian" siblings' earnings remained stratified by IQ 
       and were only slightly higher than their counterparts in 
       the general study.

The one exception was for "very dull" siblings.  Those who grew 
up in ideal settings earned 47 percent more than those who did 
not.

The top IQ group in the study earned almost five times as much as 
the bottom group.

The study points out the nearly insurmountable difficulties 
involved in trying to eradicate income inequality.

Murray was the coauthor of the 1994 book, "The Bell Curve: 
Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life," written with 
the late Richard Herrnstein.

Factor," and Linda Seebach (Rocky Mountain News), "Roots of

It seems rather odd that as a child the first thing you learn is 
automation, just take a look at child birth.  Sexual intercourse is 
sometimes viewed as an automated process (in, out, in, out,...).  
Schooling is a highly automated process.
Being human? Well, that to maybe an automated process 9in some 
respects). The human brain--the most automated processor of all time 
(does this make a human automated though????)

no probaly not, as far as I can tell many of us (extropians) are not 
as automated as humans as the rest of society, for we have chosen to 
be different.  Differance is what brakes automation.  But do not try 
to hard to be different just be who you are and you should be viewed 
as a better human for doing so.

So be all the human that you can be and don't fall for gimics or do 
what someone tells you, even if they have more "power" than you, you 
still have a choice as a human being of the planet earth, and don't 
be afraid to make the choice you feel most comfortable with.

The binary numeric notation used by computers uses two numbers,
0 and 1, and is known as Base 2 (B2) (our traditional numeric 
system is Base 10 (B10)). So what's the 1 digit of a Base 1
system, 0 or 1?  The case for it being 0 and the case for 
1 both seem to be equally logical. Which case is true?

Here's the "B1 digit = 1" argument based on the rule by 
which we grade the value of a 1 in a given Bn column:


number
columns    3     2     1


Base 10:  10^2  10^1   10^0
          100   10     1 
         ------------------
           1     1     1   =  one hundred and eleven 


Base 2:   2^2   2^1   2^0
           4     2     1
         ----------------- 
           1     1     1   =  seven


Base 1:   1^2   1^1   1^0 
           1     1     1
         -----------------
           1     1     1   =  three


So this says that the B1 system assigns the value of just 
1 to any 1 appearing in any column, hence 1111 = 4(B10).
Seems logical, but then here's the "B1 digit = 0" case:


   B10 = 0123456789
   B5  = 01234
   B2  = 01 
   B1  = 0


And in this case we would say that Bn = (n - 1), which
is to say that in B10, the highest number is 10 - 1 = 9,
and therefore, in B1 the highest number is 1 - 1 = 0.

This case seems as logical as the opposite case for 1.

Is it that 0 (as just a placeholder) = 1? After all,
when we say "Base 2" and the two numbers of B2 are 
0 and 1,  we are assigning the value of 1 to the 
0 and 2 to the 1... right? Is this paradoxical?
I think it's that 0 = 1 number = 1 tally mark.

Oh.  Well, we can do this another way, then.
If people are willing to buy stock (either on
credit, or from what they now make), then I've
no problem with this, though you might find
it difficult at first to get a loan officer to lend
money for "investment".

>So why not allow everyone who is automated out of a those jobs (i.e. 
>laid off) become shareholders in the company?  

No problem.  You can become such a shareholder 
now.  However, if you just *give* them the shares,
that percentage of the company's worth must come
from someone else's share.  Now, it is true that 
after the automation the capital assets of the 
company are worth more, but the same people
who got the shares should have paid for the 
automation, else the money comes from someone
who received no return on it.

>And since when is 
>owning some stock in a company equivalent to a devaluation of same?

It is only a devaluation if you arbitrarily
increase the shares, with no more actual
worth.  This is the same as monetary
inflation, but in shares.

Yes, but if you just *give* them the "invested income",
then they are buying your goods from you with your
money; that is, you are just giving away everything
that they can buy with what the invested income 
brings to them.

*I* am not suggesting this.  Dunno about James Rogers.
As the economy becomes automated, we will all be able
to buy and use more or improved products.

Point taken.  But you still haven't risen to the challenge I set forth in the
beginning of this thread:

Is there a free-market mechanism (incentive) w/o coercion that would alleviate the
poorer segment of the populace through this transition period?

Watch yourself here.  Sending a simple black and white photo presupposes:

1)  That they have electromagnetic vision similar to ours.

2) That their vision is at the same frequency as our - highly improbable.  Our
'visible' spectrum makes up much less than 1% of the EM range.  Have you seen a
picture of a human face in infrared?  Its very difficult to tell where one
feature ends and another begins.

3)  That they would have the same spatial awareness to put something into a 2-d
grid.  Why not a tetrahedron or some kind of non-linear grid system?  What is
'simple' to them may be extremely difficult for us because of vastly different
evolutionary histories.

As a test it would be fun to take an x-ray photograph of a jellyfish and then
digitize it into 0's and 1's and then send this binary coded message to SETI to
see if they can interpret it.  Depending on how clever they are, it could take
them years to figure out what it is.

Off hand, I can not think of a free market mechanism that would serve as a
solution given your criteria.  However, in this scenario, giving someone
everything necessary to survive comfortably (but nothing more) would likely
be an insignificant cost, even in the aggregate.  It would only take a
small inkling of altruism to spare the scraps of energy required to sustain
the transition era impoverished.  The impoverished add no value to the
economy, but cost very little as well.


However, I think the scenario will play out a little differently than as
you describe.  The transition of marketable skills may happen somewhat
prior to the transition of the production economy, creating a very
uncomfortable gap for those who cannot adapt and whose skills are no longer
valued.  Information/knowledge economic transitions are happening now,
while strong nanotech is still decades off.  In this case, it may be far
too expensive to support those who cannot adapt, since the difference
between skill value and cost of support would be large enough to be a very
significant burden on the productive segment of society, far more than
altruism is likely to support.

This transition may not have a "feel good" solution.

	Assuming these aliens recognize visual stimulation as a form of 
communication and recognize that we do as well... Perhaps whales are 
attempting to do just that-- only instead of binary digits they're 
singing us an "image" and cant for the life of them figure out why we

A simple logical question: WHERE would enough water come from, to totally
cover the Earth above the tops of all mountains? To cover K2/Everest would
require about 29,000 feet of water above sealevel.

If you vaporized all the ice on Earth, the resulting rainfall would only
raise the sealevel by maybe 25 feet.

The only way this makes sense globally is for God to import a few million
ice asteroids, and vacuum up the mess after the forty days..

	Of course!  Remember God is all powerful he can do anything he
wants.  It's just like the fact that we know God created a 4 billion
year old earth a mere 6000 years ago because the bible tells us so!

If by poorer you mean lacking anything worth trading, then I'd say 'no'.  We
could go back to the rich having lots of servants, a la the 19th century.  As
someone said, a use can probably be found for any sufficiently cheap labor.
Part of current Western unemployment is said to be native poor people being
unwilling to take janitorial jobs which immigrants come here for.

If automation was really really cheap the capital to survive might be cheap
enough to purchase out of wages.  I don't know if that's plausible.

I think this depends on what is considered adequate support.  Food,
alternative housing in rural places, and simple clothing would cost a few
thousand dollars a year, I think.  Federal poverty level for one person is 6-8
grand, I think.  Supporting 100 million Americans at $4000/year would require
$400 billion/year, which is less than half of what we spend on retired people
now.  I suspect the West is perfectly capable of supporting huge portions of
its population at a low level, at noticeable but not self destructive cost;
the catch is in competing with societies which do not impose such a cost on
themselves.

This is not within the free market, of course.


Earlier Paul said that solar energy would suffice for the transition period.
This seems to assume that while a nanotech economy could use arbitrary amounts
of energy ours could be saturated.  I doubt this is the case, even in the
short term.  I can conceive of society having a practically infinite supply of
water, where all uses are fulfilled and there's not a damn thing to do with
the excess.  But not energy.  There must be plenty of activities which would
become profitable if energy was cheap enough.  Low-grade mining; landfill
mining and recycling; carrying the extra mass of parachutes and other safety
features on planes; checking for defects; creation of industrial quantities of
diamond, corundum, and other high-energy materials; spaceflight.  Give me
cheaper energy and I'll use it.  Say that I don't need that much to maintain
my current standard of living, and I'll say that's an arbitrary peg, and those
who don't work can be supported now (see above.)

Again, *how* will people be able to but and use more or improved products
when those products are being made almost completely with human labor?

Your points on stock devaluation are well taken, but you have yet to
demonstrate how the free-market can alleviate those people who are
permanently automated out a job.  The automation process is accelerating
faster than people are capable of re-training.  So as you said, if you are
not suggesting that people become superfluous what are they going to do to
survive besides begging or stealing.  If you can't answer this with adequate
demonstration, then you have yet to meet the challenge that I proposed at the
very beginning of this thread.

Finally Ah ah!  Therein lies the rub!  You see, most people in the US at least
have enough money to get by.  So if the economy is increasing in productivity and
efficiency, why then will more and more people become impoverished instead of
becoming better off?  I tell you why, because the means of production and capital
becomE accumulated at the top at the expense of all those at the bottom.  It's
simple mathematics!  Gee, sounds like this is already happening.  NPR announced
the other day that now 94% of US wealth is in the the hands of the top 20% - the
greatest discrepancy in US history. Hmmmmmm...

***So if I were to take your scenarios seriously, the free-market is nothing more
than a ripe opportunity for the rich to get richer at the expense of the rest of
us.***

I cannot think of a better argument against free-markets than the one you have
just outlined!! :-)

If not, then only one conclusion can be drawn - AUTOMATION IS BAD FOR THE ECONOMY.

Boy its fun being a devil's advocate!!

Just as wages drop, prices will drop.  Remember, jobs don't vanish, but
rather low wages make a job worthless.  And the lower the price level, the
more worthwhile low wages are.  So people will use their lower wages to buy
goods at a lower price.

This was intended as an example, and is not the only possible use by an
SI of all the mass it can get. The example is by refrence to
"Dragon's Egg", by Robert L. Forward, and is reall idle speculation
on my part. Yes, you would start by squeezing everything into a
neutron star. The idea is that the crust of the star would consist
of matter that is almost, but not quite, compressed enough to
form pure neutronium. This matter is assumed to exist as atomic matter
with the electrons compressed almost into the nucleus, radically reducing
the size of the atoms. You end up using most of the matter in the solar
system as the core of the star, which is hard to use for computations.
The crust is available to build the computer. The result is roughtly
a thousand times denser that nanotech made from normal matter, so I guess
it's picotech. It should operate at least one thousand times faster than
nanotech because of reduced speed-of-light delays.

If this is not feasible, the SI may still want to use ALL the matter
in the solar system to maximize its computational capacity.

But matter is convertable to energy. Just use nanotech to build a "Mister Fusion."

You and I are already in agreement.  In fact I appreacite the insights you have

brought to the table.  I am playing devil's advocate with the other
free-marketeers to see how solid the ground of their assumptions are, and if
they can withstand debate.  Many of them are either not up to the challenge I
am giving, or they conclude that we must increasingly work harder in order to
keep up, or perish.

A point they seem to overlook, is if the overall economy and means of
production are accelerating, why then would a increasingly larger segment have
to work harder just to keep up?  Simple mathematics tells us that either more
and more people will be better off (as you have eloquently demonstrated), or
conversely a decreasingly smaller elite grabs the whole pie.

If their conclusion is the latter, then it's a major blow to any free-market
principle.  At this point, why would the rest of us give a damn about
free-markets when it means increasing numbers of people will suffer?  If they
are standing behind their principles of insisting on free-markets despite the
large loss of human life, what does this say about them?  This is the *real*
isssue I'm forcing.

Cheers,

Paul Hughes

Surely the income is conceived primarily as a dividend from the
increasingly cybernated components of the economy.  How this is realised is
up for grabs.  In Australia recently, a large chunk of the publicly owned
telcom was put on the market, and about a third of the nation's families
bought shares that instantly appreciated, netting them a windfall.  This
looks like theft, to me - a public asset notionally owned by everyone was
reallocated to a subset of the community with the spare money to buy it.
But maybe such allocations of shares could be managed in such a way that
the people being displaced from work get a continuing share in the extra
productivity their absence made possible.  (And yes, the desperates among
them will find ways to sell these off for drugs etc and be back with their
hands out the next week.  Opinions clearly differ over ways to circumvent
this or simply accept it as `evolution in action' - a heartless and
nauseating phrase when applied to human suffering, in my sanctimonious view.)

>Economist have a lot to say about variations on minimum income schemes,

I know, I'm shockingly ignorant.  All I was trying to do was point in the
direction of a class of possible solution that economists had proposed to
ease the social horrors of the transition to a largely jobless society.
Any further clues to the clueless warmly accepted.

 Seems rather like industrial age thinking to assume a higher tech society
would need more energy. For me the interesting problems are ones of
complexity. And our most complex systems have tended to get smaller and use
less energy. I figure a complex, well organized acorn-brain will be able to
outhink a poorly organized Jupiter-brain.

 And what is your definition of the "leisure class"? Seems to me that many
people do for leisure what other people do for work. Neither are sitting on
their asses. The significant difference is for a "hobby" pursuit the drive
is internal rather than an external. Or are you thinking of people who
watch TV?

 Why? Most creative people I know (and I include myself) find the hassle of
trading creations for food and shelter something we could do without. A lot
of good creative output has come from people prepared to live in a garret
if that is what it takes to make their idea real. If Nanotech provides easy
food, shelter and medical aid, I'd be happy to pass on my output to anyone
who is interested. In the meantime, the Net seems to be doing a good job of
providing me a living with very little effort. So I think things are going
in the right direction.

  Having lurked on this list for a little while, there seems to be a divide
between those who demand some payment before they do anything, and those
who would like to get out of that loop. I think both choices are possible.

   IAN: If science seeks knowledge, does
   science seek true or false knowledge?

   If there are 2 varieties of knowledge,
   and if science is for true knowledge,
   then truth is the true goal of science.

As Paul Hughes has pointed out, this assumes a lot about how we
represent information. I ran into a similar problem when running a sf
roleplaying scenario where the aliens were blind - sending pictures
was useless, since they couldn't figure out what they represented when
displayed on their tactile screens. Our vision is heavily based on
edge detection, but the aliens couldn't figure out what all the lines
and curves in the signal represented since they had no obvious 2D to
3D map.

If the aliens want to communicate. My sf scenario actually involved a
war in order to *avoid* communication; see
http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Game for a description.

I agree that it would be possible to send a message that is so
unlikely to have emerged from natural processes that it is obvious
that it is artificial. But interpreting it might be extremely hard.

Careful! The Earth was created with the *appearance* of an age of 4x10^9
years just to confound the godless scientists...He (she, it?) put the fossil
record there to test the faith of the likes of Darwin, and we all know where
he is now, don't we?

Gee, I've only heard this debate about, ooh, maybe three hundred times on 
this list and others; it's pointless and I have no interest in it. I don't 
subscribe to this list for discussions I've already heard three hundred 
times before, which could be avoided if you and others would just read a 
few of the books on the reading list. 

Not that it matters anyway; if the kind of technologies we're talking 
about are possible, then government is dead. It's that simple. You can 
talk all you want about governments forcing the rich to pay for the poor, 
but the first rich person with a private nuke or -- "Bob" forbid -- grey 
goo makes the whole question moot. Government is by its very nature a target-rich environment; you can't govern in secret in any meaningful 
way. 

Now, if you want to discuss possible forms of government -- if there are 
any -- in a relatively stable posthuman society I'd be quite interested, 
but discussions of government policy in the next few decades seem as 
useful as discussions of the future of Monarchy in 1770. As far as I'm 
concerned we either end up with a massive centralised surveillance state 
or an anarchic free market; there's room around those extremes but there 
doesn't seem to be any stable middle ground.

One way, as previously mentioned, would be for the displaced to become
servants for the survivors. For centuries, the servant class was an integral
part of society, and they did not suffer degradation in the main in the last
century. The reason the servant class has disappeared in our society is
because of laws requiring tax withholding, worker's comp. and high income
taxes on those who would benefit most from the servants. If the laws were
changed to allow hiring of servants, who would themselves be responsible for
paying the costs of their employment, and income taxes were removed, I
expect many now un- or under-employed would sign on to being servants. Quite
a few 'rich' people would then be able to take on a maid or butler,
gardener, etc. They get essentially free room and board, and have incomes,
and so are a productive part of society. Sounds like a pretty good deal,
when the alternative is living in near poverty on government handouts..

Another factor is the increase of property taxes. Since these have risen in
the US, there are now no landowners who are actually 'owning' land. They all
pay rent in the form of taxes to the state. This has the effect of
eliminating the 'family home' that was the norm in the last century, where
two or three generations and their servants lived for many decades in one
place. Once you retire, you can no longer pay the taxes, and are kicked out
by the landlord eventually. The taxes on a residence that was 'comfortable'
100 years ago are now something only a Bill Gates can afford..

There was an interesting documentary on TV a couple of years ago about a
group of scientists who were given the old US Navy underwater listening
network for a few months before it was shut down. Amongst other things 
they used it to track and listen to whales around the world, and one of 
the tentative conclusions they reached was that the 'songs' were long-range 
sonar for navigation in the deep ocean; because of the inversion layer 
they could potentially image the entire ocean and the differing 'songs' 
allowed them to distinguish their returns from other whales. Wish I'd 
taped it, but I didn't realise how interesting it would be until afterwards.

Personally I find the idea of animals who can 'see' an entire ocean far
more impressive than the idea of animals singing to each other, but I
guess it takes all sorts...

I just don't get it... what do you think all those factories are going to
do, just stockpile products that people can't afford to buy? If people can't
buy them, they won't be made. Like most anti-free-market arguments, this
is just totally out of touch with anything resembling reality.

A lot of production is consumed entirely within the system itself already. I
am arguing that the human consumer as the ultimative resource sink is
to be superseded in the mid-future.

True nanotech 'factories' will be owned by everyone. They will be capable of
self-replication, and will only produce what their operators want and need.
There will be no more warehouses..

That's insane!  You're talking about a population bomb that's organically
built into your economic system!  Anyhow, whether you like it or not, economic
growth will stop whenever you run out of raw materials and energy -- in
economic terms, when you run out of "land".  Then you will have a solar system
crammed full of dirt-poor consumers and no hope of a better life.  Malthus
vindicated.

>No.  Non-sentient beings don't buy anything.  They have no demands.

That's what I like about them.  Let's go back to our root principles again...
Any economy is a system for distributing limited resources among people with
unlimited (?) needs and wants.  Adding more resources to the system is
helpful.  Adding more needs and wants to the system is HARMFUL.  So, adding
non-sentient robots is ideal: it increases the available resources without
increasing the total needs and wants.  (Actually, non-sentient robots have
some needs, but no wants.  And when a non-sentient robot is no longer useful,
it can be destroyed and recycled, which could not be done to a sentient robot
for ethical reasons.)

We have been conditioned to think that adding workers to the economy is
helpful, because they tend to produce more than they consume.  This would also
be true of sentient robots, at least until you reach your limits of growth.
However, non-sentient robots have a greater advantage.  Because they have no
WANTS, they will consume much less than the sentient robot while producing
just as much.  The net gain for the economy is much greater!

>Non-sentient robots don't buy goods.

This is a benefit, as I outlined above.

>Non-sentient robots don't buy goods; and *because* they don't buy goods,
>they don't add to the demand for jobs, so they don't CREATE jobs,

GOOD!  I don't WANT to create jobs, I want to ELIMINATE jobs!  There is
nothing sacred about jobs.  There is no reason why our economy should be based
upon work, or why jobs should be equated with wealth.  At least you haven't
shown me any reason.

>And as I've been trying to tell you, more consumers DO make us better off,
>by creating more jobs for us to fill.

How does "creating more jobs for us to fill" make us better off?  Please
explain this connection, because I sure don't see it!

>I'm not, but then, the qualitative distinction between sentient and
>non-sentient is vague at best.  I'd say that when you've got robots that
>create art, you're definitely toeing the borderline of sentience.

Art is based on emotions.  This reminds me of that other post about an AI
quoting Martin Luther King on TV.  How do you distinguish an AI that has
human-like emotions from one that's merely pretending to?

>From a purely economic standpoint, my definition of sentience is very easy: a
sentient being is one who /wants/ things.  A consumer.  Aside from that, I
don't care how competent they are.  For maximum economic leverage, robots
should be non-sentient in the sense that they don't want anything for their
own comfort or enjoyment.  There's nothing in that definition that precludes
them from being artists.

Maybe art shouldn't even be done for economic reasons!  Perhaps art should be
the province of non-workers who make their living by other means, so they can
indulge their creative urges without worrying about the bottom line.  Are you
happy with the output of Hollywood these days?  Do you like walking into a
bookstore and finding whole shelves of Star Trek novels?  All those newly
minted cyber-capitalists, freed from the burdens of work,  will have a lot of
time on their hands to indulge artistic hobbies.  It might result in a
renaissance!

>>admitted that I don't want to work; why should I want my children to?

There are certainly other ways they can do that, rather than by working.

>So they can reap the rewards of their own investments.

This does not require work.

>So they can learn to manage finite resources.

This does not require work.

>So they can create jobs which other children can fill.

Circular logic...  I should want my children to work so that my grand-children
will have an opportunity to work?  You seem to be proceeding on the basis that
work is desirable for its own sake.  I strongly disagree with that!  Work, by
its nature, is unpleasant: otherwise we wouldn't require wages for performing
it.  Labor performed for it's own sake is a hobby.  I'm all in favor of
hobbies, as long as I don't have to work for a living.

>So they can learn to deal with others on a voluntary basis.

This does not require work.

>Shall I go on?

By all means!  Maybe you'll hit upon something valid.

Whales Stranded During Military Test

A puzzling episode of whale strandings along the western 
coast of Greece might have resulted from military tests of 
sonar going on at the time, speculates a Greek researcher.

On May 12 and 13, 1996, 12 Cuvier's beaked whales ran 
aground along the Kyparissiakos Gulf, where they eventually 
died. Two weeks later, another dead whale was discovered 
on the same stretch of coast.

Oh yes, I have read most of the books your referring too and several others *not* on THE LIST.  I have heard this debate about that many times
too!  And it has yet to adequately address the challenge I set forth at the beginning of this thread.

One OBVIOUS thing you seemed to have missed - is not ONCE have I ever mentioned or advocated government support to alleviate the potential
problems I have outlined.  As a free-marketeer myself, I am asking others of the same ilk if they have insights into problems I have yet to
find solutions for - i.e. the alleviation of the poor bastards permanantly automated of the economy during the *transition* to a nanotech one.

So far only David Fabulich as been able to demonstrate anything of substance.  And oh, BTW, I have heard the same nanotech discussions
circulate on the list as least 300 times in the last couple of years.

Exactly!  We are already seeing a massive overproduction capacity in several
sectors.  And although you may have not realized it, you have hinted at an
answer.  If overproduction continues at its current pace, these companies will
have to start giving their products away at obcenly low prices.  This already
happened to the chagrin of DRAM manufacturers.  Look at the trouble they got
in.

That just means that human labor becomes
more valuable, in terms of what can be made.

I don't know that a person *can* be "permanently
automated out of a job".

I don't see any reason to think that this is the case,
since *I* retrained, last year, from being a
factory worker to being a network administrator.
It isn't even very difficult to change, for someone
who is already minimally keeping up.  If a person
isn't, then it's that person's own planning that is
problematic.

I cannot give any general proof, but
it doesn't seem to me that there is 
any problem, now or in the next ten
to fifteen years, with retraining to do
whatever needs doing.  Part of the
difficulty here is that we seem to 
have different ideas of how automation
is going to appear in the economy.
With macroscale automation, much
of it will be of the type that McDonald's
is installing this year, that is, automation
designed to improve the product, but 
which doesn't put anyone out of a job,
as long as they can adapt to the new
paradigm.  I don't think we will see
vast percentages of the economy
becoming automated before the
arrival of molecular manufacturing,
and that can be small enough that
everyone can have their own 
manufacturing facility for almost 
anything.

However using Occams razor, if no other alien races in the universe have acheived
godhood status through a singularity cultural evolution already, then it is also
highly unlikey that we could acheive such status.  if it hasn't been done already
by some other race, its not likely we will be able to do it in the future....

I won't claim that they cannot exist, but I find it highly unlikely that if
becoming godlike is a possibility in this universe that the universe is not
teeming with such beings evolved from other alien species. That we are not being
harassed and dominated by at least one of these beings right now indicates to me
that either a) they actually cooperate (another highly unlikely possibility) and
have embargoed our planet, or b) they do not exist in this universe. If becoming a
god requires one to go to another universe, then of course, it is as good as not
being one at all, as far as we are concerned...

	Watch yourself here.  Sending a simple black and white photo
presupposes:

	1)  That they have electromagnetic vision similar to ours.

granted.  but practically all complex lifeforms on this planet have evolved
such a system.
it is inherently useful in nearly all imaginable environments.

	2) That their vision is at the same frequency as our - highly
improbable.  

 i agree: their vision would most likely be a different spectrum. but it
wouldnt need to
 be the same spectrum as ours for a black and white image to be informative
to them.

	3)  That they would have the same spatial awareness to put something
into a 2-d
	grid.  

we should explore what is the simplest possible "grid".  is that a 2-d
rectangular
matrix?  even if et has a different system as you suggest, it would occur to
them to
try the simplest possible grid.  

	As a test it would be fun to take an x-ray photograph of a jellyfish
and then
	digitize it into 0's and 1's and then send this binary coded message
to SETI to
	see if they can interpret it.  Depending on how clever they are, it
could take
	them years to figure out what it is.

something like this has been tested.  seti scientists sent a bunch of bits
to a number
of smart people.  the number of bits was the product of two prime numbers.
they
reported that every test subject figured out to put the bits in a m by n
matrix and color
in the 1s (or 0s) to form a picture.  

it would be a cool challenge to try to design a number of b/w pictures to
send to
et that would encourage technology exchange, mutual understanding etc.  
thanks for the input!  spike

Even for nocturnal amphibians? Even for intelligent knots of
superfluid vortices in neutron stars? And just because they have
vision doesn't mean our 2D pictures mean anything to them, since they
might rely on phase information or have a movement-based visual system
like many predators on Earth.

But are grids obvious? Maybe the most obvious grid of all is a
hexagonal array (that patterns occurs very often in nature and complex
systems, while square arrays are very rare).

   IAN: Have they tried to recruit you? I don't
   see much in the way of persuasion to join.
   Of course, there is a one-one relation 
   between organizations that want to 
   exist and that want members.

   Generally, ExI membership tends to be of 
   people with a preexisting set of principles 
   about liberty, technology, and the future who 
   join because ExI is a subset of their worldview.

considering that the more free and capitalistic a society is, the more it
tends to privately fund charitable organizations, and recruit volunteers for
charitable organizaitons,  then a future economy should free people up to
help improve the lives of others through volunteer organizations. I think
that education will be the great growth industry along with mind network
interfacing.

Education will not mean just learning facts, which will be easy in such a
world, but will be teaching others HOW to learn and think efficiently.

you have no idea, nor do I of the sort of economic trends that have yet to
even start, but will be branched off from the technologies we can currently
conceptualize. It is too soon to tell.  However, based on past history, I am
rather optimistic.

For the time being, yes. Any "movement" needs money and people
to operate. Of course, if too many (millions?) people joined it might 
become a bureaucratic monolith, but I don't see this happening anytime 
soon.

Btw, it might be a good idea to accept that transhumanism, just like
cryonics for example, is for the enlightened few. Of course some
preaching (in order to win souls) to the outside world is great, and
even necessary to keep the membership steady, but it may also
be a good idea to "turn inwards", and make things more worthwile for
the people you already have. Transhuman institutions like ExI
(or one specially created for this purpose) could offer more tangible
benefits to their members, or rather the members to eachother.

For example, now everyone has to more or less figure out for himself
what he can do to fully use today's technological potential. That is
hardly efficient. It would be good to have an easy-to-use, frequently
updated database where the best of all fields is registered, described
and recommended. From this database a program could be made
that members can take to become more efficient (like, dare I say it,
scientology has, only based on more enlightened principles). If
you can effectively make people "healthy, wealthy and wise" (and
immortal while you're at it) there should be a reasonable rise in 
membership. A good product sells itself. Strengtening the internal 
ties also helps: many folks are looking for a substitute family, and 
therefore join a cult. Now instead of taking their money and turning
them into zombies you could make them into successful individuals,
who might help to spread the word and otherwise support the cause
(the ultimate cause of this mutual aid group could be to give every 
member an optimal starting position when the singularity hits, 
increasing the chances of survival.) 

The above is a proven formula: just about any successful religion, cult 
and political movement started out as a mutual aid group of people
with a clear common goal, that could operate with or without the approval 
of the outside world. Right now it's a bit of a neither fish nor fowl situation,
transhumanists/extropians/cryonicists being regarded as a freaky "cult", 
but not having a cult's benefits.

What is true or false knowledge? You can have either useful or useless
knowledge, but true or false is really relative ;-)

A theory can explain things to you - but even if it's a very good
explanation, it might turn out to be misleading some day. And a theory
can predict things, more or less accurately. Just because a theory gives
a good explanation or predicts things accurately doesn't mean that it's
"true". If you approach science with the ideal to find truth, you'll
either be very frustrated real soon (because no matter how hard you try,
there's no certainty or truth) OR you may find something that looks like
truth to you, which is even worse. Truth doesn't change, so if you think
you found truth, you can't deal with a new theory that contradicts your
"truth" (but might be a LOT better).

Ever read Popper? "Truth" is absolute - science may get better... btw, I
think the "true" goals of science have changed during history (so they
never were absolutely true - the only true thing was that at that
certain time, people considered those "goals" the goals of science...)

Harvard's Berkman center offers Internet policy course The Berkman
Center for the Internet & Society at Harvard Law School is offering an
experimental online course open to the public called Intellectual
Property in Cyberspace.  The course will address the question of who
should own what on the Internet.  It will consider topics such as how
should Internet domain names be assigned? Should creators of material
posted on the Net be able to object when their creations are mangled
or misrepresented? How should the law deal with situations in which
multiple authors contribute to creation of materials on the Net?
Should Internet service providers be liable for copyright infringement
when they unwittingly carry copyrighted materials without the
permission of their owners. The six-week-long course will expose
students to the latest court decisions, legislation, and scholarship
on intellectual property issues raised by the emergence of the
Internet. Students will present and refine their own views on the
issues by participating in virtual seminars and threaded
conferences. The course is free and open to the public, but
registration is limited and only available through the center's Web
site. No credits or certificates will be offered.

As I explained knowledge is neither defined as true or false, the only
attribute of knowledge is that it produces more knowledge and/or
information.  For instance, creationism is not knowledge since it does
not create any new knowledge or information (it nicely snuffs it) and
it is neither provably true nor false.  Science uses an evolutionary
model because it creates new knowledge/information (and therefore is
knowledge) and it is neither provably true nor false.  The fact that
evolutionary theory works does not make it true, and certainly does
not make creationist theory false.

[BTW, I doubt Creationism has no grounding as science.  We will soon
be creating life, consciousness, worlds and maybe even new
"universes."  If we have the power to do this, what are the chances
that we are not the creation of another intelligence?  (That question
will become even more profound when our artificial universes start
building artificial universes of their own).  It's even possible an
inferior intelligence set the algorithm running that in turn created
us.  I would even argue it's possible that we were created the other
day (or next week) and yet we cannot know.  But could we ever
communicate with our creator?  Again, it's a possibility.  Of course,
this is far from worshipping God as our one true saviour (but even
then, I'm sure an egotistical super intelligence will create a world
where his worship *is* the only salvation - it could be the next big
thing in posthuman entertainment).]

Memetic r and K strategies; either you try to have a lot of offspring
(spread the memes widely) or you try to have few offspring but make
sure they thrive ("turn invards").

As I see it we want as many people as possible to think about or use
transhumanist ideas, but there is no real need to have lots of people
in our institutions. However, at present more people would be useful,
since we are yet to reach the critical mass needed to make our
institutions work really smoothly and offer truly useful services to
the members (far too many of us are busy with careers of various
kinds, making our ability to work for transhuman goals rather spotty).

A very good idea. How to make this work is another matter - this is
exactly the kind of thing you need a critical mass to get off the
ground.

The bit about challenging other humans to decode a signal misses the basic
fact that whoever send us a signal will almost certainly NOT be even vaguely
human..What if they communicate via odor, or some other strange medium? An
image as such might not even be concievable to them..

How does that follow? Just because something has not been done, that makes

Man could never fly..

Besides, is it not conceivable that WE would be the first? Someone's got to

It could be a matter of HOW godlike these hypothetical beings were. They
might decide to remain local to their own area of the universe or galaxy, or
just act as passive observers until another race attained sufficient
godliness to be of notice.. Godlike does not presuppose they want to act

And then there's always the possibility that they ARE meddling in our

Unfortunately, creationism as it is presented in America seems to be a
literal interpretation of the Old Testament, warts and all, and teaches the
Earth is 4000 years old, created with the illusion of age to 'confound the
scientists and Darwinites'...

When I become a god, I hope to be immune to such petty trifles as demanding
'worship'..I would rather encourage my creations to become my equals and
companions..

My motto: Fertilize the extropian memes and encourage their propagation! 

Rather than recruit or enlist, perhaps "welcome."

ExI has certainly been a breeding ground for brilliant minds to come
together and a main source of transhuman brain flexing. (It's bootstrapped
my IQ a notch or 2.) 

ExI does so much for the transhuman community that I like the idea of
bringing in new members or at least folks to participate in is projects.
More members can only help keep it going, and spearheading transhumanity.

Actually I think we are trying to discuss the transition period, and not
the posthuman period. The idea is to figure out how to get from here to
there while minimizing "bad things" and mazimizing "good things'. I agree
that discussing posthuman government is silly--ants discussing the constitution.

IMO, it is also dumb to consider any radical change to the current world
order, because the transition will be complete before any major human governmental
can have a positive effect. Thus, we should consider high-value short-payback
changes, and perhaps ways to ameliorate the "bad things" that may occur
as part of the transition. I do feel that we need to avoid ireversable
information loss (species extinctions, loss of ecosystems) to the extent
possible, but other long-term problems can be deferred until posthumanity
is available to deal with them. We should also attempt to minimize the

I have been on the extropians mailing list now for a few months and I've
noticed that very few posts are made in respect to short term views.  While
it's commendable to be visionary I would think that many extropians would
concern themselves with what could be done presently to assure a transhumanist
existence in the future.  Is there much collaboration on this level?  I would
like to take more of an activist's position in exploring transhumanist
avenues.  Any recommendations?

All of the fields you mentioned below make up less than 5% of the populace.
Even if you were correct, it still would leave the remaining 95% unemployed.
But even still, most of the jobs you mention can or already are becoming
automated.

Can't argue with this one! :-)

This is debatable.  I once read a rather interesting but somewhat incoherent
story, which I later found out was created by a computer program running on a
486.  I have a friend who is working on interactive fiction software at Carnegie
Mellon.  As computer power increases and interactive heuristics improve, more
and more people will be reading and playing in complex fictional environments
without the need of an author.

See above.  Although anyone can always contribute in this area. We need all the
art we can get.

> d: scientific researchers

A lot of things that were called science several decades ago are now completely
automated with advance computer software.  With increasing power and software
sophistication, software inches closer to becoming our collaborators rather than
just our tools.  According to Hans Moravec, human-level AI will be reached in
the 20-30 year timeframe.  At such a point, super-AI could exceed humans in
almost any scientific enterprise.

> e: explorers

Much of this is already automated.  Orbital reconasaince satellites, underwater
rovers, and most especially robotic space probes.  Despite the fact that 'I'
want to go to space, it is much cheaper to send a robot to explore the deep
reaches than to send a human.

hehehe.  And you call yourself an extropian - shame on you! :-)

Politicians are the most easily automated of all.  If we have ubiquitous
internet access, everyone can vote as much or as little as they like, depending
on how important a specific issue is to them.  Electronic voting heralds a move
from representational to participatory democracy.

> h: lawyers

Most lawyers are contract lawyers of one kind or another.  Contract *law*
becomes superfluous when you can circumvent the need for such laws with Smart
Contracts. The advent of smart contracts (see
http://www.best.com/~szabo/smart_contracts_2.html) will render the majority of
lawyers useless.  Who needs a lawyer when you can use cryptography and digital
reputations for secure transactions?

Your right, I have no idea.  That's why I was hoping some of the more
economically adept could enlighten me as to how the transition to a fully
automated economy would not render the majority of the workforce obsolete
without them having a means to continue prospering.

Thanks Michael for a very entertaining post!  :-)

If you follow the "A Challenge to All Extropians/Free-Marketeers" thread which I
started about a week ago, you'll see that the focus I'm trying to achieve is
*short-term*.  I look forward to the immense cosmic future that can be ours in a
post-scarcity nanotech era, but my concern is seeing us get their without a huge
division occurring between the haves and the have-nots.  IMO, there is nothing
better than the free-market in fostering innovation and technological
advancement.  However, the free-market *may* not work in all cases regarding the
majority of people who are automated out of jobs by advancing automation.  Maybe
it will, but little has been show by the staunch free-marketeers that has
convinced me otherwise.

Join the thread, maybe you will see something the rest of us are missing.  Our
collective "short-term" asses are on the line!! :-)

   IAN: A lie constitutes false knowledge.
   A true statement (i.e., a statement that 
   maximizes a 100% accurate representation
   of the physical universe or mathematic 
   models) constitutes true knowledge.

   Of course a true statement A, is A relative
   to not-A, hence the false defines the true.
   If all statements were true, they'd just 
   be statements (if in U, A = 100% and not-A 
   = 0%, A = 0%). While this defines identity-
   union (via mutual identity definition), it
   simultaneously defines identity-difference.

   We could have a universe of statements where 
   all statements were true,  only the secondary
   identity attribute "true" would have no meaning,
   all statements would just be statements, and 
   they'd be statements relative to not-statements.

   If a verbal statement was bereft of internal
   differential attributes, such a tone modulation, 
   and thus was like uniform flat-white noise, and 
   if there was no time that is was not, then it 
   would fall to 0, and would not have measurable 
   existence... just like consciousness (null).

   In short: A, if and only if not-A.

  IAN: I'd say that avoidance of a theory
  because no evidence to the contrary can
  be found is more worrisome to me than
  the possibility that a given person 
  can or cannot handle a new theory.

  My efforts to map truth have been very 
  successful. Efforts of contrarians have
  been very frustrating. So far, no examples
  of an identity or attribute of any identity
  that is not derived from differential relation
  have been found. None. The evidence for holism 
  is therefore absolute, and for atomism null,
  the fact that many denounce my theory because
  contrary evidence cannot be found worries me.

  My theory could be imperfect, no question, but 
  100% of evidence says that it's in the ballpark

   IAN: Well, we could change a true statement
   into a false statement, but that does not 
   mean it was not a true statement.

- From the FAQ:

What are extropians doing to improve their life expectancy?

         Many are supplementing their diets with significant quantities of
         vitamins and minerals, such as: 

             most B vitamins, 
             beta carotene, 
             vitamins C and E, 
             chromium picolinate, 
             zinc, 
             and selenium. 

         It is widely theorized that free radicals are responsible for many of
         the problems associated with aging, and many vitamins are known
         to remove free radicals from the body. Also, there are a fair
         number of animal studies showing that vitamins and minerals
         improve health and life expectancies. 

         An important book on this subject is: 

             Life Extension: A Practical Scientific Approach, by Durk
             Pearson and Sandy Shaw (1982). 

         I feel compelled to warn readers that some of their claims may be
         exaggerated. 

         Caloric Restriction is also a popular idea among extropians, as
         there is substantial evidence that it will increase maximum
         lifespans. For more info, read: 

             The 120-year Diet, by Roy L. Walford (1986) 

             The Anti-Aging Plan, by Roy L. Walford and Lisa
             Walford (1994) 

         Vegetarian and Vegan diets are also popular among extropians, and
         high- fat foods are frequently criticized. 

         For more information, read the newsgroup sci.life-extension, or its
         FAQ, which can be ftp'd from sunsite.unc.edu in directory:
         /pub/academic/medicine/alternative-healthcare/faqs/life-extension.


and

Do extropians live differently, or is it all theory?

         Some people who espouse extropian ideas do live
         indistinguishably from their neighbors, but here are some of
         the things that extropians are doing right now or have done
         already. Many extropians are deliberately designing and
         pursuing their own life extension programs relying on
         dietary changes, nutrient supplementation, exercise, use of
         pharmaceuticals with demonstrated life-extending effects,
         and regular laboratory tests of biomarkers of aging. Many
         extropians have arranged legally and financially for cryonic
         biostasis in the event of their accidental deanimation.
         Extropians have made career choices based on their
         extropian ideas; many are software engineers,
         neuroscientists, aerospace engineers, cryptologists, privacy
         consultants, designers of institutions, mathematicians,
         philosophers, and medical doctors researching
         life-extension techniques. Some extropians are very active
         in libertarian politics, and in legal challenges to abuse of
         government power. What most extropians do consistently
         and often is think hard about, and discuss, the changes the
         future will bring, thereby immunizing themselves against
         future shock and helping to prepare themselves to take
         advantage of the opportunities (and protect against the
         dangers) that future developments will bring. 

         Romana Machado has written an essay addressing this
         question, entitled "Five Things You Can Do To Fight
         Entropy Now." In this essay, she discusses techniques
         extropians have used to advance their physical health,
         mental health, self-defense, financial security, and
         preparation for accidental deanimation. The essay has been
         published in EXTRO 1: Proceedings of the First Extropy
         Institute Conference. 

Also, many extropians have signed up for cryonic suspension.  You can
search the mailing list archives for this one.  Alcor, at
http://www.alcor.com seems to be the most popular organization, or at least
the most visible.

I don't know. Seems to me that one attribute generally favored by natural
selection is increased awareness of one's environment.  Vision has proven to
be a very effective means of processing information about the environment
and vision is the most important sensory modality for humans. It would be
pretty surprising to me if it weren't important in most alien species (if
they exist) as well.

Science pretty much says that _truth_ is a matter of predictive and external
validity. If we discover a relationship that is replicable and thus
predictable, we tentatively call it truth-like.

The fact that evolutionary theory is coherent, elegant, and parsimonious
makes it more truth-like than creationism IMO.

Anything's possible I suppose, but why make such outlandish speculations
when more reasonable ones are available?

Also, I've changed the subject line to include "ECON:".  We've gotten
several complaints, and I think it's about time to start doing this with
all of our posts about the economy.  Let's make this a better mailing list
for you and me.  :)

Under my definition, "non-sentient AI" is oxymoronic.  My understanding of
what we were talking about were robots which would only do what they were
programmed to do.

Go back and reread my post about comparative advantage.  I'm not saying
humans would have absolute advantage over anything, just that in many cases
the ratio of goods they could produce in a given span of time would be
different from that of a robot.  It is profoundly unlikely (read: pigs will
fly) that that the RATIO of different types of goods robots and humans
could create in a day would be exactly equal, across the board for every
type of good.  (It's not even the same among individual humans!)  So humans
will certainly have comparative advantage in some goods.

Well, yes.  So, here's my case for population growth, taken mostly from
Julian Simon's "The Ultimate Resource 2."

1)  Axiom.  Promoting the greatest happiness for the greatest number is an
important moral good.
2)  Therefore.  If the number of people in society increase, without
decreasing the happiness per capita, then population growth is a good thing.
3)  Observed.  Humans, on average, produce more than they consume.
4)  Axiom.  Production taxes resources; the more production takes place,
the fewer resources will be available.
5)  Therefore.  If resources do not run out, population growth will result
in greater wealth per capita.

>economic terms, when you run out of "land".  Then you will have a solar
system
>crammed full of dirt-poor consumers and no hope of a better life.  Malthus
>vindicated.

Now, I put forward that humans have a unique and effective mechanism for
dealing with vanishing resources which not only tends to solve the problem
at hand, but add to total wealth in the process.

When a resource becomes scarce, its price increases.  As a result of this,
fewer people buy the good, noting that it is not worth its price.  As the
price rises, we observe that the resource is conserved, by virtue of the
fact that fewer people consider the good worth its price, so fewer people
are prepared to  use it, waste it, etc.

Also, when the price of a good rises, it provides a window for new
technology to provide alternatives.  Suppose some future energy resource,
say black holes, cost $5 per unit of energy extracted.  Now let us also
suppose that a new technology, dilithium crystals, could be invented, but
that it might cost as much as $7 per unit of energy due to the cost of
inventing new tools to mine it, locate it, refine it, etc.  Clearly, no one
will buy dilithium crystals at this price.  But suppose black holes
suddenly become extremely scarce, and the price of energy from black holes
doubles to $10.  First, fewer people will buy black holes, and second, the
demand for an alternative is great.  Now it is worthwhile to invest in
dilithium crystals, invent the tools necessary to process them, and bring
them to the world.  Scarcity makes money available to solve the energy
crisis.  Furthermore, once the majority of buyers switch to dilithium
crystals, you'd have even more people working on the crystals, finding
better ways to refine them, etc. so as to make their own profit.

Best of all, in the meantime we will reap the benefits of increased wealth
per capita, allowing more people to buy an education and more people to
become scientists if they so wish.  We do not see a movement towards
increasing poverty, but rather a trend towards an increasingly wealthy
society.

Note that we have to assume that people must work in order to get more
money, if this process is to succeed.  Otherwise, people will not bother to
seek cheaper alternatives.  Similarly, I would call the invention of a new
resource and the seeking out of better refinement mechanisms "work;" and to
this extent I put forward that this sort of work will always be necessary.

When Julian Simon was writing, he argued that resources were actually
infinite, and that those who were arguing for finite "scarce" resources
were wrong.  This may not be true, as written.  However, it IS true that
the amount of resources which are available to us are determined primarily
by the technology which we develop, not by the remaining quantity of any
particular resource.

You may argue that there is an absolute limit to the resources which
technology can bring us; that eventually technologies which increase
available energies will run up against some physical barrier; that all the
technologies which would increase energy efficiency will eventually reach
some maximum limit determined by physical law.  This may be true, but to
say this implies a great deal of knowledge about the universe and physical
laws which science does not claim to have.  There are some limits which we
are pretty certain about.  I don't anticipate any perpetual motion machines
in humanity's future.  However, technology is pretty sneaky, and engineers
are a crafty bunch.  So while we may not be able to get around this
particular limit, there are other mechanisms, other means of extracting
energy, which may do the trick for us.

I do not know if there is an ultimate limit to what technology can do for
us.  I suspect that there might be; but then, much of the evidence for
ultimate limits which we have seen in the past have eventually been
overcome.  So perhaps there is not.  If that time ever comes, then I will
be willing to hear arguments for decreases in population growth, energy
conservation, etc.  However, until that time, I stand ignorant as to the
truth of this point.

So:

6)  Observed.  Resources will not run out if we do not run out of useful
technology.
7)  Observed.  As wealth per capita increases, spending per capita
increases, including on education.
8)  Therefore.  More wealth per capita will result in more educated people.
9)  Axiom.  If more people were educated, we would have more people able to
create useful technology.
10)  Therefore.  More educated people results in more useful technology.
11)  Therefore.  If technology does not run out, population growth will
result in greater wealth per capita.
12)  Therefore.  If technology does not run out, population growth results
in the greater happiness for a greater number.
13)  Therefore.  If technology does not run out, population growth is an
important moral good.

Under this understanding, yes.  However, I was answering a different point
when I composed this.  First, I was asked how the poor would keep their
jobs in the face of automation.  I answered that so long as the robots were
sentient, more jobs would be needed, so we could expect that humans would
keep their jobs.

Now, I must agree that increased non-sentient automation would lead to
decreased prices and increased abundance, as you say.  However, during the
transition period, wages and prices might not be as flexible as we might
like.  If wages fell faster than the price level, or if wages couldn't fall
with the price level (due to unions, minimum wage laws, etc.) then what
we'd find is people starving in an age of plenty.  Having sentient robots
would ease this transition a lot, because they would create jobs in the
process, rather than just filling them.

And finally, in the spirit of the post above, who is to say that the
happiness of a sentient robot is not as great a moral goal as improving our
own happiness?  Presuming these robots would continue the human trend of
producing more than they consumed, (a trend from which I see no reason a
sentient robot would break,) adding sentient robots to our population would
have the same effect, if not an amplified effect, as increasing our
population would.

Unless the sentient robots are themselves considered part of our utility
calculations, in which case the utility which would be gained from having
sentient robots would be much greater than that which would be gained from
simple automation.

Well, it goes like this: as Lorrey will tell you, "There Ain't No Such
Thing As A Free Lunch."  Even if we do decrease the price level to
something absurdly low, we should still expect to make micropayments in
order to receive our daily bread.  Alternately, engines like advertising
could take over, but advertising applies only to people who COULD buy other
goods; if you're not working, then you have no income, and so advertising
to you would be pointless.

So I put forward that work must happen in order to keep things running.
Maybe very LITTLE work needs to happen (maybe people could be paid a living
salary for a tiny service, like some of the work http://www.distributed.net
is doing), but work must happen, because it takes a little work in order to
feed you; even if it's just a very little amount of work.

If wages and prices were fully flexible, then I'd probably just agree with
you, argue that increased automation will decrease the compensation for
labor but at the same time make that compensation exponentially more
valuable, resulting in lots of people living on low wages and getting rich
in the process.  I have made that argument here before.

However, I'd be a fool to claim that wages and prices are fully flexible.
The market has some sticky prices, and wages are some of the stickiest
prices of all.  And even if it IS primarily because of government screw
ups, it seems a little heartless for me to just presume that simply because
it's the government's fault, we shouldn't do anything to make it better.

Sentient robots would provide us with plenty of labor, while at the same
time creating jobs, which would ease the transition a lot.  They would also
have their own utility, which IMO is a moral good.

>>And as I've been trying to tell you, more consumers DO make us better off,
>>by creating more jobs for us to fill.
>
>How does "creating more jobs for us to fill" make us better off?  Please
>explain this connection, because I sure don't see it!

Wages and prices are not fully flexible, so people may suffer greatly while
wages and prices readjust to the new price schema.  Creating more jobs to
fill would ease this readjustment.

How is this different from an AI that "pretends" to want things?  ;)

Whoever is feeding the artist has to worry about the bottom line.  So I'd
propose a different solution:  if prices are so low that people can live
off of twenty minutes of labor a day, then the artists will be able to just
do that, and then spend the rest of their time creating art.

Again, so long as some work is necessary to feed a person, work will never
go away; we should struggle to make this work as inconsequential as
possible, but it will never be zero.

What will they invest without wealth?  Where will they get the wealth if

So long as it requires work to feed you, you will have to do work in
exchange.  Maybe just a little, but some.

Why wouldn't it be?

But I have another question.  Can anyone direct me to an expose' which
addresses the criteria by which it will be determined who gets
transhumanized and in what order? Will the ignorant and bigoted be last in
line or will the poor be last in line? Or will this turn into another class
struggle transhumans vs. humans. Sorry, I'm new to this and am probably
asking old and lame questions but there may be others like me cyber-lurking

OK, so I was wrong.  :)

In my last post on this topic, I said:  "so long as some work is necessary
to feed a person, work will never go away; we should struggle to make this
work as inconsequential as possible, but it will never be zero."  Sorry,
Tony Belding.

I've come to the conclusion that this is wrong.  We CAN all get fed without
doing work, and automation is the way to do it.  Here's how.

In contrast to Marx's "labor theory of value," I think modern economics is
a kind of a "capital theory of value," which presumes that all wealth in
some way, shape, or form, stems from capital.  In this sense, we understand
the work done by a laborer as comparable to the wealth created by a
capitalist.  The only difference is this:  where the capitalist uses
material capital to create wealth, the laborer creates wealth using their
"human capital."  Wages can be thought of as the price of human capital.

Why is this relevant?  Because this means that it is wrong headed to say
that "work" must always be done.  Wealth must be exchanged for wealth, but
wealth comes from CAPITAL, not work.  And human-owned capital may one day
be just as effective at creating wealth as human capital is today.

So, for example, suppose a new form of robot arm were able to do your job
for you, faster and more cheaply than you could.  That's capital creating
wealth.  Now suppose that robot arm were cybernetically grafted onto your
body.  (This is the example which led me to this change of mind.)
Suddenly, any work that this arm would do would be YOUR work; it would be
*you* doing the job and your human capital creating the wealth.
Alternately, imagine being a worker in a factory around the turn of the
20th century, and then somehow removing your hands and arms from your body
and leaving them there, while you went off to play games.  [Soccer,
presumably. ;)]  You would need to do no work at all: your arms and hands
would create all the wealth you needed to survive.

- From this perspective, it is clearly possible for someone to own capital
that creates so much wealth that they don't have to use any of their human
capital at all.  Indeed, this has been the historical argument AGAINST
capitalists: they don't make as much use of their human capital, which
Marxists considered the only source of value.

Automation represents an increase in the return on material capital
relative to the return on human capital, thus lowering the demand for human
capital.  However, as noted, so long as wages and prices are fully
flexible, these lower wages will be able to buy more goods, thus helping to
make certain that workers won't starve as a result of this decreased demand
for labor.

In the long run, however, the solution to this problem is cheap privately
owned capital, with as high a rate of return as possible.  The perfect
extreme example of this would the "anything box:" the anything box can
create anything, including another anything box, for free.  This is
obviously unrealistic, but since there are some people who don't have to go
to work in order to get fed, it is clear that capital of this scale could
eventually be affordable to everyone.  And as prices drop and innovation
continues, we should see technology moving closer and closer to our ideal.

HOWEVER, I still maintain that having lots of sentient robots around would
be good for us too.  We don't have to make an either-or decision here.  We
can use BOTH, reaping the benefits of automation AND the benefits of a
larger population all in one fell swoop.  The sentient robots can use the
non-sentient robots just as well as we can, if not better.  So not only
will we have the added benefit of increased productivity from automation,
we'll ALSO have the benefit of an increased population; the only difference
being that one portion of the population happens to be sentient robots.

Sorry if this didn't make much sense, I wrote this in a fit of "eureka" (or
perhaps "d'oh!") at around 1 AM.  :)

Again, studies of cetaceans have show that their sonar 'vision' is as acute as
our optical vision.  Not only that, because of the nature of sound, they can
'see' through many of the objects they bounce sounds off.  This give them a
unique kind of 3-d hologaphic perception of the world around them.

This question seems to assume that we've collectively ordained some kind of
organized centralized process around *who* gets 'transhumanized'. There are so
many advancements on so many fronts around the world towards realizing
transhumanist goals, that such a centralized process as you suggest would be
impossible.

The first ones to get 'transhumanized' will most likely be those who have the
imagination, will, talent, skill, motivation, desire, passion, luck, wealth or
combination of all of them to seize transhumanist opportunities when they
present themselves.

That's not the worst of it.

It rained so much as to cover the mountain (and don't forget that the 
fountains of the earth opened up to help out).  That would be 
Everest, which according to my almanac (I found the damn thing 
again) is 29,028 feet above sea level.

It did this in only 40 days and 40 nights = 960 hours.  The water 
level rose at an average of 363 inches per hour.  Even if only 10% of 
that is rain (the rest being from the fountains of the earth), that's 
a yard of rain an hour.  A heavy Midwestern rainstorm delivers maybe 
four inches an hour.

With a yard of rain an hour, Noah didn't need an ark.

He needed a submarine.

That's a "transaction cost".  If the value to you does not exceed

Hm... oddly enough, government force had to be used to compel the 
owners of electric companies *not* to provide competing service.

In some jurisdictions, the laws to authorize this force were never 
enacted and, therefore, competition continued and continues.  Those 
jurisdictions typically have better electric service at lower rates, 
as compared to adjacent areas with regulated-monopoly providers.  
This is true even when all of the competing providers are also 
regulated-monopoly providers in adjacent areas.

Actually, there are two things more important than our theory that it 
doesn't fit:

   * the definition of "monopoly"
 
   * the definition of "coercive".

We don't have to imagine this, as an operating system exists which is 
(a) substantially compatible with MS Windows, (b) substantially 
superior to MS Windows, and (c) substantially less expensive than MS 
Windows.

It is distributed worldwide via a wide variety of channels, 
including in the US where it can be picked up even in bookstores (new 
*and* used).  

I hear that the Red Hat release 5.0 is even easier to install than 
Windows95.

Microsoft has initiated no court action.

> Microsoft *obviously* have a monopoly.

Monopoly: the circumstance of being ahead of most of the competition, 
and running as fast as you can in hopes of staying there.

Have you told the US Federal Trade Commission about this new 
definition?  It'd be a nice addition to their collection (which 
already includes "the condition of being the tenth-largest company in 
a market" and "the condition of not being in a market at all").

Incorrect, as proven by the fact that such an operating system exists 
and is widely available in the US via multiple distributors.

I think IBM had a much larger hand in that.

But then, IBM is officially not a monopoly.  Even the government 
admits it, after spending more than a decade and many millions of 
taxpayer dollars trying to prove that it it is.  And the government 
never had any successful action against IBM, so cannot claim any 
credit whatsoever for the fact that it is not a monopoly.

Gripes about Verdop's occasional errors in English should come 
only from people whose native tongue is English but whose German is 
better than Verdop's English.

Which means Verdop won't be hearing from *me* for a *long* time -- at 
least, not on that subject.

(Providing assistance in achieving clarity, is not griping.)

Cetacea are completely non-technological, and aquatic.

Assume for the sake of argument that, except as compelled by those 
two facts, they are psychologically human.  (A pretty unlikely 
assumption, by the way).  What *would* they talk about?

Work?  They are, variously, hunters and gatherers.  Being completely 
non-technological, there aren't a lot of techniques available to them 
and they've been doing this for hundreds of thousands of years.  It's 
a good bet that all good techniques are common knowledge.

Girls?  Remember their speech mechanism.  A guy talking about his 
girlfriend, even if he mumbles, can be heard clearly for several 
hundred miles.

Possibly the current location of food.  But that won't produce a lot 
of vocalizing.

The single good bet I can come up with, is that they chat 
about their kids.

Human observers, watching a bunch of mothers chat about their kids, 
often can't later figure out what was said even when they understand 
the language!

To rule out that cetacean's do not have complex language would be a grossly
premature assumption at this point.

Being completely non-technological and aquatic does not preclude language. There
are several reasons to think that dolphins may have developed complex language.

1) They have brain sizes from 2 to 6 times ours.

2) Careful examination of cetacean brain tissue has show it to be as complex as
ours at every level - from the number of average synaptic connections to the array
of neurotransmitter activity.

3) They have had 30 millions years longer than us to develop and evolve a
language.

What would they 'talk' about?  Here is my guess:

Since they can't write anything down, they like many other pre-literate cultures
could have an extensive oral tradition of storytelling and history recounting.
Knowing how extensive some tribal cultures oral tradition is with less than 10,000
years history, imagine how much more complex cetacean's oral history could be, if
they developed complex language even 1 million years ago; less than 1/30 of their
history.

None of these reasons hold water (pun not intended); brain size
doesn't correlate well with intelligence (ratio brain size / skin area
seems to work better, but it is still crude) and certainly not with
speech abilities (elephants vs some birds). That their brains are
complex and similar to ours isn't surprising, we are related after
all, but so are mice too - different parts of the brain have
developed. Finally, 3 is rather silly, since we have also had tens of
millions of years to develop languages (but we didn't).

Still, I think we all can agree that the signals whales send are
complex, have "cultural" properties and appear to affect the behavior
of other whales in the pod, so calling it a language isn't far
off. The main question is how much intelligence and culture is involved.

In that case we would notice repeating patterns which remained as the
whale songs changed over time (classic idioms, references to the whale
equivalent of the sacking of Troy etc). Have any such patterns been
discovered?

While the idea of oceanic Homers is appealing, I'm not sure if it is
true. Especially since in order to sing epics you better have a
language able to deal with everyday experiences too (currents, social
relations, food, dangers etc), and experiences worth retelling. So
another prediction would be quick communications between individuals
("Honey, have you seen that school of fish? I'm sure I left it here
somewhere...") and long "epic" communications ("May the muses lend me
their fins..."); this should be possible to check on a cetacean
website.

Inasmuch would this differ from you internal scene representation? You 
have textures, depthcueing and stereo to construct a 3d description.

The interesting part of sonar vision is that you can tell materials
with different sound propagation velocities apart, e.g. a plastic and
a steel ball. Also, you could theoretically share a mental image,
though there is no evidence that the cetaceans really do that.

I was speaking of very short range sonar.

Subjectively this input of complex sound information could be interpreted similar to
the way we intrepet visual light.

I fairly certain there is.  I can't remember where I heard it, but there was a study
done with dolphins in complete darkeness who were able to discern the identity of
several sets of different tpyes of objects.  All I really remeber was that the
conclusions of the study pointed very strongly in the direction that their sonar can
paint a very vivid 'picture' of their immediate surroundings.

It may not correlate well, but can you possible say it does not correlate at all? Ants
are less intelligent than rats which are corresponding less intelligence than dogs which
are less intelligent than gorillas.  There is definitely *some* correlation.  Speech
modality is distinct from language.  Elephants don't have the laryngeal design to
variate sound waves, birds do.  Besides,  dolphins do produce immense variation in
sound.

If brain size didn't matter at all, then lusting after jupiter brains would be
meaningless.

The key difference is in that 30 million years our brain size went from a small monkeys
to what it is now.  During the same time period, cetaceans had already achieved brain
sizes larger than ours at present.

As far as I know the cross-section of data is pretty small - insufficient to determine
anything yet.

I'm not sure if it true either.  My point is *if* they have a complex language that is
descriptive beyond the means of survival, then it could resemble something akin to an
oral tradition.

I think practical transhumanism is very worthwhile; while theoretical
studies help to guide us and get the long view, in the end we better
get transhuman ourselves too.

I think den Otter had a good idea about setting up some kind of server
or index over enhancing technologies (including things like mental
techniques and psychological tools), this would be very useful but
tricky to implement. We would really benefit from having an overview
of the areas we are interested in, which of course would help us see
what areas need to be developed and who could help.

Overall, the spread of simple, practical methods for enhanced living
are one of the best ways of promoting extropianism. A kind of
grass-roots transhumanism, so to say.

That is true here on Earth. What about beings evolved in the atmosphere of a
gas giant? Or on a planet circling a brown dwarf? There might not be enough
ambient radiation to make vision possible.

I would expect that non-visually oriented intelligences would never develop
astronomy, and so probably would never develop space travel, or get out to
meet other races - but what if WE go to meet them? Would we ever be able to
communicate? Would we be able to even see them as intelligent?

Is there any such agenda? I was of the opinion that those who are ready will
become transhuman, regardless of other factors. I expect a goodly number of
creeps along with potential gods..

One bright light in the transhuman discussions here is that I notice a fair
lack of the aforementioned creeps on this list. Perhaps we will be fortunate
in that such people tend to ignore subjects like this, and might die out
during a transition..or at least be greatly culled..Once transhumanism
becomes a daily news subject, we will see where the creeps stand..

The question isn't exactly lame, although it might be posed in the
wrong way. Who determines today who gets to access the Internet? There
is no central control of this in most countries (Cuba the only
exception I know of). Some people have complained that the poor have
no access, but even that is rapidly changing since access is getting
cheaper and cheaper, both in the west and in the third world (I saw a
plot of Internet growth rates in Africa, truly impressive - they still
have a long way to go, but are catching up admirably). Educated people
were first onto the net, but now less educated people are also catchin
up. As are the elderly, and so on.

Compare this to the spread of transhuman technologies. It is unlikely
that there will ever be a Departement of Transhuman Development in any
nation, since the developments are likely to be fast, widespread and
divergent. At the start, the only people who will benefit from the
technologies will be test subjects and true neophiles. Then the rich,
ambitious and well educated will start to use them. Gradually, as the
technology gets more refined and cheaper it will spread, and in the
long run it will be used by virtually everybody. This is just like the
spread of telephones; once they were just experimental, then they were
for the rich, later they gradually diffused out into society and
became part of everyday life (there are some amusing stories about how
some people wanted to limit their spread since they feared the poor
would call the rich!). 

The question is of course if the fast growth of transhumanizing
technologies would create an ever widening gulf between the adapters
and the non-adapters. Furtunately it seems that the diffusion of
technology is also speeding up - it took the telephone several decades
to become ubiquitious, while the cellular phone has become quite
common in just a few years. (see
http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Masevr/6001170a.gif for a picture) Most
likely there will not be any real gulf between the haves or have nots
unless other factors create it.

Subject:      Physicists seek defintion of "science"
To: STCS-L@YORKU.CA

Macilwain, C. (1998). Physicists seek definition of "science". Nature,
392 (30 April, 1998): 849.

[WASHINGTON] The governing council of the American Physical Society
(APS) has rejected the first draft of a statement defining science
for the public, which the society's public affairs panel has been
preparing for three years. According to an official familiar with the
discussion, some members were concerned by a proposed reference to
"other approaches" to understanding nature.
        Others are said to have been worried about public misunderstanding
of the statement's references to "falsifiability". The authors of the
draft 200-word statement have been asked to confer with scientific
societies and other interested parties before coming back with a new
version later this year.
        The case for such a statement has been recently confirmed by opinion
polls showing that public belief in forms of pseudoscience - such as
faith healing and astrology - is growing in the United States. But
the rejection of the draft, although not unusual for such a policy
statement, illustrates the difficulties that scientists face in
trying to draw a recognizable line between their own work and
pseudoscience.
        The statement, entitled "What is Science?", defines science as "a
disciplined quest to understand nature in all its aspects" and
explains that it demands both "open and complete exchange of ideas
and data" and "an attitude of scepticism about its own tenets".
        It stresses that scientific results must be capable of reproduction,
modification or falsification by independent observers. And it closes
by noting that "scientists value other, complementary approaches to
and methods of understanding nature", but that "if the alternatives
are to be called scientific, they must adhere to the principles
outlined above".
        Following the drafts rejection by the council at a meeting last week
in Columbia, Ohio, the APS may now draw up two statements - one for
wide public dissemination and the other a more rigorous explanatory
statement for scientists themselves.
        The society decided to produce the statement in response to the
concerns of key members that 'pseudoscience' is not only winning
increased public attention but may even be causing confusion among
science students. APS members have been active in criticizing this
trend not just in cases related to physics - such as the alleged
discovery of 'cold fusion' - but also in other fields, such as
alternative medicine.

Fellow Extropians:

I am delighted to announce that Extropy Online has a new Editor: Alexander
"Sasha" Chislenko. After editing Extropy for the last eight years, I have
decided to step down. Sasha was my first choice to take over due to his
intellectual accomplishments, his long and deep familiarity with the topics
Extropy covers, and his wonderful personal qualities.

While I shall remain as Editor-in-Chief, overseeing the general direction
of Extropy Online, it is to Sasha <sasha1@netcom.com> that you should now
direct your ideas for articles and reviews.

Onward to a new era for Extropy!

Max

I read a study where dolphins were in a tank with a sonar-transparent
partition.  Pushing on a lever in one half would release fish into
both halves.

A dolphin was trained in the half with the lever to understand how
it worked.  He could see fish being released into both halves.  Then he
was put into the other half and a new dolphin brought into the first half.

If they could communicate abstract concepts, the first dolphin could tell
the second dolphin to push the lever, and then they'd both get fish.

However, the second dolphin didn't learn to push the lever any faster than
the first dolphin did.  So apparently no such communication occured.

I believe other studies were done along these lines, and there has never
been any evidence of abstract communication among cetaceans.

     IAN: Here the "A" is applied to the
     attribute of statements, which is the 
     attribute "true," and is not applied 
     here to statements per se. That attri-
     bute is defined by its not, which is 
     "false," just as statements are de-
     fined by their not, not-statements.

>
>  In short: A, if and only if not-A.


   IAN: This means that in U (universal set),
   A exists if and only if not-A exists. Now, 
   one might posit a contradiction by saying 
   "Well, if not not-A (if not-A is absent) 
   then A, since not not-A = A." Yes, that 
   is logical, however, "not" properly de-
   notes the "complement of" and not the 
   "absence of." The absence of is properly
   denoted by "zero" or "null." So to express
   the absence of not-A we'd say, "If not-A
   is null, then A is null."

   People often counter: if A is only if not-A,
   then what about the whole unvierse, where's
   the not-universe? There is no not-universe,
   that this is why the whole universe = 0, 
   expressed by the conservation of identity,
   which follows directly from the conservation 
   of difference, since identity is difference:

                    1  2  3  ...
                   _________
                1 | 0  1  2 |
                  |         |
                2 |-1  0  1 |
                  |         |
                3 |-2 -1  0 |
                  -----------

    Just as the difference between 3 and 3 is 
    0, the difference between All and All is 
    0, expressed in the zero sum of the whole
    differential matrix. All things, every unit
    of measure, be it one, an inch, a minute, 
    a Newton, a Pascal, an ohm, and so forth 
    are the products of differential relation,
    and as such no unit can exceed the simple
    analysis presented in the identity matrix.
    The only identity attributes are derived 
    from the relations of different subsets.

    Everything is a subset of identity, and 
    since identity is derived from difference,
    and since difference is conserved, All = 0,
    which follows directly from the fact that
    there is no not-Universe, thus U = null.

Ah the one factor not mentioned yet is that, oh my god mountains

Has anyone ever taken the time to notice that all pictures of Jesus 
Christ may be wrong?  I ask because I belive that he may have 
actually been black!  I mean he did come from that area and it is 
proven that it was a warmer climate at the time.

I don't understand the significance of the distinction between sentient and 
non sentient robots made in this thread. We have non sentient robots now,  
(probably, I can't prove it) but they're also without any doubt dumb as dirt 
and that's exactly why they haven't changed the world yet. The subjective
experience of the machine is of interest to it, but from our point of view 
the only important distinction is that between a smart robot and a stupid one.

I also think that the question of whether humans should give rights to 
machines is moot, the question of whether machines will give rights to humans 
is not.

Long range, how much resolution do you need?

That's the big problem with theories about the ability of whales to 
image the entire ocean: just how much benefit would it provide them?  
All they need in terms of long-range sensing is to "see" enough 
landmarks to locate themselves, and those landmarks *could* be on the 
ocean floor.

And who said speech had to involve only sound?

Perhaps my point was unclear.  I am not denying them the ability of 
speech.  Rather, I am suggesting that, if they do not share some 
common referents with us, it would be extremely difficult to decipher 
their hypothesized speech; and the common referents are far from 
obvious.

Any technological species we find anywhere in the universe, we can 
easily find some common referents with, probably rather substantial 
ones.  The classic example being the periodic table of the elements.  
Another culture might rotate it or reflect it, but its basic 
structure and the meaning of its contents is entirely dictated by 
nature and will be the same (aside from errors, incompleteness, and 
local variations in the relative frequency of isotopes) throughout 
this universe.

With cetacea, it is not so easy.

More completely, wealth comes from the intelligent application of 
capital to other capital to fulfil a desire.

(If your desire is to have a drainage ditch, human capital in the 
form of labor capacity should be applied to material capital in the 
form of earth-moving equipment, and the combination applied to 
material capital in the form of carefully chosen real estate.)

However, neither the amount nor the form of the capital dictates the 
amount of wealth produced.  That is determined by the desire: how 
many people have it and how much wealth they are able and willing to 
dedicate to fulfilling it.

If the amount of wealth produced exceeds the amount of capital 
consumed, then there is a profit.

Good point.  This distinction is much clearer.  Doesn't really affect any
of the relevant points, but it IS much clearer.

By this you seem to be implying that very smart robots WOULDN'T grant us
rights, and so, in order to protect our rights, we shouldn't try to build
them too smart.

It's true, smart robots might decide to rob us of our rights.  I'd like to
think that they wouldn't, but that's really just a guess.  However, since
we can only guess at this sort of thing, the underlying premise behind an
argument like this is that we shouldn't try to create new entities smarter
than ourselves, including trans/posthuman children, if there's a chance
that doing so will jeopardize our liberties.

If germline engineering turns out to be a good way to build a better
human, and that happens to mean that our children will be superior to us
in every way, does that mean we shouldn't have smarter children?  After
all, it would be a moot question to ask whether we should grant THEM
rights...  the question would be whether they would grant rights to us.

i agree with scott.  if et communicates via odor or other medium,
i have to imagine some odor emitting alien scientist would
develop an instrument that works like our eyes.  human
scientists are developing instruments that detect the
"language" of ants by meauring their pheromone emissions.  

extropians might expect that alien signals would be

Of course we must be careful in how we are defining 'smart' here.  Is it smart to
limit the rights of other sentient beings if your goal is to increase your overall
understanding of the world and enrich your own complexity, or is smart defined as
pure survival and domination at any cost? The Chinese government (PRC) has
successfully repressed its citizens in order to survive and remain in power. Is the
PRC smarter than western democracies which have some inherent liberties for its
citizens?

Many would argue that survival and emotional-territorial drives are the low-end of
intelligence - after all every species has the survival urge, and most multicelled
species have the territorial.

I think it is very likely that any improvement we can give to our children through
germline engineering, will be surpassed by even more advanced transhumanist
technologies made available to existing individuals.

Depictions of Christ vary from culture to culture. Here, the standard is a
WASP male with a sad expression. In Hispanic areas, he is darker and more
Hispanic looking. In Black countries, he is more than lokely Negroid in
appearance. I have yet to see an Asian Christ, but I am still realtively young..

Yes, of course my friend !!! He was a Jew and certainly had black hair and
big nose ( just a joke...) 
But, being the catholic church's  headquarter in Europe, they obviously
pictured Jesus with european beauty patterns: Blond, blue eyes and even
tall... So, much more europeans would love him better... And believe more in
heaven... ( inteligent, no ? : in land of blinds, who has an eye will be
king... - if you change 'eye' by 'neuron', it will work too...)

PS: In opposition, here in Brazil, where blacks are an important
quantitative component of the people, there is an image of Jesus' mother
which is really black and intentionally let this way >> Maria Aparecida. And
black folks love it... Church uses it to make them feel "sons of god too" >>
got the smartness ? ( In Japan there is also a Japanese analogous )...

Hugs,

Gomes.

Anyway, ALL depictions of holy men (other than some of those born since
photography was developed) are artist's conceptions...only the most slow of
believers would consider them to be literally what that personage actually
looked like..

Jesus was a literal being who probably UNDERSTOOD the whole 'god'
concept.  As far as religion goes he is a SYMBOL.  He was not the
'only son of God' nor was he born by immaculate conception.

When folk turn symbology into literal historicity is when religion
goes bad.  You want to believe he was bald?  Fine.  You want to
believe he had blond hair?  Fine.  He's a S-Y-M-B-O-L!

Religion will unfortunately be a part of human future, but at least
extropians should know the difference between historicity and
symbology.

Sorry, but >>> What is not REAL KNOWLEGDE IS NOT ACCEPTED by SCIENCE !!!!


1) Real knowlegde only has some sense if it IS about a truth. Knowlegde
shoud not be confused with quantity of (not necessarily validated)
informations, or divagations... or even conclusions based on a set of false
concepts... For me, it is not real knowlegde... 
For me, the existence of such doubts nowadays is also one of BAD
consequences of RELIGIOUS FAITH over minds...

2) It is being forgotten that Science always tries to prove what concludes... 

3) And about models, they must be VALIDATED in its dominium, to be
scientifically accepted...

    In the 'forteana' conference today, I found this contribution, which 
makes me kinda sad.  We fought the Cold War for this?  The essay follows 
on from an idyllic description of his home, about fifty miles outside New 
York, where the rich drink Dom Perignon and the dogs have $10 000 
jewelled collars..

I guess I could write the same story on life hereabouts.  Idylls and 
infernos in uncomfortably close proximity.

      God help us all....

This, and the retrieval of cigarette butts to gather roll and smoke is
depressing but NOT new or "news", I say with some hesitation for fear of
sounding like some cynical hardass.

   We can all clinically view the statistics with regards to the steady
shift of society's wealth to the already wealthy, while coolly ignoring the
encroaching results of the same on the working poor right outside our door
(or under our own roofs, truly), the low income elderly tenant whose rental
unit gets sold out from  them in an exploding urban real estate market, the
immigrant laborer sharing the one-room apartment with 14 other adults while
working multiple jobs to share the fruits of this better new world with
their families in explosive nations to the south and overseas,  the obscene
"War on Drugs" which makes it so that students and poor artists, the folks
who really need it,  cannot even afford simple cannibis anymore.

   I have had friends who worked in food service here in San Francisco at
the fanciest hotels and restaurants where the cast-off food is dumped into
secure dumpsters where the nearby starving are kept at bay. Of course there
are the occasional well-publicized redistribution efforts usually given a
great deal of lip service around the Xmas holiday season when people are
more easily moved(read:"manipulated") by guilt. At the other end of the
scale, some "hippier" restaurants and bakeries have set up their own free
boxes or redistribution efforts.

   Even as the disparity becomes more obscene and  shows no sign of
reversing (interms of the size and irrepairability of the gap between the
rich and poor) I still believe (while knowing full well the deep danger of
"belief") that the problem is one of distribution of goods and energy, that
there are enough resources and possible options available to solve a lot of
the gross iniquities that plague our clumsy dominion over this planet and
our neighboring species. But I am certainly not prepared or equipped to
make those grand changes, but the potential keeps me from giving up hope
while struggling amidst the squalor and disregard.

      I am not naiive enough to suggest that this trite plague is only an
urban American problem; that aspect of the issue is just more obvious to
me (as is Nem's reflections on the lush divinity of the endangered
rainforest) and I am also blessed to have nearby  my home in this congested
overpriced and depressed metropolis a protected piece of rare open space, a
grassy rocky hill to which  I am pleasantly obligated to take my canine
companion at least twice a day, where she is allowed to run leash-free with
others of her species and socialize in ways that a lot of country dogs and
suburban dogs with big old yards to defend never get the opportunity to. 

   If rather than taking that short walk to the hilltop I was to turn right
and walk out my door, the street one block down has the late 20th century
version of Bunuel's "Land Without Bread" being reenacted by the occupants
of the Asylum of St. Francis , and the web of freeway overpasses that  one
can see to the east of my little doggy hilltop provides a concrete roof for
a small shifting tribe of broken(mostly) men, walking the streets by night
and sleeping(dead?) wrapped in plastic and filthy blankets by day to lessen
the danger of assault by other homeless. Oh look, there's an emaciated
prostitute somebody beat the skull in of...third one this week... above us
the ribbon of steel and cement carries individuals on cellular phones, each
in their own Lexxus or BMW or sports utility vehicle putzing slowly but
safely in a cloud of skyborne (but lead-free!) toxins into the city of
banks restaurants and nightclubs.

   To see someone broken, hopeless, with all their possessions in a cart is
an allegedly noteworthy observation? I don't think so. It might have been
novel when I was  kid in the deficit free early 60's in the USA but I think
that was an exceptional time,  from what I've seen of the struggles of my
progenitors and those of much older countries/societies than my own.    

      I saw this beautifully interesting little old man on the street the
other day, in these mismatched pants/coat with this crazy furry
burgermeister hat w/feather on it and thought to myself: " I want to have
that much eccentric character and style when I'm his age." I then watched
as he dug around in the trash for aluminum cans, I suppose, then poked his
finger into the coin slot on the payphone hoping for some change. Something
to look forward to I suppose.

  Underneath the cold grey shadows of the modern crossroads, tenaciously
refusing to stop living, sitting on their filthy behinds holding their
poisoned heads in their broken hands...what bargain will they strike in
their daily prayer thinking it their last chance? And with which god?

              cheerfully, Joe

Possibly such story came from an ancient people who lived in a small island
having a great depression at its center :)))  this was ALL THE WORLD !!!!
After that, they simply went to a continental land, maybe near India ( now
seriously: Do you know the hindu story of MAHABHARATA ????)

  IAN: So there's no difference between false 
  and true statements? Statements transmit know-
  ledge. If what A knows is false and what B knows 
  is true, the knowledge of each is equally scientific. 
  Pseudoscience would simply be the absence of knowledge.
  I disagree.  I also am not convinced that knowledge =>
  constant increase. A person could have a fixed set of 
  things they know, and it does not spontaneously repl-
  icate into more knowledge. The set of all raccoons
  have probably maintained a pretty constant level
  of knowledge. I think true and a false are 
  attributes of knowledge, growth is not.

  Knowledge growth is an attribute of desire to
  learn and of the mental capacity to do so.


>For instance, creationism is not knowledge since it does
>not create any new knowledge... 


  IAN: So if a person does not gain new knowledge, 
  they have no knowledge? Knowledge is only know-
  ledge if it is expanding? I can't see this.

   IAN: I certainly agree with that more that the 
   complete divorce of science and truth. However, 
   to say that something is "life-like," we have
   know what life is, and likewise, to say that 
   something is "truth-like" we have to know
   what truth is. I can't say that X is 
   like Y, yet say that Y is unknown.

   Truth simply is the physical reality, true
   knowledge is  knowledge that has a one-one
   relation with the physical reality. To say 
   X is true is to say that X exists or that 
   it models existence accurately. Science 
   is about truth because it is about the
   physical universe and learning its 
   laws, principles, and structure.

I've heard this "handocentrism" before.  But imagine a world where there
were cetaceans with intelligence just like humans, yet retaining the
cetacean body.  Wouldn't there still be lots that one could improve sans
hands?  First off, they could trade ideas and things with other cetaceans.
They could could make simple shelters.  Look how well birds do without
hands.

Although I'm a positive atheist, and sometimes very radical, I do understand
religious, since, by birth and tradition, I have been one of them. The
emotional appeals associated to religions are very strong... They smartly
use figures associated with mother, father, brother, family, goodness,
charity, suffering etc etc ... I, in particular, followed this logical path:

1st: I verified some incoherecies on Jesus behaviour, enough for begining my
questioning on his idoneity as the "son of god"... and made myself FREE from
FAITH ( necessary, since not even a scientific mind is enough to break the
FAITH... In the beginning, I even thought that Pope, Church, Lutter,
Protestants etc simply MISUNDERSTOOD Jesus's message... who was right...
obviously I never believed that a god had created all this almost
yesterday... I was religious not idiot...). I will give you a small example,
of Jesus actuation: If you read his story with a deeper attention, you will
see that one of main subjects threated on it is the supposed Victory of him
over the Death. But It was simply really dieing and believing he would
ressurrect... for that disciples hide his body... The main problem is: He
calls the disciples to follow him and face the death in prol of FAITH and
GLORY of God... The Ignorant Plebes , for other side, "the support of
FAITH", "The rock on wich the Church would be constructed" ( the illuded
brains of such people so...)  would never be told this conclusions directly,
an would have to deduce it by themselves... "Lots are called by little are
chosen". One of the mission of the priests is to keep themselves firmly on
the conduction of the "shepheards" and do not cause "scandals" to the
families and innocents... But some monks and religious not: Just read the
lifes of the so-called saints: They simply wish strongly "To go together
with The Lord" and lots, lots of them simply starved until death... Lots of
martyres where so by their own choices and not obliged or killed like other
of them ... They WANTED to die because of their LOVE to Jesus... They wanted
TO SUFFER like him... You do not read... you do not really know...
Jesus and lots of their saints were "suicides of god" ... And: Church
publicly denies this and... forgimme, but protestants know nothing about
this, they are just an independent interpretation of the words of Jesus,
with a lot of good intentions and happiness and songs, but just 500 years
old, while whole chistianism comes since 2000 ys ago...

2nd: Supposing science will one day ressurrect people from the past...
Jesus, Budha, Mahomet etc will be ressurrected by science and all this lie
will simply finish...

3rd: My last doubt was about god's existence, since up to then, I had simply
convinced myself that Jesus was not god...: But, IMHO, I see that the
problem is in our linear logic, oriented to a subject-object interpretation
of the actions... If there is an universe, it was created, if it was created
there is a creator... A simple logic conclusion got when men still were
afraid of thunderbolts... Instead, if we think the universe as the whole set
of all, including its transformations, any phenomenum may be explained as
just a self-relashionship of the universe itself... And so there is no need
of using the famous (and false) pair creator-creation... even before the
last, but possibly not the only, big-bang...


Enough for while...


Gomes.

Did ya know that certain believers simply concluded that god is an state of
being... with all its presumptuos characteristics of creator, glorious,
infinite good, infinite this or that... And we are here to reach such
state... And walk proud and happy, with a great secret inside their
"hearts": I am a god ( a son, an image of ), and Jesus was the first who
understood this and "taugh it to me" ... I am a chosen of god creator, good
father, and one day will be "one" with him... 


Just to understand the difficulty there is inside some of their minds...

 Is there a private entity that would be willing to sell such insurance
and have a high probability of surviving the disruption well enough to
pay off?
 Can the conditions under which this insurance would be paid off be
specified well enough to distinguish from conditions where the insuree
is simply too lazy to try hard enough to get a job?
 (It isn't clear why people who want the government to provide the insurance
are confident that using the government allows them to ignore these questions.)

 I think half of the argument is over providing insurance to those who
appear to lack the foresight to realize that the risks are unusually high.

>Viroid Life

>Last Flesh

While I haven't seen either of those, I have just started to read/review
the UK edition (Oxford UP) of VISIONS: HOW SCIENCE WILL REVOLUTIONIZE THE
21ST CENTURY, by the superstring theorist and science populariser Dr Michio
Kaku.  I haven't read enough to get a proper sense of it, but it's a tad
cataloguish for my tastes, a bit plodding and list-ridden.  But that might
make it easy for journos to grab sound-bites from.  His basic schema
projects a consensus view (drawn, he repeatedly tells us proudly, from
interviews with 150 `leading scientists', including more than few
Nobelists) of life in the next 5 or 10 years, by 2020, and after 2050.  He
expected conscious AI only after the middle of the century, and is rather
dismissive of Drexlerian nanotech.  But he does keep emphasising
exponential change in a properly Spikish manner.

Anyone else reading Kaku?
