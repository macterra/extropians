i do on occasion randall.  i have written stuff that i could

about it much until all the hootenanny over the subpoenad
email from gates and the other miscreants that run software
companies.

i am told that all email should be treated as a postcard, and
i have for the most part, but i once calculated what would
be involved in monitoring or even sampling the email of worker bees
in a huge company like lockheed martin.  it would be a herculean
task, even for the sunnyvale commercial space division alone,
not to mention a mind-numbing waste of time.  i convinced
myself the resources would never be allocated.  spike

michael, i believe you are right.  i think i know who pulled this gag.
he is a rare example of a person who is a believer in a particular
religion (catholic) but still maintains a sense of humor.  we were
recently discussing the notion that at the moment of conception,
the newly formed embryo  receives a "soul".  i asked him whither
goeth that soul if the embryo gets frozen?  and whither cometh
that soul when the embryo is thawed and implanted?  and whither,
if that embryo is flushed down the drain, thereby thawed,
temporarily resuming its cell division, only to perish?

he thought and thought,  finally uttering the following statement,
verbatim:

"I do not like the idea of *freezing* embryos."

end of discussion.  true story.  {8^D   spike

It looks like you tacitly agreed with an abstract concept like
*conflict*, *protocol*, or whatever, as being the basis of politics and
not the individual per se. Btw, my own personal preference for a
hypothetical future is robo-socialism which is unlike your definition of
a common garden state sponsored socialism, so please don't pin your
prejudice on what robo-socialism under nanotechnology could be and as to
your analogy of whether its a network computer or a local intelligent PC
doesn't matter to me. The point of robo-socialism, as I define it, is a
two-way Survey Society which usurps and redefines the role of the state
so that the negative connotations of the surveillance state are
counteracted by the positive connotations of a Survey Society. It is not
a one person one vote system and isn't majority rule. It is one feature
- one ranking; - resulting in independent component analysis and
feedback. Such a large group of corresponding public AI systems
primarily impacts secrecy as in David Brin's transparency.

Yes, over a portion of the orbit, then it can act somewhat to restore the

Um, the angular momentum has to come from somewhere. If by "beam turnedoff" you
mean that all the exchange particles are back onboard the satellites,
their orbits can not raised or lowered.

Momentum wheels andReaction Control System (RCS), though there may be other

Atoms tend to disperse, it does not seem possible to generate an atomic

It does make a mess, there is also a problem with unequal mass distribution.
In"South Pole Accelerator", the collector and bolos are all wadded up and
shipped
to a handling facility together. I looked at various Rube Goldberg gizmos back
in 1981, none were very appealing

Little collector robots run up and down the arm? Melt the wires? Secondary arms

that fold up when full?

The problem with unguided projectiles lies in the demands placed on the
launchers
and receivers. These are large and few in number pieces of capital equipment.
The
risk of damage from incoming is probably enough to justify Smart Pellets.

Not necessarily. In most organizations separate employees have
a limited field of expertise. They are specialized in a certain aspect of
the whole, and have only a vague idea about how the end product
works (or indeed what it is). It's a fairly effective safety feature.

See above. But, in the end it's fairly trivial who of the select
group with full access to the project, the intelligence to
fully understand its potential, and the guts to use the technology
on themselves will take that final step and upload. To the rest of 
the world it simply spells "trouble". To avoid the rather unpleasant
situation of being at the mercy of a superintelligence there's
only one good solution: be the first, or at least among the first
in case this is a gradual process.

Nutrition Research 18(4): 735-742 1998
"Selenium Yeast is an Effective in Vitro and in Vivo Antioxidant and
Hypolipemic Agent in Normal Hamsters"

Abstract:

  Selenium as the selenite, selenomethionine, ebselen and yeast was
investigated in an in vitro low density lipoprotein oxidation model to
mimic the first step in atherogenesis. Ebselen and selenium yeast were
found to be the best antioxidents of the forms of selenium. Selenium yeast
was then given in two doses as a supplement to chow-fed hamsters for 15
days. The yeast significantly decreased total plasma cholesterol and the
atherogenic index but did not significantly diminish HDL and triglycerides.
Selenium yeast significantly decreased plasma lipid peroxides, low density
lipoprotein oxidation lag time, and maximum slope of oxidation. These
results indicate that selenium yeast is a powerful in vitro and in vivo
antioxidant as well as a hypolipemic agent. These two actions could explain
the benefit of selenium seen in epidemiology studies.

Additional note by poster:

  The selenium yeast used in the above experiment was Re-Natured Selenium
yeast from Grow Co., Hackensack, NJ.

Title
  Nuts and plasma lipids: an almond-based diet lowers LDL-C while preserving
  HDL-C.
Source
  Journal of the American College of Nutrition.  17(3):285-90, 1998 Jun.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To compare lipid-altering effects of an almond-based diet with an
  olive oil-based diet, against a cheese and butter-based control diet.
  METHODS: Forty-five free-living hyperlipidemic men (n = 12) and women (n =
  33) with a mean plasma total cholesterol (TC) of 251 +/- 30 mg/dL followed
  one of three diets; almond-based, olive oil-based, or dairy-based for 4
  weeks. Total fat in each diet was matched, and the study-provided sources of
  fat comprised the major portion of fat intake. RESULTS: Reductions in TC and
  low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) between the three groups were
  significantly different from the almond group (both p < 0.001). Within group
  analysis revealed that the almond-based diet induced significant reductions
  in TC (p < 0.05), LDL-C (p < 0.001), and the TC:HDL ratio (p < 0.001), while
  HDL-C levels were preserved. TC and HDL-C in the control diet were
  significantly increased from baseline (both p < 0.05), while the olive
  oil-based diet resulted in no significant changes over the study period.
  Weight did not change significantly. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that the
  more favorable lipid-altering effects induced by the almond group may be due
  to interactive or additive effects of the numerous bioactive constituents
  found in almonds.

"Long-Term Dietary Strawberry, Spinach, or Vitamin E Supplementation
Retards the Onset of Age-Related Neuronal Signal-Transduction and Cognitive
Behavioral Deficits"

Abstract:

  Recent research has indicated that increased vulnerability to oxidative
stress may be the major factor involved in CNS functional declines in aging
and age-related neurodegenerative diseases, and that antioxidants, e.g.,
vitamin E, may ameliorate or prevent these declines. Present studies
examined whether long-term feeding of Fischer 344 rats, beginning when the
rats were 6 months of age and continuing for 8 months, with diets
supplemented with a fruit or vegetable extract identified as being high in
antioxidant activity, could prevent the age-related induction of
receptor-meduated signal transduction deficits that might have a behavioral
component. Thus, the following parameters were examined: (1)
oxotremorine-enhanced striatal dopamine release (OX-K+-ERDA), (2)
cerebellar B receptor augmeentation of GABA responding, (3) striatal
synaptosomal 45Ca2+ clearance, (4) carbachol-stimulated GTPase activity,
and (5) Morris water maze peformance. The rats were given control diets or
those supplemented with strawberry extracts (SE), 9.5 gm/kg dried aqueous
extract (DAE), spinach (SPN 6.4 gm/kg DAE), or vitamin E (500 IU/kg).
Results indicated that SPN-fed rats demontrated the greatest retardation of
age-effects on all parameters except GTPase acitivity, on which SE had the
greatest effect, whereas SE and Vitamin Eshowed signifcant but equal
protection against these age-induced deficits on the other parameters. For
example, OX-K+-ERDA enhancement was four times greater in the SPN group
than in controls. Thus, phytochemicals present in antioxidant-rich foods
such as spinach may be beneficial in retarding functional age-related CNS
and cognitive behavioral deficits and, perhaps, may have some benefit in
neurodegenerative disease.

This was the theme of a screenplay I was working on with a young
Tejano writer a couple of years ago, who I've unfortunately lost
track of.

essential plot follows:

"The head of a a large corporation who's organic body is dying
develops the ability to upload. During the procedure his HQ is
attacked by a radical group that opposes his corporate policies.

The group being techno-savvy realizes that information is more
important than mere physical infrastructure, attacks with an
explosive pumped EMP device. So while they do considerable physical
damage they do massive informational damage.

Yep, they interupt the uploading (while destroying the original).
While his intelligence is successfully uploaded, the procedure is
interupted while subroutines establishing mimic functions of the
glandular functions are being created.

Result? A demented upload, who then decides the vast majority of
humanity are unnecessary and sets about creating a virus to destroy
those he doesn't like, while secretly trying to protect those he
does like.

Lots more interesting stuff...

Out of the total great filter factor of ~10^20+, I find it hard to believe
that this could explain even a factor of 10.  Sure I can imagine large fractions
of the population typically succumbing to this, but would the fraction be so big
that for 9/10 planets it completely destroys the civilization, so that no other 
civilization as advanced appears on the same planet for at least a billion yrs?

If it were me, I would have a two backups stored of the latest acceptable
version of my mind (heuristics, knowledgewebs, etc.).

Backup One: The Judge

There would be a gatekeeper AI that would be in charge of one backup. After
a 24 hour period (objective time), the gatekeeper would boot-up my backup
and let me scrutinize the current me (the end state of the last 24 hours of
mind morphing). If the backup me thinks the new me is acceptable, the
gatekeeper overwrites the new me over the backup copy and the cycle begins
again anew. If the backup me thinks the new me is unacceptable (e.g.,
suicidal, psychotic, just plain "weird") then the new me is overwritten with
the backup me and the cycle begins anew. This process might impede the fast
evolution of my mind into more robust states because I can not appreciate
the possible drastic progress my mind made in the previous 24 hours.
However, it provides insurance that I don't fall victim to the scenario
you've described.

Backup Two: The Archive

The second backup would be archived with other backups from previous days.
This mind archive could prove useful in variety of ways. It might serve as a
useful data source for my present attempts to improve my mind. What worked?
What didn't? What kind of synergistic effects can be discerned? And so on.
My mind archive could serve as a useful data source for other minds also. I
could analyze the mind archives of other individuals also. These archives
would be stored in static storage media, i.e., they would not be operational
identities.

This entire setup could be tailored to the aggressiveness of the individual.
Some people may wish to have the "judging" period only once a month instead
of every day. Others might wish to review their progress in near real time
(every second, or less) with each subtle change analyzed and selected for or
against, hence accelerated Lamarckian evolution.

There are all the concomitant problems with identities and the "rights" of
the new me. If the overwriting of the new me becomes a problem then the new
me could be allowed to continue. But the backup me would have the chance to
reinstate itself. Thus, the backup me is never at the mercy of an
unfortunate choice of modication that might send me off on some psychotic
tangent.

Don't you mean "subjective time"?  In objective time 24 hours might be
a subjective century for you.

This is an interesting approach.  I can conceive of cases where it might
not work well, but they are not very convincing.  Maybe you could drift
into an uptight, restricted mindset, and the only way out of it is by
some kind of mind-blowing, consciousness-expanding experience, the very
thing which would be rejected by your Judge.  More serious might be a
subtle memetic trap, like some kind of cult where you get sucked into
it gradually.  Now your Judge is helping to enforce your new mindset
and it's going to be harder to break free.

Still, I can understand the theory that if a change is truly worth making,
then it will still seem attractive the next morning.  Even the situations
I have described here can be overcome, via a gradual process of awakening
and enlightenment.  Giving up the ability to have overnight mindquakes may
well be a good strategy in the long run.

Certain aspects of this approach may make people uncomfortable.
Some people will be squeamish about the "death" the Judge faces when he
allows himself to be overwritten by the next day's copy.  When in the
role of Judge, they might find themselves tempted to preserve their train
of thought even at the cost of losing a day's experience.  This kind of
identity management would not be not appropriate for people with such
views.

I suspect, thought, that given the ability to do the manipulations
described here, most people would be forced to adopt more sophisticated
approaches to identity.

I considered objective time a better reference point. My intent was to
anchor the time interval with the gatekeeper AI since any reliance on the
"new" me could make the entire process vulnerable to manipulation.

You've identified some significant shortcomings to the approach. But I think
they could be ameliorated in a couple of ways. The levels of review could be
multiple. For example, every three months, the archived mind (of three
months ago) can perform the judgement process on the entire mind trajectory
of the last three months. An analysis could be performed to determine if
some sort of memetic obstacle was introduced. If this is the case, the
memetic virus could be discerned (more easily at least) by the uninfected
mind and either removed from the current mind or that trajectory is
abandoned and I start with the mind a few days before the memetic infection.
Of course, this might be dangerous since it is possible my mind's
configuration prior to the infection is what gave rise or made me vulnerable
to the infection in the first place. However, as long as the three month (or
whatever time period) window is in place there is some assurance that
undesirable states can be "cured".

As a side note, a particularly nefarious "undesirable" mutation could bestow
vastly increased intelligence in the short-term while it sinks its cognitive
bile deeply into your mind's configuration. Even this scenario though would
not be immune to a multi-level mind review.

Herein lies one of the two most formidable obstacles to this approach. The
continuity problem is a vexing dilemna that has been debated at length in
this forum. Two identities exist (the backup and the new), separated by a 24
hour time period, and only one emerges after the judging process (assuming
the "overwriting" scenario). Obviously, one entity is no longer in
existence.

The other obstacle is the solution to the aforementioned problem. If the new
entity, even though judged undesirable by the backup entity, is allowed to
continue then it might want to institute its own review process. In a
cosmologically short span of time the storage capacity needed to store all
the mind trajectories of me would exceed the information storage capacity of
the universe.

Keywords.  Sentence structures.  Statistical correlation.  You'd be surprised
at what technology can do.

In your case, the phrase "offer" and "price" might have been the trigger.

eliezer, this is an interesting thought.  it never occurred to me.  in this
case, my post about selling out to the devil is a pretty harmless one, as
lockheed could not care less who i sell my soul to, as they
are interested in only my mind and body.  hmmm, that didnt come
out exactly right either...  {8^D  spike

I am particularly drawn to that last comment:

I, too, strongly believe that a powerful opportunity is staring us in the face.  Consider the unremarkable correspondence between Klaus Lackner and myself. 

NOTE: Klaus Lackner and Christopher Wendt, at Los Alamos Natl. Labs, <kslackner@sprynet.com>, are responsible for the journal article--Exponential Growth of Self-Replicating Machine Systems--which appeared in the May 1995 issue of Computation and Mathematical Modeling, Elsevier Pub., and which resulted in the article in Discover Magazine about self-replicating, solar-energy-array-building robots--auxons. 

I wrote:

I've seen Moshe Sipper's Self Replication page, and read the NASA summer study, and requested info from Bob Freitas, its editor.

Garden variety automation (the industrial revolution), familiar, and for the most part unthreatening, incrementally reduces the amount of labor cost per unit of production.  Ho hum.   But machine self-repication appears to take automation to a whole new level, reducing the per-unit labor cost of ALL SYSTEM COMPONENTS ACROSS THE ENTIRE SYSTEM, AND ALL SYSTEM OUTPUT to a vanishingly small quantity.  Isn't that the implication, or have I missed something?  Doesn't that essentially signal the obsolescence of the old economic order?

II am not so sure that the first one to do it will win everything.  My expectation would be that the first system is  limited in what it can generate in output.  The major output of an early system would be basic feedstocks for industry. Energy, raw materials, basic chemicals etc.  The reason is that anything complex we consume is not made in numbers that would lend themselves for this production scale.  TVs for example such a system could make overnight for the entire world population.  I would expect this to happen over time which in turn gives the chance for many people with innovative ideas and capital to enter into this competition.

The trick is to define intermediate goals that don't have this all or nothing flavor.

	I can't shake the irksome feeling that shortly, someone with the vision and indomitable drive of a Bill Gates will seize this opportunity and make it into a reality, and I will be left thinking, "That could have been me."

	A final note: 
	Nanotech is on its way, and I await its arrival with dynamically optimistic enthusiasm.  Meanwhile...
	The self-replicating solar-energy-array-building "auxon" system envisions producing PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS in unprecedentedly vast quantities ("the size of the state of Arizona", or "10 percent of the Sahara desert")by currently available technologies.  Photovoltaic cells from single crystal silicon(if indeed they are cells of the single crystal and not amophous silicon type) are produced by a procedure with marked similarities to that used to produce memory and microprocessor ic's.  A manufacturing base which could produce thousand square mile quantities of photovoltaic cells, if converted to the production of computing resources, could be expected to crank out some serious -flops worth of computing power.  Mayhaps enough bring about the nativity of the first generation, somewhat clunky, pre-nano superintelligence?  Just a thought.

In this connection the emacs command M-X spook is rather amusing.  Here's
a sample result of a single application:

"Qaddafi SDI security KGB AK-47 Croatian Ortega Legion of Doom FSF
 cryptographic Uzi Waco, Texas Saddam Hussein terrorist radar"

With sufficiently widespread use of variants of this type of program,
monitoring email becomes much more difficult.

I could build a transhuman intelligence for the same estimated price.  In
fact, back in the 70s, Pounelle was offering to build an O'Neill colony for
$25G.  "Between $1G and $100G" is the hypertech equivalent of "your remodeled
basement/computer program/training should take two weeks", which always equals
six months.  In fact, this is henceforth to be known as Yudkowsky's
Translation:  Any job which is estimated to take two weeks will take six months.

Now, if you'd said $400G I might believe it, just like I'd believe an estimate
of three weeks.

Hi everyone,
I'm wading my way -slowly- through Tipler at the moment.
with no formation in maths, and only a little formal logic (years ago as
an undergrad)
I'm finding it quite hard going.
I tried -unsuccessfully to date- to read Penrose (i know he has no
fundamental affinity with the questions which occupy us here, but I
thought it might serve as a good foil/counterpoint to the boyish
enthusiasm I'm experiencing for extropian ideas)
Funnily enough, Tipler is illuminating what I found quite opaque in
Penrose on Turing machines.

question: could someone please try to explain to me -in terms adapted to
the level of mathmatical aptitude suggested by foregoing- the proof
offered by Tipler on p.26 of Physics of immortality, that is, the
argument he offers to prove that the Halting problem is unsolvable.

I am aware of how basic my concerns are, but I really do have enough
enthusiasm to make up for initial maths defecit, that is, if you folks
are willing to help me from time to time.

anyway, all the best.

I do believe though that it will be a fundamental flaw to keep energy
production centralised like that. But that is not a fundamental flaw of the
selfreplicating idea. Maybe we should just view it as an ecosystem with an
excess production that we can harvest and move to other parts of the world.

What most of this solar cell discussion really seem to strand on is the
energy storage. Has anybody got any knowledge about how the state of affairs
is these days concerning decentralised energy storage. Batteries, fuel
cells, etc?

Well many of you are probably already aware of this document, but here is a
link. An interresting read for those interrested in open source software.

{ The body of the Halloween Document is an internal strategy memorandum on
Microsoft's possible responses to the Linux/Open Source phenomenon. It
smells too strongly of Microsoft's unique corporate culture (as revealed by
independent resources such as The Borg) to be other than genuine.
The list of collaborators mentioned at the end includes some people who are
known to be key players at Microsoft, and the document reads as though the
research effort had the cooperation of top management; it may even have been
commissioned as a policy white paper for Bill Gates's attention (the author
seems to have expected that Gates would read it).

Accordingly, it provides us with a very valuable look past Microsoft's
dismissive marketing spin about Open Source at what the company is actually
thinking -- which, as you'll see, is an odd combination of astuteness and
institutional myopia.

Since the author quoted my analyses of open-source community dynamics (The
Cathedral and the Bazaar) and Homesteading the Noosphere) extensively, it
seems fair that I should respond on behalf of the community. :-)

I think there are lots more of these great opportunities that are staring us
in the face (like the mind stimulator -- hey Eliezer, how about building one
of those? ;-) It's really too bad that there isn't some kind of focussed
transhuman effort to do produce and market some of our more feasible
ideas. If you set up a company, everyone could buy a couple of shares
to start it up. If it fails, personal losses are small, if it turns out to be
the next Microsoft then everybody's a big winner. Makes sense? Surely,
if all those bright minds on this list alone worked together on a single
product there should be some good results fairly soon.

Are you conceptualizing this as though the two entities are
communicating with each other?  If so, the acceptability of
the newer entity by the older  should be fairly clear by judgement
time.   If the newer entity, quite pleased with it's own development
despite the criticisms of the older entity, suspected that it was
about to be overwritten, then wouldn't it make a secure copy of
itself?  No, you're scenario would require that only the older entity
could have the ability to overwrite or make copies.  Yes?  Otherwise,
info storage capacity problems are inevitable.

Why store it?  Why not dump it into a world wide power grid?

Solar power generating stations suffer from one serious fault: peak
demand incompatibility. being able to store power from this intermittent
source for supply to the grid at periods of peak demand (when the power
is also worth the most) is of utmost importance.

As for the amount of power it generates, the area of Arizona should see
a solar flux level equivalent to over 250 terawatts. Given that the only
solar technology currently available which has any kind of near-market
cost effectiveness is thin film amorphous, which has a conversion
efficiency of around 10%, we are talking about 25 terawatts of generated
power. Accounting for DC to AC inveting and distribution losses, we are
talking about 20 terawatts of power. This is a significant amount, but
not a significant percentage of the world power demand.

My question is more environmental. What is the albedo of an Arizona sized solar power plant, compared to the wild saharan terrain? The Sahara Desert is the largest fast injector of heat into the earth's atmosphere,  the whole North Atlantic weather system is dependent on it far more than the El Nino phenomenon. If we increase or decrease in a big way the amount of heat being put into the atmosphere at that point, what is the effect that is going to have on the weather? If it cools by reflecting more light back into space, this could possibly be a good thing to counteract global warming. But if it absorbs more light than normal sand and radiates this energy as heat, we could have some serious problems with this concept.

Your point is well taken. I've implied as such in my writing but didn't
specifically state it. The new identity would be afforded only provisional
rights. Instigating its own gatekeeper AI would not be among these
provisional rights.

I've anticipated another problem with this one tier judgement approach. The
new me could desire to make some drastic change to its mental configuration.
However, knowing that it will be judged by the backup me and believing the
backup me might reject the drastic change, the new me does not make the
change. The backup me, ignorant of the intentions of the new me, judges the
new me to be acceptable and overwriting occurs. The new me then instigates
the change (and is always assured of being able to do so since it is the new
point of reference). I've been fooled by myself! Perhaps there will be a way
for the backup me to know the intentions of the new me. However, if the new
me comes up with the drastic change post-overwriting then the entire setup
up is compromised.

The solutions to this problem would be to have a periodic judgement by the
original (t=0) identity. For every period t, the t0 identity would judge the
resulting identity of the past t period's experimentation and changes. This
identity can be archived as usual. If t0 decides that t1 is acceptable then
t1 is allowed to continue onwards. At t=2, t2 would be reviewed by t0. If t0
decides t2 is unacceptable t0 can begin with t0 or t1. To this extent, all
my identity changes would be vulnerable to my original identity. The biggest
danger here is a lack of understanding on the part of t0. t0 might not
understand the positive aspects of a t(n) configuration and thus t0 could
place an absolute limitation on the development of my identity over time.

When I have time, I'll try and develop this whole idea more completely (and
more coherently!).

I wrote about that and some other stuff in my dialog "Waiting For Zed" that was on
Extropy Online, this is part of it.
===================================

[...]

Bob: You are quite correct, a computer can't do everything, it can't even
     handle some numbers, Alan Turing discovered those numbers and then used
     them to prove that no computer program can ever predict if it will ever
     be able to come up with a solution to a problem, much less predict what
     that answer will be. This is how Turing proved that a computer can not
     deal with all numbers or even most numbers. First make a list of all
     possible binary computer programs.


Alf: This Turing character, if he ever really existed, sure did a lot, but
     this list of his is going to be awful big, infinitely large in fact.

Bob: Alan Turing isn't just credited with writing "The Iliad" he was also a
     great mathematician, he laid the foundation of computer science and broke
     the nazi military code in his spare time. Yes, he was well aware that his
     list of all possible binary computer programs would be infinitely large,
     it does not flaw his proof.

     If the programs don't have an endless loop in them they will eventually
     spit out a digital output of some sort when you run them, we will treat
     this binary output as a number, so that program Pn produces the binary
     number bn1 bn2 bn3 ...   Sometimes the output will be infinitely long,
     like Pi, that's OK, write  it all down. Sometimes the program will have
     no output at all because it is caught in an  endless loop, in that case
     just put in a blank line in  the list. This is how the list would look.

     Program P1 outputs bits  b11 b12 b13 b14 b15 ... etc
     Program P2 outputs bits  b21 b22 b23 b24 b25 ... etc
     Program P3 outputs bits  b31 b32 b33 b34 b35 ... etc
     Program P4 outputs bits  d41 d42 d43 d44 d45 ... etc
     Program P5 outputs bits
     Program P6 outputs bits  b61 b62 b63 b64 b65 ... etc
          .
          .
          etc.

     Now we can come up with our non computable number, all we need is to
     apply the "not" (~) operator in a diagonal manner on our list. The
     following number is non computable ~b11 ~b22 ~b33 ~b44 ...   Program P1
     will not produce bit ~b11, program P2 will not produce bit ~b22  Program
     P3 will not produce bit ~b33 etc. No computer program will ever produce
     this number, not even in an infinite amount of time.

Alf: Hold on! Everything you've said looks pretty mechanical to me, so why
     couldn't a computer program produce it? To find the nth bit of our non
     computable number all you need to do is run the Pn computer program
     until it produces the nth bit and then "not" it. Now we have a computer
     program producing a number that no computer program can produce.
     Something is not right.

Bob: Correct, something stinks. The only solution to the paradox is that in
     general the Halting Problem must not have a solution. This means you
     can't know for sure if the program will ever produce the nth bit.
     It might go into an endless loop, it might not. It might produce the
     nth bit in 5 seconds, it might produce it in 5 billion years, it might
     never produce it. There is no general algorithm to decide, that means
     that a computer program can never know if it will find a solution to a
     problem or what it will do next until it actually does it.

Here's a potentially better protocol:

First the entity must ask itself, what am I trying to accomplish, what am I
trying to become, what is my goal? Setting a goal is essential to actually
getting anywhere.

Then the entity sets up a worldspace in which the entity populates with several
copies of itself, which can interact, combine, reproduce by both asexual budding
and bisexual intercourse, as well as being able to edit themselves and each
other on a limited basis.

Entity copies within the worldspace  can grow over time, but if they remain
static they die after a given amount of time. Those that lose various
competetive rankings more often than not die sooner rather than later. These
competetive rankings are based loosely on the goals the Entity Prime wishes to
attain. Over time, the entities in the world space evolve toward the goals of
the Entity Prime, to the point that those entities which attain the goals of the
Entity Prime can exit the world space. At this time, the Entity Prime can
overwrite itself with Entity(n).

IMO by the time we have replicators, we can consider the biological model
for solar energy storage: plants store a lot of energy in a distributed
manner. I'm pretty sure that the energy density of biochemical storage
greatly exceeds the energy storage in a battery. For example, an adult
human, at rest, has a heat output of about 125 watts. This human needs
less than 1700 food calories per day to sustain this. (This is from
memory, not from a reference book, so I could be wrong.) Looking
at my cereal boxes, this appears to be about half a pound of
cereal. I think a nanotech-based device that stores energy like a
leaf will permit fairly dense distributed energy storage.

Agreed.  Except, of course, there would most likely be a fairly large set of
goals.

How about I, Entity Prime (EP) maintain my prime identity and also generate
(let's say) 25 sub-identities whose purposes are to achieve a set of goals
set forth by me at the time I create them?  They are virtual copies except
for the executive functions which only the (EP) holds.  They may
interact and edit themselves but not each other, except through the rational
processes of logical and persuasive argumentation.  They may form work
groups/committees to hasten their progress through cooperation.  As time
passes, sub-identities develop diverse attributes and collect specialized
information.   One problem I see, and Doug already addressed this, is that
the
EP may fall too far behind to recognize and appreciate a truly positive
opportunity for change.  I also doubt that it will be in the best interests
of
the EP in terms of efficiency to simply integrate all the attributes and all
the specialized information gathered from all of the sub-identities.  So
perhaps the best path toward achieving the stated goals (as well as
determining whether those goals are still worthwhile) is to require a
consensual
democratic decision on what information will be ultimately be fully
integrated
into the EP.  This way the EP can not be allowed to unduly retard it's own
evolutionary growth, plus the idea that an evil sub-entity might "fool" the
EP into being overwritten is no longer a problem.  It's no longer a question
of either the EP or the copy surviving.  This kind of group cherry-picking
protocol may be more controlled and stable, but might also allow for a
steadier and more sustained growth.

This idea is probably an old one, though.  I'm still trying to catch on so
bear with me.

      I am the person emailing this invitation to you concerning the
                       "Life Without Debt Program"
   The founder of this program, Mr. James Phipps, who operates the 
   "computer center", created this opportunity for people who want
    to develop a good income, but do not want to get involved with 
   the worn out multi-level marketing programs that require you to
     spend a lot of time and money trying to sell a product that a 
   dozen other companies also have available, and that few people
    are actually interested in buying.  Plus the ongoing headaches
        of having to make additional sales month after month.

   This program teaches you how to take control of your finances,
   create a good income, and get out of debt.  With this program,
   you can start with a $5 per week investment, and compound it 
     into a $780 per week income. You can then increase your
      investment to $25 per week, and compound that into a
     $3900 per week income.  This is a proven system that is
   backed by a solid, 9 year old company (The "Computer Center")
    with a large established income base.  This is not an unproven
     fly-by-night company.  This company does business the old-
       fashioned way.  Cash Only!  No credit cards or checks.
  All payments that you make to the company, and all income that
             the company pays to you is in cash only!

Title
  Prescribing exercise in multiple short bouts versus one continuous bout:
  effects on adherence, cardiorespiratory
  fitness, and weight loss in overweight women.
Source
  International Journal of Obesity & Related Metabolic Disorders. 
  19(12):893-901, 1995 Dec.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether prescribing exercise in several short-bouts
  versus one long-bout per day would enhance exercise adherence,
  cardiorespiratory fitness, and weight loss
  in overweight adult females in a behavioral weight control program. DESIGN:
  Randomized controlled trial with subjects randomized to either a short-bout
  exercise group (SB, n = 28, age = 40.4 +/- 5.9 yrs) or a long-bout exercise
  group (LB, n = 28, age = 40.9 +/- 7.3 yrs), with subjects followed for a
  period of 20 weeks. Both groups were instructed to exercise 5 days per week
  with exercise duration progressing from 20 to 40 min per day. The LB group
  performed one exercise bout per day, whereas the SB group performed multiple
  10 min bouts of exercise per day. The recommended caloric intake for all
  subjects was 5022-6277 kJ/day (1200-1500 kcal/day), with fat reduced to 20%
  of caloric intake. SUBJECTS: Fifty-six obese, sedentary females (BMI = 33.9
  +/- 4.1 kg/m2). MEASUREMENTS: Exercise participation was assessed from
  self-reported diaries and Tri-Trac Accelerometers.
  Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed
  using a submaximal cycle ergometer test. RESULTS: Exercising in multiple
  short-bouts per day improved adherence to exercise: the SB group reported
  exercising on a greater number of days (mean +/- s.d. = 87.3 +/- 29.5 days vs
  69.1 +/- 28.9 days; P < 0.05) and for a greater total duration (223.8 +/-
  69.5 min/week vs 188.2 +/- 58.4 min/week; P = 0.08) than the LB group.
  Predicted VO2Peak increased by 5.6% and 5.0% for the LB and SB groups,
  respectively (P < 0.05). There was a trend for the weight loss to be greater
  in the SB group (-8.9 +/- 5.3 kg) compared to the LB group (-6.4 +/- 4.5 kg;
  P < 0.07). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that short-bouts of exercise may
  enhance exercise adherence. Short-bouts of exercise may also enhance weight
  loss and produce similar changes in cardiorespiratory
  fitness when compared to long-bouts of exercise. Thus,
  short-bouts of exercise may be preferred when prescribing exercise to obese
  adults.

Title
  Moderately intense physical activities and high levels of
  cardiorespiratory fitness reduce the risk
  of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in middle-aged men [see comments].

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Physical activity has been advocated as an important factor in
  the primary prevention of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM),
  but information concerning the specific intensities and durations that are
  protective has been unavailable. OBJECTIVE: To examine prospectively the
  association between self-reported levels of the intensity and duration of
  physical activities, and cardiorespiratory
  fitness (assessed by respiratory gas exchange) and incident
  cases of NIDDM (assessed by the oral glucose tolerance test) in a
  population-based sample of 897 middle-aged Finnish men. RESULTS: After
  adjustment for age, baseline glucose values, body mass index, serum
  triglyceride levels, parental history of diabetes, and alcohol consumption,
  moderately intense physical activities (> or = 5.5 metabolic units) that were
  undertaken for at least a 40-minute duration per week were associated with a
  reduced risk of NIDDM (odds ration [OR], 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI],
  0.22-0.88). Activities with less than an intensity of 5.5 metabolic units,
  regardless of their duration, were not protective.
  Cardiorespiratory fitness levels greater
  than 31.0 mL of oxygen per kilogram per minute were protective against NIDDM
  (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.08-0.82). A subgroup of men at high risk of NIDDM,
  because they were overweight and were hypertensive and had a positive
  parental history of NIDDM, who engaged in moderately intense physical
  activities above the 40-min/wk duration reduced their risk of NIDDM by 64%
  compared with men who did not participate in such activities. CONCLUSIONS:
  After adjustment for age, baseline glucose levels, and known risk factors,
  physical activities with an intensity of 5.5 metabolic units or greater and a
  duration of 40 minutes or greater per week protected against the development
  of NIDDM. These protective effects were even more pronounced in a subgroup of
  men who were at high risk for the development of the disease.

The other night I saw a movie called "Bleeders", in which genetic 
replicants (sans experience) were called "BLANKS".

This led me to wonder if perhaps there are people who's lives have 
been orchestrated so that when they are eventually in public office, 
they can be backed up, just in case their hosts are assassinated.

For example, if John F. Kennedy had been cloned, and he had a running 
backup on Molecular Tape, it wouldn't be such a loss if he was 
killed.  In the event of assasination, the puppeteers need only refit 
one of his "Blanks" with a neural interface to his backup, 
conveniently stored at a remote location (e.g., The Dark Side of the 
Moon).

This would make assassination obsolete, since the replicant would be 
able to pick up where the original left off.

Please see the following URL:

This is a Lawrence Livermore spin-off (interesting pun).

Do these flywheels actually *generate* electricity, or do they merely 
store it for later distribution?

I don't cook with recipes. Here's a few condiments (not particularly
extropian):

	bacon
	soy sauce
	salt, pepper
	dried tomatoes
	onions
	garlic
	curry powders
	salsa

You get the idea...

Correction: the movie was called "The Eighteenth Angel".

Have you all had a chance to try to find your house on the following 
map (1.01 terabytes):

http://terraserver.microsoft.com/terra_findaspot.htm

It would be fun to put this whole map into RAM and fly around at will 
from spot to spot.  (Of course, it would have to be enhanced a bit 
with more current hiresolution house-level imagery... scan maybe down 
to the bristles on a toothbrush or something)...

Thanks John,
I was starting to worry that perhaps my question was too dumb to attract
an answer from the group -which in turn caused me to doubt whether I was
being realistic in hanging in here.
Your response, which I must admit, has not left me entirely satisfied
that I understand the problem any better, has at least reassured me, and
encourages me to hang in.

If I have understood anything, it seems that (and Tipler says as much)
if a person can understand the proof of the halting problem, that person
is doing something that a computer program can't do ...as yet? ever?

Thanks again,
Michael

Does this not suggest some kind of circularity: ie: having recourse to
"persuasive argumentation" looks to be suspiciously what we more
normally think of as part of being human.

Food calories, as I recall, are actually kilocalories in energy terms. As for
dense distributed storeage, a maple tree's leaves are only the energy generators
in the organism. Several hundred pounds of leaves produce 100-300 calories worth
of sap per day, which is stored in the trunk and roots. The total mass of a whole
maple tree is several thousand pounds. I would hardly call this a dense
distributed energy storeage system. The total surface area of the leaves is
several thousand square meters, indicating to me that the energy conversion
efficiency of these organisms is far less than 1%

Nano tech organisms should not be designed with their own power generation
devices, as  that is a prescription for loss of control and catastrophe. Any
nanotech we deploy should be entirely dependent upon an outside source of energy,
a food, that we supply.

Yes its an old one. We can surmise that if there actually is some being
tenatively called God that it used this sort of protocol in the creation of our
universe. Your concerns are duly noted, seeing as how many people in modern
society have left the 'god' concept by the wayside, we have outgrown that poor
being....

I assume that many of you are aware of the situation in Afghanistan by 
now.  An excellent set of factual material and suggestions for action 
can be found at http://www.feminist.org/afghan/intro.html. 

 Kudos to Ellie Smeal and the FFM for mounting a clear, rational and strong 
campaign.  In media interviews, Ms. Smeal has based her comments on the 
scientific basis for opposing house arrest for women--the severe health 
consequences brought about by a lack of sunshine and access to medical care.

I hope that transhumanists, individually or in their groups, will 
decide to take some sort of action or make some sort of statement that 
indicates that we do not tolerate this sort of retrograde human abuse.  
If the situation is not reversed in Afghanistan, we will be living in a 
time in which at least one nation on the globe has free rein to 
segregate and punish its citizens based on their biology.

Sin,

             Human Brain Transplantation Protocol
             Approved To Reverse Nerve And Brain
             Damage

LOS ANGELES (October 30, 1998) -- While growing cells in
petri dishes has been done for more than a century, this old
technique is being applied in ground-breaking new ways, and with
space-age equipment, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center's
Neurofunctional Surgery Center. The goal is to produce cures for
such previously incurable conditions as spinal cord injuries,
stroke, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease.

The project was sparked by the recent discovery of human
brain cells' potential for regeneration, contradicting previous
scientific assumptions. "While it is true that brain cells don't
regenerate in situ, we have found that a very small number of brain
cells, harvested and placed into a special environment, can be
stimulated to regenerate, and that regeneration continues when the
cells are re-introduced into the brain," says Michel Levesque,
M.D., Director of the Neurofunctional Surgery Center and an
internationally known neurosurgeon at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

Toomas Neuman, Ph.D., Director of Neurobiology at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and Dr. Levesque are working together
to culture a number of carefully targeted brain cells from a
patient, stimulating growth and regeneration in a carefully
regulated environment, and then re-introducing them into the
patient, where the growth continues, and effects healing and repair
to previously irreparably damaged brain tissue.

"The implications of this are enormous. Right now we will
use cell harvesting and implantation to treat Parkinson's disease,"
says Dr. Levesque. "Treating neurodegenerative diseases involving
one type of neurotransmitter cells is comparatively straightforward
-introducing excitatory neurons or inhibitory neurons, into
a particular part of the brain. In other words, one type of cell to
one location.

"Treating stroke and spinal cord injuries with regenerated
cells is infinitely more complex," says Dr. Levesque. We have to
identify, grow, and re-introduce a complex mixture of cells to
restore a damaged circuitry. We're working on a human protocol for
spinal cord injury now, and hope to start treating patients with
regenerated cells within the next six months."

The process literally starts with brain surgery, says Dr.
Levesque. "For epilepsy patients who require surgery, we take a
small piece of the cortex, where some of the few brain cells
capable of regeneration are located. We remove a few of those
cells, store them in our cell bank of neurons, and freeze them
until we're ready to grow them in petri dishes.

Dr. Neuman oversees the growth stimulation part of the
project. "Right now we have to remove the cells and put them into
a special environment to stimulate them to begin growing and
dividing. Our goal is to eventually be able to stimulate the cells
without removing them first," says Dr. Neuman. "The cells don't
spontaneously regenerate in the body -- that's why certain types of
brain injuries and illnesses are currently incurable or
irreparable.

"A variety of molecular biology tools are used to identify
and stimulate the cells," says Dr. Neuman. "We have to keep the
growing  cells in sterile, biologically stable incubators -- like
baby incubators -- to maintain a constant environment. When we're
ready to grow them, we put them into a special bath that includes
different growth factors. Without either one, the cells don't
regenerate. If you have all the necessary things they divide and
grow. If you don't have them, these little guys die," he adds.

"The work we're doing is based on solid scientific
foundations. It began years ago, with studies indicating that
certain types of birds could produce brain cells that would
regenerate in the right circumstances. The studies moved from birds
to animals. The progression from animal brain cell regeneration to
human brain cell regeneration is the next logical step. When I
began working with Dr. Levesque we discovered we had a common
interest -- our working  together actually stimulated the project,"
says Dr. Neuman.

"When we finish developing our protocol, we'll be the first
to offer this treatment for stroke and spinal cord injuries," says
Dr. Levesque. "We have a lot of spinal cord injury patients who are
interested in this type of treatment." The human protocol is
scheduled to be completed in six months, at which time cell
regeneration and re-introduction treatments can begin on humans.

 Very interesting, and it prompted me to look at Eric Raymond's "The Cathedral
and the Bazaar"

http://tuxedo.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/


a famous analysis of the open source process. Seems to me the open source
process is an example of using the Net to increase collective intelligence.
(The collective intelligence route to the Singularity). I was struck by Eric's
comments on the kind of problem that scales well to large numbers of independent
agents. In particular, debugging a rough cut of a solution to the problem
benefits from the many different viewpoints of the participants. To make it work
though, all participants must have a common agreement on the goal.

Perhaps other problems could be restated as debugging a rough cut of a solution,
and use this process. In particular, my current interest, tuning web site
performance, should be open to this. Anyone else got suggestions for suitable
problems?

The problem with this is that while it removes the worst
possiblities of abuse, it also eliminates the highest 
growth rates, leaving those who choose to use it less
competitive than those who use natural raw materials.

Sure but you could use the same logic to the use of gengineered infectious viruses as a
means of widespread improvement of the gene pool. Its still a very dangerous idea. If I
knew of another transhuman who was using such liberated technology I'd nuke the guy on
general principles.

I don't beleive that the risk is less costly than the purported worth of the
improvement in competetiveness.  Far to the opposite in fact.

Although I share much enthusiasm for self replicating machines, I am
also skeptical of the benefits of cheap centralized energy.  I am
currently paying  about $400 a month for power to my home.  I don't
remember the source or exact numbers, but only a small percent (around
10%) of that is being used for paying the cost of energy.  The
majority is for distribution, maintenance of power lines, meter man,
and general overhead.  Even if the energy was free, my bill would
still be around $360 and that's not exactly a major increase in
quality of living.  A real benefit would be an energy box in everyones
home that requires occasional refills of cheap chemicals.  Now that
would make a difference.

Maybe its time to research the bible to see if there is any clue as to
how many watts that eternal flame is ;-)  I suppose, even if its only
a single measly watt, as long as the population is finite, you could
experience an infinite subjective time after all.  So what if it takes
a couple billion years for one day to pass.  You'll still be doing
better than the do gooders, provided Tipler is wrong.

Apparently jokesters are only willing to go so far.  Sadly, $20,000
has not made its way into my account :-( come on td, you elcheapo.  I
extend the deadline to the end of this week and reduce the amount to
$10,000.  Because you seem to be a fully badged employee, delivery to
my office in legal tender is acceptable.  Make the envelope somewhat
obscure or I'll never find it in this messy cubicle.  td, you are the
bestest.

Yes, since Satan is less powerful than God, it is obvious that Hell is
limited in size. What is its carrying capacity? At what point do souls
have to time share fire and brimstones? Considering that numbers like 666
were considered big and 144,000 was considered to be near infinite, then
Hell must definitely be time-share by now, with billions of souls already
there... Consider also that the number of demons and devils is also
limited to the original amount of fallen angels. The more souls that go to
hell wind up getting tortured less and less over time, unless they wind
up merely torturing themselves...

Considering that some on the net think that the EBE's that the Majestic 12
have been consorting with are minions of the devil, you might try to query
Lockheed's Area 51/Groom Lake staff. TD is probably a project head
there....

The suggestions from action on this page are far from excellent, they
include writing letters to politicians, wearing a symbol of support, signing
a petition, joining their group, and telling others to also follow these
recommendations. This really does nothing for anybody, except to make the
person doing them feel like they've done something when they really haven't.
I unfortunately have no better suggestions. The situation is obviosly
terrible in Afghanistan and I only expect it to get worse. I hope that
perhaps the border skirmishes they are having with Iran will result in a war
which will overthrow or at least weaken the Taliban government in
Afghanistan (Iran is only very slightly better). What I wish is that there
were some organization(s) which are 1) helping women escape Afghanistan for
other countries and/or 2) smuggling subversive, anti-Taliban information
into Afghanistan (it does little good for us Americans to sit in America and
decide that yes something should be done in Afghanistan). Do any such
organizations exist? The Taliban is certainly afriad of any external
information coming in (shown by their recent ban of television).

  After looking through my files for the uses of  supplements  as an
adjunctive treatment for breast cancer, I was intrigued by the breast tumor
regression effect of high dose (390 mg/day) coenzyme Q10. A full double
blind placebo controlled trial of this supplement in the treatment of
breast cancer has apparently not been done, probably (IMHO) because this is
not a patentable (read profitable) drug. However the existing data is
encouraging. Following is an abstract I typed in of one report.

Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 212(1): 172-177 July 6,
1995
"Progress on Therapy of Breast Cancer With Vitamin Q10 and the regression
of Metastases"

Abstract:

  Over 35 years, data and knowledge have internationally evolved from
biochemical, biomedical and clinical research on vitamin Q10 (coenzyme Q10;
CoQ10) and cancer, which led in 1993 to overt complete regression of the
tumors in two cases of breast cancer. Continuing this research, three
additional breast cancer patients also underwent a conventional protocol of
therapy which included a daily oral dosage of 390 mg of vitamin Q10
(bio-quinone of Pharma Nord) during the complete trials over 3-5 years. the
numerous metastases in the liver of a 44-year-old patient "disappeared",
and no signs of metastases were found elsewhere. a 49-year-old patient, on
a dosage of 390 mg of vitamin Q10, revealed no signs of tumor in the
pleural cavity after six months, and her condition was excellent. A
75-year-old patient with carcinoma in one breast, after lumpectomy and 390
mg of CoQ10, showed no cancer in the tumor bed or metastases. Control blood
levels of CoQ10 of 0.83-0.97 and of 0.62 microgram/ml increased to
3.34-3.64 and 3.77 microgram/ml, respectively, on therapy with CoQ10 for
patients A-MRH and EEL.

Additional quote from the above research report:

  "previously observed that a dose level of 90 mg of CoQ10 in breast cases
for ca 8 months was ineffective, since only 6 of the 32 breast cases showed
even a hint of possible clinical regression on CoQ10."

Extropy Online magazine has just published a multi-author discussion
of Vernor Vinge's concept of a technological Singularity.


The Technological Singularity is a very interesting extropian concept,
and also highly controversial, with arguments ranging from the
definition of this expected dramatic event, projected by some to be
imminent in as little as 30 years from now, to its nature, meaning,
and possible consequences.  Suggested in the 1980s by Vernor Vinge,
the concept of "the Singularity" gave rise to a range of interesting
ideas, but still remains a matter of controversy - "a black hole in
the Extropian worldview whose gravity is so intense that no light can
be shed on what lies beyond it."  Will the development of the world
reach an infinite speed around 2030, or "just" speed up beyond human
comprehension, marking the threshold between humanity and posthumanity?

In an attempt to collect the latest thinking about the Singularity,
Robin Hanson asked several authors to comment on the original essay
by Vernor Vinge.  Thirteen submitted comments, with detailed replies
by Vernor Vinge and selections from subsequent open discussion on the
extropian mailing list have now appeared in the Extropy Online.

It's odd, I did not see the posting from 'den otter', only snippets of 
it, so if someone  could repost, that would be helpful.

I believe that my original posting may have been misunderstood.  My 
intention was twofold:  (i) to alert people to factual information 
about the situation, and (ii) to suggest that this might provide a good 
opportunity for some transhumanists to make their voice heard in new venues.
By making our voice heard, I do not mean calling for the political 
overthrow of Afghanistan.  This situation has poltical overtones, but 
it touches on many transhumanist themes, and it provides an opportunity 
to showcase them to people who have not yet heard our ideas.

 We support individual autonomy and reasonable freedom from government
regulation--this situation represents government regulation in an
extreme degree.  We support an individual's control over their own
body--that control has been taken away.  We support science--medical
research is being used as the basis for a human rights campaign, for the
first time in recent memory.  We support longevity programs--the
deprivation of sunlight and medical care only shortens the lifespans of
these women and children with no hope of medically reversing the
effects.  We support rational thought and denouce religious
superstition--there is no rational basis for dividing an entire
population by their genital composition and imprisoning those who
possess one particular set of them.  An entire nation socially
de-evolved overnight--one year from the vaunted millenium in which many
of us will be speaking out on the potential of the future for every
human. 

What this boils down to, for me, is that transhumanism does not just 
involve the distant future, it involves the potential that exists in 
every human this very minute to evolve, grow, and develop.  When that 
potential is cut off in such a drastic manner, for no reason other than 
superstition, then I don't see it as so far off the beam to at least 
suggest that some of us might like to make a statement about it.  

But, I leave that choice to each of you.  I've made the statement that 
I need to make here.

 I was thinking the same thing some time ago, considering that it was
mainly an intra afghan problem that we are not allowed to judge. But in
fact there is far more to it, it seems a small ex CCCP country has some
oil that has to be taken somewhere, two choices, 1- through russia 2-
through afghanistan and pakistan toward the indian ocean.

  It seems that big oil companies (of which french and american ones I
expect) are pushing for control over an oleoduc that would cross afghan
and pakistan countries and willing to pay huge royalties for it. And
they are giving money to whoever can assure them the passage.

   In effect, talibans are strongly helped by pakistan -> ie there are
pakistanise 'mercenaries' helping the talibans to gain control of
afghanistan.

    So again occidentals have impacts on other civilisations??? Do I
have the big picture?

     Manu.

How many kilojoules of EMF can be transmitted from antenna arrays to 
one of those trinity flywheels (see http://www.trinityflywheel.com/)?

I mean, keep the suckers spinning nice and fast, in your back yard.  
Power it with radio waves (rather high amplitude, at that).

As long as it computers doing the wireless power transmission don't 
have bugs (see http://www.starshiptroopers.com/) you should be able 
to avoid getting accidentally vaporized (or is it liquified).  

I'm all for Open Source directed energy weapons, particularly for the 
crack dealers in WATTS.  That'll help them keep competition to a 
minimum.

The recursive effects of zero cost energy at the centralized power
plant would not be any more drastic than the direct effects.  So
taking this into account would save less than an additional $40 a
month.  Still, not a big deal.  The infrastructure needed, including
real estate, and a limited ability for open competition are too much
of a show stopper for real progress.  Household micro power plants
encourage competition and eliminate the massive infrastructure needed.

Subject: Wormhole questions
Sender: owner-extropians@extropy.com

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

Everybody worries about time travel with wormholes, but I am concerned
about more mundane matters.

How does conservation of energy and of momentum work with a wormhole?
What if I shoot a ball into hole A and it comes out hole B moving in a
different direction?  Momentum is not conserved.

Worse, what if I position the exit of hole B above the entrance to
hole A, and drop in a ball.  The ball falls through A, comes out B
where it then drops into A again, and continues, going faster and
faster as it falls forever.  Where does the energy come from?

(Note that in relativity, momentum and energy are closely related,
being separate components of the four-vector which represents a
particle's motion.  So probably these two paradoxes are two aspects
of a single phenomenon.)

I can think of two possible resolutions.

First, it could be that there are some compensating forces which serve to
balance the books.  When the ball comes out of B in a different direction
than it went in A, maybe the "substance" of the wormholes (whatever
that is) is given a kick which balances the momentum.  And maybe when
you try to go through a wormhole and come out higher than you were,
maybe there is some kind of force opposing your motion and you have to
force your way through, just enough to balance the potential energy gain.

Second, it could be that wormholes simply break the rules.  Hypothetical
stable wormholes require negative energy, and it could be that with
negative energy you already break conservation of momentum and energy.
A negative-energy mass is attracted to a positive one, but the positive
one is repelled by the negative one (or is it the other way around?).
So the pair goes rocketing off across the universe, accelerating steadily
without any input of energy.  I think Robert Forward describes this
in his novel, Timemaster.

(Actually I suppose that example technically may not break the rules,
since the negative mass acquires greater negative energy and negative
momentum as it accelerates, balancing the positive energy and momentum
of the positive mass.  So the system as a whole has constant energy
and momentum.)

Michael, there are entire one-semester college courses devoted to the
Church-Turing theorm or one of its relatives. I thought John's description
was wonderfully concise. Your question was basically equivalent to one of
the "grand-slam" mathematical questions asked by Hilbert (THE grand old man
of Mathematics of his time) in 1900, and finally answered by Church in 1936.
The history of mathematics of the early twentieth century is mostly about
answering the Hilbert questions. Turing's reformulation is a great deal
more tractable, but that doesn't make it simple. The central argument 
depends on a "Cantor diagonalization", which is the really pretty step
in the middle described by John. This trick get re-used a lot when
proving that certain sets are not countable (i.e., are not "aleph-sub-zero", etc.) 
This shows up a lot in complexity theory and of course in questions
of decidabilty and computability.

If you can ask the correct question and then get basically the distillation
of an upper-divison college course as a answer, and then understand the
answer to at least some extent, I'd say you are subscribed to the right
mailing list.

My math education is old and rusty, so any real mathematican should feel
free to correct this message.

In this case, I was referring to areal density. Plant a forrest or a wheat field
and use it to capture and store the energy. However, I intended this to be used
as a model, not used directly. That is, we can design nanomachinery that uses
sunlight to drive biochemical reactions, storing the result locally. Also
note that the whole mass of the maple tree represents a very large amount
of stored energy. If this isn't dense storage, what is?

Since I think that nanotech results immediately in the SI and in the ability
to self-augment, I feel that the nano-forrest is an extension of the SI.
Note that the SI may be collaborative, with each member of the community
being an extended human mentality. If so, I may choose to be (or include
within myself) a nano-forrest. Thus, the issue of constraining self-replicating
nanites doesn't arise. All of my nanites are highly specialized. Only the
forrest as a whole (i.e. I) can extend the forrest. Please note that I will
attempt to find a way to design and use novel reactions to capture a higher
percentage of the sunlight than a plant does.

Why would it keep going faster and faster? It would only accelerate if a
constant force was applied. If you set it in motion at 100 miles per hour,
it would keep going through A and out B, back into A, over and over, at 100
miles per hour and never gaining speed. Unless you mean the gravity of the
wormhole is applying the constant force to keep it accelerating, but this
isn't a problem either. The sun applies a constant force to Earth to keep it
rotating. Or maybe if the wormholes were too far apart, the ball would be
sucked into wormhole A, spat out B, and go slower and slower as it traveled
away from B (being sucked back by B's gravity), until B completely sucked it
back in and spat it out of A, and the same thing happens. The motion would
be a lot like that of a pendulum.

This is really kind of you: truth is, I must confess to have merely

and some other stuff that i'm wrestling with.My background is in French

E-Mail Viruses

I'm sure you have all received e-mails warning you of dire consequences if
you read an e-mail whose subject is "Good News!" or "AOL4FREE" or "Win a
Holiday" or something like that.  These are *hoaxes* intended to damage
free communication by making people afraid to use e-mail.  When you
consider the time wasted reading and forwarding such things, they are as
destructive as the real thing.

It is not possible -- NOT POSSIBLE -- to get a virus by just reading an
e-mail, unless the e-mail contains a macro or attachment that you then
execute.

Here are two simple rules that, if followed, will protect you from any
e-mailed virus:

1. If you ever read a mail message and you get a warning that alerts you
that the mail contains macros, make sure that you select the option to
disable macros before you continue.

2. If you ever receive a mail message from someone you do not know and that
mail contains an attachment, do not open the attachment till you have made
sure the attachment does not contain a virus.  There are programs on the
market that can be used to check such things.

You should also be aware that both Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word have
a built-in macro checker that will automatically alert you to the existence
of a macro in a file that you open as long as you do not disable this
function.

The next time you get one of these hoaxes, don't panic.  And, instead of
forwarding the email to all your friends, please reply to it with this
article to help educate and stop the unnecessary panic.

For more information on virus hoaxes, try these sites:

  I can form habits, regardless of wether the habits are dancing, yoga, 
studying, or partying, and I know it works on these things from 
experience.
When you start doing that which you want to do more often, take a few 
deep inhalations and exhalations, drink lot's of water, and when you 
have reached you goal, eat huge steaks cooked at low temperatures 
(unless you are a vegan of blood type A), and take a multivitamin.
The main substance we want is L-tyrosine, the amino-acid precurser of 
the natural neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinepherine, which is 
found in meat.
Dopamine is our friend.
When ravers take the drug "ecstasy", they experience the profound sense 
of love caused by our friend dopamine when he is overactive.
In effect, you can fall mildly in love with whatever you choose to do 
when eating L-tyrosine.
It's sold at General Nutrition Centers under the label of a bodybuilding 
suppliment called Neurogain by EAS (Experimental and Applied Sciences) 
for use as a strength, endurance, motivation, and energy enhancer.
Oh yea, all you ladies will be absolutely ecstatic to know that while I 
am on Neurogain, fat drops off me like there is no tommorrow, even when 
I try to prevent it.
...but BE CAREFULL, it's very potent!
I lost my virginity because of this.
I'm almost a nympho now.
God, I love this. :-)

kathryn, i read the site.  enrages one, does it not?  i have been toying
with the notion of information warfare: the concept of crushing a
oppressive regime, not with guns or bombs, but with a message of hope
to those who are being suffocated by tradition and superstition.

is no stuffing it back in.  when the time is right, the women of the middle

The point about conservation of momentum is interesting.
I think it's helpful to consider that the conservation of momentum means
anything only in the local Lorentz frame of an observer.

A good analogy is light being bent around the sun - locally
no (relativistic) momentum conservation is violated but globally 
there is curvature. Pursuing the global/local distinction further,
if the universe is in fact closed (with positive curvature), then 
if you go far enough you will end up where you came from, but going the
opposite direction (if the universe hasn't ended by then). This too might 
superficially appear as a violation of momentum conservation, but
in fact isn't when only local frames are considered. 
This is related to the fact that strict, cartesian x-y-z momentum 
conservation in classical mechanics is derived in part from the translation
symmetry of space, something you lose in curved space-times over large
distances.  

Presumably, by falling into a wormhole, like other forms of free-fall
in General Relativity all the particle is doing is following a geodesic 
in spacetime; like a particle in a gravitational field, no force is involved,
but rather an intrinsic property of the geometry of space-time. 

In regard to your infinite energy scenario, perhaps there is an energy required
to maintain the wormhole proportional to the amount of momentum passing
through it.  That way, as an object picked up speed the wormhole would
require more energy to maintain stability. How this might work I have no idea. 

Something I have a hard time imagining is how the exit velocity changes
as a function of the entrance trajectory.  It can't be said  that the
particle "bounces" off the "interior walls" of the wormhole; perhaps 
a more realistic path would be a smooth, spiralling corkscrew or
straight through for a head-on entry.  Given the 4-D geometry, you
could probably work out the motion of a particle in the reference 
frame of the wormhole, given the initial velocity and position conditions.   

Then there is always the problem of what determines where you come
out of a wormhole.  Maybe it takes participation at both ends. If it does,
then it would be quite a problem keeping one end stationary with 
respect to another one light years away.  Once it's set up, of course,
nearly instantaneous communications might allow for real-time adjustment of
the appropriate boundary conditions by varying the amount and geometry of
your negative matter.
There would seem to be a lot of computation required, since on top
of adjusting for drift you would have to adjust for the distortions
caused by the objects entering and exiting.   


The business about negative matter and its interactions
with positive matter sound interesting, but considerably
speculative. 
I'm not sure how, but I once read or heard somewhere that
a very small negative energy density can be induced using
the Casimir effect, which is related to quantum fluctuations
of the vacuum. 

As I understand it, the 4-dimensional geometry needed for a wormhole
implies a solution to Einstein's field equation that contains
entries of negative energy in the stress-energy tensor. 
Mathematically it's a very small leap, but is there any reason to 
expect the existence of negative matter any more than it would be 
meaningful for a biologist to talk about negative
population? 

BTW, Does anyone on the list know of any good papers of an
introductory/intermediate technical level on wormhole physics?

 It's not my idea, but I saw the interview of an author speaking about
one of his book (that I haven't found yet). In his book he explains that
the current world is divided not in countries, but in civilizations.

  A civilization being a group of people who share common values, such
as religion, history, geography, language, legends, resources, political
systems, technology...etc.

   You will probably agree that there is effectively an 'occidental'
civilization. Started in europe, now all across the atlantic and in
australia.

    We can also speak of an indian civilization, a muslim (or arabian),
a chinese, a slavic (east europe-russia), an african. He added a
japanese one.

     On the moment I was hearing about it, I didn't notice it as -that-
ground breaking. But nowadays, I use it more and more as a world model.
Although I'm not sure there are exactly 7 civilisations (why not add
turkie or remove japan, what about south america etc...), the concept
looks more powerfull to me than countries or continents or skin colors
or cities...

      Manu.

The situation in Afghanistan (and several other areas) is appalling.
However, I'm not so certain that racism, sexism and transhumanism are
mutually exclusive. Please understand that I deplore racism and sexism and
all other forms of bigotry. However, I do not see any intrinsic aspect of
transhumanism that would manifest in such a fashion that no transhumanists
are bigots. The promise I see in the technological capacities that exist to
some extent now and will be superfluous in the near future is the
trivialization of "natural" biological configurations (e.g., race, gender,
etc.) One the biggest concerns I have is that in the near future, with the
advent of physical quasi-immortality, human-level artificial intelligence,
molecular nanotechnology and other technologies, the vast bulk of
individuals will become unnecessary. What temptations will be there be to
justify an "optimization" of our society? Eugenics and such are sourced in
irrational bigotry for now. But what happens when strong rational arguments
grounded in logic call for filtering of society? For example, instead of
trying to destroy the Jews, what happens if a government decides to
eradicate all individuals with an IQ below 130?

However, our society has a long way to go. When I voted on November 3, I was
alarmed to see a referendum on interracial marriages on the ballot. While I
realize that South Carolina is a provincial, conservative state tucked
firmly in the "bible" belt, I nevertheless was shocked to see this issue
being subject to a vote. Evidently, there is a law in the South Carolina
code dating from the 19th century that declares marriage between races to be
illegal. I checked the statute and strangely the statute does not define
"race". The implied meaning, of course, was race meaning "black" and
"white". I was shocked because the fact that such a law remained on the
books. It is not enforced, however, and as such as never been subject to
judicial review by a South Carolina court. The most amazing aspect of the
whole affair was that 38% of South Carolina voters voted to keep the law! It
was a referendum on racism. I wager any other state would have at least
15-20% voting for such a law. It's sobering to see how primitive we still
are. How would those 38% react when I told them that race is not important
because our biological forms are only prostheses for our minds? I'd probably
be burned at the stake.

Yes, that's the answer.  Conservation laws can be described in terms of
surface integrals around each wormhole end.  When mass goes thought the 
hole, one end gets more massive and the other end gets less massive.
When a charge goes through the hole, one end picks up a charge and the
other end loses a charge.  And one end gains the momentum of the mass
going in, while the other end loses that momentum.  

When you put one end above the other in a gravitational field and drop
a ball through them, you'll need to hold them there rather than let 
them fall to make it work.  As the top end loses mass and the bottom end
gains mass, the difference in gravitional potential ends up in the 
kenetic energy of the ball.  

Eventually the top end mass goes to zero and the hole closes, I think.  
After all, if you could keep pulling mass out of a zero mass end, you
could create a negative mass object.

What is cyclical CR? Is this fasting on alternative days? I've heard that
if you don't want to cut down calories on all days a few days fast is
nearly as good. Even increased eating on non-fast days still keeps your
overall calorie intake below normal. But are there health issues with
fasting?

Problems are always a possibility.  An accurate global climate model to predict environmental impact is, inevitably, to be desired.  Then one can change the "half-empty" situation--uncertainty that the enterprise might jump up and bite you--to a "half-full" situation where you seek to achieve both the energy-generating benefits and a concurrent purposeful climate modification benefit.  Make the weather better by design,... if possible. 

Continuing, he writes:

It seemed to me likely that there would be multiple sites world wide--Sonoran, Saharan, Saudi Peninsula, Central Australian, and many others not quite so large--which would obviate any demand-timing mismatch, ...

as MaxM suggested when he wrote:

Continuing with Michael Lorrey's comments,

Stop right there.

At this point you begin to overlook the essential transformative character of self-replication, the basic premise of my post. Conventional market economics, and the related cost factors, go the way of the buggy whip when automation reaches the level of exponential machine self-replication.  
	Cost factors always originate in the labor component of a product or service, which, in the case of a self-replicating machine system, is confined to the design and construction of the "seed".  The exponential growth of the system distributes that initial cost over the entire system.  Not only that, but the manufacturing system which builds the solar array, then exists, free of any cost whatsoever, and ready to produce anything within its capabilities, in whatever quantity, very rapidly, at a cost based solely on reprogrammming.  To put it bluntly, a macro-sized (in contrast to nano) machine self-replicating manufacturing system makes anything that current technology can make, in quantities that saturate demand, and at a "cost" which, shrinking to insignificance, frankly, challanges the definition of the term.
	So single crystal vs. amorphous is a non-issue.

However much is useful to make, you make.  See above, specifically, "quantities that saturate demand".

	I gave this some thought and realized, of course, you're right.  The distribution system and administrative infrastructure would be the big cost factors.  I can think of two ways to address this, given a self-replicating machine system.  
	Have the self-rep system address itself to manufacturing, installing, and maintaining the power DISTRIBUTION system, as well as the power generation system.  All physical elements of the power distribution system--cables, poles, switches, conduits, etc.--can be manufactured on the same "cost-insignificant" basis.  Programming the manufacturing system to produce these things is the only cost, but because power distibution systems are global in scale, the programming cost is spread over a very large system. (It seems paradoxical, but apparently, larger is cheaper.  Other examples possessing this advantage are communication systems, pipelines, and all roadways and rail systems.)  Insofar as people are still needed in the system, there will be conventional labor costs, but much reduced.

	The other approach is distributed photovoltaic power generation, ie., home rooftop power.  After all, if the system can make thousand square mile quantities of solar cells for power production out in the boonies, then it can just as easily make rooftop systems, in quantities to saturate demand.  At negligible cost, of course.

Joe Jenkins implied as much when he later wrote:

>Household micro power plants
>encourage competition and eliminate the massive infrastructure needed.

         ----------------------------------------------------
	An interesting feature of a self-replicating system, is that exponential growth makes component size irrevalent.  Drexler's molecular scale system is just as powerful (more powerful, actually, because of the benefits of atomic precision) as a macro-sized system, dispite the fact that the replicators are infinitessimally smaller.  You all know why.  A few more generations more or less of replication, and the bulk of one system equals the bulk of another, and with it productivity.
	What this means is that when you go to build a self-replicating system, you build it as small as possible without introducing excess cost due to miniaturization.  If you build an oven to melt silicon to make chips, given a choice between one the size of a toaster and one the size of your thumb, you go with the one the size of your thumb. 

Final note:

	The central issue here is the transformational nature of self-replication.  It is NOT about Arizona-sized solar power systems.  That is a distraction which entered the picture because the exponentially growing automated manufacturing system (the self-rep system) naturally requires a power source; both during its growth phase from the initial "seed", and at maturity.  Because the final size of the system must be capable of saturating demand for everything every human on the planet will want, it must, logically, be mega large.  Therefore, its power system, must be mega large.  And since power is needed by human society now and will be needed in the future, and since the first product the self-rep system makes for its own use is a power system, it is only logical that the first product it should make for society is excess power and more power systems.  Don't be distracted.  A robot making a power system, even a big one, is boring.  A robot making EVERYTHING for free (almost free, OK?  Don't bust my chops!) is the economic singularity.
	Nano ain't here yet.  Cryonic reanimation ain't here yet (though suspension IS here, and SUCCESSFUL REANIMATION IS A NEAR CERTAINTY).  Indefinitely perpetuated human lifespan ain't here yet (except by cryonic suspension, THE SUCCESS OF WHICH IS NEAR CERTAINTY).  Human equivalent AI ain't here yet, nor SI, nor enhancements, nor uploading.  But self-rep and the economic singularity that it will bring, marking the dawn of the transhuman era, is waiting to be built today,...this afternoon even.

On the New Paradigms Discussion List,

Somebody said:

> Libertarianism, just like feminism, is actually a meme. It is always sold
> to the gullible public as "social justice" and "idealism"

The statement above demonstates a lack of understanding of the concept
of meme.  Meme is to social organism or society as gene is to a regular
biological organism.  Any idea or aspect of culture that has social
consequences or "organizing power" is a meme.

The power organism in which we live has uses for both socialist and
libertarian memes, but needs them balanced against each other to
maintain the power structure the ruling class needs.  The socialist
meme prevents the libertarian meme from destroying institutions the
elite needs:  Central Banking, cartelizing "regulations", big government,
etc.
It also needs the libertarian meme to balance these socialist tendencies
which would otherwise expropriate the the elite.

If the libertarian meme was to win out, overwhelming socialist and statist
memes, a new libertarian society would result, one far too competitive to
allow
for a permanent ruling class such as we have today.

I'm not sure I'm an Extropian, but I just joined this list. I've
been on CR for about 6 years (I'll be in a 48 Hours piece next
week, but I doubt there'll be much useful info in it.) I went
from severe to moderate CR a couple of years ago, partly for
scientific reasons. Noted that my fasting glucose was going up
(evil, evil), so now I'm going back down to severe CR again (was
planning to do anyway, but the biostat changes help keep me
motivated).

Yes. We need a time machine! (Of course, then we wouldn't need
CR....)

And why is Walford the only CR researcher who actually follows
the diet? Strange. Optimism Dept: Because the rest think a pill
version is just around the corner.

There doesn't seem to be a threshold in rodents. And I doubt
there's one in any species. It seems to be: the more you "R" the
"C", the better the effect, all the way to a point VERY near
starvation. (I wouldn't push it, personally.)

There are a few primate CR studies underway, and some
"accidental" and epidemiological studies in humans (very few
though). I have links to them on my CR page (messy and in need of
updating....):

http://www.infinitefaculty.org/sci/cr.htm

Until we have validated biomarkers of aging, we will need the
120-year (or 150-year!) study to know with absolute certainty
whether CR works in humans, and to what degree. Myself, I think
based on what we know that there's very little chance that it
won't work for us.

AKA "anorexia" :) People on CR would call that FR (food
restriction) or DR (dietary) (though a few people have been
making up their own names, CRAN, CRON, CROL (...Oriented towards
Longevity)).

Right on! CR definitely makes me feel great too. The scrawniness
is a bummer, though. Much harder than the hunger, after an
adjustment period. You feel so much better than you look (if you
start out non-obese).

Best, and pardon typos,
Brian.

I just wondere where exercise fits into this? If for example I do weight
pushing and something like running. Then my rest pulse will be lower too
right? Doesn't that too lower the overall metabolism?

Then it might be possible to do calorie restriction by eating just the
calories you would need without exercising. And then Exercise the Calories
away.

As some of the posting Doug Screcky has made her about the Fat vs. Fittnes
seem to imply that overall death rate seem much more dependant of fittnes
than of weight. (I do understan that CR is not about weight but about
changing the metabolism)

Is there any research about this?

Peak demand is during daytime, where -- nice coincidence -- 
photovoltaics performs best. Local spikes can be averaged 
out if power is dumped into the grid. So basically all you 
need is to provide a basal PV/electrolyzers/hydride or 
(buckytube) pressure storage/fuel cells capability to make 
it through the worst-case nighttime. Seasonal variations 
should be taken care by fossil/nuke power plants 
(fine-grain decentralized, to limit thermal lossage for power/thermal 
coupling) for now, but PV and photosynthetics (both
biorenewables and future engineered/de novo processes) 
is really the only viable long-term option.

1) Centralizing PV is pointless, especially in the U.S. with its low
   (both local and global) building density

2) How do you arrive at that number? Assuming a day-average insolation
   flux of, say, 500 W/m^2, and a conversion efficiency of, say, 10%, 
   you arrive at a conservative 50 W/m^2 (with 1 kW/m^2 and 20% about four
   times that much). If you need 5 kW/human during daytime (an
   overkill in private sector, if a minimum of husbandry is 
   applied, let the industry look after itself), that's 
   100 m^2, or a square of 10x10 m (5x5 m in best case). 
   Inconspicous, if integrated  into roof and facade, 
   having an additional benefit of reducing building 
   renovation costs.

3) By utilizing terrestrial rectenna arrays/PV satellites from lunar 
   and NEA material processed in situ and EM-driver put into Earth
   orbit, you can get 100% clean power essentially 24/24 without
   consuming ground (which is not a real problem anyway).

 > solar technology currently available which has any kind of near-market

Maybe thin-film amorphous Si would be not the only technology 
available if the field has been properly funded for a decade 
or so (but, oh, no market demand, since energy is very cheap, 
particularly in the US. After 4 weeks of near-L.A. smog, one cannot
fail to notice that people will adapt to any conditions for absolutely
irrational reasons). Novel materials like CuInSe and polymer 
('last all summer long') are in theory perfectly possible and 
economical once we need them. Of course people would have to 
pay a lot for chemical feedstock once easily accessible 
fossils are depleted, being restricted to fixed atmospheric 
carbons and hydrocarbon imports from space, unless the Singularity
intervenes.

DC/AC inverting is not a problem, you can synthesize such power
directly by dynamically combining individual cells (controllers
demostrated), distribution lossage nonexistant if produced in situ,
which also takes care of centralism/landscape optical pollution. 

I suggest you revise your assumptions, as they are unnecessary
pessimistic.

Just a quick list of interesting papers that caught my eye this week
(some of this earlier reported on or from the transhumantech list):

* Beta-amyloid precursors as memory enhancers
* Geocybernetics: controlling the world
* Tisse-engineering of large tissues
* Growing neurons on patterned substrates
* Quantum key distribution through air
* NP=P if QM is nonlinear
* The street performer protocol for funding public works
* Networked schools
* Controlling complexity


Memory-enhancing effects of secreted forms of the beta-amyloid
precursor protein in normal and amnestic mice, H. Meziane, J. Dodart,
C. Mathis, S. Little, J. Clemens, S. M. Paul and A. Ungerer
Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A, 95:21, pages 12683--8, Oct 13, 1998

(http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/95/21/12683?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&titleabstract=memory+enhancing&searchid=QID_NOT_SET&FIRSTINDEX=)

In Alzheimer's disease plaques of so called beta-amyloid protein form
in the brain. It has been shown that this is some kind of derivative
of a couple of precursor proteins that are used in the normal
brain. It seems that these precursors have many fun properties,
including being memory enhancing. This seems to hold for several
different memory tasks in short-term and long-term memory at a range
of very low doses (0.05-5000 pg intracerebroventricularly). It seems
that the precursors play some kind of role in memory, most likely
rather important. It also means that we have *another* family of
memory enhancing substances to play with.



Biology

Geocybernetics: Controlling a Complex Dynamical System Under
Uncertainty, H.-J. Schellnhuber, J. Kropp, Naturwissenschaften Volume
85 Issue 9 (1998) pp 411-425

(http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00114/bibs/8085009/80850411.htm)

A systems analysis of the large scale interaction between the natural
environment and human activities; the authors argue that it may be
possible to develop a science of "geocybernetics" for controlling this
interaction in order to achieve desired results. By using detailled
models, control of chaotic processes and implementing fuzzy control
strategies (dependent upon the desired goals, such as minimizing the
risk of catastrophic change, maximizing human benefit, retaining
options, or combinations of different goals) it might be possible to
regulate the combined human + nature system. Contains references to
various interesting projects (such as regulating el nino or controlled
algae blooms to eat carbon dioxide) and a discussion of how to
formulate the vague environmental-ethical goals into stringent systems
theory. Overall many good ideas, even if the authors right at the end
fall for the systems theory temptation of calling for a central
regulator (maybe we are starting to see a split here between 'old
school' centralized cybernetics and 'new school' networked,
complexity-embracing cybernetics?). 


Development of technologies aiding large-tissue engineering,
P. Eiselt, B. S. Kim, B. Chacko, B. Isenberg, M. C. Peters,
K. G. Greene, W. D. Roland, A. B. Loebsack, K. J. Burg, C. Culberson,
C. R. Halberstadt, W. D. Holder, D. J. Mooney Biotechnol Prog, volume
14, number 1, pages 134-140

(http://pubs.acs.org/isubscribe/journals/bipret/jtext.cgi?bipret/14/i01/abs/bp970135h.html)

A discussion of how to create large artificial tissues. The problems
include creating a structure the cells can grow on that is both
biodegradable, strong enough to not collapse when implanted and a good
growth substrate for the cells, and how to make blood vessels grow
into the implant so the cells can thrive. They did some experiments
with lactide and glycolide scaffoldings, and made smooth muscle cells
grow on them. By putting microspheres with vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) into the scaffolding they got blood vessels to grow into
the implant.


Neurite outgrowth and growth cone morphology on micropatterned
surfaces, H. C. Tai and H. M. Buettner, Biotechnol Prog, 14:3, 364-70,
May-Jun 1998

(http://pubs.acs.org/isubscribe/journals/bipret/jtext.cgi?bipret/14/i03/abs/bp980035r.html)

Growing neurons on surfaces is interesting from a transhuman point of
view, especially if they can be made to grow in the right pattern. Tai
and Buettner investigated how patterns of laminin affected the growth
of cultured neurons, and found that they indeed did tend to grow along
the stripes, but became somewhat smaller than neurons cultured on free
laminin surfaces.



Quantum Weirdness

Practical Free-Space Quantum Key Distribution over 1 km, 
W. T. Buttler, R. J. Hughes, P. G. Kwiat, S. K. Lamoreaux, G. G. Luther, G. L. Morgan, J. E. Nordholt, C. G. Peterson, and C. M. Simmons
Physical Review Letters, 81:15, 3283-3286, 1998

(http://ojps.aip.org/journal_cgi/getabs?KEY=PRLTAO&cvips=PRLTAO000081000015003283000001&gifs=No)

Quantum cryptography seems to become ever more practical; this article
describes how keys have been exchanged over an outdoor optical path
around one kilometer long during nighttime. A quite fun feat, so far
most experiments have been based on optical fibers. They also discuss
the possibility of ground-satellite communication this way.


Nonlinear Quantum Mechanics Implies Polynomial-Time Solution for
NP-Complete and \#P Problems, Daniel S. Abrams and Seth Lloyd
Physical Review Letters, 1998, 81_18, 3992-3995

(http://ojps.aip.org/journal_cgi/getabs?KEY=PRLTAO&cvips=PRLTAO000081000018003992000001&gifs=No)

If there are small nonlinearities in quantum mechanics, then quantum
computers can solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. There is
no evidence whatsoever that QM is nonlinear, but this paper at least
shows that physics really can have implications for computer
science.


Economics / Society

The Street Performer Protocol, J. Kelsey and B. Schneier, The Third
USENIX Workshop on Electronic Commerce Proceedings 1998
http://www.counterpane.com/street_performer.html

Copyrights seems to become increasingly hard to enforce; information
is by its nature easy to copy. This causes a problem for creating
works of art, programs and other information products that can be
pirated - how does the author get paid? The SPP is based on the idea
that the author announces that she will create a certain work (or more
likely, has created and will release) when a certain amount of money
has been placed in eschrow. People place donations in the eschrow, and
when the announced amount has been gathered the work is
made/released. This can be extended to include publishers, banking and
funding of public works. Quite fun idea, might be tested in the
shareware field at first.


The Living Network of Schools Owned by Teachers and Students,
Stanislaw D. Glazek, http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/physics/9804005

An alternative school system, composed of a network of teachers and
students forming distributed school system. The network is divided
into teams, which may consist of students, teachers or both, and each
team is assigned to learn something and will exist for as long as the
task is not completed. Teams form classes, classes form schools,
schools form districts and so on. Teachers hold stock in the schools,
and will get dividends depending on the overall performance of the
school. They will also earn extra by producing good educational
materials or doing a good job. Students own credits, which are gained
by passing standard tests, exams, writing reports or scientific papers
(there is no firm division between basic education and university
level research; the system is intended to work on many levels,
allowing students to gradually move upwards). Overall, this seems to
be an interesting idea, even if it is (as the author points out)
half-baked as yet. It might be sufficiently flexible and encouraging
of inquiry and development to work well for a transhuman community.


Complexity

Controlling complexity, Leon Poon and Celso Grebogi, Physical Review
Letters, November 27, 1995 Volume 75, Issue 22, pp. 4023-4026

(http://ojps.aip.org/journal_cgi/getabs?KEY=PRLTAO&cvips=PRLTAO000075000022004023000001&gifs=No)

A bit old-hat these days, but it is nice to see that chaotic systems
can be controlled (see the geocybernetics paper). This paper is about
the reason why this works and how to control the noisy double rotor
map.

Anders, I'm glad you're reading widely, but I have to comment on 
your poor taste in economics sources.  The physics articles and 
journals you cite are top-notch, and I'll presume the biology 
articles are as well (I don't know that field very well).  But 
I looked at "The street performer ..." and "Networked schools", 
and they are really lousy economics - you probably couldn't get 
them published in a poor economics journal.  

I'll give the authors credit for trying to tackle neglected 
problems, and they may even have the germs of some interesting 
thoughts on them.  But compared to the physics articles you cite,
well there really is no comparison.

Did you ever try browsing some good economics journals, like
American Economic Review, Journal of Political Economy, or 
Quarterly Journal of Economics?

No, exercise actually raises basal metabolism.

Unclear.  Metabolic rates seem to recover with extended calorie restriction in
rodents; the animals just weigh less.  The extreme life extension in C.
elegans
from nutritional restriction and now some genetic manipulation does seem to 
involve metabolic changes.

> Is there any research about this?

Yes.  Exercised rodents have roughly the same life expectancy regardless of
calorie intake.  They have a slight benefit from CR, but only about 10% life
extension from 50% restriction.  Non-exercised rodents get
tremendous benefits from CR.  The most severely restricted rodents outlive
any exercised rodents by a substantial margin - 10 to 20%.  Moderately
restricted rodents - 30% CR - live about as long as the "exercised norm".

Realistically, then, I don't think you should consider exercise as providing
the benefits of CR.  The "exercised norm" is probably a normal healthy
life.  The point of CR is to do better than that.

Nothing in the monkeys, as yet.

Intuitively, global environmental impact of having a goodly fraction
of Sahara paved with a low-albedo material should not be so very
dramatic (but we oughta model that, right). Locally, terrific upwinds,
yes. Even more dramatic temperature delta between day and night, 
certainly. Some more heating up of large city cores due to 
exported heat, of course. However, this will be more than compensated 
by reductions of greenhouse gases, and a possibility to regreen, 
say, Sahara in the shades below PV panels/desalinators -- global
warming? which global warming? 

In any case does orbital PV microwaving power down to terrestrial
rectenna arrays appear preferable. Better highly localized EM smog 
(remember Waldo?), than L.A. photosmog, imnsho.

If at all, seasonally only. Notice that many of the areas you

centralization. 

 > [market economics don't apply to self-replicators] 

Uh, wrong. Unless you manage to supersede (uh, well, postpone) market 
economics by a Grand Extinction Event with Gray Goo nanoscale
autoreplicators, macroscopic autoreplicators are bottlenecked 
by energy, land, and neighbour good will. You can purchase and 
autoreplicator-tile a major test site in 3rd world country, but 
don't try this at home (do we have any extropians from 3rd world
countries???) . In a pinch, you'd get nuked. (Uh, I forgot: 
distributed uranium extraction from non-ores like granite and 
isotope enrichment in situ: grow your own).

You _could_ seed an asteroid/comet kernel, but, unless properly 
claimed (legislation will catch up very soon once the possibility 
of space development by autoreplicators has been demonstrated), 
many would interprete this as space piracy. (You could, probably
successfully, try to outrun the expansion of lawniks into space by
sending your panspermia nuclei far enough so they constitute a local
power the expanding 'civilization' front has to reckon with).

'too cheap too meter', eh? The only pluses of centralized power is
ease of administration and fuel efficiency. Of course if you make your
energy locally from fossils, you can couple thermals to power, which
is not feasible in large centralized power plants due to lossage (try
Moscow, Russia for a nice instance of a major energy bagbiter). 
Administration is not a problem today, since the advent of automation 
using digital electronics. The only problem is fuel monopoly, which 
only applies to fossil, not solar. The only reason against going solar
in the Southern U.S. is 1) large initial installation cost 2) yearly 
maintanance cost. Otoh, the resulting power is much cleaner (no 
spikes, glitches et al., no smog), and you're independant from remote,
politically instable countries (let the boys stay home). 


 > [ubiquitous autoreplicators]

A factory churning out PV panels and copies of itself in the flat
desert is one matter, an autoreplicator running amok in Silicon Valley
is another entirely. Once you have to adapt to a complex environment,
the task complexity and thus also system's jumps way up. The 
bottleneck in automation today is processing power, as our 
sensomotorics seems to be more than adequate. Since processing 
power equates to an advanced silicon foundry, complexity suddenly 
jumps up. 

 > [cheap rooftop power kits from autorep] 

With a fraction of the development costs to set up an autoreplicator
you can jolt the market into large enough numbers so that economy of 
scale can kick in. Otoh, we certainly need R&D investment into
autorep, specifically into space-capable autorep. (I think NASA has
really goofed that one up).

 > [component size is irrelevant. you will be assimilated]
 
I think the problem relates more to processivity/autorep grain size. Notice
that from a certain speed growth mechanism start do dominate: unless 
capable of spawning remote nuclei (requiring a yet another feature:
efficient transport), the best you get is a circular/spherical growth
propagation wave (due to volume/surface ratio material transport
thru-cell near surface will peak high enough to bottleneck). 
In any case, at the high end you'd be hard pressed out outrun your light cone ;)

Oh, sorry. 'NEAR CERTAINTY' appearing the second time in caps, now I am

I enjoy seeing this kind of sig line where you list your philosophies,
belief systems, world views, ideologies, current interests, pet
projects,  etc..  I think I'll make one up for myself. 
But............what is the deal with listing mutually exclusive items
like, for example, Christian extropian? Is there any significance to
why one is capitalized and the other isn't?  Is the disease,
schizophrenia or multiple personality syndrome legit? ;-) 

Just curious and not necessarily an attacker - don't mind the disease
joke, I couldn't help myself and that's probably a disease in itself ;-(

     Perseverence is the commitment to stay awake, to battle our
intertia, our lethargy, our desire for avoidance.  There is both a dreamer
and a sleepwalker in each of us.  The dreamer longs for moments of
ecstatic knowing and connection...The sleepwalker longs for safety and
status quo.  The dreamer prays to fulfill our lives at the deepest level.
The sleepwalker counter-prays that the trip is not too costly, too risky,
too threatening.  We know the tide has turned within us when it is more
frightening to be separated from the soul than to be separated from the
status quo...

Conventional economic *theory* seems more than adequate to 
analyse these sort of situations.  Thus one should be able
to understand what does or does not radically change "market
economics" by more carefully applying that theory to the 
novel assumptions you are interested in.  I challenge those
who believe in such radical change to do this.

Some comments:
1) It is not clear that demand can ever be "saturated." 
2) Your phrase "cost factors always originate in the labor 
   component of a product or service" sounds bogus.  The
   cost of land, for example, is very real.
3) A self-reproducing solar-array builder need not be at
   all close to something that can make anything.
4) The growth *rate* seems crucial.  Something that doubled
   every twenty years seems pretty uninteresting.

When it comes to the price of manufacturing RAM, DSPs, and Flat Panel 
displays, how much of that cost has to do with chip packaging, 
marketing, distribution, etc?

Is there a type of RAM that can be manufactured so that the entire 8" 
or 10" wafer can be used at once?  Is there some type of built in 
logic that can continuously check for bad memory regions, then route 
around them?  Kind of like a Thinking Machine on a wafer?

By skipping the ceramic mount portion of the packaging, would it be 
possible to make computer that have all of the ram, parallel DSPs, 
and flat display circuitry combined: all manufactured and assembled 
simultaneously in clean room facilities?

For example, see MicroDisplay (http://www.microdisplay.com/).  If 
these displays could be made the size of a Mead Notebook, with RAM 
and parallel DSPs all built into the same package, they could replace 
books, with excellent paper-like resolution.

Adding a flat battery and a radio (like a CDMA PCS cellphone with 
military GPS - see http://www.qualcomm.com/), with geographically 
variable spectrum allocation, they could be broadband books.

We could take the entire budget of the US Department of Education, 
and reallocate it to a manufacturing facility that produces these 
things.  

If we put a MEMS fisheye camera in every pixel, this could also 
double as a vanity mirror.

Uh, if you don't mind I would like to hear how you would like to
accomplish this especially at the low end of things (about 1 G$). A
time schedle (MMM taken into account) would be nice as well.

Also, the claim 'I could build' it would seem to become objectionable,
since you'd wind up more a glorified administrator than an
implementer. The superintelligence would then be the product of a
superorganism (team) than a single individual (Eliezer).

  N-acetylcysteine slows
  down ageing and increases the life span of Drosophila
  melanogaster.
Source
  Cellular & Molecular Life Sciences.  53(11-12):960-6, 1997 Dec.
Abstract
  Ageing can be defined as the time-dependent decline of physiological
  functions of an organism. The molecular causes for the ageing process are
  multiple, involving both genetic and environmental factors. It has been
  proposed that antioxidants may positively influence the ageing process,
  protecting the organism against free radical-induced damage. Here we show
  that the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has a
  life-extending effect on Drosophila melanogaster. Dietary uptake of NAC
  results in a dose-dependent increase in median and maximum life span. Flies
  fed on 1 mg/ml NAC food live 16.6% longer; at 10 mg/ml, life span increases
  by 26.6%. We have examined the effect of NAC treatment on protein and RNA
  levels: we observe an NAC-dependent increase in absolute amounts of total RNA
  and ribosomal RNA, but no differences in protein levels. The NAC effect on
  longevity may involve differential expression of specific mRNA genes, as
  suggested by RNA finger-printing experiments.

Title
  Silibinin, a plant extract
  with antioxidant and membrane stabilizing properties, protects exocrine
  pancreas from cyclosporin A toxicity.
Source
  Cellular & Molecular Life Sciences.  53(11-12):917-20, 1997 Dec.
Abstract
  Silymarin can be extracted from the milk thistle, and
  silibinin is the main component of the plant
  extract. Possibly due to their antioxidant and
  membrane-stabilizing properties, the compounds have been shown to protect
  different organs and cells against a number of insults. Thus liver, kidney,
  erythrocytes and platelets have been protected from the toxic effects of
  ethanol, carbon tetrachloride, cold ischemia and drugs, respectively. The
  effect of silibinin on endocrine and exocrine pancreas, however, has not been
  studied. We therefore investigated whether silibinin treatment attenuates
  cyclosporin A (CiA) toxicity on rat endocrine and exocrine pancreas. Groups
  of 15 male Wistar rats were treated for 8 days with CiA and/or silibinin. On
  day 9, endocrine and exocrine pancreatic functions were tested in vitro. At
  the end of the treatment period, blood glucose levels in vivo were
  significantly higher in rats treated with CiA while silibinin did not affect
  glucose levels. In vitro, insulin secretion was inhibited after treatment
  with silibinin, but amylase secretion was not affected.
  After treatment with CiA both insulin and amylase secretion were reduced.
  Silibinin and CiA had an additive inhibitory effect on insulin secretion, but
  silibinin attenuated CiA-induced inhibition of amylase secretion. Despite CiA
  treatment, amylase secretion was in fact restored to normal with the highest
  dose of silibinin. Thus silibinin inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin release
  in vitro, while not affecting blood glucose concentration in vivo. This
  combination of effects could be useful in the treatment of
  non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, silibinin protects the
  exocrine pancreas from CiA toxicity. As this inhibitory effect is probably
  unspecific, silibinin may also protect the exocrine pancreas against other
  insult principles, such as alcohol.

It is CR on alternative days, but not necessarily fasting, just CR.
Though I do fast for 1 day every month, 3 days every few months, 1 week 
every year, and eventually I'll fast for 1 month every year for a few 
years, but I am very relaxed and flexible with that schedule, so 
sometimes I'll go for shorter or longer times, depending on whatever my 
body tells me to do.
I go on CR every 2 weeks, eating about 1000 - 1500 Cal/day and taking 
the time to relieve stress and get serious about my research.
For the other 2 weeks I am a completely fanatical hedonist, bodybuilder, 
dancer, party animal, club hopper, and generally very active person who 
eats up to 3,000 Cal/day, without getting fat.
I've gained 10 lbs of pure muscle this year even though I've been 
through several fasts, about 10 for 1 day, 2 for 3 days, and 1 for a 
week.
I plan to have a liquid fast for a week sometime this winter.

If you know what you are doing, most of the health issues are extremely 
positive ones, but everything has it's ups and downs that need looking 
after.
I wholeheartedly recommend EVERYONE fast unless their doctor says 
otherwise.
You should all read up on it and find somebody to guide you if you need 
it.
If you feel like you can hack it, stop eating RIGHT NOW!
Fast for 24 hours and then have a nice plump hunk of meat, chock full of 
amino acids and dripping with juices to celebrate, but try to make it 
organic and cooked on low heat. :-)
Drink water, hyperventilate, meditate, watch movies, read, relax, keep 
entertained, spend some time at a friends house (except when they eat), 
and the day flys by.
Your organs will thank you for the rest.
It will clear up some insensitivites to varies substances (insulin, 
dopamine, norepinepherine, etc).
Pay attention to your body, before, during, and after (especially 30 
minutes after you eat).
It may teach you something.

Here's something to think about:
For the millions of years our ancestors hunted and gathered their food 
with claws and fangs, how many days a year did each go without dinner?
Now, are you sure eating 3 square meals a day for the rest of your life 
is the right thing to do?

I'm telling you people, cyclical CR is the way to go.
Change with the seasons, like your ancestors did.
It balances tolerances and intolerances to natural processes which could 
turn deadly, like insulin resistance.

I have been wanting to combine CR with suspended animation to try to 
learn how to hybernate, estivate, or enter torpor, but more truly I want 
to have a controlled Near Death Experience (NDE) so I can argue with 
people that say cryonics won't work because the soul leaves the body 
after death.
How will the counter when I show them medical documentation of my death?
Also, I've got a few vampire friends that would be impressed. ;^)
If you have any advice, I would appreciate getting it before I try any 
experiments.

OK, I've heared some high numbers when discussing the potential

Some people have claimed to be over 200.
Does anyone care to comment on this?

I preferred to call it: 
wake too late for breakfast and save lunch money.
You know, if you have to fast, the easiest time to do it is after a 
fast( sleep) because the fat stores are mobilized to prevent excessive 
gluconeogenesis (muscle wasting).

With training, your heart becomes a more efficient pump by becoming 
stronger and pumping more blood with each contraction, but exercise 
raises the metabolism so cells can be active enough to repair the 
damage.
Oxygen deficits could be useful, like changing red slow twitch muscle 
fibers, which run on oxygen, into white fast twitch muscle fibers, which 
run on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 
HI believe high intensity training (HIT) would be better for those would 
want to cycle exercise for a more extreme low metabolism phase.
Of course, I'm just speculating.
I've never heard anyone ever mention anything like this, and I've heared 
most of the best.
Maybe Torbjorn Akerfeldt or Art DeVany would know something about it.
They taught me the Anabolic Burst Cycle of Diet and Exercise system 
(ABCDE) and the Evolutionary Fitness and diet system.
Any way, exercise is good, *for some things*.

Certainly, that is very true.
By definition, fitness is resistance to death, 
whereas weight is just weight.

CR is about CR, why you do it is up to you.

Beyond the classical economics context, I think that is very well
possible. Albeit it is difficult to compare 'demands' from the
economical and ecological (say, tropical rainforest) domain, 
in the latter's case the material and energy streams are clearly 
finite (=stagnated at a high level). I think this is also 
applicable to any system with a finite matterenergy concentration, 
which fairly covers them all.

Obviously, spatial proximity is only relevant if the transportation
costs (which are very low nowadays) are significant in comparison to
the production costs. Albeit autoreplicators could amplify means
of production as well as of transportation, there are external
constant factors to account for, unless the autoreplicator colony 
has grown large and heterogenous enough to start dealing within itself.

Only if compared to things that are growing faster. Over astronomical
time scales, a doubling rate of /20 a is certainly enormous. Whether
atoms, or grains of rice on the chessboard, on the long run the
outcome is the same.

This is a really good, and really complicated, question. Because
of an absurd time crunch I'm currently under, I will break

regrets, and point you to a recent discussion in
Sci.life-extension on this (Rule #4: Don't call Rule #3 "Image

http://x14.dejanews.com/getdoc.xp?AN=408207211.1&CONTEXT=910378771.677576897&hitnum=13

(As it happens Deja News cut this article right where stuff
unrelated to CR begins, so no need to get Segment #2.)

That article (and others in the thread) relates directly to
aerobic exercise. For bulking-up, there's been little direct
research done. But there's an indirect connection, of course. If
Holloszy's recent finding holds up, it means that keeping your
body in a state of getting less food than it wants is all that
matters in CR. So you could definitely run, but the "getting less
food than it wants" under a bulking-up regimen would be somewhat
different.

But even with aerobic exercise, I still have my doubts. How many
life-long marathoners make it past 90? Very, very few. Their
AVERAGE life span is above the norm, of course, since they're
much less likely to get heart attacks (and slightly less likely
to die of other ailments). I'm going to wait for more research
before training for a marathon, myself.

Anyone got any rats? A little extra cash to buy some rats? We
should be able to run a simple experiment to test this.

Of course, how do you get rats to life weights? Running wheels
they naturally love. But a reward might be required for
resistance exercise. And rewards are usually food, ergo....

Ack! How many different places does Doug post this nonsense?
Jeez.

Everything Doug Skrecky has ever posted on CR, or the relation
between weight and mortality has been wrong in virtually every
way it could be.

Sorry if this is harsh. People with incorrect views should be
treated gently, at first. But after the 2nd, then 3rd, then
4th,... time that you correct someone (and LOTS of other people
correct him), and he keeps posting the exact same arguments,
NEVER responding to ANY of the criticism, there is clearly
sufficient evidence that politeness is not going to do the trick.
(And there is evidence to warrant a suspicion of something
devious in the person: supplement-pushing, for example, in the
case of anti-CR arguments.)

Plus, lives are at stake.

Here's a copy (sorry again for spiting Rule #3!) of a response of
mine to iteration 14 or so of Doug's argument. It's from a few
months ago, or maybe decades. I don't know. It's the same every
time, either way.

Doug, try to think a bit more carefully about possibly
confounding variables before you make claims like the above.

A bit of logic may be useful. You're saying:
1) If A then B;
2) B; ==>
3) Conclude (via a "strong suggestion"): A.

This is fallacious. If (2) is A, then you can (3) conclude B,
yes, but not the other way around. Think of some simple examples
if you don't understand; it's pretty obvious once you think about
it.

Filling in the variables for the case at hand: 1) If someone is
doing Calorie Restriction, s/he is thin (it is strongly suggested
-- I think this is where you intend your qualification to go); 2)
We have a group of people who are thin; 3) Therefore they are
doing CR. (And, therefore, since these thin people aren't living
longer than anyone else -- this, by the way, is WRONG -- CR
doesn't retard aging in humans.)

This is not valid. (Also, as to soundness, someone with a very
high set-point could do CR and not be thin at all.)

Perhaps your thinking is rather this: 1) if someone is thin,
they're doing CR; 2) We have a group ....

Here the problem wouldn't be one of logic, but rather of a fatal
lack of facts. It's hard to imagine that this is your problem
here, but in case it is, a few relevant points follow.

Thinness can be caused by FR (mere food restriction), not CR.
Very poor people, for example, are thin because they aren't
eating enough food. Malnutrition decreases longevity. You
wouldn't contest this, right?

A far more important category of people who are thin for reasons
other than the practicing of CR is people who have sub-clinical
illness. There are _millions_ of them, according to most
epidemiologists. To consider just one of the many types of
disease that can go undiagnosed, consider celiac sprue. This is a
disease of the small intestine (the jejunum) the effects of which
are triggered by a protein in wheat (and possibly in other
grains). The disease results in weight loss. It is often not
diagnosed (_far_ more often than not, in many countries) until
years after the disease process itself begins. Then there's
Crohn's disease, colitis, etc. (See Acta Paediatr 1995
Jun;84(6):672-676, for one of many studies dealing with
undiagnosed celiac sprue.)

And here's yet another serious problem. First, to recap: we so
far have two groups of thin people who aren't doing CR: 1) those
with undiagnosed illness, and 2) those who are malnourished
(people doing FR). But there's a third, very, very big group:
people who are naturally thin.

Doug, are you aware that people vary greatly in "set-point"?
"Naturally" thin people in most cases (close to all cases, I'd
guess) aren't doing CR, they're just disposing of Calories
differently from "naturally" fat people. I'm using scare-quotes
because some of this is nurture, not nature.

Let's, then, consider one aspect of nurture in body weight. There
is a huge social force that compels people to eat less: the
notion that being fat is ugly (or uncool, or bad is some other
way). So who are the people who are going to feel compelled to
change their diet because of this social pressure? The naturally
overweight. The naturally thin will just keep stuffing themselves
(and will remain thin). Stuffing oneself is not CR. Clear, yes?

And if the naturally thin are naturally thin because they have a
higher metabolism, then maybe they're aging faster then the
naturally fat would be if the naturally fat controlled their
diets somewhat (if a high metabolism generates more free
radicals, etc., etc.).

So, in point of fact, the epidemiological issues here are far too
complicated even to begin to try to make suggestions about a CR
effect in humans, let alone "strong" suggestions. (And the
logical connections among the variables are complicated, too --
well, actually, they're not complicated, but, in any case, you
appear to have gotten them wrong.)


Is anyone out there taking Doug seriously? I don't have time to
correct all his mistakes. I hope that by pointing out a few,
people will realize that, however nice a guy Doug may be, he
doesn't understand science well enough to be able to support his
claims. I would be horrified if someone stopped doing CR because
of his articles. (And if he is a Chromium salesman, someone
should arrest him.)


Doug, I'm willing to help you. If you want to send your articles
to me before you post them, I'd be happy to discuss them with
you. But you might as well get someone with more experience than
I to proof them for you. As I said before, if you're in
Vancouver, I suggest popping by the office hours of one of the
many researchers in the area. There's no reason to feel shame in
needing the help of others.

And, finally: Doug, you have a lot of energy to put into
anti-aging efforts. It's partly because of this noble aspect of
your character that it's important that you learn more about
science, and about interpreting scientific studies. With more
training or experience, we could take your posts (including those
on your fly studies) seriously, and then you could have a great,
positive influence on the world.

Good luck,
Brian.

Most commercial grade IC's are plastic encapsulated, not ceramic.  A
lot of IC's are available from the manufacturer packageless, as raw
die.  The cost differential is not substantial.  The plastic
encapsulation provides protection from mechanical damage to the die
and encapsulates the bonding wires that allow a more macroscopic
connection to the outside world.  Epoxy cure time (baking at ~85 deg
C) is often something a line manager will cheat on to bring up profits.

I think you are confusing supply with demand.  You describe a 
case where supply is finite, but this doesn't mean demand 
is saturated.  If you expanded that domain, the animals would
expand as well, demonstrated that their demand for territory
is *not* saturated.

Yes, I was comparing them to the world economy, which is growing
faster.  To us, a slower growing process which starts nearby 
and starts much smaller is just not interesting.

I'd like to have one of these paperless books/videophones/roving 
wireless routers.  My guess is that if we pooled engineering 
resources and collectively decided to get it done ASAP, it could be 
accomplished in high volume.

MEMS key signature signed wireless packets make for a great broadband 
infrastructure, but eventually, for security purposes, it may be 
necessary to have lots and lots and lots of fiber to support the 
computing infrastructure necessary to simulate real systems with 
atomic precision.

For that reason, we may still have a need for labor.

If the Earth is Federalized and each citizen is awarded a paperless 
allowance of the U.S. equivalent of $58,000/year, what incentive is 
there for laborers to burn calories?

Particularly if they are enjoying home hi-fi in a hemp-induced 
complacent state?

Cocaine or Crystal Meth could be used as incentives for the worker 
labor caste, I'd imagine.  What sorts of problems would this cause or 
solve?

Flat panel displays differ from semiconductors. for semiconductors,
a large part ofthe cost is in the manufacturing facility (the "fab")
Currently, a ne fab costs about 2 billion $US. This fab has a
leading-edge lifetime of about 1.5 to 2 years. If it produces
10 million chips per month, the plant's cost will contribute
$8.00 to the cost of each chip with no interest.

Packaging is another addtional cost. Typically, the wafer is cut into
"dice" at the fab and then shipped to the packaging factory. 
This one is currently being worked on. There are new techniques that
can use typical fab-compatible processes to add metal leads and
epoxy covering to the wafer prior to cutting it, thus eliminating
the need for a separate packaging house. The resulting itty-bitty
devices, called "chip-scale packages" or CSPs, have micro-BGA leads
instead of pins. These require new printed circuit manufacturing
techniques.

This approach is called "wafer-scale integration." It was heavily
touted and researched by a company called (as I recall) "Trillium"
in the mid-80's. The company failed after spending great gobs of
money. (Wafers are now measured in mm. Current generation is 200mm
or about 8". New generation is 400mm or about 12". Remenber when
disks were 14" and wafers were 2"?) One drawback with wafer-scale
integration is that a current-generation wafer costs about $500.

Flat-panel displays don't use wafer-processing processes. More
subtly, logic processes (DSPs, etc.) are quite different than
memory processes even though both are wafer-based. There is a whole
lot of current activity to bring these together, but it isn't easy.
You can build memory with logic processes or logic with memory processes,
but only at a huge loss in density, power effiency, or both.

Probably easier to use a CCD or the newer CMOS camera technology, to
reduce the complexity of the lens system.

If you want to get excited about new electronics technologies, try the
following:
   --purely plastic devices made from  plastic insulators, conductors,
and semiconductors. Even if these are bigger and slower, the substrate
costs pennies instead of hundreds of dollars, The fab costs
$100,000 instead of $2billion, and the result is stackable, which
regains most of the density lost to semiconductors.
   --multi-layered semiconductor packaging. This is (sort of) an
extension of CSP (see above) to make the wafers a whole lot thinner
and then bond them together.
   --spherical dice. This is too weird and I don't really get it, but
one manufacturer is trying to build semicoinductors using a substrate

Although the transition to 300mm Si is in progress now,it is  slowed by the
recent slump in the semiconductor business.   200mm will be around a looooong
time as it will be profitable to make certian types of devices on the older
equipment.  [Even 150 mm fabs are still making some older style but still
useful devices.   Hell, I work in a 100 mm fab, but we still get to do some
additional interesting micromachining work... ].  

Despit the remanent smaller sizes, there has been talk, and even some serious
crystal growth work, and calculations for 400mm wafers.  [The effect of Dan's
conversion blunder is hearby slightly obscured]  The capital costs in these
fabs can run in the 2-10 billion dollar range for state of the art.  A single
process tool can easiliy be in the 1-6 million dollar range. 
This is  an important technology area left to the competition of only a few of
the largest corporations that can afford these investments.  This leads to an
inherent conservatism and bottom line mentality perhaps?!?!? The revolutionary
ideas are harder to develop in universities unless they ally with a big
company to get access to the latest equipment.

One flaw in the spherical semiconductors.  Certian devices are made on the
<100> surface of Si, and others on the <111> surface.  When oxidized, the 111
surface has higher surface charged defect density, making it less suitable for
good MOS circuits.  

By definition shpere must have multiple crystal orientations on it's surface.
A real fundamental practical problem.  I like Dan's stuff on the cheap, slabs-
o-plastic chip approach.  We need a good science fiction story to explore the
implications of this ! 

There is  (or was) the multichip module approach (MCM).  Bare (no plastic or
ceramic chip package) die are bonded to a very high density interconnect. The
MCM was made with the same technology as chips a few generations back with
thick copper lines  of the 10-20 micrometer width range.   The market did not
really take off and only a few companies are left in it. Micro Module Systems,
a spin off from DEC is still credible.

Title
  alpha-Tocopheryl hemisuccinate
  administration increases rat liver subcellular alpha-tocopherol levels and
  protects against carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatotoxicity.
Source
  Toxicology Letters.  92(1):67-77, 1997 Jun 16.
Abstract
  Rats were administered a series of tocopherol analogs 18 h prior to a
  hepatotoxic dose of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Of the compounds tested,
  only d-alpha-tocopheryl hemisuccinate (TS)
  provided significant protection against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity. No
  protection was observed with either d-alpha-tocopherol (alpha-T) or a
  tocopherol succinate ether derivative,
  d-alpha-tocopheryloxybutyric acid (TSE). None of the
  tocopherol analogs significantly inhibited CYP2E1 activity as measured by
  oxidation of p-nitrophenol. Liver homogenates and subcellular fractions
  (cytosol, nuclei, plasma membranes, mitochondria and microsomes) were
  collected 18 h after tocopherol analog administration in the absence of CCl4.
  Homogenate and subcellular alpha-T levels were not significantly increased
  following TSE administration but were increased 2-3 fold following TS and
  alpha-T administration. Total tocopherol levels (alpha-T+ TS + TSE) in liver
  homogenates and subcellular fractions were highest in rats supplemented with
  TS. In these animals, TS was detected in all subcellular fractions and total
  tocopherol levels were increased from 6-23 fold over those seen in controls
  and 2-9 fold over alpha-T treated rats. In vitro studies in which liver
  homogenates and subcellular fractions were peroxidized with ascorbate and
  ADP/Fe suggest that increasing levels of alpha-T but not TS correlates with
  increased protection against lipid peroxidation. These results suggest that
  the ability of TS to protect against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity relates to
  its enhanced hepatic accumulation and subsequent hydrolysis to alpha-T.

Title
  The selective antiproliferative effects of alpha-tocopheryl

  on murine leukemia cells result from the action of the intact compounds.
Source
  Cancer Research.  54(13):3346-51, 1994 Jul 1.
Abstract
  In the present study we have established that the antitumor activity of
  alpha-tocopheryl succinate (TS, vitamin E succinate) and
  cholesteryl succinate (CS) result from the action of the intact TS and CS
  compounds and not from the release of alpha-tocopherol, cholesterol, or
  succinate. We report that treatment of murine leukemia cell lines C1498
  (myeloid) and L1210 (lymphocytic), with the tris salts of TS or CS, but not
  alpha-tocopherol and tris succinate or cholesterol and tris succinate,
  significantly inhibit the growth of these tumor cells and significantly
  enhance doxorubicin-induced tumor cell kill in a similar fashion. In
  contrast, the treatments mentioned above did not adversely affect the growth
  of murine normal bone marrow cells (colony-forming
  unit-granulocyte-macrophage). In fact, colony-forming unit
  granulocyte-macrophage cell growth was stimulated by exposure to CS and TS
  (as well as their ether analogues) at concentrations above 100 microM.
  Furthermore, pretreatment of colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage cells
  with TS or CS appears to protect these normal cells from the lethal effect of
  doxorubicin exposure. Selective inhibition of leukemia cell proliferation
  (identical to that noted for CS and TS) was also observed following the
  treatment of cells with the nonhydrolyzable ether forms of CS
  (cholesteryloxybutyric acid) and TS
  (alpha-tocopheryloxybutyric acid). These findings suggest
  that TS, alpha-tocopheryloxybutyric acid, CS, and
  cholesteryloxybutyric acid may prove clinically useful as selective antitumor
  agents when administered alone or in combination with doxorubicin by a route
  that ensures tissue accumulation of the intact compound.

I agree with Kathryn that transhumanists should be vitally concerned about the
misogynist policies of Islamic fundamentalists (and most religions, for that
matter -- consider the appalling treatment of widows even today in Hindu India
and the "obedient wife" prescriptions of traditional, mainstream
Christianity).  Transhumanism is about liberation; ultimately, liberation from
the limits of the biological human form.  

The Taliban make my blood boil.  When I see stories about what they are doing,
I want to pack up my arsenal and ship it to women in Afghanistan, along with a
crate of feminist literature.  But then I realize that the sort of memetic
action on this side of the knowledge wall the Taliban are building that
Kathryn mentioned is about all we can do for now.

The relatively near future, though, may hold the promise for something more:

This is something I've been thinking about for a long time.  How do we help
people like women in Afghanistan, or peasants in Indonesia, or all of the rest
of the folks who are cut off from the information revolution?  I've envisioned
a technology that could help, something I call a "Brain Seed".  Imagine a
network terminal with an embedded satellite modem.  The device is built simple
and tough -- as much one piece of solid-state electronics as possible, and the
hard-wired communications software is built to be maximally tamper-resistant.
Also hard-wired into it is a curriculum of basic literacy, from the picture-
book level on up.  With the operation of Moore's Law and advancing material
science, such devices could be made very cheaply in 15-20 years.  Now, make
billions of these things and make them available to any organization that
wants to distribute them, at a minimal profit.  Include them with aid
packages.  Smuggle them into any country that prohibits them.  Air drop them
-- hell, air drop them from robot aircraft . . .  Better yet, eventually make
them in a form that IS a robot aircraft so that they become self-delivering.
Saturate the planet with them.  Then see what happens. . .

I don't understand Islam or Islamic politics very well, but bad as they are
the Taliban may not be the worst threat to women or to transhumanity.
As I understand it, Islam is divided into the Shi'a (Shiite) branch,
spiritually based in Iran, and the Sunni branch, Spiritually based in
Saudi Arabia. The division is older than the protestant/catholic division.
Both branches have fundamentalists and moderates, but on the whole, the
Shi'a branch is more fundamentalist as seen by "westerners" and is
certainly more evangelical. It's also more clearly the insturment of
state policy of a dangerous state (Iran). The problem is that the Taliban,
while being fundamentalist extremists, are also Sunni, and overthrow of
the Taliban will very likely lead to the rise of a fundamentalist Shi'a
faction backed by Iran. This is unlikely to help the Afgan women very
much at all.

I would deeply appreciate corrections to this post by any historians,
Islamic scholars, or international experts out there. Also note that,
as Greg said, from the transhumanist point of view religious fundamentalists
of any type are more similar to each other than to their more moderate
co-religionists.

No, but the above implication isn't a very good argument.  I could make
the same argument about sprained ankles:

For the hundreds of thousands of years our more recent ancestors hunted
and gathered their food without good footwear, how many times each year
did they sprain their ankles?  Now, are you sure that wearing sturdy
footwear for the rest of your life is the right thing to do?

I'm not saying CR is bad; some of the other data posted to this list
about CR is very interesting.  But the above argument is... less than
compelling.

Yeah, spike, but 300mm is a basic part of my life. It's the
distance light travels in a nanosecond: a light-nanosecond is
about one foot, and is 300mm to six decimal places.

I can never directly remember the miles-to-kilometers conversions,
but I can remember the speed of light in Km (300,000 Km/s) and 
in miles (186,000 mi/s), both numbers good to six places. Therefore,
one Km equals .62 mi. Simple.

Iran has a very poor record, but the Taliban is undeniably worse. Women in
Iran are allowed to work and leave the house, vote, and hold political
office. One branch of Islam may have a more fundementalist rhetoric then the
other, but in practice, the Taliban is much, much worse. They have their own
web page (www.taliban.com) and you can read articles on there like "why
women must be kept indoors". The position of women in Iran is maybe
something like the position of black americans in the mid 1960s. The
position of women in Afghanistan is like the position of black americans in
the 1820s.

This could give all the soldiers something to do with all their spare 
time.  They could transfer their calorie-burning efforts from 
training maneuvers to home construction.

We can give Ford, Chrysler, Honda, Toyota, Subaru, Mercedes-Benz, 
Volvo, Mazda, Hyundai the contracts for the shuttles.

Replacing the transportation system with automated lightweight 
shuttles will require taking the old steel cars and melting them 
down.  Then we can injection mold small driverless hybrid 
flywheel/electric motor driven computer navigated shuttles.

We can take the steel and use it in steel framed houses.

See http://www.biznet1.com/cons001.htm

Does anyone know the logistics requirements of converting cars into 
raw steel, then moving large numbers of people out of apartments and 
into low and medium density steel framed homes?

I wonder what the insurance rate on a computer controled car is going to be?
Do I as a passive rider (no longer a driver) need to have insurance?

I'm not convinced this is economically feasible.  To the best of my
understanding, the cost of buying up the cars, building the shuttles and
installing a computer that can not only drive passengers to their
destinations but can also *understand where the passengers want to go*
would thoroughly kill whatever profitability you had in mind.

However, I may be wrong, in which case, I reccomend that you try it and
see.  :)

>We can take the steel and use it in steel framed houses.

As for this, if it's profitable, then go try it.  If your plan depends on
the profitability of this cars -> shuttles plan to pay for the raw steel,
however, it's probably doomed to fail, IMO.

>Does anyone know the logistics requirements of converting cars into 
>raw steel, then moving large numbers of people out of apartments and

... but then, the way you're phrasing this it doesn't sound like you're
keen on doing this through market means at all.

If you can make steel-framed homes cheap, then you shouldn't have to
concern yourself with the logistics of moving people around.  People will
gladly pay you for your steel-enforced houses and move *themselves* into
your houses.

in all these cases, the key to the destruction of opressive memes is in
reaching the young women.  the older women have less to gain, the
men often have much to lose, and most importantly, the young women
teach the children.  those who spread religious memes in this country
have learned this lesson well.  spike

Putting aside the ultra-extreme practises of the Taliban for a moment
consider closer to hand the killing of U.S. doctors willing help women have
abortions. Coming from a country where there is virtually on moral stigma
associated with abortions the continued killings of American doctors seems
to be on a par with the ultra-crazies in Afghanastan. Gunning down a
middle-aged doctor in front of his children because he was pro choice is
about as barbaric and anti-transhumanist as you can go.

If the "lightweight shuttle is an autonomous vehicle, you will need
at least ten year's more development berore it's viable on a "dumb" road
system. If it's not autonomous, you are looking at a major infrastructure
change, which will also take at least ten years. This is in addition
to the infrasctuctural changes needed for power. In either case, you
are likely to be overtaken by events.

Soldiers (at least, in the US) are trained professionals, and they don't
have all that much free time. The idea that a soldier is untrained or
easily-trained cannon-fodder has been growing less and less valid since
at least the end of the Napoleonic wars, and is completely inapplicable to
the modern US army. If you cut back on tarining time, you'll need more
soldiers to achieve the same level of readiness. We've been tryihg hard
to go the other way: fewer, better-trained soldiers.

They could bid for the contracts, but they may not have the right
skills. Depends on the system-level architecture for the entire
concept, not just the cars.

More generally, your proposal as stated appears to require a
massive, centralized project. That's a bit hard to do in a
democracy. Could you please describe your concept of the
organization of this project?

dan im suggesting the elimination of english measurements.  i proposed
it to the engineering society to which i belong in a technical paper several
years ago, but the suggestion fell on deaf ears. perhaps english measures
will
be one of those memes, like taliban and other oppressive  religious systems,

	In light of discussion relating to the Taliban and Islam, I would

extropians do to overcome the political movements which hinder extropian
and libertarians ideals, and what can we do to help and encourage those
movements which help us?
	Does anyone think the answer lies in political activism or does it

As a professional truck driver it appears to me that would be an improvement
over the  presently existing situation.  It wouldn't even require a lot of
programming.  You wouldn't beleive what I see on a regular basis from
automobile drivers.....and sadly....some truckers.....no computer could be so
stupid.

My take: work on the tech.  If you've got an illegal technology that people
want to use, it will find its way into use regardless of the law.  Cool
technology, IMO, has a kind of galvanizing effect re: optimism and
self-improvement.  The luddites will adapt given time.

I think both political activism and ignoring unjust laws is good. People who
I admire politically are Larry Flynt, Dr. Kervorkian, and Dr. Richard Seed
(Seed only if he accomplishes what he is trying to do).. they respond to
unjust laws by breaking them, very flagrantly. That is the best thing to do
- break a law as soon as it is enacted, do it very publicly, do it day after
day, do it with a lot of press coverage, and do it in a way that costs them
as much money as possible.
I do not think violent militia solutions will do much. Especially since
we're in the minority.. most people are actually pretty stupid, and if it
becomes a test of force between stupidity and intelligence, stupidity will
win simply because there are more of them to apply the force. 
The best solution to the Taliban problem in particular would be to 1) help
individual people get out and 2) try to get subversive information in.
Feminist literature, atheist literature, as well as just really shocking
offensive pornographic type stuff to desensitize them a bit. One way to do
this might be to tie little books to baloons and let them float into
Afghanistan. Does the Taliban have a figure-head who is to them what
Khomeini was to Iran? Someone to ridicule?

Actually, I wasn't think about it from a "democracy" standpoint.

I was considering it more from the following standpoint:

Human beings are in a state of tension and stress in petroleum 
economy scarcity economics.  They keep reproducing, leaving more 
humans with even fewer resources.  However, information appliances 
are growing less expensive, so these "worker class" humans will soon 
have access to "ruling class" coordination capabilities.

In order to reduce this stress, we can completely eliminate the 
entire petroleum economy in one global top down replacement of 
leadership memesets.  Not that the actual leaders will change, just
that their controlling memesets will be replaced through nonlethal
means.

The petroleum economy cannot be incrementally phased out.  The 
information economy is growing too quickly, and without massive 
deliberate intervention, there will come a point when available 
weapons design information will collide with petroleum economy 
tension, resulting in large scale conflict.

The solution is to approach the petroleum economy as a "game" that is
no longer enjoyable to the majority of players, and that can be
replaced with a different game, using "all necessary means".

The shift need not be painful.  It can be entertaining, relaxing, and
enjoyable.   Bottom line: the cars go.

Well, gee.  When you put it that way...  ;)

So, let me get this straight: if we don't switch to an authoritarian gov't
that literally opiates the masses (or barbiturates, or
crystal-methamphetimates the masses) and organizes everything from the top
down, people are going to to get smart enough to build horrible weapons,
and then people are gonna USE those weapons and blow us all up.

In short, if we don't adopt a dictatorship/oligarchy soon, the world's
going to end.

Allow me to raise the point that if you're wrong about your predictions,
that adopting such a system would be Bad(tm).  Much worse than what we've
got now.  Economically, top down structures just don't work as efficiently
as bottom-up markets do.  Logistically, huge portions of the intelligence
of the world will go untapped as people become completely alienated from
their incentives.  And ethically?  Well, I happen to be a utilitarian/
libertarian.  Maybe I won't even bother to open this can of worms here.

If you're right about your predictions, (and you'd have a hard time
convincing me of this in the first place,) then I don't think a top-down
economy is going to fix things.  You see, in a top-down hierarchy, those
who find their way to the top are those who want to be at the top.  Those
who want to be at the top and have powerful weapons at their fingertips may
be inclined to use them.  If the rest of the sheeple are unarmed, then the
rulers will feel no repercussion whatsoever over misuse of these weapons.
In short, whatever it is that you think is going to blow us all up will do
so eventually; maybe faster than would happen in a market-oriented society.
 Maybe not.  Either way, the total obliteration of humankind would be
inevitable.  The longevity we transhumanists are striving for would be
utterly pointless, and we'd all die.

To sum up:
If you're right but we don't listen to you, we die.
If you're right and we listen to you, we die.
If you're wrong and we don't listen to you, life is (relatively) good.
If you're wrong but we listen to you anyway, life sucks a lot.

Transhumanists have an interesting take on these "end of the world"
scenarios, no?

Not all, just the memeset carriers who insist on paying taxes and are 
unable to be reprogrammed into enjoying freedom and liberty.  Mr. 
Veteran refuses to give up HIS (Host Indentification Syndrome) and 
cannot stand the thought of his HAM Radio frequencies being used by 
Libertarian digital microcellular.  He falls asleep and wakes up in a 
VR simulation.  His 4x4 and Gun Collection get melted.

Ethics?  It's unethical to rearrange the atoms in coffee beans to 
make expresso.  Unfair to the poor weak chemical bonds that insist on 
remaining in the bean state.  Fried chicken?  Steak?  Pork Chops?

Agreed.  But to dismantle the top down hierarchy in a nonviolent way, 
you need to work from the top down.  Kind of like a dissolution of 
big brother starting at the top.  The King says "servant, YOU WILL be 
free now, but first tell your servants to pass the message on down 
the hierarchy".

Not necessarily total oblivion, just replacing evolution with 
designed outlasting of human form.  Why is it that anthropologists 
have such a hard time tracing human evolution back on the tree of 
life?  Maybe we get to a point where our intelligence outgrows our 
natural forms, then we clean up the mess, upload to nano-scale 
distribute forms watching vicariously through the next evolutionary 
outgrowth.  Remove all evidence of technology, then watch through the 
eyes of squirrels are monkeys, waiting to see who gets nanotechnology 
next.  Then, right before that species gets nano, we intervene, 
upload, and eliminate all evidence of that species' existence.  
(Leaving small traces and clues in the literature and mythologies).

> To sum up:

Correct.

> If you're right and we listen to you, we die.

Incorrect.  You get to reach nanotechnology, and enjoy interplanetary 
travel and immortality.  You get to join "The Watchers" and patiently 
sculp the evolution of the next species.

> If you're wrong and we don't listen to you, life is (relatively) good.

Well, maybe a compromise: we could make an industry of swapping the 
gasoline burning engines with non-polluting engines, then retrofit 
the cars with autopilot systems that operate when these heavy steel 
vehicles are operating in proximity of lightweight hybrid 
flywheel/electric motor driverless shuttles.  We can't have heavy 
human controlled cars sharing the roads with lightweight electric 
cars.  It's understandable how people are attached to the feeling of 
control that a steering wheel, break pedal, and accelerator pedal 
produces.  However, human control can't be permitted on automated 
shuttle based transportation systems.  Rather than retrofit, it's 
probably easier to scrap the human controlled gasoline burning 
vehicles, then replace them with electric cars.

For those who are so attached to controlling their cars that they 
won't go free without a fight, we can bribe them with hydrogen or 
alcohol burning systems that have both autopilot and human control 
modes.  Then they can stock up on water or alcohol when they feel 
like they might need to "head for the hills". ;)

> If you're wrong but we listen to you anyway, life sucks a lot.

Only if you listen to *me* only.  There are plenty of people out 
there to listen to in addition to me. 

> Transhumanists have an interesting take on these "end of the world"

Yeah.

You forget that a biological body oxidizes oxygen from the air. A fuel cell
with a supply of fuel and oxidizer will have a higher energy density.

- From www.sciencedaily.com posted Oct 6 1998

- -BUFFALO, N.Y. -- The pictures that accompany a University at Buffalo paper in
this week's issue of Science show what looks like an exquisitely uniform
field of wheat, or a close-up of a neatly trimmed "buzz cut."
In fact, the perfectly even rows of tall, skinny, carbon nanotubes represent
a major advance that brings researchers much closer to developing the flat
panel displays that one day will make it possible to hang your TV or computer
monitor on the wall like a picture.
Flat panel products currently on the market, such as laptop computers, are
based on technologies that cannot produce the excellent viewing angles and
high resolution that carbon nanotubes will make possible.
The technical advances made by the UB team are precisely those that will help
make flat panel displays made with carbon nanotubes affordable.
"We have made three major achievements," said Zhifang Ren, Ph.D., UB research
associate professor of physics and chemistry, and first author. "Our
nanotubes are beautifully aligned, they grow at relatively low temperatures
and they are grown on glass."
Glass is the preferred material for monitors, costing only a few dollars as
compared to several hundred dollars for silicon-based materials, which would
make the cost of flat panel display products prohibitive.
Carbon nanotubes are actually tiny, elongated, tubular versions of C60, the
soccer ball-shaped molecule also known as the "buckyball."
What makes them so tantalizing is their incredible strength, at least 100-
1,000 times stronger than the strongest steel available, Ren explained, along
with their very-high stability and excellent electron-emission capabilities.
The combination makes them ideal for use in flat panel displays.
"In a conventional television, a high-voltage electron gun is constantly in
motion, bombarding each pixel on the screen, and that's what gives you your
picture," Ren explained. "But in order to have enough room for the gun to
scan the whole length and breadth of the screen, you need about a foot." That
gives televisions and computer monitors their unwieldy bulk. Flat panel
displays, on the other hand, need less than a millimeter of space between the
carbon nanotubes, which act as the electron emitters, and the phosphor
screen.
"With these displays, because each pixel is an electron source, there is no
need for scanning and therefore no need for that distance between the
electron source and the screen."
But technical problems have prevented flat panel displays from advancing to
the development stage.
"We know from earlier work on carbon nanotubes that electrons come out only
from the tip of each tube, not from the sides," said Ren. "Therefore, it is
necessary to have all the nanotubes positioned exactly perpendicular to the
substrate on which they are grown. If the alignment is not good, then you
cannot obtain good electron-emission properties."
Previously published work on carbon nanotubes has shown poor alignment, with
nanotubes, in some cases, resembling jumbled strands of spaghetti. Previous
work also involved growing carbon nanotubes on materials other than glass,
which was necessary because of the high temperatures required for the
synthesis of the nanotubes.
To use glass as the substrate, synthesis temperatures have to be below 650
degrees Centigrade, the point at which glass begins to deform.
"Our work shows that large arrays of well-aligned carbon nanotubes can be
grown on anything, so long as the substrate can take temperatures of 650 C,"
explained Ren.
He believes that the reason the nanotubes produced by the UB researchers grew
at such comparatively low temperatures is the use of ammonia, instead of
nitrogen, during the synthesis.
"For the first time, we found ammonia acting as a catalyst," he said. "I
think that this helps the disassociation of acetylene, which is necessary
during the synthesis of the carbon nanotubes."
Carbon nanotubes have many other applications, from components in energy-
storage devices to super-strong cables.
The UB researchers also are investigating the possibility of using nanotubes
in scanning tunneling microscopes to enhance resolution.
The paper's co-authors are visiting scholar Zhongping Huang; Jui H. Wang,
Ph.D., Einstein Professor of Science, and Jianwei Xu, doctoral candidate in
the UB Department of Chemistry, all in the UB Materials Synthesis Laboratory,
and Peter J. Bush, director of the UB Instrumentation Center. Other co-
authors are Michael Siegal and Paula Provencio at Sandia National Laboratory,
who provided transmission electron microscope characterization

For those of you interested in cryogenics, a very interesting article from
New Scientist.

http://www.newscientist.co.uk/cgi-bin/pageserver.cgi?/ns/981107/nretina.html


Putting life on hold

Jon Copley 


taking a tip from tiny animals that can live for more than a century,
Japanese researchers have invented a new technique for storing human organs
for transplant. 

The team, which has successfully revived a rat's heart after 10 days in
storage, says the work may lead to organ banks similar to blood banks.
These would allow doctors to avoid the frantic dash to bring suitable
organs straight from donors to the operating table. 

Organs can usually be stored for only 30 hours before they have to be used.
For hearts and lungs, the time limit is even less--just 4 hours. The main
problem with keeping organs in cold storage is that water damages cell
membranes at low temperatures. Unfortunately, removing water from tissues
usually causes at least as much damage. 

But Kunihiro Seki and his colleagues at Kanagawa University in
Hiratsuka-shi, Japan, knew that animals called tardigrades can withstand
extreme conditions by losing most of the water in their bodies (In Brief,
31 October, p 26). They can survive in this state for a century or more.
When water was added to a dried-out moss kept in a museum for 120 years,
tardigrades were later found crawling all over it. 

To achieve this feat, tardigrades use a sugar called trehalose to stabilise
the structure of their cell membranes. "This suggested that the
physiological mechanism for preservation and resuscitation of tardigrades
could be applied to the preservation of mammalian organs," says Seki. 

To test this, the team flushed rat hearts with trehalose solution before
packing them in silica gel to remove the water from their cells. The hearts
were then immersed in perfluorocarbon, a biologically inert compound, and
stored at 4 C in airtight jars. Ten days later, the team took the hearts
out of the jars and resuscitated them. Within half an hour, they were
beating again. Measurements of their electrical activity suggested that the
heart cells had survived intact. 

Seki believes that the trehalose and perfluorocarbon replace the water in
the cells, preventing tissue damage. He plans to repeat the experiment with
a complete autopsy to confirm that the tissues are preserved intact. The
researchers also plan to demonstrate the procedure with other animal organs
and prolong their storage for up to a year. Seki hopes that within a few
years the technique could be used to preserve human organs. 

"The implications for transplant patients would be huge," comments Vanessa
Morgan, who chairs the UK Transplant Co-ordinators Association. "It could
lead to planned, elective operations rather than emergency surgery." She
adds that recipients could have a greater choice of donor organs, improving
their chances of a good match. But she cautions that the quality of
transplant organs must be maintained during long-term storage. "The
condition of organs is crucial and I wouldn't want to compromise condition
for time."

Yes.

There's a simple way to further this process. Don't use English units.
If somebody tells you measurements in those units, put up resistance. If
you give measurements to somebody, use metric/SI units and push against
(and maybe past) their resistance. In the early stages, compromising is
fine.

I could waste resources arguing with people that it is a bad idea to
write today's date as 08.11.98, 08/11/98, or 11/08/98. Or I can simply
go ahead and use 1998-11-08.

Probably true, and applicable for space-going applications. However, on
the ground, and from a systems perspective, there is no reason not to
treat the atmosphere as part of the storage system. In particular, from
a practical standpoint we're competing against gasoline-burning IC engines,
which also use biochemical energy storage and atmospheric oxygen.

This is interesting technology, but is not immediately relevant to integrating
a display onto a silicon wafer. Basically if I understand the contemplated
buckytube-based display, it will be a type of FED (field-emmision display)
In a FED, there is back plate with gazillions of field-emitters separated
by a narrow vacuum-filled gap from a front plate with phosphors. very high
voltage electrons from the field emitters strike the phosphors, yielding
TV-like display characteristics (brightness, field-of view, pixel density)
but with an overall thickness of less thatn an inch regardless of display size.
However, I think that the switching (i.e., pixel selection and scanning) is
done on the front panel, not on the back. FEDs are already being made, using
MEMs-style emitters. The breakthrough is in the cost and quality of the
emitters.

My original comments related to LCDs, which don't use wafer technology. Please
note that there is a wafer-based display technology that is very exciting: the
micro-monitor. These devices reduce a SVGA-quality monitor to less than a square
centimeter, and then use optics to create a virtual screen in front of the viewer's
eyes. Why bother with a 30" wall screen fixed to one place when you can have a
virtual 30" screen all the time as part of your wearable info appliance?

Again, I'm no expert, but I thought most Afgan women were illiterate. Sending
in books is not likely to work. You could try AM radios or super-cheap audio
players. A purpose-designed player with several hours of voice on ROM would
cost less than two dollars. Radio is more flexible but is subject to jamming.
The device should be powered photovoltaically, like a cheap calculator.
I would go for a dual-purpose device. However, I don't know enough about the
culture to know how the devices would get from their landing sites into the
possession of the women.

for those who are up to speed on cryonics, a question please:
our tissues are mostly carbon and carbon has an isotope (C14)
with half life about 6kyr.  when C14 undergoes beta decay, the
remainder is a nitrogen atom.  looks like the dna chain would
be broken there.  would the cell then be dead?  dependent
on a nanobot to find and repair the break?  have there been

Well that's a meme that needs to be changed.

Death is the end of change in the conscious mind. When you are dead you
don't change no more. Thus Life is change.

When you sleep you are not dead because you are still changing. Albeit at a
slower rate. And when you wake up you are free to change again.

When you are dead you don't change no more, and you don't wake up.

Change is good. To change and evolve is to feel and be alive!

IBM To Build Largest Academic Research Supercomputer

SOMERS, N.Y. (Reuters) - IBM said it had been selected by the National
Partnership for Advanced Computational Infrastructure (NPACI), a
leading U.S. academic computer consortium, to supply the first
supercomputer capable of handling more than one trillion calculations
per second.

The supercomputer, to be installed at the San Diego Supercomputer
Center (SDSC), will help researchers tackle massive computer
calculations that are currently impossible to calculate.

The NPACI, which is backed by the U.S. government's National Science
Foundation, links together 46 prominent universities and research
institutions. The computer system is available for use by researchers
throughout the world.

The new supercomputer system, an IBM RS/6000 SP computer, is
scheduled to begin operation in the second half of 1999.

The machine initially will be built to handle a quarter- teraflop of data,
or 250 billion calculations a second, before it eventually is upgraded to
full teraflop, or one trillion calculations per second, capacity.

When complete, the system will have simultaneously operate more than
1,000 IBM Power3 microprocessors.

Financial terms were not disclosed, but a similar computer sold
commercially would carry a list price of around $50 million, an IBM
spokesman said.

While there are supercomputers under construction at several U.S.
government research labs with the capacity to handle up to 4 trillion
calculations, the new San Diego system will represent the world's largest
supercomputer available for general academic research, the SDSC
and IBM spokesmen said.

In conjunction with the deal announced Wednesday, SDSC and IBM
have expanded their partnership, which now involves data storage and
digital library systems, to include parallel programming software and
``transparent supercomputing.''

Transparent supercomputing will enable users from around the world to
access the computer over the Internet using a simple Web browser.

SDSC and IBM are already working jointly on a system for storing and
retrieving massive amounts of data. The system can handle up to 80
terabytes, but capacity is expected to grow to a petabyte, or one
quadrillion bytes, in the next few years.

Please do, after all it seems like everywhere else (on the net) I'm asked to
enter mm-dd-yyyy.  If we really want to change the reinforcement we need to
e-mail those programmers who are creating applications not using the ISO
standard.

I have to beg to differ -- somewhat.  The same basic AngloAmerican common law
system of liability has been in effect throughout the period when we have
developed and implemented some of our most important technological
innovations.  While it is certainly true that the U.S. is the most litigious
society on Earth, we certainly aren't the most backward, technologically.
Japan, one of the least litigious societies, is not significantly quicker to
adopt new consumer technologies.  Let me address the questions you ask to
demonstrate how the system currently in place will accommodate computer-driven
vehicles.

>  what if your 6 yr old takes your computer driven car and it
>  hits someone?  

Just as with any other potentially dangerous device, the answer depends on who
or what CAUSED the accident.  If the six-year-old input instructions into the
computer to drive in the same fashion as he had recently done on his Nintendo
256 "DeathRace 2010" video game, then at least some liability will likely fall
on the kid's parents, for letting him have free access to the car.  The same
rules apply today to parents who carelessly allow their children to take
control of dangerous instrumentalities. If, instead, the accident was caused
by a basic programming flaw in the machine as it was purchased by the child's
parents, then the suit is a standard products liability suit -- no different
from one today against auto makers.  In fact, since it's quite foreseeable
that a six-year-old might get into an automated car, one can argue that
safeguards against user inputs similar to those found in "DeathRace 2010"
should be built into the system.  So the manufacturer might well share some
liability with the parents even in the first scenario.

Do such suits pose a cost to automakers?  Of course.  And I think most people
think they should.  One only has two alternatives when approaching product
safety: Private suits and central government regulation.  Which is more
consistent with individual liberty?

>  what if you send your car unaccompanied to your
>  friend's house and it hits someone?  

Same answer as in the hypothetical with the child.  If you programmed the
computer to take the shortest route to your friend's house -- including
shortcuts through your neighbor's bedroom -- then you'll likely have some
liability.  On the other hand, Ford or GM should likely be at least partially
financially responsible if they produce the car to accept such inputs.

> what if your computer car
>  is sitting still at a light and some yahoo who wants a new car
>  sees you asleep in the passenger side and backs into you, then
>  claims you hit her?  

The fact that the car has an automated guidance system doesn't change this
scenario from the situation we have always faced: There will always be people
who try to cheat, whether in the private tort system or in a less
individualized, less flexible system of public responsibility.

>we insist that someone be responsible always,
>  even if the computer driven car is ten times safer.

Actually, neither of these propositions is true.  The defense of "unavoidable
accident" is still alive and well in our tort system.  The civil common law
tort system recognizes and enforces the principle that "sh*t happens".

Your second assertion actually works the other way.  When a demonstrably safer
technology becomes available, the civil tort system creates powerful
incentives to adopt it.  Imagine the field day a plaintiff's lawyer would have
in an auto accident case today involving a current-model car NOT equipped with
seatbelts.

Ahh, antitrust law -- not my bag :-

Now, there IS a quite difficult legal issue buried in here, actually -- one we
recently thrashed about on the extropians lawnode list.  What happens when the
software agent at the heart of the guidance system becomes so sophisticated
that it is capable of generating goals on its own initiative?  I leave that
knotty problem as an exercise for the reader.

Thank you for asking such an important question, Steve.  

If nothing else, I think that transhumanists are positioned to provide a
reasoned perspective on such issues, and thereby to point out avenues of
action based on compassion and rationality rather than fear or hatred.  As
it stands now, most issues are framed in terms of victim/oppressor, and
there develops a sense that one can stand with either the victims or the
oppressors and gain a short-term advantage.  As transhumanists, we forsee
another course entirely, one based on a long-term view of where we are going
as humans.  Making the existence of this view known to others is probably
our most important task at this point.  Speaking up in venues that have
never heard from us before.  Planting the seeds for others to develop along
the same path.  Offering our praise and support to those who use science and
technology in positive ways.

With relation to actual 'actions', I think that we can link our own
individual interests with groups that are already working on certain issues.
I may not agree with everything feminist organizations say and do, but I can
link with them to achieve certain goals, and sometimes they actually
incorporate my suggestions.  Same goes for environmental organizations,
peace organizations, medical organizations, etc.  Through coalition
building, we can multiply our influence on the actions of various groups,
rather than attempting to take parallel actions.

Easy Money  HOW TO TURN $6 INTO $6,000!! OR MUCH MORE!! READING THIS COULD
CHANGE YOUR LIFE! I found this on a bulletin board and decided to try it. A
little while back, I was browsing through newsgroups, 
and came across an article similar to this that said you
could make thousands of dollars within weeks with only an initial investment
of $6.00! So I thought, "Yeah right, his must be a scam", but like most of
us, I was curious, so I kept reading. Anyway, it said that you send $1.00 to
each  of the 6 names and address stated in the article. You then place your
own name and address in the bottom of the list  at #6, and post the article
in at least 200 newsgroups or bulk email it to everyone you know and to
any email address you can find. (There are thousands) No catch, that was it. So
after thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought about
trying it. I figured: "what have I got to lose except   stamps and $6.00,
right?" Then I invested the measly $6.00. Well GUESS WHAT!!... within 7
days, I started getting money in the mail! I was shocked! I figured it would
end soon, but the money just kept coming in. In my first week, I made about
$25.00. By the end of the second week I had made a total of over $1,000.00!
In the third week I had
over $10,000.00 and it's still growing. This is now my fourth week and I
have made a total of just over $42,000.00 and it's still coming in rapidly.
It's certainly worth $6.00, and 6 stamps, I have spent more than that on the
lottery!! Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, why it
works....Also, make sure you print a copy of this article NOW, so you can
get the information off of it as you need it. I promise you that if you
follow the directions exactly,
that you will start making more money than you thought possible by doing
something so easy! Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully! (print it
out or download it.) Follow the simple directions and watch the money come
in! It's easy. It's legal. And, your investment is only $6.00 (Plus postage)
IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off; it is not indecent; it is not illegal; and
it is virtually no risk - it really works!!!! If all of the following
instructions are adhered to, you will receive extraordinary dividends.
PLEASE NOTE: Please follow these directions EXACTLY, and 50,000 or more can
be yours in 20 to 60 days. This program remains successful because of the
honesty and integrity of the participants. Please continue its success by
carefully adhering to the instructions. You will now become part of the Mail
Order business. In this business your product is not solid and tangible,
it's a service. You
are in the business of developing Mailing Lists. Many large corporations are
happy to pay big bucks for quality lists. However, the money made from the
mailing lists is secondary to the income which is made from people like you
and me asking to be included in that list. Here are the 4 easy steps to
success: STEP 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on
each piece of paper "PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST." Now get 6 US $1.00
bills and place ONE inside EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will
not be seen through the envelope (to
prevent thievery). Next, place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal
them, MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH STAMPS ON YOUR ENVELOPES. You should
now have 6 sealed envelopes, each with a piece of paper stating the above
phrase, your name and address, and a $1.00 bill. What you are doing is
creating a service. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL! You are requesting a
legitimate service and you are paying for it! Like most of us I was a little
skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all. So I
checked it out with the U.S. Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed
that it is indeed legal! Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses:

#1) O. Oyesiku
1210 Woodycrest Ave. #3a
Bronx,NY 10452
#2) D. Molkentin
100 Kennedy Ave.
Blue Point, NY 11715
#3) M. McGuire
68 Devon Lane
Williamsville, NY 14221
#4) Dr. E.
6573 Maple Lakes Dr.
W. Bloomfield, MI 48034
#5) JC
1908 Thurmond Place
Charlotte, NC 28205
#6) C. Edel	
30028 W.12 Mile #33	
Farmington Hills, MI 48334

STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the other
names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc...) and add YOUR Name as number 6 on
the list. STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep this article
as close to original as possible. Now, post your amended article to at least
200 newsgroups. (I think there are close to 24,000 groups) All you need is
200, but remember, the more you post, the more money you make! ** EVERYBODY
AROUND THE WORLD CAN DO IT, BUT REMEMBER TO PUT ENOUGH STAMPS ON YOUR
EVELOPES!!!!** This is perfectly legal! If you have any doubts, refer to
Title 18 Sec. 1302 & 1341 of the Postal lottery laws. Keep a copy of these
steps for yourself and, whenever you need money, you can use it again, and
again. PLEASE REMEMBER that this program remains successful because of the
honesty and integrity of the participants and by their carefully adhering to
the directions. Look at it this way. If you are of integrity, the program
will continue and the money that so many others have received will come your
way. NOTE: You may want to retain every name and address sent to you, either
on a computer or hard copy and keep the notes people send you.
This VERIFIES that you are truly providing a service. (Also, it might be a
good idea to wrap the $1 bill in dark paper to reduce the risk of mail
theft.) So, as each post is downloaded and the directions carefully
followed,
six members will be reimbursed for their participation as a List Developer
with one dollar each. Your name will move up the list geometrically so that
when your name reaches the #1 position you will be receiving thousands of
dollars in CASH!!! What an opportunity for only $6.00 ($1.00 for each of the
first six people listedabove) Send
it now, add your own name to the list and you're in
business! ---DIRECTIONS ----- FOR HOW TO POST TO
NEWSGROUPS------------ Step 1) You do not need to re-type this entire letter
to do your own posting. Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this
letter and drag your cursor to the bottom of this document, and select
'copy'
from the edit menu. This will copy the entire letter into the computer's
memory. Step 2) Open a blank 'notepad' file and place your cursor at the top
of the blank page. From the 'edit' menu select 'paste'. This will paste a
copy of the letter into notepad so that you can add your name to the list.
Step 3) Save your new notepad file as a .txt file. If
you want to do your postings in different settings, you'll always have this
file to go back to. Step 4) Use Netscape or Internet explorer and try
searching for various newsgroups (on-line forums, message boards, chat
sites,
discussions.) Step 5) Visit these message boards and post this article as a
new message by highlighting the text of this letter and selecting paste from
the edit menu. Fill in the Subject, this will be the header that everyone
sees as they scroll through the list of postings in a particular group,
click the post message button. You're done with
your first one! Congratulations...THAT'S IT! All you have to do is jump to
different newsgroups and post away, after you get the hang of it, it will
take about 30 seconds for each newsgroup!  **REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWSGROUPS
YOU POST IN (Message-boards etc.) THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL MAKE!! BUT
YOU HAVE TO POST A MINIMUM OF 200 OR EMAIL TO A FEW THOUSAND PEOPLE
That's it! You will begin receiving money
from around the world within days! You may eventually want to rent a P.O.Box
due to the large amount of mail you will
receive. If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a name to use, as
long as the postman will deliver it. **JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE
CORRECT.**
Now the WHY part: Out of 200 postings, say I receive only 5 replies (a very
low example). So then I made $5.00 with my name at #6 on the letter. Now,
each of the 5 persons who just sent me $1.00 make the MINIMUM 200 postings,
each with my name at #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of the original
5, that is another $25.00 for me, now those 25 each make 200 MINIMUM posts
with my name at #4 and only 5 replies each, I will bring in an additional
$125.00! Now, those 125 persons turn around and post the MINIMUM 200 with my
name at
#3 and only receive 5 replies each, I will make an additional $626.00! OK,
now here is the fun part, each of those 625 persons post a MINIMUM 200
letters with my name at #2 and they each only receive 5 replies, that
just made me $3,125.00!!! Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this message
to 200 newsgroups with my name at #1 and if still 5 persons per 200
newsgroups react I will receive $15,625,00! With an original investment of
only $6.00! AMAZING! When your name is no longer on the list, you just take
the latest posting in the newsgroups, and send
out another $6.00 to names on the list, putting your name at number 6 again.
And start posting again. The thing to remember is: do you realize that
thousands of people all over the world are joining the internet and reading
these articles everyday?, JUST LIKE YOU are now!! So, can you afford $6.00
and see if it really works?? I think
so... People have said, "what if the plan is played out and no one sends you
the money? So what! What are the
chances of that happening when there are tons of new honest users and new
honest people who are joining the internet and newsgroups everyday and are
willing to give it a try? Estimates are at 20,000 to 50,000 new
users, every day, with thousands of those joining the actual internet.
Remember, play FAIRLY and HONESTLY
and this will really work. Don't let this exciting opportunity pass you by!:
How to turn $6 into $6,000! Or more!!!

While we are on the subject of gender.....;^) 

(really, everyone should just chill out and have some fun with this...)

The film Velvet Goldmine premiered this weekend, and I recommend it as an
opportunity to see a particular kind of drag that is making a comeback on
the drag caberet and club scenes.  Those of us, including myself, who are
bored to tears with the 'drag queen' and 'drag queen' aesthetic have moved
into 'glam drag', which is a highly androgynous form of presentation that
often leaves others guessing as to just what's under all of it.  As Ru Paul
once said:  'we're all born naked, everything else is drag.'

The movie is based mostly on David Bowie's life and his contribution to the
changing perceptions of sexuality in the early 70's.  It's about a half-hour
too long, but the music is great, the wardrobing is total eyecandy and a lot
of fun.

Human embryonic stem cells have been isolated and I think this is very
big news. The feat was independently achieved by two different teams
using completely different methods, although both were financed by the
Geron corporation, the same company that made a splash a few months ago
when they immortalized cells by lengthening their telomeres. Human
embryonic stem cells are undifferentiated but can develop into any of
the 220 different kinds of cells that make up the human body. This is a
huge step toward cloning spare organs with no danger of rejection from
your immune system. And why not clone organs, we already know how to
clone individuals. A reporter asked Dr. Thomas Okarma, Geron's vice
president for research "Can the mortal body therefore be repaired with
new tissues, new tissues that remain youthful indefinitely?" Dr. Okarma
replied "Exactly."

Apparently I'm not the only one who was impressed, these results were
published in the journal Science on late Thursday afternoon (November 6
issue) and on Friday the price of Geron stock tripled and the trading
volume was more than 80 times it's normal level making it the most
actively traded in the market.

does anyone understand how a human embryo can be cryopreserved, revived,
inserted into a uterus, and then develop naturally? it seems to me that if
cryopreservation is so terribly destructive to human cells that
cryopreservation of embryos would be impossible...

This is a very salient point - trying to precipitate change in a climate
where literacy, and thus education, are of a very low level, can have
potentially catastophic concequences ( witness the numerous revolutions and
counter  revolutions in Africa etc).  In order to gain meaningfull change,
those who have their fingers on the triggers, so to speak, also have to be
convinced that to change is in their interests too, otherwise, as so often
happens, all that changes are the hands holding the guns

Well intentioned interventions is such volatile environments as those that
exist in extremist societies like the Taliban's can so easily have very
violent repercussions for the very people in need of assistance.

I would suggest that any intervention would have to be very carefully
considered beforehand .  Spaming Taliban Leaders with Porn doesn't sound
like  one of them, as was suggested on a previous post

Yes, and another important aspect of these stem cells is that 
they are immortal. They're telomeres don't shorten with division.
They wouldn't have to bother with isolating them again once 
they had a good sample. Question though, where would they find
stem cells on Scott Badger's body, since the article refered to a 
very narrow window of time during which these cells may be 
isolated from embryonic tissue.

I also saw a Geron representative given a lengthy interview on 
the McNeil-Lehrer Report and I couldn't believe how many times 
they were throwing the word immortal around.  I've been tuned 
into all this long enough that it doesn't phase me much, but I 
wonder what it's like for the mass of people who are just starting 
to understand the potential of bio-tech.  I mentioned to Robert

I came across this article today:

Huntsville - November 7, 1998 - Marshall Space Flight Center has
successfully completed two years of testing radical, new rocket engines
that could change the future of space travel with the development rocket
engines that "breathe" oxygen from the air.

"Air-breathing rocket engine technologies have the potential of opening
the space frontier to ordinary folks," said Uwe Hueter of NASA's
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. "We've proven the
technologies on the ground with extensive testing of complex and
technically challenging system components. Now, I believe we're ready to
demonstrate the technologies in flight."

Air-breathing rocket engines could make future space travel like today's
air travel, said Hueter, manager of NASA's Advanced Reusable
Technologies project. The spacecraft would be completely reusable, take
off and land at airport runways, and be ready to fly again within days.

An air-breathing rocket engine inhales oxygen from the air for about
half the flight, so it doesn't have to store the gas onboard. So at
take-off, an air-breathing rocket weighs much less than a conventional
rocket, which carries all of its fuel and oxygen onboard. Getting off
the ground is the most expensive part of any mission to low-Earth orbit,
and reducing a vehicle's weight decreases cost significantly.

An air-breathing engine (called a rocket-based, combined cycle engine)
gets its initial take-off power from specially designed rockets, called
air-augmented rockets, that boost performance about 15 percent over
conventional rockets. When the vehicle's velocity reaches twice the
speed of sound, the rockets are turned off and the engine relies totally
on oxygen in the atmosphere to burn the hydrogen fuel. Once the
vehicle's speed increases to about 10 times the speed of sound, the
engine converts to a conventional rocket-powered system to propel the
vehicle into orbit.

This unconventional approach to getting to space is one of the
technologies NASA's Advanced Space Transportation Program at the
Marshall Center is developing to make space transportation affordable
for everyone from business travelers to tourists. NASA's goal is to
reduce launch costs from today's price tag of $10,000 per pound to only
hundreds of dollars per pound.

GASL, a small aerospace company in Ronkonkoma, N.Y., has conducted most
of the air-breathing rocket engine testing at its facilities on Long
Island. GASL's unique facility is capable of testing across a wide range
of speeds and modes the rocket engine must achieve in flight.

NASA's industry partners in developing air-breathing rocket technologies
are: Aerojet Corp. of Sacramento, Calif.; Rocketdyne of Canoga Park,
Calif.; Astrox Corp. of Rockville, Md.; Pennsylvania State University of
University Park; and the University of Alabama in Huntsville.

There's a reason why most people do the date that way. It's
because month day year is the way you say the date in English,
and I at least think in English. It is day month year in other
countries probably because that is how it is said in their
language...

At any rate, that's my theory

Speaker Newt Gingrich (R) was a history professor, a science-fiction fan, even
the coauthor of an SF book.  He will not run for Speaker and will probably
resign from Congress.

Senator Patrick Moynihan (D) was one of the few highly intelligent people in
the Senate.  He will not run for reelection in 2000.

The shepherds are gone, and with them the last vision beyond the next
election.  Now the hungry, snuffling pigs rule with their bellies.

It is eery, looking at history, how terribly often the best and brightest are
removed or disabled just before the deluge.  Someday, I think, historians will
look back at this moment and say:  "Here marks the decline of the American Pax."

There is now no hope that Congress will act rationally in the coming storm.

Who is John Galt?

I didn't hear any time schedules from the self-replicator people.  Come to
think of it, I didn't hear any time schedules from the people who said they'd
remodel the basement in two weeks.

It's a Pure Intuitive figure, based on how many programmers and how much time
I think it would take to do everything listed in "Coding a Transhuman AI". 
But as I once said, "This is the last program the human race ever needs to
write.  It makes sense that it would be the largest and the most complex."

Don't be too sure of that.  It's harder for me to design organizations than to
design computer architectures, and it takes a much larger and more secure
power base to implement them - but the level of design necessary just to free
myself up is a hell of a lot less than what it takes to design a seed AI.

The range of the estimate reflects the degree to which I can change the rules
of the game.  A seed AI is a quick kill.  But if that quick kill isn't
possible, one simply recurses on creating more and more sophisticated forms of
intelligence enhancement, ranging from collaborative filtering to Algernic neurosurgery.

Mr. Gingrich was also a rabid anti-drug campaigner who advocated the death penalty
for certain kinds of drug users.  Anybody who advocates death by the state for what
one puts in his or her own body (no matter how harmful) is not a civilized person,
nor someone I want to be in a position of power.  Gingrich's departure is the best
political news I've received all week.  Good riddance!

BTW, reading and/or writing science fiction does not necessarily make one sane or
decent.

This is kind of a moot point.  Only one in roughly ten million carbon atoms
is a C-14 atom and with a half life of 6000 years this is not a very
frequent event.  As to whether it breaks the chain, that is dependent on
the trajectory of the electron emitted by the decay.  If this occurs, the
cell is not dead by any means.  Small errors in the chain are well
tolerated, this is why you need five or six "hits" to a cancer related gene
before it "malfunctions".  If you wanted to repair it, no need to design a
nanobot to do it, cells already carry an inherent repair machinery for all
but the most severe of breaks.

Its a question of size.  The damage to cells is caused by formation of ice
crystals, which can be avoided if an organism is frozen quickly enough. 
Unfortunately humans are too large to have all of their cells frozen
quickly enough to avoid this damage.  Many smaller creatures have been
successfully revived after cryopreservation.

In response to my post, Technology evolves, etc. Eugene Leitl wrote:

>> [market economics don't apply to self-replicators]

	I didn't say that, though I take responsibility 
for the confusion.  Market economics apply, but the situation is so extreme--cost goes to ~zero and demand is saturated--that the dominant characteristics of an economics of scarcity are replaced by those of an economics of abundance.  Rather than "market economics don't apply" it would be better to say "market economics evolve" or "market economics are transformed".

Back at you wrong.  Plenty of energy ie., sunlight.  Plenty of land, not to mention water.  And as to good will, the horn-of-plenty takes care of that.
	As to getting nuked,...well.  Aside from the general surreality of the idea of folks casually nuking each other--which seems either paranoia or an all-purpose end to a line of reasoning that has no place to go--there is the idea of nuking the horn-of-plenty.  Stealing it first, and then nuking, though still silly, makes more sense.  But then again, there's no need to steal it in the first place, when you can have one of your own, for free.

Huh?  Running amok?  Where did that come from?  It's machine system.  It does what it's told.  It has an on/off switch.  It stays inside the fence.  It is NOT a Stephen King novel.

I agree, in spades.

Don't make me hurt you.  Aside from short range transport capabilities which are an obvious part of basic functionality, you just blow this little whistle that comes in the box, and all the little robot boys and girls get on the truck/boat/starship and you take them to the next location/galaxy.

Thanks for asking.  It's a question I have dedicated my life to answering.  Cryonet post #10333 is my first generation answer, though I'm working on fleshing it out a bit.   You can find it at:

Already convinced?  Obviously your transcendent incisive brilliance combined with my genius for analysis and expositon have just ripped and shredded right through that old Veil of Maya.  Say Hi! to Buddha for me.

But seriously, I get a little tweaked at the dynamic pessimism of so many supposed "proponents" of cryonics.  As the saying goes, "With friends like that, who needs enemies?"  So I'm countering their frumpy pessimism with my extropian dynamic optimism. (So it wasn't actually argumentation that convinced you, but rather advanced applied memetics.)  At each and every mention of cryonics I hammer away pro-actively with my positive/optomistic meme:  SUCCESS IS A NEAR CERTAINTY.  Repeat it to yourself over and over again, kind of mantra-like.  (Other good extropian memes are I AM GOING TO LIVE FOREVER, and I WILL TRAVEL TO THE STARS.  These last two are most effective when repeated, standing with arms spread wide beneath a starlit sky.)

	I don't care a fig for conventional economic theory.  Ever since the first chief imperial economist was called into the emperor's presence, and the emperor, staring out the window said, "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the greatest economist of them all?"  and the economist, who's mother had raised no idiot children, replied, "Oh, great Ozymandias, King of Kings, thy genius, as in all things, is supreme, rising so far beyond the feeble reckoning of we ordinary men, your humble servants, that it rivals the wisdom of the gods themselves.  Thou art the greatest economist the line of man shall ever produce."
	"Flattery aside, chief economist", replied Ozymandias with an air of cold command, "Does it appear economically viable for me to send my armies forth to destroy all who resist me, and to then subjugate the rest?"
	"Exalted one", replied the economist, perfectly attuned to his master's unquenchable thirst for power, "my discernment is insignificant compared to yours, yet I am pledged to answer, so I say it is not merely viable, but essential.  It is the will of the gods that you shall rule over other men.  Rape, pillage, conquer, destroy.  Embrace that choice and achieve your destiny, and you will surely earn not only your place in the Hall of Heroes, but your place among the very Gods themselves."
 	"Thank you chief economist," said Ozymandias. "You may go now."
	As he left the palace to return to his villa, he felt a warm sense of confidence.  At least for tonight he would sleep safe and secure in the arms of his latest trophy wife.

	Sycophancy has been the central feature of economics (and history, and theology--"Render unto Ceaser...") since Ur.  That is why Soviet economists were Marxist, why western economists are proponents of whatever flavor of capitalism is currently in favor, why it is called the dismal science, and why it is utterly disreputable.  "Garbage in" can make you stupid, or, if you're good at it, rich.

	Robin, fellow extropian, I trust you will not take any of this personally.

	Now, as to your comments.

>1) It is not clear that demand can ever be "saturated."
 
	You sit down in an Italian restaurant, a big plate of pasta in front of you.   You eat, and eat, and eat, and eat.  When you can eat no more, your demand is saturated. Multiply by five billion.
	Every human on the planet--a finite number--is home, in a very big house, wandering around thinking,"I should close down this wing of the house, I never use it."  Demand is saturated.
	Imelda is sitting in the Ferdinand Marcos Memorial Footware Museum, within whose halls she has assembled, in her size, one pair of every kind of footware ever made.  Uh,...ok, bad example.

>2) Your phrase "cost factors always originate in the labor 
>   component of a product or service" sounds bogus.  The
>   cost of land, for example, is very real.

	A piece of land can be bought or sold.  Why?  Because men-at-arms protect its property status.  Their labor, as well as that of armaments manufacturers, and the governmental infrastructure which codifies and maintains the arrangement, is the labor value in the land.  Otherwise it would be free.  That is, if unclaimed.  If claimed, it would be free to steal.  If you had the men-at-arms.  Which brings us back to where we started.

	As to bogus.
  
	Once upon a time, there was a man who, after having amassed a considerable fortune in the pickle business, set out to build the world's largest pickle.  Using his expertise, his financial resources, and a lifetime's accumulation of goodwill, he built a very, very large pickle.
	How large was it?
	It was so large, that in order to see all of it, you had to get so far away from it, that you couldn't see any of it.
	
	That's bogus.
		
>3) A self-reproducing solar-array builder need not be at
>   all close to something that can make anything.

	In my original post, I clearly indicated that the design of novel components for the system, or of products to be made by the system, and the programming with which to implement the manufacture of those components or products, would come from outside, from the system operators. 
	Nevertheless, a self-replicating machine system, by definition, would be able to make every part of itself, and thus would REQUIRE a broad, almost comprehensive set of  manufacturing capabilities. This implies, well,...an almost comprehensive set of outputs.
	But, I have to apologize.  I'm have an unfair advantage here.  This is all theoretical and speculative, so I have broad lattitude to control the definitions regarding system capability.  In the real world, the system would have limitations.  Sometimes it would come up short.  In those cases, human intervention would be required, ideally, to add the missing capability.
	
>4) The growth *rate* seems crucial.  Something that doubled
>   every twenty years seems pretty uninteresting.
        
	The "throughput" issue.  Yes.  Well, the folks behind the 1980 Nasa Summer Study--Advanced Automation for Space Missions concluded that this was not a problem.

	I'm still waiting on my copy of "Expontial Growth in Large Self-Reproducing Machine Systems".  Perhaps after I've digested it, I'll have a taste for crow.  Hope not.

Geron thinks it can convert any one of your cells back to its embryonic form.
Take any human embryonic stem cell, it doesn't matter who it's from, and
destroy the nucleus in it, then remove the nucleus (the part of the cell that
contains the DNA) from any cell in your body and insert it into the cytoplasm
of the stem cell. You end up with Scott Badger's personal embryonic stem
cell. This is very similar to the technique used to clone mice that was
reported a few months ago.

Incidentally, according to The New York Times Dr. Michael West who did much
of the early telomere work has quit Geron and started his own company, its
announced goal is to "apply telomere theory to animals". It's starting to
sound a lot like Silicon Valley.

Won't the mitochodrial DNA be from the donor, then? Are there potential

Me, probably.  I think I remember that the reporter mentioned that she had
done another member interview, but I can't recall whether she said that one
was in Houston.  It's always hard to tell how a finally edited television
piece will turn out from the interview (I've had hatchet jobs done on the
cutting room floor), but the reporter, Theresa Rodriguez, seemed genuinely
interested and to not have a negative slant on the subject.  She was headed to
Phoenix after our interview, so there will likely be some shots of the Alcor
facility and some talking heads (ugh) from there, as well.  

I'm overseas this week, but my wife intends to tape the piece when it airs.
In true transhuman fashion, in case of technical snafus, I'd appreciate a
back-up from any local Textropians.

Chris Cox, who is running for Gingrich's old job, has been favourably
evaluated by Reason magazine, so I think there are still some brains in
Congress. The former wrestler who was elected Governor under the Reform
party ticket, is by according to many accounts, a libertarian who favours
gay marriage and drug legalisation.

Gingrich had a genuine enthusiasm for ideas, so his departure is a great
loss.

how can you say such a thing about the man who led a radical christian coup
of the American political system? how can you say he possessed an
"enthusiasm for ideas" when he led a monolith in congress which continually
attempted to criminalize all forms of abortion, cut American funding of the
UN, curtail further the civil liberties of homosexuals, enact prayer in
school, subvert the American social security and health care systems, and
impeach Bill Clinton for receiving a blow job and possibly lying about it
in court? the aforementioned does not seem characteristic of a man who
holds an "enthusiam for ideas" or strong libertarian convictions. i see
that your address ends with .au so i'll assume that you have not had the
same exposure to this man as I have...

I'm forced to agree, everything I've seen about Gingrich tells me he's a
power grabbing
old style demagogue.

Mr. Gingrich was also a rabid anti-drug campaigner who advocated the death
penalty
for certain kinds of drug users.  Anybody who advocates death by the state
for what
one puts in his or her own body (no matter how harmful) is not a civilized
person,
nor someone I want to be in a position of power.  Gingrich's departure is
the best
political news I've received all week.  Good riddance!

BTW, reading and/or writing science fiction does not necessarily make one
sane or
decent.

There's a noticeable difference between a history professor who believes in
freedom and a lawyer who believes in pork and reelection, even if neither one
is a fanatic Libertarian.  Don't make the mistake of lumping all politicians
together if they don't share your views; that destroys the possibility of
incremental progress.  If Congress were composed of Gingriches, there'd be a
chance of a Paul Hughes being elected; as it is, Gingrich was the most we
could possibly hope for, a spearhead... now shattered.

> BTW, reading and/or writing science fiction does not necessarily make one sane or

Really?  I would rather be governed by the first 535 names in a national
telephone directory than Congress, and I would rather be governed by the first
535 members of Worldcon than any other government in history.  Let's face it,
reading science fiction makes you smarter, faster, less susceptible to panic
in the face of future shock, less gullible, more idealistic, more rational,
more informed, and better capable of understanding technology and
technological change.  This tendency is stronger in Extropians and even
stronger in Singularitarians.

Think of it as a Future Shock hierarchy, measuring the ideas you can
contemplate without flinching.  At Shock Level One, the baseline, we have
technophiles, "The Road Ahead", "To Renew America", "Future Shock", virtual
reality, and Wired magazine.  At Shock Level Two we have medical immortality,
interplanetary exploration, and new ("alien") cultures - the average SF fan. 
At Shock Level Three we have nanotechnology, human-equivalent AI, minor
intelligence enhancement, uploading, total body revision - the average
Extropian.  At Shock Level Four you have the Singularity, complete mental
revision, far superhumanity, Powers, and evaporation of the causal network
called "Life as we know it" - the Singularitarians.  If there's a Shock Level
Five, I'm not sure I want to know about it.

Anyway, the point is that you can't introduce anyone to an idea more than one
Shock Level above - and Shock Levels measure what you accept calmly, not what
you know about; there are very few SL4ers, and I was *not* one of them (too
enthusiastic) when I wrote "Staring Into the Singularity".  If somebody is
still worried about virtual reality (low end of SL1), you can try explaining
medical immortality (low-end SL2), but not nanotechnology (SL3) or uploading
(high SL3).  They might believe you, but they will be frightened - shocked.

Gingrich wrote at SL1, but probably toned it down a bit - he was writing for
an SL0 audience and knew it.  He was very likely SL2, and could have reacted
to SL3 ideas without screaming and running away.  Now we're stuck with an SL0
Congress that keeps trying to censor the Internet.  Maybe, since Al Gore
chaired the Senate hearings on nanotechnology, he could be a force for sanity
- but frankly, I think he was just sucking up to the techies.

Not unless the donor and the recipient were from different species (and 
maybe not even then).  All human mitochondrial genes end up in people
with any given human nuclear gene, so they all have to get along or
they basically get bred out.

Hi all,

I used to subscribe about 5 years ago. The list was amzaing then: 
completely anti-state and 100% behind the individual. People like Tim 
Starr and Perry Metzger. The most centrally planned project was trying to 
buy an ocean liner to get away from a___holes trying to "melt" other 
peoples property rights.

I just resub'd and the list seems to be a mixture of Stalinist central 
planners and Popular Mechanics. Am I in the wrong list or did  Ayn Rand 
recant everything  while I was away?

I'm really confused as to what extropians mean by libertarianism. It seems to
me that from private discussions with a few people on this list I should take
libertarianism to be objectivism; I hope this is not a commonly held
philosophy. I consider myself a "liberaltarian" which combines what I believe
to be the best aspects of the left and right. I think many of you might be
interested in The Revolution, a new, serious, prankster political party which
embodies many of my beliefs. Below is their 15 point party platform. More info
can be found at www.the-revolution.org. cya

15 Point Party Platform for National Politics by R.U. Sirius  

NOTE: All of these platform points are stated simply in three-or-less
sentences.
The reality is far more complex. Each one of these will be detailed, one by
one, in the months to come. 

We will repeal five times as many laws as we pass. We need to simplify and
clarify the rules of the game. We will do a better job of enforcing and obeying
a few reasonable rules than thousands upon thousands of incomprehensible
statutes.  
End all corporate welfare. Let allegedly free-enterprise stand on its own two
feet.  
No Federal Personal Income Taxes for individuals with incomes of less than
$100,000. Encourage states and counties to also end taxation of
middle-class and
poor individuals. Institute a flat tax on income over $100,000.  
Legalize most pleasure drugs, prostitution, and gambling. Institute a 'sin
tax,'
taxing these activities at 100% to make up for some of the funds lost as the
result of #3. Use part of this tax income to make counseling and rehabilitation
easily available in all locales.  
Close down the prison/industrial complex. Pardon all prisoners who are in for
non-violent crimes involving sums involving $25,000 or less, provided they have
no known history of violent activities. Pardon all prisoners listed with
Amnesty
International.  
Defend civil liberties. For the first time in recent memory, let's have a
federal government that respects The Constitution and The Bill of Rights .
Let's
have the ACLU and the EFF and other pro-rights organizations inside the federal
government.  
Stop policing the world. Become just another member of the UN, with
responsibilities equivalent to our numbers. Reduce the Pentagon's budget by at
least 50%.  
Close down the National Security State. Since the end of World War II,
representative democracy has been hostage to the National Security State.
Release all secret documents (excluding only those recent ones that present a
very clear and present danger), fire the CIA, and reform the federal
intelligence apparatus.  
Put environmental concerns before profits and jobs. On the other hand, put
scientific consensus and reason ahead of emotion-based environmentalism.
Protect the environment while limiting Orwellian bureaucratic absurdities.  
Open federally-funded birth control clinics all across the country,
guaranteeing
women in every locale reasonable access to her legal right to abortion and
other forms of birth control.  
Allow 'autonomous zones.' Offer ways in which localities and even
households can
-- with a very few limits -- opt out of the system.  
Re-establish social services at pre-Reagan levels, for starters. Study the
possibility of a 'workfare' state that would create an ultimately
self-sustaining 'generic' maintenance economy that would involve those who
don't receive income independently, or through employment, in the production,
distribution, and receivership of life's essentials. Ultimately, an advanced
high tech society will need to end the employment/make money ethic entirely or
risk a total psychotic break from the social/environmental pollution wreaked by
billions of desperate people on a hustle.  
Study the possibility of restructuring the economic/money system toward making
money consistent with actual value in an age where money-as-information is
excessively abstracted from the creation of real wealth and unfairly favors
those who know how to manipulate it. Also, question the oligarchic power of
those who control the money system, such as the Federal Reserve, the IMF, and
the World Bank, reforming or possibly eliminating those organizations.  
Fund a 'Manhattan Project Toward Utopia.' Finance and encourage altruistic
scientific and technological projects geared towards breakthroughs that can
diminish or eliminate scarcity, disease, and other forms of suffering that most
people would prefer not to experience. Establish a principal of universal
access to the products of such breakthroughs.  
Victory Over Horseshit! The political process in America is hostage to certain
obvious absurdities that are an embarrassment before the civilized world: like
the continuing embargo against Cuba (and particularly the Helms/Burton bill),
the excessive numbers of state executions, our refusal to sign the land mine
treaty, the opposition to policies like needle exchange that are geared towards
slowing down a plague, refusal of funding for international birth control, ad
infinitum. Let's have a national government that calls ridiculous horseshit
what it is.

Sound's like "The Young Ladies Illustrated Primer" from Neal
Stephanson's "The Diamond Age." A truly advanced model would
realize if the user was illiterate and teach them how to read.
Unfortunately a bit to far into the future.

Canadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan once made an interesting
suggestion. He suggested that instead of propaganda, Radio Free
Europe play only Jazz. He suggested it's innate content would cause
the USSR to come unglued.

Radio free Afghanistan?

Does your confidence in cryonics come from similarly dismissing
conventional biology?  Are you interested in colonizing the 
universe because you similarly dismiss conventional physics?
After all, aren't biologists and physicists just as much or
more in the hip pocket of the great oppressive military-
industrial complex?

Is there some unconventional economic theory that does support
your conclusions?  Or does dismissing conventional theory then
entitle you to ignore economics all together and then make 
whatever claims occur to you? 

>Robin, fellow extropian, I trust you will not take any of this

I am a person who has carefully considered the options and on
reflection found much of value in conventional economic theory.
Because some (but hardly most) people in power agree with me, 
you have concluded I have been duped.  And I am wondering 
just how carefully you have considered the options.  Have you
ever even browsed a current economics journal, conventional
or not?

I don't think you appreciate the vast number of dimensions 
along which demand can increase.  Yes, researaunt meal pounds
of food has long ago saturated, and yet such meals cost more
as people get richer.  Why?  Because demand has increased along
quality and diversity of ingredients, care and technology of 
preperation, rapidity of retooling to follow food fashions,
quality of decor, convenience of location, etc.  Total demand
for restaraunt food doesn't saturate until *all* dimensions 
saturate.   And total economic demand doesn't saturate until
demand for *all* kinds of products and services saturates.  
Leave one service with one unsaturated dimension, and you
aren't there.

Excuse the bio-ignorance but what is the basic game plan for getting
the stem cell to grow a particular organ?  How do you trick it into
growing a lung (for example), and how do you keep it alive while it's
growing?  Is there any way to speed up the growing of the lung so it
doesn't take 15 years to reach adult size?

My problem with this approach is that it seems to assume an unrealistic 
degree of individuality.  You're going to have to wait more than a day to
see if you do or don't like some new version of yourself.  But if you wait
a week or a month, then rejecting this new version becomes pretty expensive.
This version has been interacting with the rest of the world, which is not
going to be keen about backtracking all their interactions with you.  

Consider that you will have close friends and associates, and they will 
be evolving with you.  If you and a friend evolved together in a way you
both like, but then an old you disapproves while an old her doesn't, do
you revert or not?  What about your co-workers and clients and customers?
How often will they tolerate your not recalling interations with them? 

It seems to me that old version review has a place, but that one can't 
afford to invoke it very often, and that the cost of doing so increases
with time, even though it probably takes some time to see what changes
you like.

This is a good point for longer-term review.  But there still would
be value in the one-day lookover.  I had the impression that this was
to protect against cases where you adopt a new worldview overnight.
This is not too common now but presumably could happen more easily given
technologies to manipulate brain states directly.

Probably the closest examples we have today would be religious conversion
or extremely powerful drug experiences.  Although these may arguably be
to the benefit of the person, in many cases the day-before version would
prefer not to allow such a drastic change.

In effect this is a way of committing yourself to a policy of gradual
change.  Conceivably there would be other ways of doing so, via subtle
modifications to the brain that would change how it worked, but this
method is a conceptually simple way of accomplishing it.

Josh Glasstetter, <jag36@cornell.edu>, asks:
> I'm really confused as to what extropians mean by libertarianism.

No doubt it means different things to different people.  I would prefer
to call the philosophy "individualism", the belief that to the maximum
extent possible, people should be free to make their own individual
decisions about how they live their lives.

Where I disagree with the left is in the question of whether businesses
are also to be considered as having this right.  It seems to me that
since businesses are composed of people working together in a common
enterprise, that their individual rights to make decisions do not vanish.
It is the same for one man who wants to cut down a tree in his back yard
as for a million who want to form a company to cut down a forest they own.
In neither case do I have the right to make them stop.  I can try to
persuade them to stop, I can join together with others who value trees
so that we can buy them ourselves, but I can't come and tie the hands
of the people holding the axes.

Josh also posts R.U. Sirius' Revolution Party platform.

Many aspects of the platform are attractively libertarian.  Broadly,
the reduce government interference and give individuals more freedom to
live their lives in the manner they see fit:

> We will repeal five times as many laws as we pass. We need to simplify
> and clarify the rules of the game. We will do a better job of enforcing
> and obeying a few reasonable rules than thousands upon thousands of
> incomprehensible statutes.

> End all corporate welfare. Let allegedly free-enterprise stand on its

> Legalize most pleasure drugs, prostitution, and gambling. Institute a
> 'sin tax,' taxing these activities at 100% to make up for some of the
> funds lost as the result of #3. Use part of this tax income to make
> counseling and rehabilitation easily available in all locales.

> No Federal Personal Income Taxes for individuals with incomes of less
> than $100,000. Encourage states and counties to also end taxation of
> middle-class and poor individuals. Institute a flat tax on income over
> $100,000.

These may not be exactly what I would want to see, but they are a step
in the right direction.

In other areas, the platform calls for increased government power and
interference in private decisions:

> Put environmental concerns before profits and jobs. On the other hand, put
> scientific consensus and reason ahead of emotion-based environmentalism.

I read this as asking for the power to force people to treat their
property according to the wishes of others, as in the tree cutting
example above.

> Open federally-funded birth control clinics all across the country,
> guaranteeing women in every locale reasonable access to her legal right
> to abortion and other forms of birth control.

It is morally repugnant to take taxes from people who view birth control
as a sin and abortion as murder, and use their taxes to fund these very
activities.  I don't agree with these views, but I respect the right of
people to hold them.  To the maximum extent possible, we should try to
structure society to respect all such views.  The religious right should
not be able to stop people from having abortions, but by the same token
they should not be forced to fund them, either.  This is an obvious
compromise, and it is frustrating that both sides are so blind to it.

> Re-establish social services at pre-Reagan levels, for starters.

This is an interesting one because I don't know whether this calls for
an increase or a decrease!  The document straddles libertarian and
leftist views so I don't know how to interpret it.

On the libertarian side, this could be an acknowledgement that much of
the vaunted Reagan "shrinkage of government" was mere rhetoric, that
government grew under Reagan and has continued to grow since.  Shrinking
social services to 1980 levels would be in keeping with other aspects of
the platform which call for reducing the size and power of government.

On the leftist side this could represent an acceptance of the image of
Reagan as a cruel, insensitive slasher of needed government programs,
and a call to return to an attitude of government as a last-resort
protector from cradle to grave.

The last few platform elements, the call to make money "consistent with
actual value" and to fund a "Manhattan Project towards Utopia", are
vague and confusing.  I doubt much would come of them.

Have no fear.  Ayn Rand is dead and recants nothing.  ;)

I'm anarcho-capitalist, myself, and will occasionally put my $0.02 in when
the thought strikes me.  I think the vast majority of us are still
anti-state.  We debate the point occasionally; you've reached us during an
off period as far as those debates go.  (Arguably, such debates are a waste
of everyone's time anyway.)

Personally, I'm trying to earn a biomedical engineering degree just as fast
as my little brain can take it.  I take anti-oxidants daily.  I don't
exercise as much as I read, but I'm reading good stuff, so hopefully I've
reached a good balance.  I'm hoping that we'll ultimately reach the point
where the technology itself will catalyze the political changes we have in
mind.  I'm optimistic towards the future and look forward to boundless
improvement in the years to come.

There should be something about cryonics in that. I spoke to a 48

Would it be possible to mass produce a "black box" that functions as 
a broadband wireless router.  Have the thing be self programming?

See the following:

http://www.sandia.gov/media/hacker.htm

There could be GPS-based spectrum allocation, and something similar 
to an I.P. address that consists of a number assigned by the above 
MEMS device.

These would have variable power, and placed at grid points.

The more dense the grid, the lower the power of the individual cells, 
and greater the amount of bandwidth available to the "subscribers".

Although, I'm thinking that this should be structured in such a way 
that there is zero cost to the end user, because it would also be the 
security network, providing the transport for citizen tracking.

Not all mammal embryos can be cryopreserved 'as is' (pig embryos require a
protocol which causes a temporary breakdown of the cytoskeleton), human
are one of the hardy ones. IIRC, the embryos are frozen at a few cell
stage, where the embryo is microscopically small (and so subthreshold to
certain damage mechanisms) and the cells are still undifferentiated. At
this stage a considerable fraction of the cells can die, the remaining
ones still being able to compensate. Even so, a fair fraction of
cryopreserved embryos is nonviable. 

If you freeze a macroscopic adult organ (say, a human brain) the amount of
damage caused by currently utilized protocols which are perfectly okay for
embryos is unacceptable, probably even if we consider structural
conservation as the only criterion. Certain organs (brain, liver) are many
times more fragile than others (heart, kidney).

Much research is still needed to classify the kind and quantify the amount
of damage occuring, so that better protocols can be devised. Basically the
only accepted validation criterion of cryopreservation protocols is tissue
viability, which makes it doubly difficult (you subject the tissue/organ
to additional damage during thawing/devitrification, and viability can be
difficult to measure).

"Serious, prankster political party"?  If that means what I think it
means, I like it.  After all, how could you even have a serious
Libertarian party in the representative democracy framework that we
are currently constrained by.  If I were elected into this system, I
would become the same old low-life politician type we have all come to
hate.

This would eventually have to be a broken promise, taking into account
the mathematics and the need for new laws as we transition to
posthumanity.

After a rather disastrous surgical post recovery my doctor and I were
discussing the restrictions the state now has on doctors which intrudes into
the doctor/patient clinical decisions. 

He mentioned that Jesse "The Body" Ventura Reform party had many of the
libertarian ideas. There has been no news coverage on this in California.
The play on the election in Minnesota has been of the nature "how strange".
Which is interesting California is applying that term to another state. I
thought California had an exclusive on it :-)

Does anyone have any information on the Reform party and Jesse's election.
Was this a voter revolt against intrusive government.

This is an interesting complication. However, I would consider it
a small price to pay to ensure that my mind didn't embark on some
completely undesirable path. The idea is similar to a conservative
investment policy. Do you invest in government bonds (old mind
review) or do you speculate on a unpredictable startup (say a prayer
and start tinkering with your heuristics)?

This effect should be mitigated by the fact that both of your
old minds will be evaluating your new minds. Given that you were
friends prior to the day's changes, odds are you should only
approve of minds that are platonically compatible. However, the
whole arrangement adds new spice to the spectre of "growing apart". :)

> What about your co-workers and clients and customers? How often

Many ideas come to mind to mitigate these problems. You can have
"rogue identity insurance" in case your new mind entered into an
unsavory business deal. It should be possible to update the old
mind with selected memories from the new mind without changing
the old mind. A caveat though would be the memories would be
configured by the perceptions of the new mind's perspective.

Another problem Robin's comments bring to mind are crimes
committed by the new you that did not survive the review process.
Would the old mind be accountable for the new mind's actions? 
It seems there would have to be some level of accountability
on the part of the old mind for the new mind's actions or chaos
would ensue. Perhaps there would be lesser punishments imposed
on old minds for crimes committed by new minds.

The cost would only increase to the extent that you view time
as a commodity. If you have no definite objective where conserving 
time becomes crucial, but instead have the simple goal of improving 
your mind (higher intelligence, etc.) then the time lost is not
as painful. The cost is further glossed when the review process
is viewed as a mind survival strategy. Any cost becomes
palatable when its objective is survival, exhibit A being present
day health care costs.

This is getting absurd.  <sarcasm> Why don't we debate Gingrich's skill at
chess?  I've always thought a good chess player, what with their
complicated problem solving machinery and all, would have than enough
intelligence in place to govern a nation. </sarcasm>

While I agree that it's nice for Congress to be forward-looking, it would
be much nicer if he had more libertarian leanings than it would be that he
be at Future Shock level 4.  The future can take care of itself; all we
want/need gov't to do is get out of the way!

Well. That really hedges the bet. the phrase "maximum extent possible" is 
the question. Everybody, Marxists included, could agree with that phrase, 
they merely define maximum and possible quite differently.

Yes. That is the essential difference between the state and a company: 
the company is is embedded in a capital market so its share holders can 
sell up and move. No such (liquid) market exists, yet, for states. I 
can't come to the USA and if I relinquish my New Zealand citizenship (not 
intended BTW), I don't get a severance pay-out of 1 3-millionth of the 
net asset backing of NZ. American's can't even move without summary 
de-righting.
  
Josh continues,

Now that is a good rule of thumb for a few years!

That is a critical point. I made a similar proposition to the

yet. The critical point for maintaining popular support is deregulating 
the law, health, and professional services unions whose restricitve trade 
practices drive up the cost and complexity of living for the vast 
majority (see also the Bell Curve for similar arguments).

Hmmm. Change most to all and I am on board. But then what would the 
police and lawyers do with with no criminal's left to speak of? I predict 
the end of crime by the year 2020 if crimes must have victims and and 
victims are free to defend themselves with, for instance, full time 
multimedia surveillance, including DNA sequestration.

How about we start more modestly by eliminating all government "public"

ravaging is left when it directly decreases owner equity?

No. Just let ordinary people like us practice medicine. Women's

cost training and service provision. Abortion would plummet in price and 
become ubiquitously available inside a year. The crazy God-squad 
murderers cannot combat that kind of groundswell.

That would be American-english (why do so many people in the USA think
their english is English?). In Australian english (and English-english?)
its dd-mm-yyyy. I guess we do reverse ISO standard since we are
upside-down.

Perhaps English should be considered one of the most libertarian of
languages given the way it easily adopts new words and evolves to the users
needs. Though this can cause some confusion: in my first trip to the States
I got some very odd looks in cafes when I asked for a 'long black' - lucky
I wasn't in a gay bar.

Perhaps we can send arabic teachers and teach the taliban how to read the

What will be the best way to make the public transition from "atom 
style" politics to "bit style" politics?

Electronic democracy replaces the need for physical politcal 
representatives to be located in physical offices (e.g., so called 
"Office of The President in Washington D.C.).

But since the internet is not yet ubiquitous, there will continue to 
be a need for the old style public theater.

What is the best way to handle the transition?

Will there eventually be a big ceremony where the White House is 
blown up, like the scene in "Independence Day"? Or will it simply be 
turned into a museum?  Does anyone have any suggestions for how the 
ceremony of retiring the physical facilities of government should 
take place, in a manner that is not too shocking to citizens?

The basic problem would rather seem to be the limited budget, since
for a few k$/unit methinks it is very possible to design a multimedia
gadget to teach literacy interactively/adaptively.

In case of the Arab totalitarians, it would rather suffice to create
video/audio units not requiring conspiquous sat dishes (which would seem to
demand LEO technology) and small enough to hide thus enabling clandestine
use. Surely, the physical and cultural specifics for the Arab
countries can be accounted for. Free market should take care of the rest.

If this is real memetic warfare, aerial deployment (by robot drones,
but who is going to pay for it all?) might be really an option.

Pretty unlikely. Radio Free Europe was heard primarily for its
information content which was complementary to the remote-controlled
state media. The key to RFE's success was availability of RF receivers.

 > Radio free Afghanistan?

As a matter of fact, thin-film amorphous Si photocell radios with
headphones are very cheap (a dollar or two, if mass-produced),
inconspicuous since tiny, and certainly deployable from air. 
Unfortunately, in case of misogynist memetic set the enforcer is 
not far, being the husband. It would be really interesting to see what
the reaction (and, of course, the success) of the Taliban (Caliban?) 
would be against open  memetic warfare?

Worse still, plenty of vile practices are enforced by earlier victims.
Clitoridectomy of children is usually insisted upon, and carried out, by
older women in the misguided cultures where it is practised.  Ugh.

What I'm trying to point out is that the two are hardly unrelated.  Would a
science fiction fan have reflexively banned cloning?  Of course not.  Cloning
is a totally innocent technology which is not subject to any abuses whatsoever
- it's simply a way of artificially producing unsynchronized identical twins. 
President Cl*nt*n banned it because cloning is SL2 and President Cl*nt*n is SL0.

ralph, you have hit on the issue which will prevent computer controlled
cars, as well as most future revolutions.  if that computer fails and
kills someone, it is unclear in our litigious society, who gets sued.
what if your 6 yr old takes your computer driven car and it
hits someone?  what if you send your car unaccompanied to your
friend's house and it hits someone?  what if your computer car
is sitting still at a light and some yahoo who wants a new car
sees you asleep in the passenger side and backs into you, then
claims you hit her?  we insist that someone be responsible always,
even if the computer driven car is ten times safer.

Well, I assume that these computer driven shuttles could contain cameras that will document the entire trip from all possible angles.  If a certain accident occurs, one will always be able to refer to a digital recording of the accident.

How small can the quantum teleportation/telemetry devices be 
constructed?  Would it be possible to engineer biological systems 
with quantum telemetry inside cell structures?

Could devices be constructed that use quantum telemetry on a cellular 
level?  For example, could neurons be "bugged" so that each neuron 
has a unique i.d. and quantum transponder, so that nueral activity 
could be monitored from a far remote facility (on the moon or a 
distant planet)?

Could such a "machine" be spliced into the DNA gene sequences that 
encode nerve cells?

I have to disagree with your very first assumption about Mr. Gingrich - that he believes
in freedom - at least of the civil kind. His record clearly show that he does not look
kindly on civil liberties; and his ideas, futuristic though they may be, do not represent
progress in any measurable way I consider it.  I could be wrong, but I distinctly recall
that Mr Newt was on the side of those opposing any kind of cloning research.  On the
other hand, one of the few sane voices calling for rational inquiry into cloning was
Senator Harkin (D-Iowa), who by the way is a vocal fan of Star Trek and science fiction
in general.  He believes very strongly in space exploration, the search for
extraterrestrial intelligence, and advanced scientific and technological research.

As to lumping together politicians, I draw the line on anybody who advocates the death
penalty for a victimless crime.  I don't care if he is on Extropy Institutes Board of
Directors or a research nanotechnologist.

As to the rest of your post, unique and fascinating as always. :-)

I have to agree, in part, with Eliezer's assessment of
Gingrich. I've spoken with Newt Gingrich on a variety of
occasions and found him to be intelligent and open-minded.
Gingrich's only crime was that he was too moderate for
a GOP that, with prodding from the Christian Coalition and
other groups within the Christian Right, is tending towards
a more extreme right-wing stance. To an extent, this
shift within the GOP was necessitated by a moderation of the
Democrats.

I'd much prefer a Newt Gingrich as a leader of the GOP than
a Helms, Livingston, Archer, or Armey. The fiscal dementia
sported by the extreme right factions of the GOP don't need
a highly-visible proselytizer in place as de facto GOP 
congressional leader.

However, not all is gloomy. I suspect Gingrich will return to
public life (or attempt to). I would not be surprised to see
a Bush-Gingrich ticket in 2000.

Can we get a few facts in here? Not all men in Afghanistan are for the
Taliban. I guess many would love to see them blown to bits. The problem is
the ultra-extremists with guns that are telling everyone else how to act.
Its not exactly like the population greeted them with great warmth when
they entered Kabul. Information for the oppressed is always a useful
commodity (whether it would have any affect on the Taliban is another
question).

No ones answered my previous question: how do you attack problems much
closer to hand. For instance the insane guys shooting doctors offering
abortions. I would have thought if you could crack the memetic set of
Bible-beat Christians you would be ready to take on the World. If you can't
then any talk of changing the much more extreme (I know its hard to
believe) Taliban is just idle posturing.

Yes and no.  Cloning probably not.  However, a liberal/conservative with a
high SL can still be even more dangerous.  cf. any of the various
techno-socialist schemes that occasionally get posted here and elsewhere.
Insert old sayings about technology and morality here.

I'd say that sf and libertarianism are extensionally equivalent in a few
(mostly trivial) ways, but that in general they don't have all that much to
say about one another, ie they're mostly unrelated.

I'd rather have a libertarian with SL0 running the country than a fascist
w/ SL4+.

>President Cl*nt*n banned it because cloning is SL2 and President Cl*nt*n

I think he banned cloning because he's an authoritarian with SL0.  If he
were an authoritarian with SL2, he would have made it only available with
gov't license and supervision.  Interestingly enough, however, a rational
libertarian wouldn't have banned cloning at all, no matter WHAT their shock
level was.  (Non-initiation of force and all that.)

I don't think the term "quantum telemetry" is a very good one.  As I
remarked earlier, explanations of quantum teleportation in terms
of "transfer of quantum information" are misleading.  No "quantum
information" is transferred in the normal sense that we think of
information transfer.  No useful signal can be transmitted, for example.

To do telemetry of biological systems, quantum or otherwise, you will
need conventional technology which can send a conventional signal to the
receiving device.  In my opinion, supported as well by the comments I
posted earlier, this classical information is good enough for the kinds
of purposes Ken is asking about.  Adding quantum state measurement is
frosting the frosting and is very likely unnecessary.

Here again the misconception of quantum teleportation as a mystical
linkage between the two end stations seems to be rearing its head.
You need a conventional measurement and a conventional communication
system as a prerequisite for quantum teleportation.  Probably nanotech
would enable such a system of neural measurements, although I don't
know what would be the best way to distinguish the signals as they
emerged from the brain.  Maybe chemical tags could be used, every
neuron pumping state into the blood stream which would be picked up,
organized, and transmitted by a special transmission organ/machine.

I doubt it, but perhaps in the future people could have two parallel
"genomes", one DNA based and one nanotech based.  As the organism
developed the nanotech system would activate and cause itself to be built
into the organism.  This way you could be born with nanotech improvements
all through your body that would carry on to your offspring.  With such
a system you could probably arrange for your neurons to transmit their
state in near real time.

I don't see how, the immune system figures out what is self

the information for them is coded in DNA in the nucleus not
the mitochondria.

I was reading http://www.darpa.mil abstracts on "Large Scale 
Information Storage Systems Research", and they mentioned "Quantum 
Dots".

What are quantum dots?

Do we currently have storage and retrieval systems using this method?

How does this compare in efficiency to molecular tape?

Basically, the position of the carbon that is decaying is important.  Which
part of the nucleotide (DNA monomer) is this carbon a member of and how
much damage to nearby atoms does it cause when it decays?  If the carbon is
on the sugar-phosphate backbone of a strand it might cause breakage, if it
is in the nitrogenous base damage would probably be less severe and the
nucleotide in question would just be replaced by the enzymes which
constantly error check our chromosomes by recognizing mishapen or
incorrectly paired nucleotides.

One thing that amazes me is how people seem to need to have something 
to rebel against.  There is all this talk about who replaces 
Gingrich.

Why don't we talk about what replaces Washington D.C., biennial 
elections, and other such obsolete idiocy?

Sooner or later, we are going to need to stop sending all of our 
money to a bunch of empty wooden chairs sitting in old marble 
buildings.  The people come and go, and the institutions just sit 
there, as completely inanimate objects doing nothing more than 
keeping a bunch of historical documents safe from erosion.

As long as the focus in on "the people" and not "the process", we're 
just a bunch of sheep wasting our time and money waiting around for 
something better.

Why don't we collectively start thinking about openly suggesting 
something better.

Assuming, with the stroke of a pen, our leaders simply cancelled all 
funding, effectively immediately, for the DEA, FCC, and FDA, what 
then do we do with all the unemployed Federal Workers?

Many of us resent these institutions.  But if we were called upon to 
make the decision of how to eliminate them outright, how would we 
implement that decision?

What the hell do we do?  Just have Clinton make a National address, 
saying "due to statistical projections, information technology, and 
local leadership resources that are in place, we no longer are 
required to collect tax revenues.  The IRS has been disbanded, and 
you are no longer required to pay Federal Income Taxes.  The military 
advises me that we have 40 years of petroleum reserves to supply the 
tanks, ships, and aircraft, so the military will remain strong, even 
without the taxes being collected."

Will some of the readers on this list do me a favor and play "King 
for a Day", and come up with some scenarios that can be acted upon.

Otherwise, we're just going to watch generation after generation of 
egomaniac power brokers doing nothing but maximizing their Nielsen 
ratings.

Nobody has made an entire organ yet but you can do a lot with just the cells.
Geron has already manufactured mouse heart muscle cells from mouse stem cells,
when the muscle cells were injected into a living mouse they found their way to
the heart and successfully integrated into it supplementing the muscle already there.
In a similar way it should be possible to use pancreatic cells to cure diabetes,
neuron cells to treat Parkinson's disease and stroke, retina cells to treat
blindness and bone marrow cells to treat cancer. My hunch is that the first
complete organ they'll aim at is the liver, it can grow fast.

Wow Ken!  Feeling a little ambitious this evening are we.  I can answer
half your question (the biology half).  Maybe some well meaning physist can
answer the other half.  I'm not up to speed on quantum teleportaion
devices, but I know the theory behind them.  For any computational
structure that is possible, you could certainly build it in a living
creature as protein sequences (and if its protein you can code for it with
DNA).  The technology is not here yet, we still have the infamous protein
folding problem to overcome befor this is possible.  The only limiting
problem (excluding current technological limitations), as you have pointed
out, is size.  There are a very large number of variables involved in the
transmission of signals from a single neuron so this might get to be a
large piece of protein hardware (not just a simple on/off transmission). 
You do realize that current quantum teleportation techniques still require
a convential EM signal to transmit half the message though, right?  Or have
things changed recently?

Peter

P.S,  Why would you want to monitor every single neuron in someone at a
distance?  Maybe have an extension of yourself in many places at one time? 
OOH AHH, I like it!

Is there such a thing as quantum telepathy?

Remember the movie "Brainstorm" with Natalie Wood?  If AT&T had such 
a device, would they be able to announce it to the public, or would 
it simply be too shocking and complex for the average citizen to 
comprehend and use responsibly?

Yeah.  It would make conference calls between people much more 
interesting.  If the majority of callers were moved to tears, my tear 
ducts would well as well.

I wrote this for the list on Oct 7 of last year.
=============================================

Unless we find a replacement for field effect transistors Moore's law will
eventually come to an end, although IBM's recent technique of using copper
instead of aluminum in a IC probably gave us an additional 5 or 10 years
breathing room. Power dissipation in a FET can be a real problem, as is
trying to interconnect billions of different transistors, even worse, when
the FET channel becomes very short quantum effects start to seriously degrade
performance. We can't change the laws of physics so we need a way to turn
Quantum Mechanics from an enemy to a friend.

Back in 1991 Craig Lent proposed we abandon transistors and capacitors, stop
using voltages to encode information and start using individual electrons in
a Quantum Cellular Automation (QCA). His idea was to have each cell of the
automation be made of 4 quantum dots arranged in a square and have each cell
contain 2 extra electrons. The electrons repel each other so they will always
try to get into quantum dots as far apart as possible, that is the dots at
the diagonal of the square. There are only 2 stable states such a cell can
be in:

  _____________                                              _____________
 |X                     0 |                                            |0                     X |
 |                          |                                            |                           |
 |  STATE 0          |                                            |  STATE 1           |
 |                          |                                            |                           |
 |0___________X|                                            |X___________0|



There is no direct connection between the 4 quantum dots but the 2 extra
electrons can move from dot to dot in a cell by quantum tunneling.
The electrons can't tunnel to other cells in the automation (a small increase
in distance means a huge decrease in the probability of successfully
tunneling) but the electrons in each cell can still feel how the charge is
distributed in a neighboring cell and will always stay as far apart as
possible. For example if you have a long row of such cells and you change the
first one to state 0 then that will change the second cell to state 0 and
that will change the third cell to state 0 and so on all the way down the
line. A signal sent in this way uses no current so almost no heat is
generated.

Because a cellular automation interacts with adjacent cells you could
intertwine several such "wires" to process information. Lent also designed
but did not build a quantum cellular automation adder.

Six years ago not many were very impressed with Lent's idea because they felt
the dots could never be made accurately enough and the slightest imperfection
would let the 2 electrons leak away in about a nanosecond. In the August 15
1997 issue of Science Lent and his associates report they have actually build
one cell of the automation. The cell operated just as Lent said it would,
it can be in only 2 states and can stay in one state for many minutes and the
electrons do not leak out.

The quantum dots in this prototype are huge, 8 microns across, so he had to
keep it at cryogenic temperatures, but Lent says in the article "QCA
architecture is scaleable to molecular levels and performance actually
improves as the size of the device is decreased. [...] a molecular sized QCA
would function at room temperature." Unlike transistors, the smaller these
things get the better they work

In an editorial in the same issue of Science Terry Fountain of University
College London call this new work "A new and promising possibility to shrink
computer architecture [...] by factors as much as 50,000 compared to the
smallest feasible transistor. [...] the remaining hurdles though daunting are
largely technical".

Compared to other lit. genres there seems to be a disproportionate no of sci
fi writers with libertarian leanings.
There's Jerry Pournelle, Larry Niven, Poul Anderson, Robert Heinlein,
Gregory Benford, David Brin (the last 2 have been associated with Reason
mag), L Neil Smith, Robert Anton Wilson, Victor Koman ...

Thanks -- does that mean we could insert foreign mitochondria into mature

You're right that I only know of Gingrich from profiles of him in Wired and
Reason. To the best of my knowledge the man is a pragmatist and a political
opportunist to a certain extent. He first ran as a socially moderate
Republican. His Contract with America was an attempt to unite social
conservatives and economic libertarians and to that extent he had to make
concessions but that doesn't mean he holds all the fundie-Christian views
you mentioned. To get some things done, he had to let other things through,
mostly symbolic concessions. After all, no homosexual in the US is actually
under any political persecution (with the exception of State anti-sodomy
laws) while no one has actually made abortion a criminal offence. There is a
difference too between being pro-choice and arguing that those who find
abortion morally repugnant should be forced to subsidise abortion.

Regarding his ideas, he has put Bionomics by Michael Rothschild on his
Congress reading list, he has spoken at Cato Institute functions, he has
praised the Tofflers who have advocated things which the Christian right
would regard as worthy of a burning at the stake. I suspect he is
sympathetic to libertarian ideas though he has some blind spots (like
drugs).

I think that that every political party claims to hold that idea :-)

I too believe that personal freedom is of utter importance, but I also feel
that there can be no freedom for the poor. And yes the free market is
probably one of the best ways to distribute wealth. But still there are
plenty of people who has no money and never will have.

Thus it seems fair to mee that those of us who has property and money also
give something of it away to those who has not, so they don't starve, has to
sleep on the street, can get any education and can be treated for their
illness'.

It's probably too hard for a Scandinavian to become a complete libertarian
;-)

Prolonged life via mitochondrial repair or replacement is a topic well
addressed by the articulate and knowledgeable British expert Aubrey de
Grey, who hangs out on sci.life-extension.  He's come up with a new
paradigm of mitochondrial ageing that has attracted an amount of interest
from his peers (and he's suggested some possible methods, based on that
model, for tweaking the system).

I discuss his work a little in my forthcoming THE LAST MORTAL GENERATION -
final draft about to go to the typesetters.  (Oz publication only so far,
due early 1999.)

Hi Max M and list

Writing from lovely Denmark Max said:

The market NEVER distributes wealth. It always increases net 
satisfaction, but it never distributes wealth. Only Gifts and Taxes can 
distribute.

>But still there are plenty of people who has no money and never will have.
There is no one who has no money. Especially in the sense of has no worth 
to others. How much would you pay for a life time of  houshold cleaning? 
That is the absolute minimum value. Remember too that economics are never 
about producing that which you are best at personally, it is always about 
producing that which you are relatively best at. Even if I am a better 
cleaner, if someone is a relatively better cleaner, I will pay them to do 
it for me if I am a relatively better neuro biologist.
  
>those of us who has property and money also

Each too his own. There is a thing in the talmud that I kind of agree 
with. Every 7 years, the fields were left for the poor to cultivate for a 
year.

  I know this effect is observed in the laboratory and I had not really
  asked
  why, but here goes my best guess. Any crystal is a highly organized
  structure which is made up of smaller repeating units.  The process is
one
  in which small units form first and then are gathered into a larger
  structure.  By quick freezing an object you may be able to slow molecules
  down before they are able to become highly organized. (The slower you
cool
  any crystal the more perfect its structure) It is large crystals which
are
  problems for cells.  They do nasty things like tearing cell membranes. 
If
  you freeze an object very quickly the crystals are probably kept in a
less
  organized state and of a diameter which is not particularly dangerous to
  cells.
  I hope that helped.  Peter

Is this the same "ban cryptography, total surveillance, anarchists are evil"
David Brin who's posted here in the past, or is this another David Brin 
I've never previously heard of? If it's the former I don't know how anyone

For what it's worth I'd much prefer a government that remained clueless

I had thought that having a techno-savvy politico like Al Gore was a good
thing until he showed his true colors on crypto.

This is getting absurd.  <sarcasm> Why don't we debate Gingrich's skill at
chess?  I've always thought a good chess player, what with their
complicated problem solving machinery and all, would have than enough
intelligence in place to govern a nation. </sarcasm>

While I agree that it's nice for Congress to be forward-looking, it would
be much nicer if he had more libertarian leanings than it would be that he
be at Future Shock level 4.  The future can take care of itself; all we
want/need gov't to do is get out of the way!

Household power plants are not a cost effective source of energy. Normal
household sized fossil fuel base generators generally have an energy cost of
between $0.15-$0.75 per kilowatt hour. Present day solar and wind plants for
the home also are in the $0.250-$0.500 per kwh range. The new thin film
amorphous solar cells that have been 'coming to market' for the past 6
years, built into roofing shingles, are supposedly in the $0.120-$0.250 per
kwh range, but I have yet to see any installations. Considering that the
average for the US is around $0.075 per kwh, this technology, as well as all
other household based power generation, is only usable in two areas a)
extreme rural/wilderness locations, and b) areas that pay $0.12-$0.17 per
kwh already for centralized power. Also, because small power plants do not
load share and cross tie with other generators and consumers, the energy
efficiency is lower and the pollution levels per kwh are much higher (for
the fossil fuel sources, of course).

Nah, we've just gotten a lot more subscribers from Europe, New Zealand and
Australia. Consequently, the number of people with socialist leanings has
gone up. They seem to have this quirky notion that you can make everything
equal for everyone without stealing anything from anybody, or annoying anyone

while they do it. Of course, the stupermagical Promised One of nano tech is
 THE WAY to do it, bringing back the old saw of the 'workers paradise'.

As for the Popular Mechanics, why not? Acheiving self soverignty through
technology is gonna take practical thinking and lots of technical work, far
beyond just heady philosophical talk of PPLs, PPAs, etc.

Getting down to nuts and bolts is the first indication that a) people see
extropianism as more than just pie in the sky-ism, and b) 'we have the
technology, we can rebuild him, make him better....'

ah yes...but any port in a storm so to speak when bashing a fallen opponent...

Thanks for saying it.  I started to doubt myself here, because the David Brin I
know is anything but a libertarian.  As far as I know he advocates equality,
equal tyranny and surveillance for everyone.

The types of damage to biological caused by 
temperatures below their optimum are manifold, 
and still largely unknown. Proteins denaturate, 
as a result some superstructures are damaged or 
fragment, lipid bilayers undergo phase transitions, 
as the result integral membrane protein structure 
and/or their distribution get disturbed. Further 
down the slow thermal descent (only tiny specimens 
can be cooled rapidly) extracellular ice growth 
begins, increasing the cytosol concentration 
(which in itself is denaturating to many proteins). 
Randomly oriented ice crystals anisotropically 
deform tissue by pushing it along their main 
growth axis. If ice is removed by freeze-substitution 
(washed out with, say, isopropanol at dry ice 
temperature), the resulting tissue strongly resembles 
an irregular mesh, with about 100 um holes iirc. Though 
difficult to assess without watching the dynamics 
process/using cell markers, the whole tissue looks 
scrambled (randomly, nonlinearly distorted). If 
frozen tissue is warmed, ice crystals melt suddenly, 
resulting shrunken cells full of highly concentrated 
cytosol to be surrounded by solute of low ionic 
strength -- causing cells to rupture due to osmotic 
shock, resulting membrane debris closing up into 
vesicles. You think you see lots of intact structures, 
but a lot of them are just artefacts. (Notice that
most of these points, grave as they are, are largely
irrelevant to the gros of the patients, where
factors like system-wide damages due to the original 
disease/age, hour-long normothermic ischaemic 
damage (go neuro, people, the periphery is junked, 
anyway), clotting and spotty perfusion, mechanical 
damague due to brain swelling etc. dominate 
overwhelmingly).

Of course we do not need to warm the patient for 
reconstruction, in fact the only way to do a mapping 
at molecular scale is to do it in solid state, using 
the structure as blueprints only. Since the scan is 
destructive, you essentially rebuild the structure 
anew minus the suspension damage (using damn 
smart filters), whether physically, or as model 
in machina (at least slicewise,as you will need 
for applying smart filtering, anyway). However, 
you are still facing a severe, very probably 
irreversible information loss due to the 
'turbulent' deformations (irreversible mapping: 
a given distorted structure could have been 
originated by a large number of structures, which 
are all more or less equally probable).

To avoid such information lossage we can use 
vitrification, fixation (with a complex perfusate/protocol 
which would have to be developed) and subsequent 
storage at low temperatures or uploading in vivo 
('gradual uploading'), which has the major advantage 
of supplying lots of low-level operation signatures 
for what is an essentially indefinite duration (which,
at the top level, you can even tweak or correlate 
with sensomotoric information). If the duration 
(hours to decades) and resolution (say, a 
sample/um^3) of the sampling is good enough, 
you essentially don't need to make a molecular 
map anymore.

Unfortunately, you need devices made with the 
mechanosynthetic paradigm, which is not yet validated.

In theory, yes.  But delivering foreign mitochondria is a fearsomely difficult
task.  They're big, they're numerous, and they're everywhere.  Your best bet
would be in giant cells like sensory/motor neurons and muscle fibers - which,
fortunately, is probably where they'd be of most use.  You'd need to introduce
fixed or foreign mitochondria to an accessible spot on the cell and then
provide it with a selective advantage over the residents.  Of course, you 
don't want to harm all resident mitochondria as that would really harm
cells that aren't infected (most, by almost any method)  One idea would
be for the introduced mitochondria to convert an administered drug into
something toxic to other mitochondria.  

>Is this a shortcut to rev up metabolism?

Not in general.  Mitochondria only encode a very few proteins critical for
aerobic metabolism.  You're not going to be able to improve on them, and 
the control is from nuclear genes.  You could use introduced mitochondria
to replace damaged mitochondria in long-lived cells; accumulated mitochondrial
damage is one hypothesis for the aging of non-dividing cells like
nerves and muscle.

First of I must say that I find death to be the ultimate form of loss of
freedom.

In my POW there is a scale of freedom that goes like this:

Absolute Freedom -> Wealth -> middle class wealth -> annoying lack of
money ->
Powerty -> inability to feed one self properly -> No food at all -> Death

I think that being poor is the ultimate form of imprissonment there is. Just
slightly better than death.

Therefore I find it is fair to steal money from those who has "wealth" and
"middle class wealth" to help those who has "powerty" or less.

"Making the rich 2% unhappier to make the poor 200% happier"

When that is done I also believe that ultimately those people should be able
to feed themself. Therefore I find it to be a good idea to steal even more
money from the more wealthy, to give the poor a free education. Then they
will become a productive part of society and there will be an ROI that will
benefit all of the society.

The educated mind is the greatest raw material there is.

Economics is a win win scenario, and taking money away from the wealthy and
investing them in other peoples education/helping the poor can eventually
make the wealthier even wealthier as society as a whole becomes wealthier
and the newly rich start spending their money.

I think this is obvious from watching history. I would rather be poor and
unemployed today in Denmark than I would want to be King Richard of England
:-)

And no. I don't believe that the individual investor and the invisible hand
will automatically find a similar solution. At least not without the
consquences being to big for the poor.

Another thing though is the level of taxation taking place now, which I find
has reached absurd proportions. At least here in Denmark. I currently pay at
least 65% of my total income to different taxes! This I do find rather
enslaving.


btw. I am considdered to be right wing here in Denmark :-)

I dunno about that, but the U.S. martime industry also uses the "European"
system, i.e. dd/mm/yyyy, perhaps because of its roots in the UK-dominated
world of the 18th and 19th centuries, but likely just because uniformity is
important.

It's funny you should say that, although I've never met the man and doubt he knows I
exist, Senator Harkin is my cousin. I've lost track of that branch of the family, my mother

It is mostly a matter of access and education - I can access a lot of
fun scientific journals from my office workstation since the Institute
supplies online access, but I do not have equal access to other
fields. And of course, I'm not an economist or even well educated in
econonmy, so you really should take my taste in that area with a grain
of salt. As you should in other areas too, I suppose :-)

 I say, that's a  bit of an exaggeration, what?  To caricature the American view,
each person magically acquires all that they have by entirely by their own
efforts, and at some point begin trading in the great market with the goods so
acquired.

 Those with more of a sense of history might think much of what you posses is a
gift from the Past, (e.g. language, culture, technology), and feel moved to
continue that trade into the future. I don't see any conflict in this with the
Extropian Principles as posted by Max.

 Since I believe in maximizing freedom of the individual, I wouldn't want to
force trading between the past and the future on others. I'm hopeful than
self-replicating systems and the like will enable total individualists to go
their own way, and various forms of collective association association to
flourish. For me, the negative in Socialism is the coercion of those who don't
desire to redistribute any of their wealth, not the desire to take part in a
"gift culture" as well as a money market one.

According to the chemistry textbook I have in my bookshelf the
abundancy in living material is one in 10^12. The human genome is
roughly 6e9 nucleotides, each having around 10 carbon atoms - hence
each cell has 6e10 carbon atoms in the genome. The chance of having
just one C14 is one in 17; of these just 1% suffers decay in a
century. The problem is likely minor compared to other sources of
damage.

There's no law against gifts under lf-capitalism.  Indeed, arguably one of
the biggest advantages of anarcho-capitalism (for those who are keen on
this sort of thing) is that all you have to do to create anarcho-socialism
in an anarcho-capitalist society is share all of your property with those
of like minds.  Compare this to gov't mediated socialism or socialism as
outlined by Marx, who conceded that it might even take *another revolution*
to get from socialism to utopia, and you can see that anarcho-capitalism is
much more in line with "gift culture" communism than socialism could ever be.

Ultimately, those who want to reach anarcho-socialism but recognize that it
is not immediately attainable should recognize that the best way to get
there is through anarcho-capitalism, not through the nationalization of
property.

Good point! Collective association's (like trade unions) can be
beneficial, and often absolutely necessary when dealing with an
organization that is both capitalist, and feudalist (almost any
modern corporation).

In recent negotiations, we started by opening up our thinkpads
pulling up the spreadsheets and saying " I thought we'd start by
talking about the recent 2 billion dollar stock bye-back, the 6%
increase in shareholder dividends, and management compensation for
the last three years."

We settled for a modest 4.1% increase per anum and a three year
contract.    ;)

Just trying to concatenate the general gist of the socialist ethic.

Trading labor to add value to raw resources or rough goods is the basis of trade
under any system. Socialism merely says that the consumer has no voice in the market,
and that the owner of property has no say in the use of that property, if they are
allowed to keep that property.

But who decides? Also, socialism does not care about trading into the future, it
wishes to squander present day resources by taking them away from those who use them
most efficiently and giveing them to those who are least efficient with them. Its a
lateral, not a forward thinking philosophy.

Thats what many Americans like so much about our own system. Did you know that
Americans give a higher percentage ( thats percentage, not dollar amount) of their
per capita income to charitable use than any other country in the world. Yeah, we are
just a buncha greedy bastids. We're so bad, thinking that we might know what to do
with our own money better than some government bureaucrat.

Hi Max

To which Max replied

That is Marx in a nutshell: property is theft, ergo theft is justice.
Unfortunately,even in the Utilitarian cloths in which you dress your 
wolf, the sums don't compute.

Take a miniature country like NZ or Denmark. They are both 100 Billion 
dollar economies. Bill gates could give us a holiday for 180 days, then 
all his money is gone.
 
Add up all the other rich people and your sentence becomes

"take all the wealth form the rich and make everyone happy for about 1 
day."
 
>taking money away from the wealthy and

>make the wealthier even wealthier.

Nope. It just makes people stop work. Galt's Gulch. There are quite nice 
equations for this now. In New Zealand the Treasury suggests that the 
optimal tax rate to maximise GNP and government income is in the mid 20s.

>btw. I am considdered to be right wing here in Denmark :-)
I guess that is because people forget that Denmark had an explicit 
eugenics program to enhance the IQ of its population ;-) Skin heads 
keeping out "inferior" colours of immigrant is also suggests 

In truth, Denmark has little to fear from socialism. Your people are so 
honest and intelligent that the whole system is highly self organising. I 
thoroughly enjoyed both my trips to Copenhagen and Aarhus for that 
reason. I recognised immediately why Denmark's Jewish population mostly 
survived the Nazis: Danes are decent human beings.

best,
tim

hi damien - sending this to the list as well in case i am misunderstood 
more widely.

Damien Broderick noted [off list] that a sentence in my last email is 
broken.

>>I guess that is because people forget that Denmark had an explicit 
>>eugenics program to enhance the IQ of its population ;-) Skin heads 
>>keeping out "inferior" colours of immigrant is also suggests 

>The sentence about skinheads appears to have been truncated.  I wonder if

For Daniel and the wider audience, I first wrote to "... suggests that 
there is a significant facist right in denmark."

I changed my mind and wrote  "keeping out "inferior" colours of immigrant 
is not a good advertisment for Denmark."

Somehow, neither got sent. Oh well.

I was referring to a news item from earlier this year in which skinhead 
gangs were shown "standing guard" at the road entries to denmark 
"discouraging" non-whites from coming to Denmark.

PS: In part, reflects of how little use is the term "right wing". As the 
late Hans Eysenck pointed out, both Stalin and Hitler were authoriatarian 
butchers, and it seems uninformative to call one left-, and the other 
right- wing. In many ways the libertarian philosophy is radical left but 
is typically characterised as radical right. The terms are of little 
value in practice. Sociology has failed, as far as I can see to give us a 
useful term.

Told you "need" NT? Point them to Amazon.com and this informational site.

http://yunus.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~kosart/unix-nt.html

A quote:

For Windows 95 and NT users, one of the most popular places on the Web to 
get freeware and shareware is a site called www.windows95.com which due 
to the immense popularity of the site, requires a robust operating system 
and Web servers. Since all the software offered at this site is 
exclusively for Windows 95 or NT, and the overall flavor tends to be very 
pro Microsoft, one would assume that NT servers running IIS would be the 
logical choice for their Internet solution. Well, here's a quote from one 
of their own Web pages: What hardware and software is Windows95.com 
running on? 

We use Pentium Pro computers running the BSDI UNIX operating system with 
Apache Web server software. Our servers are connected to the Internet via 
multi-homed T3 connections. 

Note: This quote is from February 1998. They recently changed their name 
from Windows95.com to WinFiles.com although they still have use of the 
windows95.com domain name. This change transpired in March 1998.

When that is done I also believe that ultimately those people should be able
to feed themself. Therefore I find it to be a good idea to steal even more
money from the more wealthy, to give the poor a free education. Then they
will become a productive part of society and there will be an ROI that will
benefit all of the society.

The educated mind is the greatest raw material there is.

Economics is a win win scenario, and taking money away from the wealthy and
investing them in other peoples education/helping the poor can eventually
make the wealthier even wealthier as society as a whole becomes wealthier
and the newly rich start spending their money.<<


	These comments seem very puzzling to me. Why do people become
wealthy? Either by inheriting wealth, working and earning wealth, or by
theft of wealth. We may or may not agree on the merits of taking money from
those of us who inherit wealth or earn wealth, but we usually agree that
increasing wealth by simply taking it from someone else is not right. So
why would you propose to do just that - take from the rich to give to the
poor, by coercion? You appear to be disregarding liberty and personal
freedom in favour of some misguided socialist notion of equality.
	OK, so I agree that the amount of poor may seem to be a great
injustice. But why forcefully tax wealthy simple on the basis that they
have more money than others?
	I feel that we should start looking not at taxing the rich, but
rather where does the rich's wealth come from and hence why are the poor in
such a position.
	Socialists would argue that capitalism's success lies on
exploitation of workers. So one would assume that all capitalist businesses
are greedy exploiters of the common worker. This argument is not true for
all cases. Sure, there are some businesses run by selfish arseholes, but if
the socialists are right then every business, to succeed, is run by selfish
arseholes. But there are a myriad of businesses, small and large, which
take people with little apparent capital and succeed in operating
efficiently in our capitalist world while at the same time not exploiting
the worker - actually improving the lot of him/her better than any
government would do.
	So we can now state that the capitalist system is currently being
run by a mixture of decent business people and selfish arseholes. From this
we could argue that some people are poor because;
      a. they want to be so.
      b. selfish arseholes effectively 'oppress' them.

	Argument a. seems unlikely so we could assume that b. is true.
So we can now argue that it is the selfish arseholes responsible for
denying some their freedom they strive for. If this is the case (which I am
inclined to believe is more often than not) then it is clear that rather
than taxation on those who are rich, legal discourse be taken on those who
oppress rights of freedom (the selfish arseholes in this case).

	So we can still address the problems of the poor while not having
to revert to authoritarian means of state 'redirection'.

I have never said that you should take all the money away from the reich.
The rich are no longer as important as they once where. As you say B.Gates
can give us a nice long vacation but that is all.

He certainly does a better job investing his money than my current
government would :-)

I was arguing whether it was fair to tax at all to help the "poor."

It will not help to tax the poor ;-) Besides, to make an oversimplified
example. If a person has NO money at all and is at the verge of starving to
death, and somebody else has $1000 Billion Dollars and the cost of keeping
the poor one alive would be $1000, then the cost of keeping the poor person
alive is pretty neglible for the wealthy and thus represent very little loss
of wealth and liberty. For the poor one on the other hand it means all the
difference in the world. the $1000 is worth far more for the poor than the
wealthy.

Naturally it would be nonsense taxing somebody who has $2000 to give some of
it to one who has merely $1000. The problem is in finding the right balance.

Another thing is that the $1000 does not just dissapear, they get spend in
the general economy so the net loss is actually a lot less than $1000
dollars as most of them will be earned back by the wealthy.

> Socialists would argue that capitalism's success lies on
>exploitation of workers

Maybe they will, but I don't considder myself to be a socialist and cannot
answer for those people. I think that bussines is great. I love capitalism
and I love to buy stuff ... The explotation of workers seems like a pretty
old fashioned idea. Especially for people working in the IT biz like I do
where there is a lack of skilled workers.

c. They are unable to bring themself out of their memetic and genetic
condition.

In the old days when most Danes lived in the country there was something
called a "bad family". A family that had been up to no good for generations.
Where the parents where loosers, drunks, beggars etc. and the kids would
grow up and be the same.

They still exists but are harder to find these days because we don't live in
smalltown societies anymore. The kids often ends up being criminal, working
in the sex industri, being on wellfare, getting no education etc. I have
worked with these kids, and their minds are wired in a way that is hard to
believe. Their memetic makeup is twisted in unbelievable ways. Some find
that being on welfare is is cool, and cheating the system is the coolest of
all. They don't see that ultimately they are cheating themself. They often
think that everything is the societys fault. And naturally they will.
Because everything they get, they get from society. Their parents
(in)directly teach them that that is the way it is done.

Children of people with social problems are most often those who get social
problems themself.

It is this wheel of missery that needs to be broken. This I believe can only
be done by giving the kids better oportunities than those of their parents.
Better education, better friends etc.

We must fix the cause of powerty not just the symptoms, but we got to keep
the patient alive while doing it.

I don't believe that oppression by the rich is the problem at all. Not here
in Danmrak at least.

Here I don't agree.

The real problem here in Denmark though is that most of the tax's goes to
serve the middle class. Taking from the middle class and giving to the
middle class. That is an absurd idea, but it steems from the fact that
middle class voters is by far the largest voter group thus the politicians
must serve their needs. Paradoxically they are also the group who has the
most money. Thus the money must come from them too. Or so the logic goes :-)

Correct. I'd also like to add that work is (usually) degrading too, and should
be abolished where possible. An intelligent being should not be forced to
spend a third of each weekday (sometimes more) in a place he doesn't want 
to be, doing work he hates, only to sustain himself. This comes close to torture
(I'm quite serious about this). They don't call them "wage slaves" for nothing.

Yes, as long as this money is used for automation, so that the people
you help will never have to work again (while maintaining/aquiring a
good standard of living). Preferably, the state should legalize drugs,
prostitution, gambling etc, and start offering these services itself
(perhaps with a semi-monopoly) to finance the transition from work
state to auto-state. Only if this wouldn't be sufficient, taxes should
be used to fill in the gaps. What we need is a national or even global
"Manhattan Project" to abolish work for once and for all. Everybody
works hard one last time to set up an automated society, then 
"relaxes" forever. Of course, there are always those people that want 
more than just the average. They will create their own economy,
and be the driving force behind progress. People that live on "machine
support" can always try to join the working class (all white collar jobs)
after having received sufficient free education. Voila, the "perfect" 
society. Of course, this ignores the Singularity, but for the sake of 
argument...

You could still provide free (automated) education, but no longer to
prepare people for some stupid, degrading job but to learn them to
think critically, and provide some general knowledge of the world
etc.

Yeah, libertarians tend to overestimate the mental capacity of Joe
Average...To create a pleasant society, one needs smart people 
(and machines) to run the show. "Coercion" for their own good. Sad
but true.

I concede to Anders estimate Spike (10^12).  I'll refer you to geophysics
and carbon dating pages which estimate the total terrestrial supply of C-14
at 60 metric tons as compared to the mass of all carbon forms as 40
trillion metric tons.  See

I must admit I don't know. I just trusted the textbook (*very*

Minnesota has not had a major party Governor for 12 years. Jesse was at the low
20's for percentages up until the debates. Hubert Humphrey III demanded that
Jesse be included in them because he thought that it would hurt his opponent
more than he. Turns out Jesse did great in the debates and was the only one with
some new exciting ideas, and could talk like a normal human being. It will be
interesting to see what develops of his administration.

Brin had a rather extended and at time vile conversation with a number of us a
year or so ago on this list vis a avis privacy issues in general. While his
logic of making everyone accountable to everyone else  due to total open
survellance would definitely result in little crime or exploitation, and
possibly enhance the market by fact that it would result in much better
price/value signals, he is, like communists/socialists in the past and many
social engineers today, trying to push a change of behavior which is totally
contrary to human nature. ignoring the fact that most people LIKE their privacy,
his concept has little possibility of being accepted unless the population is
scared into it by a totalitarian propaganda machine........ hmmmm, that sounds
familiar....

Dear all,

Since I've also become a slave of the 
free market I can't follow up on all of this....

But I think there is a bit more to it then 
"steal from the rich and give it to the poor"

What about " I need somebody to wake me 
if I have a cryo-contract "
If you had all the money in the world, you still
could not buy a "friend" who made sure you 
will be revived.

and the other one:

" who will guard the guards"


I prefer a Social-liberal-capitalistic way

Oddly enough, this may be the optimum way to make rich people happy. As I have
heard it, studies on happiness show people are happy when features that they
value are increasing. Someone with a constant one million dollar income is
likely to report themselves less happy than someone whose income rises from
10,000 to 20,000. This suggests that getting the rich to start over every decade
may maximize their happiness.

 I was at a conference this weekend, "Dennett's Philosophy of Mind". (Dennet is
the author of "Consciousness Explained" and "Darwins Dangerous Idea".) Dennett
reported on one study of happiness in which the highest scoring group were
quadriplegics. The "explanation" was that they were starting from a very low
base, and had long term prospects (with improving technology and all) of steady
improvement.

 If this research is accurate, a rational libertarian should voluntarily give
away most of their wealth every so often to maximize happiness. The short term
hit after giving it away is more than compensated for by the long term
opportunity to rebuild from a low base. It is rather counter intuitive though.
How convincing would the research need to be for people on this list to adopt
such a strategy? What would be the economic effects (Robin?)?

Mike, thanks for the info. I did a WEB search and found the guys WEB site.

http://www.jesseventura.org/default.htm

My god, here is a platform I would actually feel good voting for. For the
past ten years I have held my nose and voted to the candidate I disliked the
least. Lately I have just been voting libertarian as a protest vote. I
figured if the alternative parties got at least 10% of the vote it might
wake up the main political parties to get them out of our personal lives.
Here is someone who actually could win an election on issues I agree with
for the most part! I wish we had someone in California that would run on a
similar platform. Any extropians into politics who want to run on a similar
platform would get my vote.

Best Ralph

Really?  A desire for privacy is part of human nature?  Are there any
studies that support that hypothesis?  Do you mean to say that there was
some evolutionary advantage available to those who preferred to be alone?
The only survival value I can think of off the top of my head would be that
when one was alone and unmonitored, one had an opportunity to hide, or to
steal, or do something else unbeknownst to the rest of the tribe that would
give one some sort of unfair (but effective) advantage.  Any other
advantages come to mind that might have resulted in a preference for privacy
being hard-wired into our circuitry?

Does anyone (e.g. Extropy Institue) have a way to put
the interview on a server so that we could see it through
a multimedia streamer like "RealPlayer" or something?
It would be nice to see Greg's interview, but I'm thinking
also about other multimedia events that could be shared
in the future.  Natasha's recent radio interview for example.
Just an idea.

Freezing (and reviving!) people ought to be a normal 
business, not something relying on friendship relations
or set of beliefs as it is now. You do trust your bank/insurance/
mail-order business, do you? Why should cryonics be an
exception from that rule?

Well, I grew up in Southern Louisiana (a.k.a. Acadiana) and I don't
believe in giving.  I believe in sharing as in "Share the Wealth."
Laissez-faire Capitalism is the only reliable way I can find to reach the
"socialist" ideals.

Thought some of you might be interested in a conference I am involved in
organising. Though the issue of uploading is probably a little wild for the
conference proper, the areas covered will certainly be relevant, and there
will certainly be lots of time to talk about wilder things between papers.

This will be the 3rd ASSC conference: the first at Claremont concentrated
on consciousness and implicit processing; the 2nd in Bremen on the neural
correlates of consciousness; the 4th in Brussels in 2000 is intended to
look at capacity limits in consciousness.

       ASSOCIATION FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF CONSCIOUSNESS

            CALL FOR PAPERS, POSTERS & WORKSHOP PRESENTERS
                           FOR A CONFERENCE ON:

 CONSCIOUSNESS AND SELF:  NEURAL, COGNITIVE, AND PHILOSOPHICAL ISSUES

                    UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN ONTARIO
                 JUNE 4-7, 1999: LONDON, ONTARIO, CANADA


The third conference of the Association for the Scientific Study of
Consciousness will be held from June 4-7, 1999, at the University of
Western Ontario in London, Ontario, on the theme of "Consciousness and
Self".

Consciousness involves not just the passive experience of sensory
contents, but the active involvement of an agent. Phenomena such as
volition, social cognition, metacognition, self-recognition, self-
modeling, reflection, and planning all suggest that self-related phenomena
may be central to an understanding of consciousness.

Recent neurophysiological and neuroimaging research has linked these
self-related activities to specific brain activities, especially in
prefrontal cortex. Neuropsychologists have studied numerous disorders of
the self, often forcing our intuitive ideas about self to be revised.
Psychologists have investigated the role of self and agency in memory,
personality, volition, metacognition, and many other areas. Cognitive
models have suggested a central role for executive systems in
understanding these self-related phenomena of consciousness. And
philosophers have analyzed the relationship between consciousness, self,
and self-consciousness, with some arguing that self-directed cognition is
at the core of consciousness. The third ASSC conference will bring together
researchers from numerous disciplines to discuss these issues.  Topics that

will be discussed include:

  --the role of executive systems in conscious agency
  --neuropsychological disorders of the self
  --brain imaging of self-related processes
  --the role of prefrontal cortex
  --self-recognition in animals and humans
  --consciousness and metacognition
  --self-knowledge and theory of mind in schizophrenia and autism
  --the relationship between consciousness and self-consciousness
  --the role of self-knowledge in memory
  --the role of self-models in spatial cognition and action
  --the relation between sensory perception and controlled action
  --the unity or multiplicity of "the self"
  --cross-cultural conceptions of self
  --face perception and consciousness

Confirmed speakers include: Jonathan Cole, Chris Frith, George Gallup Jr.,
Marc Jeannerod, Nancy Kanwisher, Alan Leslie, Tom Nelson, Thomas
Metzinger, Morris Moscovitch, David Perrett, Giacomo Rizzolatti, David
Rosenthal, Endel Tulving, and Daniel Wegner.


-------------------------
CALL FOR PAPERS & POSTERS
-------------------------

While the central theme of ASSC 3 is "consciousness and self", speakers
in concurrent sessions are invited to talk on any topic relevant to the
scientific study of consciousness.  Physiological, psychological, and
philosophical perspectives are all welcome.

Submissions for both posters and talks will be accepted. Any person
may present only one submission, but may be co-author on more
than one. Oral presentations will be limited to 20 minutes, to be
followed by a 10-minute discussion period.

Concurrent sessions, posters, symposia, and plenary lectures will
all be held in the Social Science Centre at The University of
Western Ontario.

---------
WORKSHOPS
---------

This notice is also intended as a call for workshop presenters. One aim
of this meeting is to allow researchers to gain a background in areas
that they may know little about. Towards that end a number of workshops
are planned.  Is there a topic you or perhaps one of your colleagues
might want to present? Some participants in the conference would be very
interested in learning about technical matters such as fMRI or other
brain imaging techniques. Others might enjoy a seminar on a
philosophical topic. If you have recently published a book or major
article on some topic you might want to lead a discussion on it. As with
papers the focus of all workshops should naturally fit within the
overall theme of the conference.  Sample topics might include:

    --The latest methods and implications of various brain scanning
       techniques (e.g. fMRI, EEG, SQUID, ERP)
    --Blindsight, neglect, or other neuropsychological syndromes.
    --Neural network or other theoretical models of processing in areas
       related to conscious activity
    --Differences and similarities between conscious and unconscious
       processing
    --Current models of the visual system
    --Consciousness and metacognition
    --Criteria for the ascription of consciousness
    --Philosophical issues concerning the self

    --Please suggest other sample topics, or modify the above!!

Workshops will be held in parallel sessions on the morning and afternoon
of June 4th. Each workshop is intended to last approximately three
hours.  The sizes of workshops will vary between a minimum of 10 to a
maximum of around 25 people. Workshops that do not achieve the minimum
enrollment of 10 people will not be offered. Workshop presenters will
receive an honorarium of 750 Canadian dollars. The cost of attending
workshops will be 75 Canadian dollars.

David Brin is a very smart and future-oriented type guy, but he does
not consider himself a libertarian, at least as of last May when he spoke
at the foresight fellows conference. At that point, he wasn't speaking of
banning cryptography, and I don't recall that he called for banning
cryptography (except perhaps for its use by the government) in his
book. Rather, he believes that cryptography and other attempts at
secrecy are futile in the face of future generally available
surveillance technologies.

Wow! a scientific attitude to human nature!

I am not aware of studies which demonstrate that, to paraphrase and 
extend this logic, libertarian values were selected for. Robert Ardrey 
argued that territoriality (property) was innate. He also argued that 
enmity and amity are innate and result in human cooperative systems. He, 
like Desmond Morris after him, popularised the notion that large 
corporations with their concentration of alpha-positions to a privileged 
few lead to increased suicide and depression (there is good scientific 
evidence that major depression is (in part) an adaptation to 
lower-than-desired social status.

Humans want to be part of a group and some of them want to dominate the 
group.

My hypothesis is that libertarians are partly the confluence of extreme 
scores on some independent underlying shared dimensions such as hi 
openness, low agreeableness, low Neuroticism and empathy, and hi 
intelligence. We have a study investigating this at present, examining 
the relationship between the major dimensions of personality, libertarian 
views, and susceptibility to superstition. 

Partly, though, I think that libertarians are trans-human. That they have 
genes which are at very low levels outside the libertarian population, 
partly because without technological augmentation, we are at greatly 
increased risk of being hung, shot, tortured to death, and being burned 
at the stake ;-) 

I think these are genes for not acknowledging the legitimacy of the will 
of the band or tribe. It seems likely that the tribe genes are still 
present but are overridden.  I say this because I am sure we all get 
lonely and wish to have close friends etc. However some intellectual 
vision, commonly found in hackers, keeps us from being able to be close 
simply for closeness' sake: there has to be a logic to a view before we 
will subscribe.

Just as 92% of computer users are too stupid/indifferent to change their 
default Internet browser, and have no idea of the critical importance of 
crypto, privacy is not an innate demand because most people have no 
philosophy other than "maximise the difference between my stuff and your 
stuff, at any cost". Do not get between these people and stuff unless you 
have a gun.

cheers,
tim

I don't think this holds water.  Our simian anscestors
on the savannah plains were neither reading, nor
performing experiments with new social and technical
innovations.  They were, however, smart enough to hide
and or steal food or weapons.  OK, here's another possible
advantage to privacy back then . . . non-alpha males
needed privacy to engage in covert copulation with the
females.  I suspect one's need for privacy is more
culturally than genetically determined.

I read somewhere on the web that libertarians are likely to fall in the
INTJ/INTP/ENTP/ENTJ dimensions on the Myers Brigg test. Any truth to this?

Amazing!  You have just reinvented Keynes, which is a step forward over
some of the gung-ho I've-got-mine-fuck-you-Jack rhetoric on this list.  I
find it interesting that as crony capitalist Asia melts down and parts of
eternally-in-hock Latin America are blown away, some views are shifting
back toward a kind of Keynesian revival.

One prudential motive for adopting the views typically favoured in Europe,
Oz, etc (and of course large sections of the USA) is caught quite aptly by
Max M:

I find all this entirely plausible.  Solutions based on such insights are
hard to find, of course.  Old-style socialism didn't do it, authoritarian
social democracies have made some shameful blunders (such as routinely
taking kids away from `bad' parents) and current-style capitalism (applied
in countries that are internally fragmented on grounds in sectional or race
fears & hatreds) has some horrible running sores of its own.

The sorts of absurd strawmen that get lugged out in these discussions - `If
you steal all Gates's money and share it equally, we'll have a big party
for a day and a half and then society will crash and burn' - is so
unrelated to the kinds of real, urgent issues described above that I am
embarrassed to see people utter them.

In fairness I haven't had a chance to really check out his website
properly, but his view that neither drugs or prostitution should be
legalised doesn't strike me as particularly libertarian. He certainly seems
more enlightened than your average US politican, but then that's using a
pretty low standard. He does come across as much more intelligent than the
Press ever gave him credit for.

The common elements among those four categories are N and T

Characteristics Associated with the Four Temperaments (Kiersey, 1985)

 Intuitive-Thinker Type  (NT)

  *  analytic
  *  efficient
  *  logical 
  *  curious
  *  inventive

Relating this to Tim Bates reference to the 5 Factor theory (an 
interesting study that I need to think about), I have conducted 
research that indicates that Thinking and iNtuitive types are 
most strongly correlated to the "Open to Experience" factor 
of personality and least correlated with "Extroversion" (nothing 
to do with extropy) and "Agreeableness".  When Dr. (?) Bates 
completes his study, we can make some reasonable and testable 
hypotheses about political leanings and the MBTI.

 Brin advocates surveillance in most conditions, but doesn't advocate
complete abolition of privacy or a ban on cryptography (at least he clearly
avoided those positions in his book The Transparent Society; it's easy to
imagine him changing his mind). The only steps he advocates for creating
more equality involve empowering the average person to break up existing
concentrations of power by surveillance. As long as he doesn't advocate
that the government forceably help this along (he seems to waffle on that
question), I approve of his efforts towards equality.

 As for believing anarchists are evil: "these cypherpunks were among the
most brilliant, articulate, knowledgeable, and boisterous T-cells our
society could brag about producing so far;" - page 186-187 of The Transparent
Society. He does believe cypherpunks are mistaken about the effects of
widespread use of cryptography.

 Hardly. The right-wingers that I heard calling for his head (on a private
mailing list) made no mention of his ideology, and made frequent mentions
of his failure to communicate any ideology to the voters over the past
couple of years.

 The idea futures market puts the chances of Gingrich running for president
in 2000 at 13 to 19 percent (down from about 35% before the election).

Interesting article in today's Atlantic Monthly's "Atlantic Unbound" about
transhumanism: "Biotech at the Barricades".  

"Is there still such a thing as the artistic avant-garde? If you're like
me, you're tempted to agree with recent assessments of the end of the
radical in art and literature. But if the avant-garde is finished in
painting and poetry, is there a chance that it will migrate to an entirely
different context? "

In regards to Max M's responce to my email.

	Firstly, Max, I must thank you for your point c;
>c. They are unable to bring themself out of their memetic and genetic
condition.<
	It is an important point which I had failed to consider. I also
agree with you comments on the effect of people's social history;
>In the old days when most Danes lived in the country there was something
called a "bad family". A family that had been up to no good for generations.
Where the parents where loosers, drunks, beggars etc. and the kids would
grow up and be the same.<
		and,
>Children of people with social problems are most often those who get social
problems themself.<

	So I feel that I should clarify my position somewhat. I agree that
it is in our best interests to improve the conditions of the poor, for us
as individuals and as a whole community. What I dont agree with is the
concentration on wealthy for taxation purposes. Would it not be better to
look at other forms of less 'liberty encroaching' means, like the debit tax
system, or the carbon tax.

	Thanks, Steve.

It may not be a part of everyone's nature - but is certainly a part of those who
are mutating or evolving beyond the norms of their particular tribes reality
tunnel.  As practicing transhumanist we can certainly fall into this category.
America was founded largely by people who felt threatened to believe and
practice their religion as they wanted to.  Their need for privacy finally
became so strong that the only way they could get to their satisfaction was to
give up everything in attempt to cross the Atlantic and form a new community.

This scenario is nothing new.  If it wasn't for people ability to establish
privacy they wouldn't have been able to evolve as they wanted to for fear of
being burnt at the stake or sacrificed to the local god.  I'd say privacy is
definitely hard-wired into peoples brains, especially those of us whose
ancestors had to overcome great pressures of social conformity.

His failure to champion the current plate of conservative issues is
indicative of his moderacy. He worked towards lowering capital gains rates
and other general GOP goals but did not actively support the flat tax,
school prayer (disguised as the "religious freedom" amendment), and other
ultra-conservative bile that populated the legislative landscape. The
moderation of liberals has forced conservatives to become more conservative
to differentiate themselves from their counterparts. The stoking of the
Christian Right doesn't help anything either. Gingrich simply was not the
right person for Speaker. Remember, the Speaker's primary purpose is not as
spokesperson for the GOP but instead as shepherd of the legislative process.
Gingrich had little appetite for the ultra-conservative issues. The GOP
leadership wanted someone who did, enter Livingston and his histrionics.

I think 13-19% is too high for Gingrich running as president. However, the
chances that Gingrich will be the running mate of a GOP presidential
candidate are considerably higher, in my opinion.

Cancer Research 52: 6583-6587 December 1,1992
"Potent Preventive Action of Alpha-Carotene Against Carcinogensis and
Promoting Stage of Lung and Skin Carcinogenesis in Mice Are Suppressed More
Effectively by Alpha-Carotene Than by Beta-carotene"

Abstract:

  Although beta-carotene has been considered to be a key cancer preventive
agent in green and yellow vegetables, other types of carotenoids, such as
alpha-carotene, may also contribute to anticarcinogenic action, since these
carotenoids usually coexist with beta-carotene and are detectable in human
blood and tissues. In this study, we compared the inhibitory effect of
natural alpha-carotene, obtained from palm oil, with that of beta-carotene
on spontaneous liver carcinogensis in C3H/He male mice. The mean number of
hepatomas per mouse was significantly decreased by alpha-carotene
supplementation (per os administration in drinking water at a concentration
of 0.05%, ad libitum) as compared with that in the control group (P<0.001,
Student's t test). On the other hand, beta-carotene, at the same dose as
alpha-carotene, did not show any such significant difference from the
control group. Furthermore, we also compared the antitumor-promoting
activity of alpha-carotene with that of beta-carotene against two-stage
mouse lung carcinogenesis (initiator, 4-nitroquinoline l-oxide; promotor,
glycerol). Alpha-carotene, but not beta-carotene, reduced the number of
lung tumors per mouse to about 30% of that in the control group (P<0.001,
Student's t test). The higher potency of the anti-tumor-promoting action of
alpha-carotene compared to beta-carotene was confirmed in other
experimental system; e.g., alpha-carotene was also found to have a stronger
effect than beta-carotene in suppressing the promoting activity of
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate on skin carcinogenesis in
7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene-initiated mice.
  These results suggest that not only beta-carotene, but also other types
of carotenoids, such as alpha-carotene, may play an important role in
cancer prevention.

Additional data from table 3:

Group                            Mean number of tumors/mouse
Control                                6.31
0.005% alpha-carotene                  5.07
0.05% alpha-carotene                   3.00
0.005% beta-carotene                   7.38
0.05% beta-carotene                    4.71
0.005% palm-oil carotenes              3.60
0.05% palm-oil carotenes               2.06

Note: Palm-oil carotenes consist of 30% alpha-carotene, 60% beta-carotene
and 10% other (gamma-carotene, lycopene, etc). The best dietary sources
for alpha-carotene are (cooked) pumpkin, followed by carrots.

	Methinks I have a crazy plan!
	How about this; an underground tunnel, approx 1m across, which
would run from Melbourne, in Oz, under the seabed to California, housing
optical fibre cables.
	The distance is about 12000km give or take.
	I guesstimated that tunnelling and optical fibre costs would be
around US$2000 per metre. So that figures to be US$24G.
	I would be interested in any comments on the validity or costings
of such a scheme.
(I reckon' it could be part of a global neural net of super fast data links.)

Good for him, but that's not what his press release says on this website:

"I'm the only gubernatorial candidate with the courage to admit that our
wars against drugs and prostitution have failed....I was misquoted
Wednesday. When asked if I supported legalized prostitution and drugs, the
first two words I said were: 'absolutely not.' "

I don't know what his take on prostitution is, but with regard to drugs it
appears he wants to minimize jail terms (or avoid them all together) and
work on educating people about the health issues related to drug use: both
excellent goals, but hardly legalization.

best, patrick

Does anyone know of any systematic deprogramming techniques that can 
be used to efficiently reprogram Regilious believe systems to 
rational belief systems?

For example, if you were in charge of network programming for Baghdad 
metropolitan and suburban television, and had an unlimited supply of 
SONY Trinitron televisions to hand out, would it be possible to 
convert the citizens' attitudes to some that were more friendly to 
Western ideas?

In the interest of "Open Systems", what if we were to suddenly 
eliminate National Borders and Customs?  What would happen?

How could we accelerate memetic propagation in such a way that there 
could evently be free and unrestricted global travel and goods 
distribution?

First of all, this conversation is pretty tangential to the original thread.
And
I should note that I personally treasure my privacy and would fight tooth
and
nail to defend it.

Nevertheless, I will say that I suspect your definition of human nature must
differ from my own.  Secondly, you're suddenly talking about a "community"
of people seeking freedom from oppression (a very good thing), and
calling that a need for privacy.  Group splinterings are conceptually
different from
individual privacy in my mind.  Besides, I suspect that Puritans (and any
other
group with a strict and inflexible set of mores) were highly vigilant and
became
quite suspicious when any of their members sought an unusual amount of
privacy.  (He's probably consorting with satan!)

Wouldn't it follow from this argument that those who sought to establish
privacy had a greater risk of being killed than those who did not?  And
wouldn't that suggest that those with a strong need for individual privacy
were less likely to pass their genes on?

I still think that a population's need for individual privacy is primarily a
function of cultural factors and things like population density.  As for
genetic predispositions, I suspect that we're "wired" to socialize more so
than we are to be alone, but I also like Ardrey's notion (. . . that enmity
and
amity are innate and result in [effective] human cooperative systems).
I can see the need for balance early in our development.

So here's a question:

Throughout history, have there been no cultures where no real value
is attributed individual privacy?

Did I miss something?  It sounds as though the able-bodied should choose to become

I'll vote for that

I should lay my cards on the table. I'm more of a Milton Friedmanite than a
David Friedmanite. If we could start from scratch I would be a libertarian
anarchist. However, while I find D. Friedman's utilitarian arguments for
libertarian anarchism convincing, I also heed Popper's warnings that we
minimise avoidable suffering and slowly 'test the waters' with gradualistic
reform. Given that the State has already crowded out most voluntary
institutions, simply abolishing it won't bring these institutions back
overnight. It is also unjust to talk about abolishing a welfare safety net
when as a result of regulation and taxation there are less jobs than there
could be in the economy.  The poor were not the ones who lobbied for the
growth of the present regulatory state.

Given that any wholesale move to anarchism is politically impossible anyway,
I am a classical liberal in terms of my views on immediate reform
possibilities.  I favour gradual devolution, privatisation and deregulation
but also would like to ensure that the poorest and most vulnerable are
appropriately compensated for the losses they might suffer in the transition
to a freer society. Greater globalisation and interjurisdictional
competition is the only evolutionarily stable and the least disruptive means
towards legal polycentrism.

I don't see how this is going to be practical. I'm in favour of a low, flat
rate of tax  (income or sales or a combination of both given the politically
possible) with as few deductions as possible combined with a negative income
tax to replace present social welfare arrangements. Also, more reliance on
land tax and the institution of a carbon tax

Except I don't see any need for a 100% rate if we reform the health care
system so that only the indigent are subsidised while the rest must take up
a minimum amount of compulsory coverage.

Yes, nonviolent drug offenders should not be in jail for starters. I also
favour restitution for minor property crimes. However I think there is still
a place for a deterrence-based penal system for more serious crimes (rape
and murder).

Being in Australia, I'd like to see the US butt out too. Everytime they

too.

>Put environmental concerns before profits and jobs. On the other hand, put

By all means, let's have a carbon tax to internalise environmental
externalities. And let's have an emissions trading scheme. But I see no
reason why this is mutually exclusive with profits and jobs. All the
measures I mentioned promote economic efficiency.

>Open federally-funded birth control clinics all across the country,

Abortion should be completely legal. To the extent that we have a more
market-oriented health care system, the politically inflammatory issue of
whether Christians should subsidise abortions becomes less important. As I
said before I favour a policy of a minimum compulsory coverage through a
medical savings account, with the poor topped up to this minimum. How people
choose to spend above this level is their own business.

Devolve more functions to State and local governments (giving them the
requisite taxing and spending powers), yes.

Given the comments above I obviously favour attempts to ameliorate
conditions in the transition to a freer society such as education and
training vouchers.

Also, question the oligarchic power of

As Keynes almost recognised in Ch 17 of his General Theory, business cycles
have a lot to do with the peculiar properties of monopoly money. The growth
of electronic money on the Net will lead to de facto privatisation of the
money supply and eliminate this problem.

Crony capitalism, Damien, not capitalism. Hong Kong and S'pore which are
among the freest economies in Asia were not the cause of the Asian crisis.
The Asian crisis was caused by old fashioned industry policy in Korea, M'sia
and Indonesia combined with the moral hazard of past IMF bailouts.

I read an estimate that this next pummeling in the Gulf will cost the
U.S. Taxpayers $5 Billion.

Wouldn't it be better to put that $5 Billion into HDTV Flat Panel Web
Terminals with Wireless Broadband.

We could take all the Trinitrons sitting in Circuit City warehouses
and send them to the Gulf.  This way, we'll be avoiding all the long
term animosity that's created when people are killed.

Sure, you can kill a Republican Guard soldier in the desert, but his
children are just going to grow up hating America.  His survivors are
more of a long term threat than he is in the first place.  Remember
all those pictures of those starving lice infected Iraqi soldiers
begging for mercy, as the U.S. robotic controlled weapons were
unleashed in a turkey shoot?  

Why not launch an all-out reprogramming effort instead?  Maybe drop
leaflets with Prozac and Ecstacy or something?  Why not do some
research before exterminating the test subjects?

David Friedman totally agrees w/ you.  ;)  I quote:  "All things that
governments do can be divided into two categories--those we could do away
with today and those we hope to be able to do away with tomorrow.  Most of
the things our goverment does are in the first category."

*I* wouldn't advocate just shutting down the gov't tomorrow, and I'm pretty
sure Friedman wouldn't either.  Education, alternative "skeleton"
institutions, a strong voter majority who wants the smallest possible
government...  These are the stepping stones he advocates to
anarcho-capitalism.  I agree.

I've always been rather taken aback by this wounded cry.  Those who utter
it seem unaware that in a pluralistic western society, a vast array of
different and possibly antagonistic interests are supported out of
consolidated revenues (tax, in brief) which are gathered from most of the
working (or at any rate income-earning) population of different and
possibly antagonistic people.  As I understand it, my moiety or clan or
meme-tribe notionally chips in for the things we especially fancy, as well
as shouldering our share of the costs of the commonweal (roads, air traffic
control, etc).  Some other lot of morons who believe in homeopathy or
creation science or Catholic education surely have a perfect right to
expect that a chunk of what they pay will go to funding their preferred
idiocy - as long as the rights of kids, say, are not (too irreparably)
infringed.  

This was a big issue in Australia, and maybe still is, when Catholics
demanded that their sectarian schools be funded at the same level as
state-provided schools.  There were screams of outrage from the
three-quarters of the population whose kids were not going to get the
benefit of those schools.  `*My* taxes are not going to support some
damnable Papist brainwashing!'  I have some sympathy for this dislike of
Catholic (or Muslim, or other meme-cramping) schools, but I was dumbfounded
that these angry taxpayers failed to see that they were, in effect,
demanding that 25% of the population help fund *their* system, with no
return to themselves.  

Presumably libertarians will find all this a bit of a bore, since they will
maintain that *no* central provision of education, health, etc, is
justified.  Still, given that state-funded education is common, I can't see
any just way to avoid allowing groups to choose how to deploy the chunk of
the education dollars they pay in.  Similarly with pornography, abortions,
writers grants :) etc.  If enough people find these practices loathsome and
detestable, let their consciences be assuaged by the knowledge that the
share of the tax buck that's going to pay for the services is not coming
from *their* contribution but from the tax paid in by the very many who
disagree with them.

Sorry if this strikes many here as absurdly elementary.  Still, it's a
perspective that seems to elude many indignant taxpayers, and I have the
feeling that if the matter were explained properly they might calm down.
If they wish to prohibit the activities they dislike, let them try.  If
they fail, they need suffer no longer under the guilt that *their* dollars
are being spent on the spawn of Satan (or the God of someone else's
choice). The payments are being provided by *other* people's taxes, more or
less, all things being equalised.

Ignoring all other factors, your pricing ($2,000/meter) is probably
relatively close based on my personal experience.  Normal soft rock
tunneling can cost as little as $100/meter (at ~5m/hour) but given some of
your parameters, the costs would almost certainly skyrocket based on the
dimensions and extreme length of this tunnel.  Hard rock tunneling will
cost a little more (rates are often based on time, not distance) since it
will take longer to drill through.  I would love to know how you expect to
change drill heads twice a day when the drill is several thousand
kilometers away in a tunnel under the ocean.

However, the concept is (more or less) an engineering impossibility for a
number of reasons.  Question:  Why don't you just lay the optic fiber
across the ocean bed like everyone else?

Perhaps the implication to draw from this is that *NT* people are the most
likely to answer informal surveys?

Hi all,

Damien said regarding tax
>my tribe notionally chips in for the things we especially fancy, as well
>as shouldering our share of the costs of the commonweal (roads, air traffic
>control, etc).

 As you go on to note, libertarian's just don't grok tax in the first 
place.If all we are doing is chipping in for our fancy: why not just let 
us chip in all by our selves? 

Anyhow. Regarding state funding for bigotry training and mind-ablation.  
It has previously been found necessary to keep the religious people out 
of government by law. In absentia such laws, God lovers royally screw any 
nation they get their hands on. We ahve some quite nice case studies: 
pre- vs post- Elizabethan England, caused unmitigated disaster across 
Europe and continue to f__k up every country they are allowed to have a 
hand in governing. 

Religion in state funded schools should be illegal. Jefferson said it, 
and he was right.

The compromise is that we don't teach atheism in school (though science 
makes it pretty clear (to anyone lacking the neural god-module) that 
god-stuff is nonsense.


cheers,
tim

Looking at the results from the last time I did the MB test I
landed at IX*T*j (8 out of 10 on EI, 11 of 20 on SN, 0 out of
20 on TF and 14 out of 20 on JP).

Hi.

I was watching the news tonight regarding the massive damage in Central
America caused by the last hurricane.

The news reporter mentioned something very interesting:  Most of the aid
relief sent to Central America has been directly from corporations,
particularly American ones, with business interests in the region.  Not
only that, but that the response from companies was much quicker than the
response from governments.

On one hand, this is counter-intuitive, since we normally associate
disaster relief with governments.  OTOH, it does not surprise me that
companies are much quicker and more efficient at providing disaster relief
than governments.  Additionally, the one time that I was in a disaster
region, the most prominent efforts *were* private entities.  

Not to drop a grenade in a crowded room, but doesn't this fly in the face
of commonly held beliefs regarding the moral dispositions or "goodness" of
large corporations?  I've often thought that corporations have been
unfairly maligned as group due mostly to a relatively small number of
anecdotal stories demonstrating their "evil" natures.  I would counter that
corporations are generally very good, since unlike governments, they are
neither expected nor particularly obligated to provide disaster relief
(indeed, from the standpoint of the stockholders/owners this is bad).

Comments?

Well, no, actually, I don't.  That's why I keep my business interests diversified, 
and why I don't count on them to do anything truely vital.

Because the cost of failure is much higher than the examples you gave.  The 
closest analogy would be a hospital, and whenever someone I care about is in 
one I watch them like a hawk.  I don't *ever* want to be in one without someone 
I know and trust to look after my interests.

I cannot help but to see this as an argument *against* taxation.  If
fine-grained representational disbursement is an appropriate way to spend
tax dollars, why not eliminate the middle man (government) and let the
individual directly spend their money for these services?  It would
certainly be more efficient.

Perhaps a compromise would be for the government to decide allocation, but
for the individual to determine the actual spending of their tax dollars.
Of course, this leads to several other issues, but I'll leave it at this.

Making sure you got woken up is easy in a free market. Simply post on
public boards the notice that you will pay such and so a reward to the
first third party that makes sure you get woken up at the proper time.
I'm sure there are plenty of law offices that could automate the
boilerplate paperwork to ensure the cryo organization is legally
accountable to someone other than the patient to ensure the patients
revival.  Lawyers can be very good friends for hire, given the proper
inducement.

For example, when a primitive female human was having her period, she would be
sequestered from the rest of the tribe, to the point that females prefered the
privacy. Do that for thousands of years and women are going to feel very private
about their reproductive health. I could go on and describe many other
evolutionary advantages to privacy.

More big news from biology, today another company "Advanced Cell
Technology" (ACT) announced that they too have produced Human Embryonic
Stem Cells but their technique is superior and they did it over 2 years
ago. In 1996 Dr. Jose Cibelli obtained a cow egg cell from a
slaughterhouse and destroyed the nucleus in it, he then took one of his
own cells from inside his cheek and removed the nucleus from it and
inserted it into the cow egg cell. It started to divide as if it had
been fertilized normally, he stopped it before it developed into an
embryo but not before he obtained Jose Cibelli's own personal stem
cells. Some say the bovine mitochondria DNA will cause problems but
most think it should work as well and even if it didn't the few human
mitochondria that inevitably follow the nucleus during the transfer
procedure would be enough to take up the slack.

ACT filed for a patent at the time but, fearing a negative reaction
from the superstitious over a human bovine hybrid, kept their discovery
secret. The announcement from rival Geron Corporation a few days ago
made them come out of the closet. Meanwhile medical ethicists are doing
what medical ethicists do, whine and fuss and moan.

I humbly submit that they are not unaware of that, they know it all too well
and is precisely the reason you hear their wounded cry. Mine too.
The fact that part of my tax money goes to subsidies tobacco farmers and
help them increase production makes me unhappy, the fact that another part
of my tax money goes to subsides television advertisements to get people to
stop using tobacco does not cheer me up.

I agree completely. It would be much better if government would just get out the of
education business entirely but I'll take what I can get, school vouchers would be
better than the system we have now.

Dear all,

Just one last mail befor I will go to the 
Alcor UK meeting in Eastborne.
(hope to see some of you there)

I agree on the fact that you could find
ways to "pay someone in the future" to 
wake you.  But I was reffering to "all" of 
it in a more general way.

I strongly believe that we can have the best of both worlds.
I think one of the main things that makes life worthwhile
is socialising with friends and have just plain fun.
(why would you wan't to live longer in the first place...)
(I'm not saying you can't have friends or fun in a Total free market,
......but I fear you just too busy watching your back all the time)

This means IMHO that we have to have some sort 
of "mind-set" that we all agree on:

" OK...you are free to have a gun (free market rigth !)..."

but i hope we all agree on the fact that:

" NO..you can't shoot at him just for fun...."

I agree; it's a bit extreme, but I think it says what I mean.
Try to give as much tasks as possible to the "free market"
They will most of the time do a better job.
But make sure that we have some "rules" that are
controled by an "independent" (dare I say it :-)  goverment
And control it by ; for example "a truth machine :-)"
or something that comes close .....ALWAYS LIVE VIDEO...
of everything they say and do.
This way it can still be "honestly" controled by the
votes of the majority........
(only a very few......anarchists will complain that they 
still don't have "absolute freedom" (wich in a way they
will never have....but I will try that one later :-)

Sorry...got to go now.
(you can mail me on bstaring@csi.com
 but somehow this adres can't conect to the
 extropy list ......I'm still trying to find out why ?)

Greetings,

Berrie

What's your evidence for this Paul? I'm not denying it, but I'm not
convinced either. Personally, I'm not a private person. I've always been
extremely open about my views and interests, even when those around me are
not in sync. For instance, when I was in my first year of grad school, the
professors knew about my involvement in cryonics during the Dora Kent
crisis. I know some Extropians prize their privacy highly, but I'm not sure
it's a general characteristic.

The technology for undersea cables is well developed and does not require
tunnels. The current big cable-laying effort is called "Oxygen". They are
laying huge amounts of fiber. The economics are such that it is now
cheaper to use undersea fiber than on-land fiber in many places even when
the land route is cheaper. Furthermore, over the last few years, there have
been enormous increases in the bandwidth that a fiber can be made to support.
The new fiber is passive: no repeaters on the sea floor, so the new technology
can be applied to existing fiber by upgrading the on-land endpoints. current-
generation UDWM gear gets more than 40Gbps per fiber. A cable has many fibers.
I saw a recent report on a new scheme that can increase this by a factor of
100, which boggles the mind.

To throw in my own two cents on this...

I don't have to show that a desire for privacy is a part of human nature in
order to justify Lorrey's claim.  Acting in accordance with one's own
desires IS a part of human nature.  Since lots of people like privacy (for
*whatever* reason!), forcing them to give it up is contrary to human
nature.  That's all there is to it.

Hope this helps settle the matter.  ;)

I don't recall David Friedman advocating an abrupt change to Anarcho
Capitalism.  In fact, I'm not aware of him making any attempt to
propose a transition from our current situation to Anarcho Capitalism.
 This is what is lacking in his writings.  I'm still waiting for
someone to make a decent proposal.  I suppose slowly selling off all
of the governments assets and repaying previous tax payers is a good
start.  If your saying Popper has made a decent proposal for this
transition, I'd like the references so I could read him.  I've been

Actually, I believe it's the title to the new Firesign Theater (reunited)

Acting to satisfy one's perceived desires could practically be a
definition for simply being alive.  Every creature does this.  So,
of course it's a *part* of human nature.  That's not saying much,
though.  IMO, examining human nature is about identifying those
human attributes favored by natural selection and "hard-wired"
into our neural systems.  It's the difference between those needs
which we are predisposed to experience (trans-culturally) and
those which we learn.

Sorry, but not really.

Once again, I'm not against privacy.  I'm just curious about it's
genesis and its role in human development, and I'm having difficulty
understanding the logic of your statement.  Think of other words
that could be inserted into this similar statement:

                Since lots of people like ___________ (for *whatever*
           reason!), forcing them to give it up is contrary to human nature.

How about:

rape
murder
discrimination
ignorance
drunk driving
bigotry
child abuse

Maybe this is too much.  Sorry.  I get carried away.
All I was trying to say was that IMHO a need for privacy
is most likely tied to cultural factors, not neural ones.

Just a little more . . .

Interesting.  Is this from David Buss' book, "The Evolution of Desire"?
Does it imply that women have a greater need for privacy than men?
Or are you saying that there are scores of reasons why both sexes
have a *need* for privacy?  If so, are most of these reasons pro-social,
anti-social, or asocial?

Like Max, I'm not a very private person.  In fact I'm quite a
self-discloser.

So do a large number of individuals and groups of individuals in the inner
cities...we quaintly call them "gangs"...they think it is just peachy keen to
steal from anyone that they deem worthy prey...

We have another group who do the same thing...they are a little more polished
in their approach though...and do it with great pomp and ceremony....we call
them "polliticians"...

But if you resist the entreaties of either class you stand a fair chance of
winding up dead...

Yes, but my point is that this perception itself (of how your tax share is
being spent) is a somewhat arbitrary one.  You can choose to look at the
matter differently.  As other people have noted, it would be refreshing to
be allowed to nominate your own preferences concerning which pork gets
barrelled.  But since that option is not likely to be made available why
not recognise that some proportion of people favor state-funded abortion
(or space science) and notionally a part of their tax can be ascribed to
such use.  A different proportion of the voters wants to fund orphanages
for hapless bastards, and an equivalent part of their tax goes there.
Obvious such segmentation is rough & ready, but I suspect it might reflect
the underlying reality (except for space travel and astronomy, where
probably *most* people bitterly resent having to pay for any part of that
goddamned pointy headed science bullshit boondoggle).

I'm just a young sprout...not quiet fifty yet....but in the last thirty five
or so years it has been my observation and experience that there is one thing
you can depend upon from government......

If it's in their perceived interest they will LIE to you in a heartbeat...and
then go to great lengths to cover up the fact that they did lie..

Recently it's become more and more apparent that the  news media act as the
propaganda arm of government...so their credibility is also suspect.

i've just read the paper "Amplifying Cognition: Extending Memory and
Intelligence" by Anders.
available at http://www.extropy.org/eo/articles/ampcog.htm

I find it a very good and interesting paper and more precisely, i find
the idea underlying the Remembrance Agent very attractive. a priori, i
think it can provide me a great help in my current private writing (not
really transendant ;)... but anyway...).

i've checked the Remembrance Agent Page at the MIT :
http://rhodes.www.media.mit.edu/people/rhodes/RA/

but this great stuff is running under UNIX... that's too sad for me
because my complete current environment is under win95 ;(..

is somebody aware of some software doing the same thing but win95
compatible?
or more probably could somebody tell me if it's easy to make this
program work under w95 with some kind of emulator?

thank you, anyway...

The undersea cable is almost certainly cheaper for long-haul, and
has a huge advantage in ease of upgrade. As to breaking the local
telco monopoly on the "last mile" ("bypass technology"), radio works
pretty well, in many forms: look at cellular and satellite phones.
Interstingly, the "G3" cellular proposals (i.e., third-generation
cellular protocols) are currently being worked out. they are supposed
to permit data rates to 2Mbps (burst), which is a huge leap. Another
neat idea is to use long-duration aircraft circling over big cities at
a very high altitude to deliver MAN services via radio trasponders.

I just added another implementation of the idea futures market
- MyHand "Invisible Hand electronic market" - to my list of
hypereconomy-related links at
http://www.lucifer.com/~sasha/HEDG/HEDG.html#idea_market

Has anybody had experience with this system?
Could you summarize the differences between MyHand and Foresight
Exchange?

Maybe there are other implementations I should list?

That's the key: "business interests in the region"

Some people forget that (seemingly) altruistic behavior can arise
selfishly. The companies are almost certainly acting in their best
interest. They benefit in two ways. They help to sustain the area where
their economic interests lie and they appear "good" to the consumer. This
should not be underestimated.

Of course there's your "average" indifferent/uninformed consumer, but any
advantage to be gained from consumers who do not fit this description is a
benefit.

>(indeed, from the standpoint of the stockholders/owners this is bad).

not the forward-thinking ones.

Perhaps I overstepped my assertion here.  I meant to say it's been my experience
the more someone explores alternative reality tunnels, the more they're likely to
hide it from the 'tribal' consensus.  Obviously, there would be very little
memetic change if this were completely true.  I for one am *not* totally open on
certain issues, as it could cost me my job.  Its simply a matter of degree.  To
use an extreme example - would you feel comfortable discussing your views on
interracial relationships at a Ku Klux Klan meeting?  Probably not if you value
your life.  Either you hide your views from the Klan collective or you get the
hell out of Klan City.  I think the same can be said for most people who find
themselves outside their cultural continuum.  Because of that, I am not surprised
that the majority of transhumanists are strong privacy advocates.

I do not dispute this, but I think it's no coincidence either that you've chosen
the west coast of the U.S. as your home.  I can't think of a better place (short
of an off-shore colony) where extropian views will be met with the least
resistance or prejudice.

"Lycopene in Association with Alpha-tocopherol Inhibits at Physiological
Concentrations Proliferation of Prostate Carcinoma Cells"

Abstract:

  The effect of lycopene alone or in association with other antioxidents
was studied on the growth of two different human prostate carcinoma cell
lines (the androgen insensitive DU-145 and PC-3). It was found that
lycopene alone was not a potent inhibitor of prostate carcinoma cell
proliferation. However, the simlutaneous addition of lycopene together with
alpha-tocopherol, at physiological concentrations (less than 1 microM and
50 microM, respectively), resulted in a strong inhibitory effect of
prostate carcinoma cell proliferation, which reached values close to 90%.
The effect of lycopene with alpha-tocopherol, was synergistic and was not
shared by beta-tocopherol, ascorbic acid and probucol.

Sorry, I wasn't trying to imply that he was. I'm aware that he favours
building up the voluntary sector first,
I was just trying to draw a contrast between the anarcho-lib attitude to
reform which he built an intellectual foundation for (without necessarily
agreeing with the tactics of hard core libertarians) and the classical lib
attitude represented by his father. eg there are hard core libertarians who
want immediate separation of school and state even to the point of opposing
a voucher system. This, I think, is impractical.

 I figured the "we should all become quadriplegics" deduction was so obviously flawed
that it didn't need comment. The quadriplegic example was just to illustrate that common
assumptions about happiness may be flawed. People with so little of what we consider
valuable should be miserable, right? Not necessarily so. People with lots of "valuables"
should be happy, right? Not necessarily so.

 My point was if we are trying to maximize our happiness, but are intuitions about what
makes us happy are flawed, then our strategies are likely to be flawed. Declaring
research nonsense because it doesn't meet our expectations doesn't seem to be very
rational. Since the reported research is not yet published, its hard to guess its
validity. But my question remains, would you change your strategy for increasing your
personal happiness if reliable research showed the currently accepted assumptions to be
flawed? Or are you trying to optimize some other factor than happiness? If you are
trying to optimize power for example, I would guess absolute values rather than rate of
change become most significant.

Screw the wacky human goal system.  Trying to be "happy" with the default
diencephalon is chasing wind.  The system isn't optimized so you'll wind up
happy and stay that way, it's optimized so that you have more and more
children.  Unhappy with what you have?  Want more?  What a #@$!ing surprise. 
Face it, there ain't no way to stay happy, the goals you chase to "be happy"
at any given time are arbitrary and probably self-destructive, and the whole
game is rigged to begin with.  You can act rationally or spend your life
trying to tickle a few serotonergic receptors, but you can't do both.

I understand your point, and it's not the research I was declaring nonsense (sorry if I was
unclear), but rather the extrapolation from it.  I think it's quite a leap to postulate that
because those who are forced to be quadriplegic may be quite happy as the propects of
improving their condition improve, then self-impoverishment for other people will cause them
happiness at the propect of struggling back to financial security (or at least their
previous state) again.  So where is the flaw in the "we should become quadriplegics"
deduction that does not pertain to the "we should become impoverished" deduction?

A similar case might be a person on the verge of starvation.  When presented with a sandwich
his happiness may exceed anything in my common experience, but I don't see that as an
argument for malnutrition.

So, if we shouldn't become anorexic to increase happiness (or pay someone to beat us up
because we're so happy when they stop), then why should we voluntarily place ourselves into
poverty (even relative poverty) for the pleasure of having to achieve financial security
again?

Now, if some people chose to do this and became known as the happiest people in the land, I
would have to pay serious attention.  Until then (or similar compelling evidence) I will
consult my own experience of what tends to make me happy, and what measure of common sense I
may possess, and my knowledge of others' experiences, when striving for my happiness.  As
always, when someone claims the commonly accepted strategies (for happiness or anything) are
wrong, the onus of proof is on the claimant.

i suspect the separatists came to america to prevent information from
*coming into* their society, as much or more than to prevent information about
themselves from leaking out.  each generation would need to carefully block
information channels to the next generation in order to prevent them from
becoming
like the society the separatists so despised.  i have seen, first hand,
information
control at work still today, in the form of blocking or distorting information
about science in general and evolution in particular.  {8-[  spike

You may find Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's work illuminating in this area:
Finding Flow: The Psychology of Engagement with Everyday Life (1997)

I have not read the book, only an interview in _Free Inquiry_ but it helped
me put words to my conception of happiness.

The idea of flow is a sort of all-consuming alternative reality we are
sucked into when we are creative or artistic (in their most general
senses). We would not really say we are happy during this flow experience.
There is just too much going on. But reflecting on this experience after
that fact is the source of our happiness.

Perhaps the quadriplegics find flow in finding ways to overcome their problems.

Rich people may find flow while they are creating new ways of acquiring wealth.

But of course if the initial condition is self-imposed I would imagine
overcoming it to be substantially less satisfying.

grok is Unix-geek speak: it means "get it". 

if you are etomologically minded, check out

it may be the first exptropian word in common currency ;-)

As most people use it, it means `understand`.  It is defined
to mean a wide variety of things, depending on the context,
by Robert Heinlein, in _Stranger_in_a_Strange_Land_.  If you
have never read this book (and apparently you haven't), you
should, IMHO.

It was too early for it, but you could probably define it best
as "carry as part of one's memeset", which would fit nicely 
with Mr. Bates usage.

It comes from Robert A. Heinlein's novel STRANGER IN A 
STRANGE LAND (a book which inspired the Church of All Worlds, 
publisher of GREEN EGG Magazine) and was usually used in that 
book as part of the phrase "grok it in its fullness."  This meant to 
understand something completely, from the internal (and all external) 
perspectives.  Of course, this is an existential and phenomenological 
impossibility in practice, but it remains an abstract ideal by which it 
is useful to measure/compare one's mental grasp of something, and 
attempt to asymptotically attain.    Joe

I think that the most important point is being missed here. Happines might
come from trying to achieve a goal or/and then acheiving it. When you are
rich a $1000 more wont make you happy, but then you must set yourself some
other goal.

I think this is obvious, and is one of the unspoken core dogmas of
transhumanism.

True, but I lived in England before that, espousing the same views. I
started the first European cryonics organization at a time when it would be
considered terribly un-English, what! When I first became a full-fledged
libertarian in 1981, there probably weren't more than 250 of us in the
country. I still went to school wearing badges (US: "buttons") saying
"Taxation is Theft" and "Legalize Heroin". I wrote an extremely unpopular
article in 1983 arguing against the age of consent laws which was
circulated in the houses of parliament and which got me called "a morally
deformed exhibitionist" and "a precocious guru of the New Right" by a
newspaper. Ah, the good old days! I still treasure those insults! Even over
here, in Extropy #3, I wrote an article under my own name in which I
praised psychedelic drugs (rather more extravagantly than I would now).

So, it's not only in relatively hospitable environments like California
that I've been open.

Unless it's been superceded in the last decade, the best study I know of on
the causes of happiness (or at least what factors happiness correlates
with) is Michael Argyll's The Psychology of Happiness. I bought this in
England in the '80s, so it may not be available in the U.S.

The 11/12/98 issue of _The Guardian_ made the following statement
in an article dealing with the Foresight Institute:

"It seems researchers can `grow' a biological motor. Shahid Khan
and Renate Lux of New York's Albert Einstein College of Medicine 
will tell the Foresight conference they have found the blueprint 
for the motor which drives the tail of the E. Coli bacterium in 
just four of the bacterium's genes. E. Coli's helical tail works 
like a screw propellor, rotating from the base. The researchers 
have cloned a copy of the tail using these four genes; an electron 
microscope shows the protein structure in the base is exactly the 
same as the original, which means it should function normally."

This appears to give further credence to the position that if nature
can create functional components at the nm scale, so can we.

Grok is from the 1960's science fiction classic
"Stranger in a Strange Land", by Robert Heinlein.

It is the Martian word for "to eat", but is nearly always
used in in the context of "to understand".
"To grok the fullness" is to completely understand.

If you give folks the option to spend a part of their tax money as
they see fit, then you're further legitimizing taxation even further. 
What's the difference between directing 30% of my stolen (taxed)
income towards space funding and voluntarily donating a similar
unstolen amount?  One is coerced, the other isn't.

Allowing you to choose how your tax money is spent is like being
mugged and having the mugger promise to spend a portion on whatever
you like.  That's nonsense.

Any attempt to look at taxation as anything other than government
thievery is helping the government steal more of our money.  Also
remember any plans to allow us to direct our own tax monies would
create more huge bureaucracies which would tend to eat up a good
portion of that money anyway.

Taxation is theft.  Nothing more.

In the November-December issue of _MIT's Technology Review_,
George Whitesides was interviewed on the subject of nanotechnology.
Whitesides is a chemist and materials scientist at Harvard. The
article describes Whitesides thusly:

"A distinguished chemist and materials scientist, Whitesides has 
been exploring this very small world for years. After nearly 20 
years at MIT, Whitesides joined Harvard University's chemistry 
department in 1982. The Harvard researcher has provided micro- 
and nanofabrication with some of its most useful construction 
techniques. But Whitesides also keeps a well-trained reality check 
on the nano world. Despite his obvious enthusiasm for the field, 
he's intent on defining what is, and what isn't, going to be 
possible."

In the interview, Whitesides expresses enthusiam over near-term
possibilities of nanotechnology (i.e., information storate,
ubiquitous computing, etc.). However, Whitesides is openly
skeptical of the robust MNT described by Drexler and discussed
on this list. The following excerpt captures Whitesides' skepticism:

"TR: Beyond shrinking microelectronics smaller and smaller, there's 
been a lot of talk about using nanotechnology for other, mechanical, 
types of applications.

WHITESIDES: There are a lot of things that range from being potentially 
real to things that are science fiction. There's the idea of very 
small autonomous machines that swim around in the bloodstream or 
something like that. I can see no way of realizing those. The reason 
is that, aside from the problems in building them, there are horrendous
problems with power in anything that's an autonomous system. There'll 
have to be some truly deep invention before anyone figures out how to 
power small autonomous systems. We have examples of powered systems: 
for example, living cells, or organelles in the cell. But the cell is 
not actually a small object. Mammalian cells are about 25 micrometers 
across and even bacterial cells are 1 to 3 micrometers. Viruses, which 
are much smaller, are not powered. So power is one fundamental question. 
Friction in small moving systems is a second. Manufacturing is a third."

Again, we see skeptics who should know better basically saying certain
technological accomplishments are impossible without any firm theoretical
substantiation for such a finding. Whitesides covers his bets by saying he
"can see no way of realizing [such technology]" and speculates that "truly
deep investion[s]" would need to be made before we can realize some of 
the applications described by Drexler and others. Too bad the interviewer
did not ask "Do you think such technology is possible or impossible? And if
you think it is 'impossible' what are the theoretical arguments to evidence
this impossibility?"

Previously written: "eg there are hard core libertarians who want
immediate separation of school and state even to the point ofopposing
a voucher system. This, I think, is impractical."

In what way is it impractical?  Vouchers simply justify the
government's theft of our money.  We should immediatley eliminate any
government spending in education and reduce taxes - possibly selling
off all government education related resources and refunding the money
to tax payers.

Government sponsored education usually costs quite a bit more per
student than private education does - mainly because of administrative
overhead.  If we give vouchers that equal the average cost of a public
education student, that will upset the market for private schools
causing them to raise tuitions.  This will screw that sector of the
free market all to hell.

Why pay twice for something you could pay once with no bureaucratic
skimming?

Why so quick to label any sort of critique of nanotech as uninformed 
skepticism?  I think that a healthy dose of skepticism (and Whitesides 
seems to have quite a background to conduct such a critique) will help 
keep nano enthusiasts focused on just what can realistically be 
accomplished.  I see nothing in the quotes you provided that indicates 
that Whitesides considers nano applications to be 'impossible'--I doubt 
that he would have expended so much time in reviewing a technology that 
had no hint of potential success.  

We can't have it both ways--we set ourselves up as skeptics to provide 
critiques on religion and bogus science, but then turn and scream at 
anyone who dares to suggest that every nano pipe dream won't come 
true.  I welcome essays like Whitesides and hope to read more like 
them, because if nano is to gain any credibility it must first survive 
such scrutiny.

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

I think the real point is that even if people in poor circumstances turn
out to be happier than those in better circumstances, it does not follow
that people will make themselves happier by making their situation worse.
The things that make disadvantaged people happy may not apply if someone
knows that they had intentionally given up advantages they previously had
in order to become disadvantaged.  You could only draw this conclusion
if the people in a bad situation were happier even though they had
voluntarily made themselves that way.

 A third way in which "good" deeds can benefit a company is that they appear
"good" to their employees. This increases employee motivation, a important
point in companies where people are the main capital. Which would you rather
work for, a corporation you are always apologizing for, or one you can be
proud of?

Damien, can you quote an example of such rhetoric? I don't recall any. I
think you're imputing unworthy attitudes and motives with no evidence
because you can't imagine how anyone could honorably differ with you on the
issue. Of course, imagination doesn't equal understanding.

As a matter of fact, I'll take "I've got mine, fuck you, Jack" over "I want
yours, hand it over or else" any day of the week. The first is impolite and
insensitive. The second is criminal. Yet it's what modern so-called
"liberalism" amounts to.

IMHO failing to distinguish economics (power of production and trade) from
politics (power of brute force) betrays an abysmal lack of understanding of
both.

Last nights program on "48 Hours" covering immortality seemed quite
positive, although I only viewed the last 1/2 hour.  The importance of
cloning organs and brain cells was handled smoothly and openly, suggesting
a *need* for cloning organs, especially cloning and replacing our own
organs as we are living longer.  Cryonics focused on our friends Judy
Muhlestein, Mark Muhlestein and two of their sons at their home, along with
Linda Chamberlain and Fred Chamberlain at Alcor.  I especially appreciated
the closing comments which were uplifting, and the young-old women working
out in the background.

Sorry I don't have a URL for recap of program.

I sent this to the letters page of the Chicago SunTimes Yesterday
in response to the headline story of the Mayor filing suit against
suburban gun shops and gun manufacturers.

In light of the blantant antigun censorship of the SunTimes, I do
not expect it to be published.


The Mayor is missing the answer to the gun violence problem in
Chicago.

Handgun registration in Chicago was terminated in 1983, and it is
illegal to possess an unregistered handgun, so effectively handguns
have been banned in Chicago since 1983.

Yet despite this and the over 20,000 other gun laws in this country
we see crimes committed daily with illegal handguns, and children
injured and killed because irresponsible adults have left illegal
handguns where they could be found and abused. They are rarely
punished, I believe they should be.

The answer is personal responsibility. To solve the problem pass
the following law:

5 years in prison with no chance of parole for possession of an
unregistered/illegal handgun.

20 years in prison with no chance of parole for the possession of
a handgun during the committing of a crime.

Life in prison with no chance of parole if during the committing of
a crime with a handgun anyone is injured or killed.

Pass the law, enforce the law......

In other words it would be refreshing if the market was allowed to operate freely.

But except for receiving a healthy percentage of the action what's the purpose
of the government middleman in all this? If I want to help poor people get abortions
or help space science I can do so directly with private charities.

    >Obvious such segmentation is rough & ready, but I suspect it might
    >reflect the underlying reality


I think the underlying reality is that there is no reason  to expect government
to engage in projects that help most people most of the time, it's much
more likely that they'd do things that help a very few people a lot but is
slightly harmful to most. When the number of such projects becomes large
the harm is no longer slight.

If I want to make $10,000,  there are two ways to go about it, I can
work to repeal hundreds of special interest laws, each one costing me a few
dollars, or I can lobby for the passage of one more special interest law that
will give me and my friends $10,000 and cost everybody else a dollar or two.
The second method makes much more sense, it's far easier to pass one law than
to repeal hundreds and it's better public relations too. If a take a dollar from a
thousand people by force and then give one of them $500 I have 999 people who
are indifferent or only slightly angry and one person who is overjoyed and forever
grateful for my magnificent generosity. The politician is happy too, he likes the
campaign contribution I made and he likes even more the fact that he's made a
powerful friend.  Most people don't have the time, inclination or ability to engage
in lobbying on that scale so most people get the shaft.

This sort of lobbying won't work in the free market. If I want an executive
at Microsoft to be promoted to a position of greater power there is only one
thing I can do to help that come about, purchase the product that the
executive has been advocating. Bribery will help the executive's bank
account but it will not help his chances for advancement, it will hurt it
because his boss will note that his decisions have been poor and do not
made economic sense.  The stockholders will note the same thing.


    >except for space travel and astronomy, where probably *most* people
    >bitterly resent having to pay for any part of that goddamned pointy

I try to be consistent so I'm unable to defend the idea that people should be
forced to pay for things they don't want even if John Clark happens to think
those things are admirable.

I agree the whole thing came out positive despite a few attempts to
play cute. The cheap shot at ALCOR "It looks high tech but the
science is more like highschool" and the typical cheap attempt to
shock the audience by talking about neurosuspensions aside, I
thought it went well. The Muhlesteins and Linda Chamberlain came
off great!!

Title
  Evidence for synergism between chromium and nicotinic acid
  in the control of glucose tolerance in elderly humans.
Source
  Metabolism: Clinical & Experimental.  36(9):896-9, 1987 Sep.
Abstract
  Impaired glucose tolerance results from Cr restriction in animals, and Cr
  supplementation improves glucose tolerance in diabetic animals. These effects
  are presumably due to the role of Cr in glucose tolerance factor (GTF), a
  complex of Cr and nicotinic acid believed to facilitate insulin binding.
  Humans, however, do not uniformly respond to Cr supplementation. The present
  study was designed to evaluate the possibility that the failure results from
  inadequate levels of dietary nicotinic acid to serve as substrate for GTF
  synthesis. Sixteen healthy elderly volunteers were divided into three groups
  and given either 200 micrograms Cr, 100 mg nicotinic acid, or 200 micrograms
  Cr + 100 mg nicotinic acid daily for 28 days and evaluated on days 0 and 28.
  Fasting glucose and glucose tolerance were unaffected by either
  chromium or nicotinic acid alone. In contrast, the combined
  chromium-nicotinic acid supplement caused a 15% decrease in
  a glucose area integrated total (p less than .025) and a 7% decrease in
  fasting glucose. None of the treatments exerted any effect on fasting or
  one-hour insulin levels. Thus, these data suggest that the inability to
  respond to chromium supplementation may result from
  suboptimal levels of dietary nicotinic acid.

I don't see why you should give primacy to human nature at all. Isn't
civilisation all about overriding our original human nature to allow us to live
in larger groups? Potty training of children springs to mind, which makes public
health systems workable. If a lot of people like privacy, that's a good reason
for not forcing them to give it up.

 I'd guess "no privacy" would work just fine in a town where everyone had agreed
to it, and all had a suitable level of mutual tolerance. No selling the tapes to
outsiders though.

The Calorie restriction segment was amazingly devoid of useful
information. And, from what I hear, they left out some
qualifications on what Weindruch said about whether people should
try CR, like, "there's good reason to believe it will work in
humans, but we can't know for certain yet..." leaving the viewer
instead with the impression that he thinks there's essentially
LITTLE reason to believe it will work in humans, which is definitely
not his view.

They also didn't mention that there are hundreds of other people on
the diet, many of whom are pulling together a study to be submitted
to a gerontology journal. I spent hours talking about this.... Very
annoying.

Producers have a vision. The produce it. That's it.

Brian.

Both deductions are extreme, and move out of the range where I think the theory holds. In the
quadriplegics case, I would say the subjects score well on the happiness scale because.

 1) The disaster was accidental
 2) They are only a tiny minority in a society compassionate enough to provide resources, and do
research which alleviates their condition.

 If everyone followed that route, there would be no-one around to do research, or even provide
help. A terminal condition.

 I was not suggesting people become impoverished. However, I did see the research as validating
my lifestyle of the last few decades, so I found it attractive. Typically, when my assets get
large, I get rid of them and restart at a lower base. This lower base does however include
obvious essentials like the latest laptop, a fast Net connection, and enough money to cushion
small surprises. Note that I don't get rid of my *really important* assets like my skills and
experience in systems design which give me my high earning power.

 I noticed long ago that affluent executives I worked with would moan about how much they had to
work to give their house new furniture, their yacht a new mast, their cottage a new roof, and
their money a new home. The answer seemed to me to be, "ditch the possessions". When I found
myself risen to the exalted state where I was mostly working to keep my possessions in the state
to which they were accustomed, I followed my own logic. I've done that a few times, and it works
well for me. I'm surprised how few other follow the same strategy, or do it only once and call
it a "mid-life crisis".

 If you are trying to maximize power though, its a poor strategy. Or you may have other goals
for which lots of stuff is essential.

 Again, I wouldn't recommend anything that extreme. But I do find putting my sandwich in a
backpack and hiking to the top of a mountain with it improves the taste significantly.

I agree with Aegis.  I have very strong bull detectors, and I didn't hear
anything wrong.  I heard someone pointing out the flaw in a commonly-used
analogy.  If the maximum size for assemblers is smaller than the minimum size
for chemically powered cells, the analogy is invalid and that's that.  If it
takes a major research breakthrough to get powered sub-micron units, then
that's one of the many leaps required for nanotechnology.  Nobody said
nanotech was going to be easy.  I *pray* nano is hard enough to defeat the
human race until there are competent, ethical transhumans around to handle it.

I think Whitesides has done a good job of identifying the basic issues which
do not scale down from micron cells to nanometer machines.  One is power -
ATP-based chemical power doesn't scale down to what are essentially autonomous
chemicals; nanotech needs some source of power - electrical, perhaps.  Two is
friction - the macroscopic or classical effects used to shape current
machinery don't operate at the atomic or quantum level; nanotech needs a
different type of design, assembled from atoms instead of carved from blocks. 
Three is manufacturing - how do we make an assembler once we've designed it?

I believe that all three questions are addressed in Dr. Drexler's
"Nanotechnology".  I would have been interested in a critique of Drexler's
answers, but what Whitesides delivered was a perfectly valid critique of a
common, popularized, mistaken argument.  So I don't think that Whitesides is
being unnecessarily skeptical, but I don't think he's disproved nanotechnology either.

I still think it is great work after all of these years.

Some later work I did found happiness was a proper mix of novelity,
sociolality and privacy.

There are those, however, who have chose to make less money 
and live more simply . . . downsizing their lives for the sake of 
happiness.  I'm not sure how many of them succeeded, though.

Same here.  However, it seems my mind was corrupted anyway ;^)
Seriously though, among fundamentalist Christians this is very common.
Children are often "shielded" from all non-controlled media sources.

I was pretty disappointed in the segment on cryonics. 
It was particularly offensive that the *one* individual they 
interviewed who pooh-poohed cryonics was the *one* 
whose credentials they emphasized (professor as U of C), 
implying that "professionals" or "experts" in the field 
consider it nonsense.  I tried to imagine myself as a viewer
hearing about cryonics for the first time, and I think I would
have concluded that these cryonicists seem like nice enough 
people and they don't seem to be harming anyone, but they're
dreaming!  And I couldn't believe I heard the infamous 
hamburger quote again!

Oh well.  I wasn't expecting much better.

True enough, but like I said it is a matter of degree.  How much would depend
on how strongly you feel versus your fear of what the tribe might do to you.  I
think the drug issue is a perfect case in point.  People have been fired from
their jobs or put in prison for their views on drug use.  Many would argue this
is exactly what happened to Timothy Leary - 37 years for a pot seed that he
claims was planted in his car.  And that was back when there was no "War on
Drugs".  BTW, would your decision not to write 'extravagantly' about
psychedelic drugs stem from your fear of the tribe or a change of view on the
drugs themselves?

Nietszche said, "Faith is not wanting to know."  It is much worse now

while that may be its meaning to unix users, it did not originate there. Grok

Preventing an inflow is as much a issue of privacy as preventing an outflow. Its
all about personal space. Privacy rights are about how inviolate that personal
space is to unsolicited intrusions of any kind. Granted, in some societies where
people have been bred like lemmings for so long, they have no more concept of
personal space outside of the body. If you look at such societies you'll note that
it took quite a bit of genocidal culling to get rid of the people who could not
handle such a system. However, historically, the concept of borders began with how
far a person could swing or reach with their hand, then with a club, etc. This
sort of thing has gone on to the point that the 3 mile limit for national borders
on a shoreline was created because that was how far the state of the art cannon of
the day could throw a projectile in defense of the nation. In colonial days,
grants by the King to a settler were made by a curious concept of personal space.
A settler could decide where they wished to build their dwelling in an unclaimed
area. The grant to the settler would declare all land within line of sight of that
dwelling to be the granted property.

Personal space and the sanctity of that personal space in the concept of privacy
is innate. Indeed it precedes mankind. It can be seen in the territorial instincts
of hundreds if not thousands of species of animals. A squirrel's nuts belong to
him and him alone. If someone else eats them then the squirrel's risk of starving
during the winter increase. Thus it is an evolutionary advantage for the squirrel
to respect personal space and personal property.

While there is a noted variance in an individuals need for privacy, in the
extroversion-introversion index, the reference is always on relative amounts of
privacy. There is nobody who is an absolute extrovert, because the fact that we
lie to ourselves on occasion indicates that we do  or think things that we don't
even want to admit to ourselves that we do, never mind tell anyone else.

So the question becomes: What is the accepted standard of privacy? Do we go with
the least common denominator, i.e. next to no privacy, or just the average desired
privacy? With the average desired privacy, there is still half the population
feeling like they are being violated. If we are to respect the rights of
minorities, in this case the introverted minority, we need to have a standard of
privacy which meets the demands of the most introverted person. Anything weaker
than such an absolute puts the society as a whole on the slippery slope of popular
relativity and tyranny of the media. Only such a high standard of privacy will
allow all in the body politic to choose their own acceptable level of privacy.

Huh? Can you point me to some references on this? It appears wildly

There are now purely *optical* repeaters, which are pumped with light,
so no electric power supply system needs to be embedded in the cable,
but of course you still need repeaters and you can't upgrade old cable.

Yes, parental negligence has not been properly prosecuted in any
jurisdiction. I also support mandated gun locks. A gun should not be
operable when it is not in the owners posession.

One of the problems with our overburdened legal system is that whenever
a violent crime case goes to court, the prosecutors are almost always
happy to plea bargain. When they do, the first charge to be dismissed is
always the weapons charge. Pass a law against dismissing weapons charges
in plea bargains.

Now, aside from parental negligence charges and mandating weapons
charges be immune from plea bargaining, all gun control laws should be
repealed. As Prof. John Lotts landmark study proved beyond a reasonable
doubt, making it easy for law abiding citizens to carry concealed
weapons reduces violent crime. The decreases range from an average of 8%
overall decrease in violent crime, to such marked decreases as an 80%
decrease in multiple death spree type killings within 5 years of the
liberalization of gun laws.

Furthermore, as the GAO Audit of the performance of the Brady Bill's 5
day waiting period shows, criminals do not buy guns from legal sources,
so this intrusion into the privacy of law abiding private citizens
should end. While Clinton claimed that the Brady Bill prevented 100,000
criminals from buying guns, the GAO report showed that of these, all but
12 were false denials based on clerical or computer errors, or were
unjustly refused because of nonrelevant records like traffic tickets,
etc. Of the 12 who were actually criminally buying guns, only one was
ever prosecuted, even though the Brady Bill mandated prosecution and a
minimum charge. So 100,000 law abiding citizens rights are violated for
every one criminal prosecuted, at an expense of $500 million. Now thats
cost effective law enforcement, don't you think?

Use of a gun in murder should be an automatic death sentence, with
restricted numbers of appeals, and a mandated maximum time from
sentencing to execution. Prof. Lott's study also showed that the Death
Penalty as it exists today, has little to no effect on violent crime
rates. Only the death sentences meted out by private citizens lawfully
defending themselves seems to have a significant impact on crime, so the
more like crime scene justice we can make our justice system the more
deterrent it should be against crime.

The Mayor of Chicago should start wondering why it is that the cities
and states with the most restrictive gun laws seem to have the highest
crime rates.

If you used optical repeaters, you would still need a power supply to
power the lamp or laser in the light pump. I don't have an immediate
reference for the non-existance of repeaters, since I was going from
memory. I'll try to find one and get back to you.

I don't think "skeptic" is an inappropriate label for Whitesides.
My concern is the dismissal of feasibility by many in the
scientific community inhibits research and funding in areas
that might directly contribute to molecular assemblers and 
replicators. I don't fault Whitesides for being skeptical but 
instead of implying Drexler's visions are "science fiction".

Whitesides obviously sees potential for nanotechnology but 
seems to believe there is a definite ceiling to its potential.
Whitesides specifically refers to Drexler after his "science
fiction" remark. Equating a scientist's work with science
fiction is fairly contemptuous.

This is symptomatic of many scientists views of nanotechnology.
Michio Kaku, in his book _Visions_, casts Drexler's notions
aside with a rhetorical paragraph and then uses the polemic
comments of the editor of a science fiction publication and
another individual to berate Drexler's view of nanotechnology.
I find this situation absurd.

Extending the lifespan of flies
Working memory constrains the prisoners' dilemma
Communication can lead to cooperation in the single-shot prisoner's dilemma
Neutrino propulsion
A pheromone guided robot
PAF, Estrogen and AF-DX 116 improve memory


Genetics

Extended life-span and stress resistance in the drosophila mutant
methuselah, Y. J. Lin and L. Seroude and S. Benzer, Science 282:5390,
943--6.

That selective breeding and genetic modifications can make C elegans
and Drosophilia live longer is old news; this article is interesting
because it identifies a single gene change that increases lifespan with
35%. This gene, mth, seems to be some kind of G protein coupled
receptor. Experiments show that methuselah flies can withstand stress
better than normal flies, both in the form of starvation, free
radicals and high temperature. This seems to fit in with what has been
observed in C elegans mutants. Overall, this article suggests that
aging may be linked to stress resistance, and that even single genes
can improve lifespan.


Theory of Cooperation

Working memory constrains human cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma,
Manfred Milinski and Claus Wedekind, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1998,
95, 13755-13758
http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/95/23/13755

An empirical experiment studying what strategies people use in the IPD
when their memory is limited by a distraction task. As the memory load
increases, the subjects tended to shift from pavlovian strategies
("win-stay, lose-shift") towards Tit for Tat; this fits quite well
what has been observed in simulations.


Communication and Cooperation, John H. Miller, Carter Butts, and David
Rode (Submitted to J. Games and Economic Behavior)
http://www.santafe.edu/sfi/publications/Abstracts/98-04-037abs.html

Traditional wisdom says that in a single-shot prisoners' dilemma it is
rational to defect, and that cooperation will not emerge. However, if
the agents can communicate with each other and evolve, then brief
bursts of cooperation can emerge even if they play single-shot PD with
each other. These bursts seems to involve the emergence of more
complex communication which is used to "make deals".


Physics / Spaceflight

Neutrino Propulsion for Interstellar Spacecraft, J. A. Morgan
http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/physics/9811009

Another fun kind of propulsion; by exploiting parity violation in weak
interactions it is possible to create anisotropic neutrino emissions,
which would allow rest mass directly to impulse. The whole system
looks rather unwieldy (involving slowing down and polarizing muons,
using antimuons to make neutrons to regenerate target nuclei etc), but
the concept is fun.

Robotics

A Pheromone-Guided Mobile Robot that Behaves like a Silkworm Moth with
Living Antennae as Pheromone Sensors, Yoshihiko Kuwana and Isao
Shimoyama, International Journal of Robotics Research vol 17 no 9
Steptember 1998 pp 924--933

A small robot is controlled by signals from moth antennae fed through
a very simple neural network, making it able to seek out pheromone
sources.


Nootropics 

Effects of posttraining intrahippocampal injections of platelet-
activating factor and PAF antagonists on memory, L. A. Teather,
M. G. Packard and N. G. Bazan, Neurobiol Learn Mem, 70:3 349-63, nov
1998

Platelet Activating Factor injected in the hippocampus has been shown
to improve memory (Izquierdo95); this paper shows both this effect
(and that a structurally similar derivative has no effect) and that
PAF antagonists impair memory. PAF only acts if injected close to the
training, 2 hours later it has no effect. This seems to suggest that
PAF plays a role in the hippocampal memory consolidation process.


Estrogen improves performance of reinforced T-maze alternation and
prevents the amnestic effects of scopolamine administered systemically
or intrahippocampally, A. J. Fader, A. W. Hendricson and
G. P. Dohanich, Neurobiol Learn Mem, 69:3, 225-40 may 1998

Estrogen seems also to have memory improving effects, at least when
given to ovariectomized rats. It also can protect against the effects
of scopolamine. 


AF-DX 116, a presynaptic muscarinic receptor antagonist, potentiates
the effects of glucose and reverses the effects of insulin on memory,
S. R. Kopf, M. M. Boccia and C. M. Baratti, Neurobiol Learn Mem, 70:3,
305-13, nov 1998

Glucose improves memory , and AF-DX 116 seems to enhance the effect of
it. The drug seems to be a blocker for autoreceptors inhibiting the
release of acetylcholine, so it is possible that it acts by making the
release of Ach (increased by the glucose) even higher. [This is an
interesting possibilitiy for a long-lasting nootropic rather than one
that must be used in conjunction with what is learned. ]

Yes, it seems like there are lots of ways of improving memory
chemically; but deep down they might all be related or a few basic
pathways.

Check out :

At least some cables are repeaterless.

I did an Altavista search on
  +fiber +undersea +cable.

Quite a few people are doing a whole bunch of stuff. See for
example
     http://www.flag.bm/
 The original "crazy idea" wasn't quite so crazy: they actually bury
the cable to a depth of .6 meter in most places, deeper in heavily-travelled
sealanes and fisheries, and 5 meters deep in Hong Kong harbor.
most burial is done with undersea plows, not tunnelling equipment.

Yes, optical repeaters are in use, but I can't tell how many of them
are actually undersea. They are configured permit the cables to shift
from the current DWM technology to UDWM technology without upgrading
the repeaters, so my original barely-informed assertion is not
completely wrong even for these cables.

Why is all this relevant to this list? well, folks, the availability
of international bandwidth is exploding. These cables are increasing the
bandwidth by factors of ten or more every three years. This is faster
even than the internet or processor power curves.

Could microdisplays (see http://www.microdisplay.com) be fitted into 
mood rings and turned into cellular videophones w/MEMS 
identification?

How could such a device be powered so that it still had a low profile 
on the wearer's index finger or thumb?

What kind of range could a MEMS-based two-way telemetry system have 
if this were to be used as a passport/wallet/micro-cell phone?

I agree both deductions are extreme, it's a method I use when testing new new ideas.  I certainly
agree with your other points.  Someone who is striving for gain only to maintain their possessions
or their image may have forgotten that those things should not be ends in themselves, but means
towards happiness.  If I were in the situation of doing work I did not enjoy to maintain my
possessions, I am no longer working for myself but for inanimate objects!  It is hard to imagine
this as a likely route to happiness.  Hopefully I would in time wake up and ditch those possessions
that did not bring me joy, and find better uses for the resources I had been putting into
maintaining them.  However, I don't know that I would find it necessary to divest myself of those
resources.  It seems that the satisfaction of achieving goals would increase with the scope of those
goals, as that increase in scope is allowed by the resources acquired in the meeting of previous,
more modest goals.  For me, happiness consists in part of experiencing growth, moving the mark
higher and trying to achieve more, rather than diminishing myself and then once again striving to
reach my prior state.

From: Peter Merel <peter@connectnet.com>
Subject: The 21CM Conference and Why no one is talking about it.

First off I have to say it was most peculiar and enjoyable to meet in the
flesh so many folk I've corresponded with for years. Best regards to all of
you. What follows is just my unschooled impressions - don't go investing
just on my say-so.

So whappened? The latter half of the morning was a presentation by Mike
Darwin of his successes in mitigating ischemic damage through chilled
fluorocarbon breathing. Mike's now got 50% of his dogs surviving 17
minutes of *warm* ischemia without any effect, the other 50% experiencing
a mild cognitive impairment. He's shooting for 30 minutes. How does it work?
The analogy he used a couple of times was putting ice on a burned thumb -
if you do this quick, you don't get the swelling, pain or injury that you
get otherwise. Apparently the same is true for brains.

There's a lot more to what Mike presented, but the upshot is that if this
work were applied to humans, it would dramatically increase survival rates
from sudden heart attacks. Many hundreds of thousands of lives a year would
be saved. The downside is FDA regulations make this a long term prospect only -
it'll be many many years of red tape, and maybe never, that Americans will
actually benefit from Mike's pioneering work. Non-americans may be luckier.
Mike showed some CAD mockups of a commercial unit that would implement his
protocols, and I get the impression that discussions are under way to
mass-produce the things for use overseas.

But the wonders were truly in the first half of the morning. Fahey and
Wowk have got something wonderful happening. They've got a series of new
cryoprotectants with orders of magnitude less toxicity, better vitrifying
power, better permeability, and better stability than anything in the
literature. They're combining these with a synthetic polymer similar to
fish and beetle antifreeze proteins to ward off devitrification on warming.

The upshot is something that, at very low concentrations too, actually seems
to do the trick both with cooling and warming without any fancy external
gear to increase the rates - no RF warming, and conventional rates of
cooling. What's more they feel they may even get the glass transition to occur
at higher temperatures than dry-ice freezing, so no more liquid nitrogen ...
hell, there are so many still-unexplored research avenues in what they're
doing, if it all works out, maybe even permafrost or a conventional meat
locker might be okay for short term storage (they didn't say that!).

Most of their experiments so far were with rabbit kidneys and human sperm,
but the most dramatic stuff they showed was two experiments done just last
week with rabbit brains. They showed the micrographs and compared them with
the infamous ones that made a non-cryonicist out of Mike Darwin.

You folk know I'm no biologist. I know a bit of parlour neurology, but
I'm basically pig-ignorant. Still I have eyes: these new and very very early
experiments - really just shots in the dark - preserved many orders of
magnitude more structure on all scales than modern techniques. Everything
from the molecular guts of axons up to the macrostructure looked essentially
intact. Compared with the usual torn-and-minced micrographs this was
just stunning.

The most dramatic moment of the day occurred when a member of the audience
asked Brian Wowk how long it would take to scale this up to whole bodies.
Brian said, "a very long time". Mike Darwin chimed in, "no, I have to disagree
with Brian. Given these new results I just don't think it's all that hard ..."
You could hear the jaws dropping all around the room. Not a pretty sound,
mind you ...

As to why no one is talking, I suppose they're all waiting for prospectuses.
Having just bought a new house for Y2K I have bugger-all to invest, but FWIW
I sure wish I did. Kent and Falloon must be over the moon - there seem
to be many billions in conventional applications of this work quite apart
from the cryonics potential. And Fahey says they've achieved all this in just
5 months of active work.

thanks mike.  i have a power mac and a unix box on my desk at work.
i use the mac almost exclusively, the unix box only for matlab and a
couple other things.  heres a coincidence for you:  i was at the library
book sale one week ago today and was looking at heinlein's stranger

Actually it's not only the "born agains" that are opposed to TV...and to a
somewhat lesser extent...radio.

I happen to dispise it myself...and I'm non relegious bordering on atheistic.
Television is mindnumbing...and radio is only slightly....very
slightly...better.

I don't even need to search back beyond today's postings.  Regard this:

< We should immediatley eliminate any
government spending in education and reduce taxes - possibly selling
off all government education related resources and refunding the money
to tax payers. >

I'm sure the guy who posted that suggestion is a generous and lovable
person with the best intentions, whose proposal is grounded in a theory of
economics rather than a simple distaste for helping provision the
commonweal.  So `fuck you, Jack' might sound like a very unfair and
offensive way to sum up what he's written.  But in practice, I think that's
what it amounts to.  

The technological basis for our wealthy western societies certainly derives
from the basic universal education which the community insists upon
(however clumsily it's implemented) and which we all share in paying for.
So does the minimal open-mindedness and tolerance for diversity that keeps
us all from maiming each other.  Any system can be skimmed or abused, but
literally eliminating state schooling would impose the most dire
consequences on the children of the poor and feckless, and then a few years
later on all of us as we grow an ignorant and resentful underclass.  

>you can't imagine how anyone could honorably differ with you on the issue

It's true that I lack empathy for the economic doctrines often assumed
here, which appear to wish out of existence the long, brutal and bloody
stand-over history of owners against workers that created the substructure
for present hierarchies of wealth.  If anyone finds this hard to believe,
let alone to square with the bizarre mythology of Ayn Rand, I diffidently
suggest a glance at some history books along the lines of THE COMMON
PEOPLE, by G. D. H. Cole and Raymond Postgate.

For every brilliant innovator who multiplied humanity's common wealth, and
maybe got richer doing it, there was at least one ruthless extorter backed
by thugs with sticks or guns who kept in line the people doing the
productive work in farms or factories, quite often with the connivance or
armed support of law and government.  (But this sort of discussion is
already in breach of the rules of this list, so I'll retire.)

Cells are huge, cells are conglomerates containing thousands of factories, but who said anything
about cells? Drexler made an analogy between nano machines  and something that was the same
size, Ribosomes. Ribosomes are machines that input digital information (messenger RNA) and
raw materials (amino acids) and output a finished product (a protein). The analogy isn't perfect,
a ribosome can't make anything, but it's not bad because it can make any protein and there are
a hell of a lot of them.

A full rod logic nanocomputer with the power of a modern mainframe would be far larger than a
ribosome of course, it would need to have about 150 billion atoms, a cube 1000 nanometers on
an edge would do it, that's about as big as another machine, a mitochondria. A complete cell is
about 20,000 nanometers in diameter and has 8000 times the volume.

Certainly. I can imagine circumstances under which I would be much more
private about my views on certain issues. If I were living under Stalinist
Soviet communism with my current political views, I would be extremely
cautious about how (and to whom) I expressed my views.

>From the latter. I still believe that psychedelics can be valuable tools by
enabling the imbiber to take very different perspectives. Among all the
silly ideas I've had under the influence, I've also had some valuable
insights and forceful reminders of things I already knew but was not paying
enough attention to. However, these substances don't make you change--the
hard work of altering yourself for the better based on these insights remains.

I'm sure that the reduction of my enthusiasm for psychedelics has nothing
to do with fear of the tribe. Back when I was using LSD, I remember an
occasion when, accompanying a non-altered friend, I walked calmly and
confidently between two uniformed policemen to enter a donut shop. I was
amused by the policemen clustered around the donut shop, but not concerned
about arrest since I felt in charge of myself.

I think it's unfortunate that the careful use of psychedelics is not part
of any accepted ritual in this country, as it is in some South American
countries. I saw a program recently showing the use of a mild psychedelic
as part of a weekly (or perhaps it was monthly) ritual in a church. A study
apparently showed that the users of the drug (I think it was ayahuasca)
were physically and psychologically healthy than comparable non-users. The
structure of the ritual use ensured that the drug was not overused, and
that the experience was guided.

Hi all,

the following was cited as a "fuck you jack - I've got mine" attitude:
>< We should immediatley eliminate any
>government spending in education and reduce taxes - possibly selling
>off all government education related resources and refunding the money
>to tax payers. >

It was further suggested that 
>> `fuck you, Jack' might sound like a very unfair and
>>offensive way to sum up what he's written.  But in practice, I think that's
>>what it amounts to.  

Of course, it _might_ be very different ;-)

It might be that this person is saying: 
"let's stop taxing factory workers to pay for rich people's education." 

It might be someone saying 
"let's stop having an elitist medical system in which the state hands out 
million-dollar lifetime salaries to a select group of individuals, 
legally prohibiting competition."

It might be someone who believes in meritocracy and believes that state 
rationing of education promotes less access, not more. 

To impute a "fuck you Jack" consciousness to this person is as rational 
as Freud imputing hostility where there is none because "it is just 
symptom transference". 

I think that an objective review of comments on this list would reveal 
that self-interest is at once higher and lower than in any other group in 
society. 

Higher because we believe we are the Captains of our souls. Lower because 
we have a vision of the future which we will gladly work toward. The 
critical thing is that we are not willing to enslave others to reach our 
goal: taxation is slavery.

all the very best,
tim

Your friends at TMAN have decided to establish an archive of media

going to be the point person for gathering materials (OK, I admit, I just
want to read all of this wonderful stuff....)  Then we will figure out the
best method of making them available.  At the very least, a bibliography
could be put on a web site.

If you have a print interview, taped copy of a television appearance,
recorded copy of a radio appearance, or essay published in a mass-market
magazine/webzine that you would like included in this, please mail them to:

In the United States, the biggest three federal outlays are social security,
defense, and interest on the national debt.

Social security is paid to all senior citizens who've held jobs for the
requisite amount of time. Amercian workers are currently being taxed at
payroll tax rates higher than is necessary to fund the programs current
needs in an effort to accumulate funds for the "baby boom" generation. In
theory, the trust fund has hundreds of billions of dollars sitting in its
coffers waiting for these citizens to retire. In reality, the trust fund is
only a collection of IOUs from the federal government. All the funds that
should inure to the trust fund are instead bartered away for spending on
other programs and most notably tax cuts for the wealthy.(^1)  Even now, the
purported "federal surplus" is nothing more than an accounting fiction. The
federal government, by direction of Congress, includes the social security
funding surplus in determining its deficit or surplus number each year.
Ironically, corporations are not allowed to include any aspect of surplus
from funding their own pension plans in their earnings figures. If they did,
they would be hanged by the SEC. What is not good for the goose, is
evidently quite alright for the gander. (^1) 90% tax cuts embodied in the
1997 "taxpayer relief" act benefited the top 20% of the U.S. population, 70%
to the top 5%.

Since most wealthy people send their children to private schools that
receive no federal funding, this statement would be largely in error.

Problem with this approach is how are you going to identify merit? Test
every single kid? How will you design the test? How will the test account
for different cultural backgrounds? How will children who do not test well
be properly evaluated by such a system? What would the cost be of such a
program? What are all the kids going to do if they are no in school? What
happens to the millions of teachers that no longer have jobs? Who will
compensate for the lost income and payroll taxes? What about the substantial
industries that gird themselves within a large school population?
Meritocracy is the pipedream of people who simply see a better place for the
billions spent on education, that place being their pocket. Once last
question, how will be get the chance to better themselves if they are only
tested in the context of their current position? Is the raw aptitude of a
child that significant that we could decide their path 5 years of age and
on?

Ironically, every view voiced on the list generally champions itself as the
one with the general interest of all people at its core. Additionally, every
view is viewed by its adherents as the most capable method to maximizing the
overall "good" experienced by society.

Altruism could be the biggest death in the next century. Cooperation, which
was historically required by societies to prosper, may become unnecessary in
a new age of individual self-reliance. High technology might be the slayer.
Taxation is no slavery in and of itself. Mandatory compliance to the laws of
a ruling body can be viewed as slavery but that is the price of altruism.
We've needed cooperation among ourselves for thousands of years. Governments
are simply devices to develop and enforce laws which in turn preserve the
Cooperative. As long as we must cooperate, we'll need governments to mediate
our individuality.

But the futures we describe on this list could be of scenarios where
altruism and cooperation are no longer necessary, at least for survival. You
might benefit from the creativity of another but interaction is not
required. But won't laws still be necessary? Laws governing the rights and
rules of uploading, the forbidden software for nanobots, etc.? Central
governments may become outmoded as enforcers of law, but law may be with us
for a long time to come.

"Long length" of course is understood in the context of repeaterless

Indeed there are rumors that there is already much more overseas
bandwidth available than the telcos are currently selling and that the
prices are kept artificially high. On the other hand I've just heard
that the prices for overseas cables are dropping fast, which is good
news, because the German Research Network will be able to upgrade its
connections, which in turn means better connectivity for me. ;-)

As a matter of fact, the man might be doing a smart thing. Though
lacking formal investigation, anecdotal evidence does seem to suggest
that watching TV for long hours does erode basic mental capabilities,
and prevents their formation in children, particularly young ones.

Since rationing TV time in a family is difficult, it may be best to
abstain altogether, difficult as it may appear in the first few weeks.
Is anybody aware of some basic study, e.g. as average TV hours/week
correlate with IQ?

harms not one person and when developed could save the lives of millions,
and that is all the evidence medical ethicists need to declare it grossly immoral.

i notice no one in the family has offer the slightest criticism of the
technique.  these are the only two kids in the family, both sides,
cosequently, they have a huge number of aunts and uncles grandparents
and even great randparents.  over the years, toys have become muuuch
cheaper than they were when we were that age, specifically big
molded plastic thingies.  consequently my brother in law is struggling
with how to teach kids they need to work for things, when they
are being buried in toys, more than can will even fit in their rooms.

 I agree testing extremes is good for verifying universal rules. But for strategies, which is what I
think I am talking about here, it simply tells you the range over which the strategy is valid. I believe
there is a range in which my strategy works.

I would agree that is mostly true. I think I have been steadily growing and achieving more. I have
noticed however that my goals are getting larger but more abstract, so the physical resources I need to
achieve them are getting less not more. In this context, more resources simply get in the way. Real
world resources are never without cost as well as benefit, at least in the attention you have to pay to
them.

 I do like acquiring resources, mostly as a side effect of what I really want to do. Every so often, I
try to clear out the surplus. Going back to the European/American split, I've noticed the "more is
better" meme is very strong in the US. If an 8 oz steak is good, a 24 oz steak must be great, eh?

 Perhaps the Fermi paradox (no aliens here) indicates that the "more is better" meme dies out at higher
levels of intelligence ;-) In our current state, expanding fast across the universe makes the most
sense. With more understanding, we might find goals that don't require it. Back to the Singularity
again.

No, that is not guaranteed, but this goes back to defining transhumanism as
both an area of philosophy and an area of endeavor.  While the endeavors
related to transhumanism can result in actions based in bigotry, the
philosophy of transhumanism itself does not support such viewpoints and
rather proposes more positive uses for technological progress.  Not everyone
who engages in scientific or technological progress also agrees with the
philosophical aspect of transhumanism, that is why we rely on the
declaration of individuals to distinguish who might agree with transhumanist
philosophy and who might not.  

As for South Carolina, well, I grew up there and you've barely scratched the
surface of its backwardness.  I consider my years there a strong object
lesson in the memes that I do not want to see continue.

i belive that if our goal is to transform ourselves using different kind
of technologies we will probably arrive to a state of so much diversity
that races and sexual distinctions or other classes of classification

Such a study would be virtually impossible. Most children watch TV. Since
who don't watch TV would come from exceptional families (whether these be
Born Agains or Transhumanists) it would be pointless to try to do a
comparison with the two groups. I once thought about doing a study on
effect of television violence on children, but gave up for the same
reasons: most children watch television violence, the backgrounds of those
who don't are too exceptional use as a comparison.

I did try getting away from mainstream media for a while. So of 12 months I
didn't watch TV, radio, or the newspapers. It was a little disappointing
that during that time the USSR collapsed, the Berlin Wall fell down, and
Eastern Europe was freed.

I remember most of the studies reporting positive correlations between HOURS
of TV watched and GRADES, IQ, etc were samples of families who limited not
only hours watched but what was watched. If these parentis had a higher than
average IQ or university education I would hope the studies did partial
correlations on these variables as well. It may not be TV at all but an
environmental and genetic correlation being picked up.

Someone needs to go back and do a methods and meta analysis.

The real study I am waiting for is one evaluating children on unsupervised
TV watching and Total Hours watched vs. belief in consumerism, faith in
advertising messages, etc

entp:  2.5
entj:  3
istj:    2
enfj:  0.5
esfj:  0.5

all others, nada.  i counted a liner as half for each category.  this is an
interesting result, considering the nt quadrant (rational) is the least
common and yet reporting extropians were 85% in that region.  the
most common category in the general population (esfj: 15%) we
scored only 2.5%.  so.  bad news my friends:  we are weird.  {8^D spike

Why are you only considering those who watch and those who don't?  The
question asked refers to the *average hours/week* as related to IQ level.

I also stopped watching TV for one full year.  Didn't strike me as a big
deal
one way or the other.

The study in this area that I found interesting suggested that the content
was
not all that important. Rather, it was the passive nature of TV viewing that
was problematic.  Too many hours of TV in young children were suspected
of impairing normal neural development because what children normally
do with that time is active play.  Fewer play hours were also suspected
of leading to fewer social skills.  Even so, I don't doubt that there's a
de-sensitization taking place.  I also think that TV programs can lower
one's self-esteem in a number of ways.  Yes, almost everyone is better
looking than you.  But what I remember was that everyone was so great
at arguing.  I could always come up with the perfect line a half-hour after
I needed it.  TV actors had the right line at the right time.  I worry that
TV
creates a world for small children that they accept as real on some level,
but they cannot meet the ideals and expectations that world establishes.

jason, consider what just happened on this forum in the past 10 days.  you
tossed out a meme, several people grokked it (love that word), someone
else asked a question, someone proposed a poll, we all learned something

The problem here is that the you can't treat *average hours of TV
watched/week* as independent of lots of other variables that impact on IQ.
For instance from memory you'll find that children from families with a
higher socio-economic status watch less TV. Of course you could control for
a factor like socio-economic status, but you'll still be left with the
problem that within any relatively homogeneous group the reasons why more
or less TV is watched is likely to have various impacts on the child that
affect IQ *independent* of how many hours of TV are watched.

I am not saying you couldn't do such a naturalistic study (and certainly
not that IQ and TV aren't related), just that it would be hard to get clear
results.

Well I have also thought about this.

If TV is a really great source of violence, then the natives of Rwanda must
really have been watching a LOT of TV before they went out with machettes
and killed several hundred thousands of their fellow citisens with
machettes.

I do believe there is is latent violence in most societies, and naturally TV
is a source of inspiration for a few individuals, but generally I think that
together with other media it can have a leveling effect. Exposing the
biggest problems in society so that it is possible to act upon them before
they becomes reason of massviolence.

Thus you can argue that TV is a source of less violence.

Hi all,

people asked about *average hours/week* as related to IQ level.

patrick said
>The problem here is that the you can't treat *average hours of TV

Same with lead and IQ. Averaged across society, the net $cost of lead 
poisoning is probably in the billions. However, in any individual it is 
perhaps .4 IQ points -- too small to disentangle from a myriad of 
dramatically larger effects.

One one around this is to "Actually have a theory" </TM>

That is, to predict WHY two vars are related. Why should TV and IQ be 
related? Is the relationship causal A->B or B->A?

If TV is supposed to lower IQ, you could boot strap off the "music raises 
IQ" data
(see Rauscher FH, et al. Music and spatial task performance. Nature. 1993 
Oct14;365(6447):611).

However, I have published a pretty nice failure to replicate this study. 
Stough,-Con; Kerkin,-Bridget; Bates,-Tim; Mangan,-Gordon(1994) Music and 
spatial IQ. Personality-and-Individual-Differences.1994 Nov; Vol 17(5): 
695. 

30 Ss participated in an experiment in which the effect of music (Mozart, 
popular dance music, or silence) on Progressive Matrices scores was 
measured. No significant effect of music on IQ performance was found, 
contrary to the F. H. Rauscher et al (1993) finding of a significant 
improvement in spatial IQ scores after listening to a Mozart piece 
compared with either silence or relaxation music. 

Others also failed to find it.

The point is, _theories_ can be tested, relationships cannot. As Paul 
Meehl wisely noted :the null hypothesis is (quasi)always wrong. The real 
question is whether the theory reduces complexity by more than the words 
used to write it out ;-) 

In psychology this is hardly ever the case. We mostly just have political 
theory wrapped up as science - bull about how people with schizophrenia 
are never violent, IQ isn't heritable, EQ is completely learned, and such 
like. That is why i moved to cognitive science.

best,
tim

A bit of a strawman argument no? Do you really mean to say that if TV leads
to violence then its the only cause of violence?

More to the point: I don't think critics of TV violence are trying to say
that TV leads naturally to more violence, but perhaps desensitization to
it. Some argue that it is bad that we teach our children through television
that violence is a game and that death is not important. There is some
bizarre statistic that by the time a child reaches 15 they've seen upwards
of 10000 deaths depicted on television.

Note: I don't necessarily believe TV does any harm to a child, but its
silly to misrepresent the argument.

>Exposing the

I wasn't aware that most children's shows dealt with real problems. Did I
miss that episode of Scooby Dooby Doo or Lost in Space? OK. So I'm showing
my age, but I do not believe TV shows have become that much more socially
relevant in the intervening years (nor perhaps should they).

>Thus you can argue that TV is a source of less violence.

Without proper studies you can pretty much argue anything.

No I was just trying to say that there is a lot of violence in any society,
and most often there is a lot of violence in societies where they probably
don't wacth a lot of tv. Thus the argumant that TV causes violence cannot be
the whole truth.

>More to the point: I don't think critics of TV violence are trying to say

Yes but was not the argument that was used in the posting I answered.

>Some argue that it is bad that we teach our children through television
>that violence is a game and that death is not important. There is some

Most children certainly knows the difference between TV violence and real
violence. But some kids from "bad families" has no defence against what they
see, and they have no values to tell them that violence is bad. Perhaps they
are even abused themself by the ones that should show them love. Those kids
can probably be inspired by TV violence.

But I don't think that it is a problem with TV. It is a social problem with
these kids and should be treated as such.

>Note: I don't necessarily believe TV does any harm to a child, but its

Yes. I was just using an extreme argument to make my POW more clear.

I wasn't thinking about childrens TV, although Danish child tv does raise
social issues. I was thinking about news program documentaries etc.

Theory!!! I once got in trouble in my psychology for arguing that too many
studies were fishing expeditions. You go out, trawl the data, find a
"significant" difference and publish the results. Theories can just get in
the way!

What people don't seem to appreciate is that most constructs like IQ are
multifactorial and its almost guaranteed that any two groups are going to
differ. Once you find out the difference you can easily create a theory to
fit the direction of difference.

People don't even bother to find out if there is a substantive difference.
All the fuss about men and women having differing verbal and mathematics
ability (based on data from the SAT, and which I believe has now
disappeared) was based on a difference of less than 0.5 standard
deviations.

There was a recent article in Nature/Science suggesting that music training
in childhood permanently raised verbal IQ. I haven't read the article so
can't comment, but it seemed to have surface plausibity. The argument that
similar (same?) areas of the brain are used by both.

Couldn't agree more.

Here's another example for Castro to show the marvels of communism. 
Just watch, when our "government" declares this sort of
experimentation illegal, Cuba will welcome the scientists and their
megabucks with open arms.  Cuba already has a great reputation for
allowing biotech work.  They'd love the opportunity to make the US
look stupid.

Viva Cuba!

Always interested. Here's an opener: security of FTP site access and
transfers.

I figured out the other day how WS_FTP encrypts its passwords in its INI
file, which is rather weak and a major weakness for anyone using this FTP
client to transfer files. Essentially, the encryption works like this: each
letter of the password is converted to its hexadecimal value. Then one hex
digit is added to the letters hex value based on its position in the
password, starting with 0 for the letter in the first position.

So, while you may only FTP encrypted files to an FTP site, by using a weak
password encryption like this a hacker could easily sniff out your password
and then use the FTP site with impunity in YOUR name.

As a long time musician (+15 Years) I am absolutely convinced that music is
no more than a stylised abstraction of the human language!

Music consists of rythm, tone and pitch. When I hear my kids learning to
speak they don't say the words right at first, but the rythm, tone and pitch
is in place long before that.

My youngest girl is called Clara and when she tries to say her name it comes
out as ara or aha.
My oldest son is called Magnus and she pronounces that as arhus.
When she tries to say "thank you for dinner" (tak for mad) it comes out as
"ak or ad".
In fact everything she tries to say comes out as a "musical" version of the
right words and sentences. Even when it's all garbled the rythm is usually
right.

It would also explain what a musical genre is. A dialect of a musical
language. When the dialect becomes too different from it's root language it
becomes a new language.

Any music we don't know ususally seems boring and superficial. That is
probably because we don't understand the "language" and "dialect" of that
genre. Thus we cannot enjoy the details, which is what usually defines a
genre.

This is nonsense. You can't reverse a logical implication. If B follows
from A, A doesn't necessarily follow from B. The Rwandian butchery,
which can probably be subsumed under that catch-all of "ethnic
conflicts", doesn't tell us anything about the influence of TV violence
on (children in) Western society.

I agree 100%, the idea was that they would not be able to dismiss

breaking the law.

I again agree 100%. I have John Lotts book. I support concealed
carry. I am former NRA/ILA. But in a town where the average citizen
has no idea that handguns have been banned 15 years ago the chance
of getting concealed carry passed is 0.0  the odds of getting all
gun laws repealed is less than that. We must enforce personnal
responsibility first, fill the jails with lawbreakers, and force
people to see the hypocrisy going on.

One of the new gun laws Daley is proposing would prevent gun shops
from selling handguns to residents of Chicago. I actually like the
idea, either people will move out as I have done, or will scream
bloody murder. either works for me.

I always loved the bit on "Saturday Night Live" when Charleton
Heston guest hosted. "We of the NRA will LOAN you a gun for 5 days,
just visit anyone of our 2000 outlets..."


>Use of a gun in murder should be an automatic death sentence, with

I agree once again 100%. I favor the death penalty. I left out the
death penalty in the interest of getting the thing passed. It
should be a provision however.

>The Mayor of Chicago should start wondering why it is that the
>cities and states with the most restrictive gun laws seem to have

He already knows this, The mayor is surrounded by armed body
guards, and the mayor and city council exempted themselves by
appointing themselves "officers of the court". They may conceal
carry, (most do!) but the average joe is less important. A blatant
double standard.

I couldn't agree with you more Michael.

I'm not sure television has any simple effects; it might turn out that
it makes certain people more passive but not others, increases certain
forms of intelligence (possibly on the expence of other forms) and
that it makes certain people have less inhibitions against certain
forms of violence. The point is, this is a very complex phenomenon,
well worth studying.

But from a more transhuman point of view, how can we make use of it?

Apropos the neuroscience of the music, I just found this at biomednews
(http://biomednet.com/biomednews):

Feel the Music
by Julie Clayton

...

Anne Blood and colleagues at McGill University in Montreal,
have previously found which areas of the brain are involved in pitch
perception, imagery or memory for melodies. To test whether emotional
reactions to music could also be pinpointed to different brain regions
they performed PET scans in 10 volunteers as they listened to music
(all having been brought up under the same Western influence to
eliminate bias). To evoke pleasure or displeasure, the music had been
composed especially as six different versions of the same original
score that varied in their level of consonance. At one extreme, the
music was highly consonant, with all the notes sounding pleasant
together. At the other extreme, combinations of notes used sounded
progressively more unpleasant.

They found that as the music increased in unpleasantness,
the parahippocampal gyrus became active on the right side of the
brain,an area which is known to contain emotion-related
neurons. As music became more pleasant to listen to, the frontal
lobe regions, orbitofrontal cortex, frontal pole, and
subcallosalcingulate, became activated on both sides of
the brain. These areas were different from those involved in
music perception, but are also known to be involved in
emotion. Next, Blood will be looking at people listening to their most
loved, and most hated piece of music, in order to maximise the
strength of emotional responses, including during the "shivers down
the spine" phenomenon. It is unlikely, however, that these imagine
studies could yet demonstrate the music preferences of different
people.


[Nice result, although I'm having some personal theories about the
role of parahippocampal gyrus in dissonant music; the other areas seem
to be properly emotional. ]

As a neuroscientist (a theoretical, computational one) I also agree
with Max's statement. It seems to fit quite well with the lesions
producing amusia being located in the right superior temporal lobe,
roughly corresponding to the language-related cortex in the left
hemisphere. A guess may be that we use the higher auditory cortices on
the right side for rhythm, tone, pitch and likely some emotional
content of speech and sound, and this is then specialized for music
(just as we have some reading-related cortex in the temporo-occipital
region behind Wernicke's area). 

(everything modulo cortical lateralization, of course. Sorry for the
anatomese. I'm starting to sound like Eugene :-)

Back to the main question: does the training increase intelligence? I
haven't got any new hard evidence to add, but I would guess it is
likely. Training, attention, the development of personal skills in
general seems to promote intelligence.

Some more cholinergic substances to enhance memory. 

http://biomednet.com/biomednews/conf/sfn98/Monday/story_6.html :

...
Neuroscientist Edward Levin and his colleagues at Duke University have
found that a nicotine agonist AR-R 17779 can improve learning and
memory in rats undergoing a radial maze test, and have filed for a
patent on the compound. It stimulates a subtype of nicotine receptors
called alpha-7, and was shown to act in the hippocampus. This region
is central to learning and memory, and is often impaired in people
with Alzheimer's disease. "We're excited by these findings", says
Levin, "they indicate that AR 17779 may have potential therapeutic
use".

Similarly, Patrick Lippiello and colleagues at the
R.J. Reynolds Company in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, have also
developed two compounds - RJR 2557 and RJR-1734 - that also stimulate
Ach receptors in the brain, and which increase both short and
long-term memory in the rat. They were also protected from dying when
later exposed to toxic chemicals that normally cause the cells to
die. This suggests, says Lippiello, that the compounds may have the
ability to prevent the death of brain cells in Alzheimer's disease
patients. But clinical trials of either sets of compounds have yet to
demonstrate this in humans.

This song is dedicated to the person with open sores, a cleaver sticking out,
blood all over his shirt, and mold growing on him, who saw my "Singularity
2005" T-Shirt, and struck up a conversation at WindyCon XXV.

"Curse You, Eric Drexler" or "It's Hard To Be a Zombie"
  by Eliezer Yudkowsky

Chorus:
It's hard to be a zombie in the age of nanotech.
My arms have reattached themselves, my head's back on my neck.
So maybe I'll retire, and maybe I'll take five;
Curse you K. Eric Drexler, I might as well be alive.

No-one screams in horror when I stagger through a room.
They think I'm drunk or stupid, not an instrument of doom.
I drooled blood on one of them, and all he did was grin.
I tried to bite his head off, but my teeth would not sink in.

Chorus:
It's hard to be a zombie in the age of nanotech.
My arms have reattached themselves, my head's back on my neck.
So maybe I'll retire, and maybe I'll take five;
Curse you K. Eric Drexler, I might as well be alive.

My open sores have closed, and my gangrene's gone away.
My pasty skin has tanned, and I walk the light of day.
My bloodshot eyes are white again, my acne's cleared up too,
It's tough to be undead in these days of healing goo.

Chorus:
It's hard to be a zombie in the age of nanotech.
My arms have reattached themselves, my head's back on my neck.
So maybe I'll retire, and maybe I'll take five;
Curse you K. Eric Drexler, I might as well be alive.

They say you can't undo it, so be careful who you kill.
And ripping someone's heart out, sure seems to fit the bill.
So imagine my surprise when my victim greeted me.
Turns out he'd signed with Alcor back in nineteen eighty-three.

Chorus:
It's hard to be a zombie in the age of nanotech.
My arms have reattached themselves, my head's back on my neck.
So maybe I'll retire, and maybe I'll take five;
Curse you K. Eric Drexler, I might as well be alive.

(Additional verses welcome, but I reserve the right to edit or reject them on
grounds of rhythmic incompatibility with a tune only I know.)

So how does this compare to a child who sees hundreds of his or her neighbors
slaughtered in front of them by government or guerrilla thugs? Also, how does
this compare to children who grow up on farms where animals are slaughtered as
an everyday practice? How about to a child whose parents are abusing each other
and their children on a daily basis? I'm sure that compared to a baby raised in
a bubble there may be a difference, but compared to children raised in the real
world, not in the suburban fantasy land, I doubt that there is much difference.
Making suburban kids aware that the rest of the world does not grow up in their
saccharine way of life may even be of benefit to them when they leave their
cocoons...

Any show that glorifies the perpetrators of violence would obviously have a
suggestive impact for the negative. However the perpetrators are almost always
defeated by normal people meeting fire with fire, which is a rational, logical,
real world solution to agressors like Saddam Hussein or the local gang banger.

How about spreading our memes via a wacky Extropian sit-com.  
It's a story about two cops that don't follow the rules.  One is an 
upload with a jupiter brain complex, the other is only an inch tall 
but don't ask him if size matters.  These hard-nosed rookies are
there whenever individuals' rights are threatened, wherever 
irrationality, passive optimism, or technophobia raises its ugly 
head.  Next week's episode:  

              "I Got Your Singularity . . . Right Here Pal."

ftp passwords are sent as cleartext between the client and server,
so ws_ftp's .ini settings obfuscation does nothing to help or hinder
someone who wants your password, unless that someone has access to
your ws_ftp .ini file.

There is an rfc out concerning secure ftp, but it isn't widely
implemented yet.  See <http://www.mit.edu/people/marc/ftpsec/ftpsec.html>.

Good news from the Sixth Foresignt Conference in Santa Clara.
Five major advances were announced. Here is a brief summary of
each advance:

1 - Bucky Horns: Sumio Iijima of NEC Corporation, Japan, announced 
the ability to grow this new class of carbon nanostructures, the 
next step beyond buckyballs and buckytubes. 

2 - Biopowered Nanomotor: Carlo Montemagno of Cornell University 
announced success in building biological-motor powered mechanical 
devices. All the tools are now in place to make this happen within 
a living cell. (I posted about this one on Friday)

3 - Nanomanipulator: MinFeng Yu of Washington University generated 
excitement by showing the first-ever movies of interactive 3D 
manipulation of carbon nanotubes, using a new research device built 
by Zyvex LLC. 

4 - Nanotube Transistor: Cees Dekker of Delft University of 
Technology, The Netherlands, presented work on buckytubes as a new 
kind of molecular quantum wire and a field effect nanotube 
transistor, called TubeFET. 

5 - Single-Molecule Tape Measure: Mark Akeson of University of 
California, Santa Cruz, announced the use of a molecular pore able 
to electrically "read" long molecules at high speed, even 
differentiating among DNA bases in groups as small as five. 
Next goal: rapidly read DNA base-by-base.

probably this singleton is already here, represented by the complete
borganisation of the human-electronics systems... he is just simply
evolving gradually to higher degree of complexity, conscience.
...well that is not the purpose of my mail ;)...

you used the term "computronium" for optimized computational matters, i
find it a nice one... did you coined it or does it appear in some book
or sci-fi litterature, culture ?

I think that anyone who regarded themselves as a transhuman would
necessarily be a bigot, since they would regard themselves as greater than
human.  So they would be racially bigoted against humans.

If someone who regards themselves as transhuman has altered genes, then they
are calling themselves superior on the basis of their genes.  It is a short
hop from there to making judgements about different human races on the basis
of their genes.  If transhumans are not so bigoted, I would guess it will be
more a matter of disinterest than of principle.

Which is also rather easy for users on internet connected LANs or WANs. A common
practice to break into a system is to spoof yourself as an authorized device by
assuming its IP address when it is offline. Once you are in you then have a login
to get by, which is no big deal, as most desk drivers at companies which have no
centrally controlled password system typically just use their name with no
password, or their name as the user and their name as the password, or first and
last, etc. Once you are in, you can copy the ws_ftp.ini file you can find on
every drive the user you are spoofing has access to.

Right now I have implemented a patch to prevent this sort of thing from happening
on the network here, but I doubt that many small businesses know or care about it
at this point.

 I would tend to turn the problem around. Privacy is the natural state,
as the low side of communication volume -> we can't communicate
perfectly with the rest of society. We are prisoners of our own skul,
individuality: we can't -physically- share all information with the rest
of society.

  There is an old BW french movie with young rebel jean paul belmondo
(for those who know), and he talks about the sentence "sleeping with
someone"*. Arguing that in fact we don't really sleep with, we merely
sleep beside someone!

   CU. Manu.

------
* as in sleeping, not having sex of course :-)

BTW, fill me for ENFP. Although I would tend to identify with ENTP. I
can't believe that distinction between soft and hard hearted...

There's a lot of neural hardware supporting things like bigotry, which a smart
transhuman would disable if at all possible.  Saying that a transhuman is a
bigot "by definition" implies a lot of connotations which may be absent -
hatred, smugness, prejudices.  Are you a bigot because you consider yourself
"superior" to chimpanzees?  No - you don't fear or hate them, and you don't
exult in your superiority.  If you did, you'd be a bigot, with all the correct
negative connotations of implied, and it doesn't matter that the assertions
generating your emotions would be correct.

I would define bigotry as a condition testing for a certain set of evolved
human emotions, and not as a condition testing relational assertions of ability.

So living with abusive parents or in a slaugherhouse is the real world? And
my childhood without this is some sort of disneyland? Yeah right. Either
you are very bitter about others having a happier background or you are
just posturing. I am well aware I have had a privileged background. I have
been very lucky. Are you trying to tell me that my life has been somewhat
less real? What exactly is your transhuman vision of the future? Some sort
of Clockwork Orange Utopia with lashings of ultraviolence to ensure that
people have some strong emotional rush and living Really Real Lives?

Do you honestly believe living through war makes you live any sort of
better life? My grandmother and mother lived through the World War II in
camps in Eastern Europe, my grandfather was shot fighting the Russians as a
partisan. I can tell you they don't feel they lived a more "real" life
because of it, and I would love to see you tell my grandmother to her face
that watching TV would have helped her get out of her cocoon and better
prepare her for the real world. Please do: I'll sell tickets...

In the next two nights, you will have a chance to observe the 
most intense meteor showers in 32 years!
Just get somewhere into a clean open space at night on Nov. 17 or 18,
and look up!

Too bad Melbourne is a little out of it. West or North of us would be much
better (est. 2000/hour vs 400/hour).

Some of the best sites are:

This is more in line with I expected of a transhumanist personality type - an
XNTP.  The NT is no surprise, however the predominance of the J's over P's in
the latest survey is most surprising.  I would have thought that
Transhumanists would be more likely to suspend 'judgment' in favor of a more
objective 'perceiving' style.

I regret that the human emotional system seems to be designed so that high
levels of stress are needed to really grow up.  (Although sometimes this
occurs automatically at age 40.)  I don't know that I would recommend doing
this deliberately, but quite a few people, including myself, report that
emotional maturity began after their lives were threatened.  Someday,
undoubtedly, we'll bypass this trigger.  But it is there.

There's an interesting Dilbert cartoon in which Dilbert thinks, "Sometimen I
feel like I've been faking everything since fourth grade.  I wonder if other
people get that feeling."  A few days after the crisis had passed, I realized
I would never get that feeling again.

I don't romanticize it or try to explain it in philosophical terms.  I
wouldn't be the least bit surprised to find that it reduced to neurochemicals.
 So I don't want to hear ten thousand reasons why an ideal world wouldn't work
that way.

Well you better get that level of stress just right: the recent Society for
Neuroscience meeting suggests that childhood abuse (emotional not physical)
may lead to permenant brain damage:

You have additional support from the finding that in non musicians, there 
is a right hemisphere advantage for music while in trained musicians, 
this shifts to the left hemisphere: it is "lingufied" 

OF course the right hemisphere has an ability to read single words and 
remains the seat of prosody (roughly the equivalent of rhythm).

I have to disagree.  Human language has its own song, true; but the 
rhythm, key and timbre of human speech has its musical roots in the 
calls of mammals, and colors the sterile cortical facticity of the word 
with felt limbic emotion.  Words came later.     Joe

Perhaps -- though it may also be that human language is an
abstraction of music!

Nietzsche wished he had "sung" _Zarathustra_. Some 20th century
composers wished they had written novels (or political tractates).
Nietzsche was smarter, I think.

The question ultimately requires determining how much language
refers outside of itself. Tricky question, to be sure, and not just
for posties (people who refer to their beliefs as "post-modern,"
"post-structuralist," etc. -- also a kind of breakfast cereal with a
very, very high glycemic index).

Off to jam,
Brian.

I was thinking of televisions as tools to help primitive third world 
societies become more socialized and tolerant of Western values.

For all the *damage* that TV has done, it's really COMMERCIAL 
BROADCAST television that has done the damage, *not* the technology 
of television itself.

We now have new television technologies like DVD, HDTV, and digital 
video over broadband internet, that render NTSC television hardware 
obsolete.  Soon, I believe, there will be an internet infrastructure 
upgrade in which very large chunks of previously allocated RF 
spectrum are reallocated as public spectrum for use in a broadband 
internet backbone.

This is the public spectrum microcellular model in which gps-based 
broadband autorouter/proxies are mass produced.

These "content distribution nodes" will be sealed black boxes with 
parallel dsps and gigabytes of ram.  Sort of like PCS cell sites, 
except much higher bandwidth, and with variable power, so that cell 
density changes result in automatic reconfiguration of the nodes.

This will result in an internet infrastructure in the industrialized 
countries that supports broadband web access, including streaming 
wavelet-based HDTV.

Since this technology can be implemented with today's technologies, 
the only impediment to implementation is the current volume of 
inventory of old technologies that sits in the wholesale and retail 
distribution warehouses of the "Western" countries.

I would like to suggest that the developed countries procede on a 
systematic, region by region basis, and replace old spectrum devices 
with digital hdtv interactive devices.  The old spectrum "broadcast" 
devices can then be loaded up on freighters and sent to third world 
countries (see http://www.worldbank.org/) and donated for the purpose 
of assisting these nations in the process of development.

Rather than repeating the commercial broadcast "mistakes" of 
appealing to the lowest common deonominator of visceral programming, 
we could instead fit these "low definition" devices (now obsolete in 
the west) with digital set-top decoders capable of providing low 
bandwidth WWW access.

In the process, we could be balancing the material wealth, by 
providing third-world countries with what amounts to Western riches.  
They will not mind that the Westerners consider these items to be 
"hand me downs".  In the process, we could accomplish the objective 
decreasing international tensions.

Why do Americans need AM/FM/UHF/VHF, when the content from these 
spectrum hogging broadcast communications systems can be reallocated 
to public use low-power digital microcellular?

Once the transport is in place, and the delivery terminals are 
installed in, for example, the Arab world, how should access be 
handled?  How should automatic content selection be programmed?

I'll do the "The Truman Show" for the Third World, if they put up with
my independent thoughts and actions.

    See http://www.sandia.gov/history.htm

Think of November 17, 1998 Quantum Computing and Nanotech as being the
equivalent of December 7, 1941 Enigma Machine.

We can blame it on Truman: "The Buck Stops Here."

P.S. As a kid I wondered why my television went from Channel 2 to 13, 
what happened to Channel 1?

N. Margolus, "Crystalline Computation', to appear in The Feynman
Lectures on Computation, volume 2 (Anthony Hey, ed.), Addison-Wesley
(1998). Preprint (46 pages; .ps.gz) on the web.

[...]
Thus in the distant future I expect that our most powerful large-scale
general purpose computers will be built out of macroscopic crystalline
arrays of identical invertible computing elements. We would make such
large arrays out of identical elements because they will then be
easier to control, to design, to build and to test. These will be the
distant descendants of todays SIMD and FPGA computing devices: when we
need to perform inhomogenous computations, we will put the
irregularities into the program, not the hardware. The problem of
arranging the pieces of a computation in space will be part of the
programming effort: architectural ideas that are used today in
physical hardware may reappear as data structures within this new
digital medium. With molecular scale computing elements, a small chunk
of this computronium[63] would have more memory and processing power
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
than all of the computers in the world today combined, and high
Reynold's number CA MD calculations of fluid flow would be practical
on such machines.

Note that I don't expect our highest performance general purpose
computers to be quantum spin computers of the sort discussed in
Section 1.1. In such a machine, the whole computer operates on a
superposition of distinct computations simultaneously. This kind of
quantum parallelism is very delicate, and the overhead associated with
the difficult task of maintaining a superposition of computations over
a large spatial scale will be such that it will only be worth doing in
a very specialized situations -- if it is possible at all[74]. This
won't be something that we will do in our general purpose
computers. [...]

I have long suspected this to be true.  It led me to wonder . . . If we can
confirm this and it becomes accepted as fact, will verbal and emotional
abuse be punishable by the same laws which deal with physical abuse?
I used to work in a domestic violence shelter and it seemed odd to me
that someone could be arrested and jailed for beating someone but
there was no penalty whatsoever for verbal/emotional abuse.  Would
you have to have a way to verify that neural damage had been inflicted?

in the one clear case of successful memetic warfare, it was commercial
broadcast TV that won. By all reports, the fall of eastern germany was

There is no evidence for this, at least in the usual sense of "growing
up" (i.e. developing adult mental abilities, an adult personality). If
you mean "breaking down self-serving bias" it is also not obvious that
stress is the best way of doing it.

Emotional maturity is tricky to define. A lot of pessimists claim they
are realists; are they emotionally mature? But I think you have a
point in that life threatening experiences can have positive effects,
possibly by dissolving various previous imprints. Of course, we have a
sample bias since the people who get positive effects tend to speak
more about it than the people who got bad results.

I'm working on it :-) There is an interesting section about this
matter (as a lot of other >H-relevant stuff) in Austin's _Zen and the
Brain_ (I'm getting tired of referring to it all the time, but even if
you disagree with his conclusions it is a good review of the
neuropsychology of unusual mental states with a nice bibliography).

It is interesting, but I'm not completely buying just this
article. What the article seems to say is that psychological abuse
causes changes in mental state and brain activiation similar to
temporal lobe epilepsy. This is another good reason to limit
psychological abuse, of course, but what isn't shown is that there is
structural damage, just functional damage. The difference is small,
but relevant when it comes to repairing it.

However, I'm actually quite convinced that abuse can produce even
structural damage, a lot of data seems to point in that direction. For
example, it is well known that high levels of stress hormones
(especially the corticoids) damages or kills cells in the hippocampus;
it wouldn't be surprising if this would lead to decreases in memory or
attention capacity for victims of abuse or a stressful upbringing.

I find this thread fun, but it seems to me that sweeping conclusions are
being made on very little data.  I seriously doubt that most extropians
are first-born, nor that any one particular Kiersey temperament sort is
drawn to transhumanist memes.  If anything, I expected to find the more
adventurous minds drawn to it, rather than the more rational.  The
sample size is dreadfully small considering the full data set, not to
mention the new groups of people that will be attracted to this in the
next few years.  I also see a slant due to the fact that you are
conducting the research on an internet list that has gone through
several membership fluctuations and that probably does not fully 
represent the membership of ExI at this time.

Hell, some of us don't need any cotton-picking genetic engineering to feel a
little superior. But that in itself doesn't make you a bigot in my book.
After all, I think I have a superior moral system to a god-believer, but I
don't think that makes me a religious (or anti-religious) bigot. As long as
my opinions are rational and I don't seek to deny rights to any other person
based upon their ethnic/religious status, who cares what my feelings
regarding our relative abilities are?

But this does raise a significant question, which may or may not have a
ready answer depending upon how much humanism is in transhumanism. The
Humanist Manifesto II of 1973 specifically prohibits discrimination (but not
feelings of superiority) as normally defined (except sexual orientation
isn't explicitly mentioned), and I think it would also include transhuman vs
human discrimination. If transhumanist fully embrace humanist ethics, then
we have at least a firm ethical stance on the issue.

The error in this logic is a) since a transhuman may be equally bigoted against
all mere humans, he is not discriminating, and b) since any mere human can
easily become transhuman in such a society, then the fault for remaining human
is not that of the transhuman. Its easy to be bigoted against ignorant people,
since its so easy to cure that affliction in todays society if only the
ignoramus chooses to open his or her eyes. Refusal to do so is the real sin.
Thats why its ok to be bigoted against bigots... ;)

Did you know that sneezing causes permanent brain damage? If this is so, why are
there no laws punishing people who give other people their colds, flus, and
pneumonias? How about holding parents responsible for giving their children
predispositions for allergies? C'mon, people pull your heads out.....

i don't understand why we're talking about humanism, morality, and 
compassion on a listserv dominated by libertarians and objectivists. 
many of the policies people advocate on this listserv indicate to me 
that they don't care about people other than themselves. a posthumanist 
world could very well consist of temporary 
autonomous zones (taz) where everyone would be free to do as they please. 
with the proper technology anarchy and absolute liberty would be possible. 
but how are we going to get there? will it be through cooperation and 
sacrifice or will it be through ruthless competition. i believe that most 
of the people on the list are out of touch with reality. have you ever 
been on the other side of the policies you advocate? and if you have 
been fucked over, is it really a mature and rational response to attempt 
to fuck over others. i think not. thanks.

Today, if someone goes out and surveys the literature,
and gathers a lot of data, then publishes a book arguing on the basis of that
data that, say, Asians are generally all-around smarter than Caucasians,
those people are called racists.  Rationality is irrelevant to the label.

The only way not to be a racist today is to say that race and genetics
makes no difference in behavior or intelligence or strength.
Someone who regards themselves as genetically transhuman has taken the
critical step of acknowledging that genetics makes a difference.

I am not saying that the term "racist" is being applied incorrectly.
I think it is correct.  Someone who believes there are or can be
significant observable behavioral differences correlated with race
is a racist.  And anyone who considered themselves transhuman would
necessarily believe that.  Once you believe that, it would be inconsistent
not to consider that there might be behavioral differences between other
human races, and once you consider that, you are a racist at heart.

 Wrong. Reputation is at least as valuable a mechanism as those two.

 Your basic point that lawsuits don't stop large innovations is correct -
irresponsible lawsuits are almost always aimed at the deep pockets of
industries that have already proven successfull, not at the kind of startups
that start new industries.

 Clearly it is important to ask whether holding the agent responsible will

Discrimination, since some of the members of the set are not
smarter. To generalize them together on the basis of race is to
show bias.

Genetic's may make a difference in peoples abilities, but not in
how they should be treated.

I don't agree, it is discriminatory (not a good thing) to group
together on the basis of race, sex, sexual preference, or religion,
but unless you show prejudice, it is not racist.

It is not peoples DNA, it is how you treat them.

People deserve to be treated equally/fairly.

About that cellular spectrum reallocation, see:

http://www.mercurycenter.com/premium/business/docs/comdex17.htm

Turn these voice calls into set-top digital video, and the task at 
hand becomes more clear.  We need simply to take back the whole 
freaking spectrum and make everything digital.

Roll out the new communication tools on a region-by-region basis.

If this were correct, then any informed person would have to be called a
racist, since the evidence that genetics makes a difference is
overwhelming. I think this shows that what you're saying is not correct.

In some discussions, I've heard a distinction made between "racialist" and
"racist". A racialist would be one who holds that differences in
intelligence or other abilities correlates significantly with race (however
races are defined in today's age of massive intermixing), but does not
necessarily claim that this justifies different (negative) treatment. But
the term "racist" clearly implies more than a factual observation; it
implies a recommendation to treat some groups worse than others. In this
sense, transhumanism is certainly not inherently racist, nor does it have
any particular tendency to be racist. The many transhumanists I've know
seem to be some of the least racist people (as well as finding variation in
sexual preference to be a trivial matter).

It seems to me that transhumanists, looking ahead to massive self-redesign,
will have little interest in an individuals racial background or sexual
orientation. That doesn't mean a transhumanist must like all *cultures*
which may be associated with particular races in particular societies.

Tell that to the life insurance companies who will be gene sequencing 
applicants prior to issuing policies.  Remember that thing called a 
"pre-existing condition"?  How about a genetic predisposition for 
cancer, depression, epilepsy?  Welcome to GATTACA.

See http://www.news.com/SpecialFeatures/0,5,27406,00.html

The FCC has so screwed up HDTV and digital broadcast concept, that
it's time for private management of the spectrum.  Who the hell needs 
BROADCAST HDTV??  That's an oxymoron!  Broadcast itself it an extinct 
concept, ready to be phased out with digital steaming web content!

Oh yeah, about the SVGA monitor, isn't that an HDTV?

And those HDTV standards?  Why not a 2:1 aspect ratio, with square
pixels, rather than 16:9.  Nothing wrong with a little black space on
the left and right of the letterbox, instead of on the top and bottom.

Maybe a 1600x800 (or 2048x1024) computer monitor or low-cost HMD?

See http://www.i-glasses.com/products.html

I pray for a 32 or 64-bit multiprocessor Linux kernel based on 
Michael Lorrey's parallel DSP computers.  And for a nice Wavelet 
codec that's based on open standards.  We can even ask SONY or 
Panasonic to mass produce "The Digital WalkMan", a receive only 
cellphone that plays streaming media over the wireless web.

 It sometimes looks like that is happening because typical criticisms
from reputable scientists simply ignore elementary arguments that nanotech
advocates have been making for years.
 Read the article through Crit and see how easily Ralph Merkle answers it:
http://crit.org/http://www.techreview.com/articles/nov98/whitesides.htm
 Drexler keeps claiming he wants to hear informed criticisms of his claims.
As far as I can tell, the only criticisms of his arguments about what
technology is possible are ones that were refuted quite a while ago.

>We can't have it both ways--we set ourselves up as skeptics to provide

 The accusation that nanotech dreamers reject all criticism without regard
to merit seems inconsistent with the respect that such dreamers give to
people who suggest nanotech is undesirable because of risks such as grey goo.

 When dealing with the timing of nanotech rather than what is physically
possible, I think nanotech advocates are more vulnerable to criticism.
 I think Drexler's claims about when the first assemblers will be available
(10 to 25 years) are reasonable, but I haven't heard a serious published
attempt to analyze how long it will take.
 Drexler simply says he can't imagine how 20 years from now there could
be 20 years more work needed to produce an assembler. This doesn't convince
people who suspect he's a theoretician who doesn't know much about the
mundane details needed to translate theory into practice.

I certainly hope so. This would be a great service to both the victims and
society as a whole, as childhood abuse often leads to anti-social and 
criminal behaviour later in life. Camera monitoring of suspected child
abusers (either secretly to gather evidence, or openly as a preventive
measure) combined with parenting tests (having children should be no
right but a privilege) seem like the best solutions to nip the problem in
the butt. Though option two is unlikely to be used (hear the bleeding
heart libs squeal!), option one (the cams) should be quite feasible.
Hidden cameras have also helped to expose abusive babysitters,
for example. Cameras and sound recordings are in fact the closest
thing we have to a "truth machine".

I think we already have all the evidence we need to determine that
childhood emotional abuse is something that should be punished
by the law. Besides, suffering is suffering, be it emotional or
physical. Allowing one and punishing the other would make no sense.

Excuse me?  I was referring to people who have an *intent to harm* and you
counter with examples that are innocuous, incidental, or unintentional?  I
have
read and enjoyed your posts and know that you can make a more rational
argument than that if you really think my head is up....

A better example might have been, what about a person who dumps their
partner cause they're mad at them and this throws the partner into a deep
depression? Harm was intended and harm was done.  Is it the perpetrators
fault? or was the partner predisposed?  You'd probably never figure this
one out.

I'm not sure where the line should be drawn, but I don't think that adults
who
maliciously inflict emotional abuse which results in brain damage to
children
should be considered non-criminals simply because you can't see the
bruise.

Because 16:9 is a standard internationally recognized format which will fill
the screen, and because a vast fraction of old shows were shot at 16:9 or 
1.85:1 on 35mm film; they can be telecined and re-edited for a full HDTV
frame. While some formats have gone out to 2.2:1 or wider, to the best of
my knowledge no-one has ever shot 2:1 or plans to, so you'd never be able 
to fill the entire frame without cropping or letterboxing.

> Nothing wrong with a little black space on

What's wrong is that so many people complain about letterboxing even when
they get to see more of the movie than they would with pan-and-scan. No 
media company with a clue will support a format which requires letterboxing.

While I think that HDTV is a pretty silly idea -- much better to store the
movie digitally in the original format and have the TV convert it on the
fly to whatever aspect ratio the user chooses -- within its limits the 16:9
format does make sense.

I wouldn't call that sequencing, rather screening. Individual DNA
total-sequencing is still at least 10-15 years off (how do you call
such a person, molecularly challenged?). (And if you can do that, 
and can afford a genetic therapy, you can patch up your DNA as well).

Last time I looked spectrum was still a valuable resource, 
protected by legal enforcement. There should be room for low-power 
spread-spectrum grass-routed cellular which looks indistinguishable 
from noise (remember CryptNet?), but such infrastructure needs 
a minimal coverage threshold to be interesting and its hardware be
a commodity item to be affordable while being violently opposed by
telco and information provider oligopolies. Also, we need something 
along the lines of ATM for a matrix, while distinctly suboptimal 
TCP/IP still reigns supreme.

That HDTV is very dead I certainly can agree with. As to streaming 
video, the global bandwidth is not yet adequate. Unless arrested at
protocol level (pay by packet), xDSL will push further bandwidth 
clogging, and thus will require a yet another networks upgrade. 
And after streaming video there will come a yet another resource 
hog, I am certain.

 > Maybe a 1600x800 (or 2048x1024) computer monitor or low-cost HMD?
 
Have you noticed that both VR/AR and HMDs are ailing, as does the
magickal wearable? Such a coincidence. According to the wear-hard 
list, several novel HMDs are in the pipeline, but then, they are 
in the pipeline for half a decade at least. Boooring.

DSPs don't have virtual memory, which most Linux flavours require. 
A multiple-DSP machine needs a message-passing nanokernel 
architecture, which Linux certainly ain't. Instead of using multiple
processors, possibly on-die, there is still a fatal
(software-artefacted) trend towards monolithic monster 
processors to be observed, whether vanilla PC or DSP. 
On the long run, OSses are obsolete, anyway. On the really long run,
even the difference between software and hardware will be nivellated.

With a high-speed wireless modem can do that with a wearable, today.
A receive-only unit is not flexible enough by far. Moreover, watching
movies while crossing street does not exactly appear to be a healthy
occupation.

Then can we expect computer displays and display adapters that 
support 1600x900 resolution as a standard?  Is this a good 
*convergence* target?  Would this keep the popcorn munchers and web 
surfers happy for a reasonable period?

I was refering to socio/politically, but you raise a good point
Ken. While I believe it will be longer than "early next year"
before we have genetic screening it won't be much longer. 

Should people be treated the same biologically/economically?

Should those with pre-existing conditions pay more?

Should those with genetic predispositions pay more?

Smokers? drinkers? meat-eaters? over/under counter drug users?

count me (1) no (6) yes's

Respectable scientists don't read nanotech advocates. Maybe this will
change when the latter start be published in refereed journals. 
Electronic resources, especially Usenet posts are simply not visible 
to scientific mainstream. This is silly, but you must consider that
handicap when you expect to see valid criticisms by the establishment.

Crit is so _slow_, especially overseas. Are there any plans to make
the database distributed? Is Foresight running the service on their 
own resources, or did they receive any hardware/bandwidth donations?

I must say I made basically the opposite observation. There is much imo
unfounded belief in rational design (as if one could clone/upgrade 
artifexes faster than grow computational darwin-in-machina circuitry) and 
containability of nanoevolution processes (so far archaeology has
failed to find even fossil traces of ur-autoreplicators). The 'active 
shield' mantra is too often invoked. To me, this is simply not
addressing the issue, but it is exactly these fuzzy anything-goes 
claims, criticisms and countercriticisms that point at the heart of the
malaise. Nanotechnology as practiced on the web is simply not a
science. And nanotechnology, as practiced in the laboratory is simply 
not exciting enough. Too bad.

Futurology is not science. There exists no validated scheme to assign
probabilities to future histories. Hence, expecting any real-world 
criticisms of pipe dreams is not exactly constructive.

'Mundane details needed to translate theory into practice' says it
fairly all. Drexlerian nanotechnology means: I can build a device which
can more or less sustainably clone itself within a time span of less 
than an hour by means of mechanosynthetic reactions -- as simple as that.

Is such a device possible? No one can say, now. If there was a
detailed, mundane blueprint, we could simulate and validate that. 
But there is none. How does one supposed to prove the existance and
met functionality of a mundane device which is not specified? The
science/technology validation process does not work that way. It would
help a lot if there was a mundane, well-developed body of theory describing
mechanosynthetical processes. But there is none! (Don't say things
like Schroedinger or ab initio, that doesn't count). So we have to resort
to a massive make-believe that we can build the repertoire of required
mundane structures (the set of which, also, happens to be undefined) 
by this unspecified, mundane set of mechanosynthetic reactions. 

Is this science? Is this technology? Whatever it is, it not
validable. Which does not mean that it is impossible -- simply 
we. just. can't. tell. yet.

Please, let's stop this nonconstructive discussion, and let's go back to
the workstation/lab. Whoever can push the field of nanorobotics and
nanolithography into full-blown all-purpose mechanosynthesis is
scheduled to be the next Nobel laureate -- and Generic Saviour as well.

My memory was just jogged by the recent reference to a _new_ or perhaps
infrequently used term, computronium. I remember reading a 1950s short
story that as far as I know coined a term, electroponics.

The definition attached was simply the construction of things atom by atom
in the nanotech way. Personally I think its an apt term that would do good
to filter into common parlance.

Just as hydroponics means growing in a medium of water, electroponics
means to grow things in a a medium of electrons. Currently when people
talk of nanotech they talk a couple of generally different things.
1. Actual nanometer scale systems (computers, assemblers)
2. Macro or real world scale things that assemblers will produce
   but won't necessarily be much different from what we have today,
   (cheap materials, endless food supply, diamond bridges, etc.)

I think there's a useful split to be made between the new devices
in category 1 and the products (category 2) that those who own
the devices/IP for category 1 will make/sell.

You can do lots of stuff with nanotech. Wouldn't seperating out a subset
of electroponics aid understanding where the future is heading?
It would also make nanotech sound safer if people knew that its most
likely that its only category 2 things (things manufactured with
electroponics) were available in the public domain and the assemblers
(electroponics equipment) were safely locked away.

Your thoughts please!

Afair, the first-born (single child?) membership was not tested in the

I listened to an interview on NPRs Diane Rehm 
Show dealing with this issue.  The insurance 
executive on that show suggested that most 
insurance companies will try to sell the idea that 
the higher costs of insuring genetically *at-risk* 
groups will be spread out across all of those 
insured.  Then he said that what will really happen 
will depend on the market.  Competitive forces will
cause an insurance company somewhere to offer
lower rates to the more *genetically pure*.  He said
that if the general public is willing to allow this, then 
it will happen.

BTW,  Diane Rehm's show tomorrow (Wednesday 
AM) will focus on the recent research on stem cells.
She often has very informative guests.

Eugene, you're taking all the fun out of this!  You seem to be 
approaching this whole issue from the perspective of a law obiding
citizen living within the system.  I'm trying to think of it from the
perspective of a "lets start over and do it right in a big way" on a 
locality by locality basis.  

Play it like a time travel game.  1998 rules, laws, and 
infrastructure in one locality, 21st century rules, laws, and 
infrastructure in a different locality.  The 21st century localities 
will be so technologically advanced, that they can assist in bringing 
the other localities on line.  *Everything* will be affected by 
broadband.  Transportation, education, health care, entertainment, 
economy.  Quite simply, the broadband community will be privately 
managed by open systems, and the societies will be cashless, and 
primarily electricity based rather than primarily gasoline based.

Let's say the legal system favors ecology over all other priorities, 
but rather than simply exterminating the people and bulldozing the 
infrastructure, it's more of a "go home, be entertained, communicate, 
enjoy self-paced learning... if you need a ride, we'll handle the 
transportation."

> That HDTV is very dead I certainly can agree with. As to streaming 
> video, the global bandwidth is not yet adequate. 

We can upgrade each locality to broadband, with all that entails.  It 
can be priority one, above and beyond anything else.  We don't need 
to make every phone company and cable tv company go bankrupt at the 
same time.  We'll just make them completely useless and obsolete on a 
town-at-a-time basis.

Who needs 25 different video rental stores and 40 different 
department stores with CD shelves, when the few thousand titles that 
are redundantly available can be archived on high-capacity local 
servers and streamed to local consumers using a local infrastructure 
of mass produced broadband router/proxies feeding beeper sized 
distribution nodes.  

This is a cultural shift.  The pagan communities will upgrade before 
the orthodox religious communities, I'm sure, due to the relative 
technological leanings of their respective citizens.

The biggest resource hog is distributed scientific computing.  The 
computing requirements are endless.  A good start, though, will be 
something that can be thrown together fairly quickly using 
off-the-shelf technologies.  

You can't please everybody, all the time, (without direct brain 
stimulation, that is), so why not do this locality by locality.

Approach it like a game.  Our community is in the year 2020, your 
community is in the year 1998, and their community is in the year 
1893.  We can't practically bring every community to 2020 at the same 
time (again, without direct brain stimulation/modification), and 
that's really not worth it.

> DSPs don't have virtual memory, which most Linux flavours require. 

Who cares?  It's something to do.  Can't you simulate virtual memory?
DSPs are cheap and fast.  Couldn't there be some assembly programming 
beneath the C functions that compensate for architectural defects.  
We can use existing DSPs at first in the first wave of devices.  The 
chip-level designs can be modified for the next generation of 
production. Imagine a flat memory model being used to keep RAM 
proxies of media files.  These things could be thrown together fairly 
quickly, given the will.  Linux has a cult following.  

It's not really the *WHOLE* OS that's needed.  Really, just enough of 
a familiar set of tools for file management.  (Although, in a 
no-moving parts device, it will really be array management).

I say hide the complexity of chip architecture from the programmers, 
and let them focus on creating games and multimedia applications 
(spectragram libraries, continuous speech recognition, music 
synthesis).  Just preserve enough familiarity so that you can 
capitalize on the available knowledge workers, including their 
emotional attachments to old structures.  It's more of a social 
transition strategy at this point that a plan for perfect 
computation.

Actually, I was being facetious about the one-way cellular.  Really, 
if I see another 20 pound casette playing ghetto blaster in my local 
"Good Guys" electronics store I think I'm going to vomit.  You tear 
the things apart, and they're nothing but empty shells weighted down. 
 Just being the front display is a little chip that handles all the 
radio.  It's just consumerism garbage.  Why not make the same thing 
out of a cell phone capable of streaming a 64K audio feed?  If the 
consumers need to see big dials and FM style LCD tuners, just spoof 
the damn things.  Let the dial be a placibo, doing nothing but 
sending an http query to an online streaming media provider.  The 
radio stations in that locality can keep all their studio equipment.  
But instead of sending their signal out at 10,000 watts, they're 
really just another site on the web.

I've finally read your posting carefully, Greg, and I do appreciate the
sentiment that you and Spike express.  I think, however, that many of the
postings on this thread have been based upon the assumption that this
particular culture of women in Afghanistan are illiterate and largely
ignorant of their own rights.  This is, unfortunately, not the case.  A
significant portion of these woman are highly educated, they are doctors and
lawyers and professional businesswomen.  They worked hard for many decades
to improve their status.  Now they find themselves completely imprisoned and
beaten in the streets when they attempt to carry out the daily business of
living. The streets are policed by uneducated young thugs who have been
offered power through a fundamentalist religious regime.  Any men who
support the women seem too intimidated by the threat of force to speak out
openly.

I have trouble envisioning how a memetic bomb or plant can alter the
situation.  Who would you aim it at?  The women are already fully educated
as to the direness of their own plight.  They have, at great risk, spoken to
western reporters and to social researchers who have carried their story to
the world.  The young men who police the streets are for the first time
being given influence in their own society.  What incentive do they have to
take on new ideas that would remove them from a position of high status?
The Taliban leaders have been fighting long and hard to take power in their
country, and it goes without saying that they would not relinquish it
voluntarily.  Have I missed something about this idea?

Yes. Dejerine referred to the "language quadrant" - a vertical core of 
brain including neocortex, as well as underlying strutures both limbic, 
thalamic, and brain stem nuclei That is of course the trouble with terms 
like language and so forth: they cinclude the whole brain, when define 
dwidely enough. Nevertheless, it is fruitful to break language into its 
constituent parts..

Eugene, you're taking all the fun out of this!  You seem to be 
approaching this whole issue from the perspective of a law obiding
citizen living within the system.  I'm trying to think of it from the
perspective of a "lets start over and do it right in a big way" on a
locality by locality basis.  

Play it like a time travel game.  1998 rules, laws, and 
infrastructure in one locality, 21st century rules, laws, and 
infrastructure in a different locality.  The 21st century localities
will be so technologically advanced, that they can assist in bringing
the other localities on line.  *Everything* will be affected by
broadband.  Transportation, education, health care, entertainment,
economy.  Quite simply, the broadband community will be privately
managed by open systems, and the societies will be cashless, and
primarily electricity based rather than primarily gasoline based.

Let's say the legal system favors ecology over all other priorities,
but rather than simply exterminating the people and bulldozing the
infrastructure, it's more of a "go home, be entertained, communicate,
enjoy self-paced learning... if you need a ride, we'll handle the
transportation."

> That HDTV is very dead I certainly can agree with. As to streaming
> video, the global bandwidth is not yet adequate. 

We can upgrade each locality to broadband, with all that entails.  It
can be priority one, above and beyond anything else.  We don't need to
make every phone company and cable tv company go bankrupt at the same
time.  We'll just make them completely useless and obsolete on a
town-at-a-time basis.

Who needs 25 different video rental stores and 40 different 
department stores with CD shelves, when the few thousand titles that
are redundantly available can be archived on high-capacity local
servers and streamed to local consumers using a local infrastructure
of mass produced broadband router/proxies feeding beeper sized
distribution nodes.  

This is a cultural shift.  The pagan communities will upgrade before
the orthodox religious communities, I'm sure, due to the relative
technological leanings of their respective citizens.

The biggest resource hog is distributed scientific computing.  The
computing requirements are endless.  A good start, though, will be
something that can be thrown together fairly quickly using
off-the-shelf inventories of high performance low cost components.

You can't please everybody, all the time, (without direct brain 
stimulation, that is), so why not do this locality by locality?

Approach it like a game.  Our community is in the year 2020, your
community is in the year 1998, and their community is in the year
1893.  We can't practically bring every community to 2020 at the same
time (again, without direct brain stimulation/modification), and
that's really not worth it at this point.

> DSPs don't have virtual memory, which most Linux flavours require. 

Who cares?  It's something to do besides commuting 2 hours a day to 
sit around a develop multimedia software for Bill's OS, just so the 
software company can go bankrupt because the telco switches are 
still depreciating.  

DSPs are cheap and fast.  Couldn't there be some assembly programming 
beneath the C functions that compensate for architectural defects?

We can use existing DSPs at first in the first wave of devices.  The 
chip-level designs can be modified for the next generation of 
production. Imagine a flat memory model being used to keep RAM 
proxies of media files.  These things could be thrown together fairly 
quickly, given the will.  Linux has a cult following and a lot of 
talented C programmers. 

It's not really the *WHOLE* OS that's needed.  Really, just enough of
a familiar set of tools for file management.  (Although, in a
no-moving parts device, it will really be array management).

I say hide the complexity of chip architecture from the programmers,
and let them focus on creating games and multimedia applications
(spectragram libraries, continuous speech recognition, music
synthesis).

Preserve enough familiarity so that you can capitalize on the 
available knowledge workers, including their emotional attachments to
old structures.  It's more of a social transition strategy at this
point than a plan for perfect computation.  It will keep the 
community motivated and the skills honed.

Actually, I was being facetious about the one-way cellular.  Really,
if I see another 20 pound casette playing ghetto blaster in my local
"Good Guys" electronics store I think I'm going to vomit.  You tear
the things apart, and they're nothing but empty shells weighted down.
 
Just behind the front display is a little chip that handles all the
radio tuning.  It's just consumerism garbage.  Why not make the same 
thing out of a cell phone capable of streaming a 64K audio feed?  If 
the consumers need to see big dials and FM style LCD tuners, just 
spoof the damn things.  Let the dial be a placibo, doing nothing but 
sending an http query to an online streaming media provider.  The 
radio stations in that locality can keep all their studio equipment.  
But instead of sending their signal out at 10,000 watts, they're 
really just another site on the web. 

Here we are moving to an age of driverless lightweight non-polluting 
vehicles, and we're still training our children from the age of 2 how 
to drive a car!!

	I've explained it before.  I'll explain it again.  There is
absolutely no biological basis for the conceptual distinction of race.
We're just as likely to be more genetically similar to a person of a
different "race" as we are to a member of the same "race."  Literally a
racist is a person who believes in the existence.  That belief tends to
perpetuate these artificial divisions within heterogenous societies.

	Ethnic groups have definitive existence.  "Race" is a meaningless
destructive aneristic illusion.  Caucasians, for example, live in the
Caucasus Mountains of Southern Russia.  They have a distinct shared
culture and even a unique non-Indoeuropean languistic heritage.

	It is very easy to be non-racist.  Simply discard the concept of
"race" from your memplexes and attack it with uncompromising critical
rationalism whenever it rears its ugly head.  Is there discrimination of
various subcultures and ethnic groups?  There most definitely is, but it
is based on subculture and ethnic groups.  I think Richard Dawkins
provided a strong argument group selection in _The Selfish Gene_ for most
of us to reason that any major distinctions into massive human groups
are probably memetic rather genetic.

And thus racism is slain not with a government program, but with a
rational argument from a Cajun Extropian.  Laissez les bons temps roulez.

	When I was younger I was told that it was because No. 1 had the
sense of being the best and broadcast channel that was given the title of
Channel 1 would be considered to  have an "unfair" marketing advantage.
Whether or not this was the case is not known to me.  If someone knows to
the contrary let me know.

Anders:

I am interested what distinction you make between functional and structural
changes in the brain.

Even if cells are not killed, given that long-term abuse clearly causes
significant functional changes in people isn't this evidence for structural
change?

I guess I am understand 'structural change' differently from you. As I see
it any functional difference must be reflected in a structural difference
(though some of these structural states may be more or less amenable to
change), but not all structural changes necessarily involve functional
changes (i.e. functional states are supervenient on structural states).

So accepting that abuse victims differ functionally from the rest of the
population necessarily implies that they have structural differences as
well. What is interesting for me in this study is to use knowledge of the
functional state (symptoms of abuse) to explore what certain structural
states in the brain do and so perhaps offer help.

Does this sound right? Or have I missed something?

best, patrick

	Smokers already have to pay more under most policies.  As to the
rest, it depends on whether the new policies will deter too many
people from becoming future policy holders.  If it does, it loses too much
profit and can go bankrupt.

 Seems to me the significant word is "significant". I would consider someone a
racist who believes the differences in races are sufficient to stereotype
individuals behavior. e.g..

 "You are Asian, you must be good at Maths". "You are black, you must be stupid".

 I think few racial differences are significant in that sense.  Only one case
springs to mind where it might be valid to treat individuals differently based on
race. That is in testing for certain heritable genetic diseases. I'm hard pressed
to think of racial differences that are not swamped for the individual by
environmental factors and personal genetic variation.

Well I got up at 3am and saw three (3) in the next 2 hours. So not exactly
a storm, but at least one was very spectacular: very bright with a nice
long tail. Hope others had more luck. It sounds like Asia had a really good
show.

Actually, if extrpopians/transhumanists were really interested
in developing a group profile, they should consider going
beyond a very simple inventory like the MBTI (generally
ill-favored in the psychological literature).  There are a
nummber of on-line instruments that could measure things
like:

locaus of control/attributional style http://www.queendom.com/lc_frm.html ,
or

emotional quotient http://www.queendom.com/emotionaliq_frm.html , or

communication skills http://www.queendom.com/commun_frm.html

and a variety of personality assessments.  These on-line
instruments also have shaky validity, of course.

There are a number of other sites with psychological tests
if someone would like to make other suggestions.  We have
the option of testing a hypothesis or we could do an
exploratory study (I think someone called it *trawling the data*).
Individuals could take an assessment battery and confidentially
report their scores to who ever was willing to create a database.
It could help us identify those most susceptible to transhumanistic
memes.

That is not an explanation: it is a claim.

That is irrelevant to the claim that races are as  meaningful a grouping 
of humans as they are of other species.

I could use the same logic to say that there is no such thing as birth 
order by noting that I am as likely to have a personality more similar to 
someone of another birth order as I am to someone who shares my birth 
order. The critical question is not do the distirbutions overlap at all, 
but does aggregating across (putative) members leave reliable differences 
and secondarily, can these differences be attributed to gene frequencies 
within the mating population? If there are no differences, they will 
disappear in the aggregation. If there are, they will shine forth. The 
fact is that are reliable aggregate differences which have meaningful 
social outcomes.

>Literally a
>racist is a person who believes in the existence.

Oh i see: you need no proof that what someone might say is wrong: that 
they say it is proof that it is wrong: how handy for you. 

This is structurally identical to Dworkin's claim that women have no need 
to prove that pornography is harmful or even to define pornography. 
Pornography is whatever a powerless person says it is, no one can 
meaningfully dispute this, and the mere claim that it is pornographic is 
proof that it is harmful.

This is mind-rotting nonsense.

Umm. I guess it is just an editing slip up, but Dawkins is virulently 
opposed to group selection. Anyhow, could you supply a citation from "the 
selfish gene" to the effect that it has been empirically demonstrated 
that there are not now, and never have been, any human groups 
distinguished by statistically significant differences in gene frequency? 

To my mind, race is like the use of the term type in the Myers Briggs 
personality scale: it would only be appropriate if significant 
bi-modality or higher order multi modal peaks were found in the gene 
frequencies when mapped out against dimensions known to underlie 
speciation: dimensions such as geographical location. In the case of 
personality, type claims are not supported by the evidence. It si a 
similar matter of empirical investigation whether this is the case for 
race.

a. All members of a species have the same gene loci.
b. Individuals have one and only one allele at each locus on each strand 
of DNA. 
c. If those gene frequencies were randomly distributed geographically and 
on all other dimensions affecting mate choice, then there could be no 
justification for the term race.

If, however,  we find that certain alleles differ significantly in 
frequency between groups distrubuted on these dimensions which underlie 
speication, then the term race has utility (meaning):it describes this 
inhomogeneity in gene frequency.

It is a scientific question: either gene frequencies are distributed 
non-normally, or they are not. Either groups of hominids were 
reproductively (relatively) isolated for considerable periods of time or 
they were not. If they were, racial differences will evolve. They must 
because it is exactly these differences which drive speciation and we 
have species. Or don't you believe in species either?

Hey, are you saying transhumanism isn't rational? I wouldn't be on this
list if I didn't think it was. 
Think about it, though, NT (the Rational type) was a foregone conclusion.
All we've done is confirm what a priori thinking would tell you ( as an
INTP I trust my a priori thinking a lot <g>).Barring the exceptions on
this list, is someone scoring a high S going to take a field much inspired
by computer science as seriously as someone with a high N? (In other
words, what you call 'adventurousness' isn't mutually exclusive with
rationality (high T) - it corresponds to a high N score). 

And how would
someone with a high F as opposed to a high T react to the thought that his
treasured 'feelings' could be reduced to a computer program? The
reductionist element in extropianism is going to turn off high F types
(the types who get outraged at cloning because they think it violates the
'sanctity' of life and so on). The high S types will get turned off by
the amount of speculativeness in extropianism.

The second post regarding developments unveiled at the annual meeting of the
American Society for Reproductive Medicine.  

On October 8, Jamie Grifo, John Zhang and Hui Liu of New York University
announced that for the first time genes from an infertile woman's egg were
transferred into another egg, the egg was fertilized with sperm and the egg
was then implanted into the infertile woman's womb to maturate.  If this
results in a child, the child will have two genetic mothers, although one
will have contributed more genetic material and will clearly constitute the
dominant genetic mother.  

The actual technique involves removing one egg each from the fertile and the
infertile woman.  The nuclei from both eggs are then removed.  The nucleus
from the healthy egg is transferred to the infertile egg.  The reconstituted
egg is then fertilized (with sperm, wouldn't you know.)  The baby would
carry nuclear genes from the infertile woman and mitochondrial genes from
the donor woman.

This technique was developed after earlier experiments with reviving
infertile eggs with younger, healthier cytoplasm from donor eggs.

This technique is considered similar to cloning, similar enough to be banned
in California and any other state that decides to ban the same cloning
procedure that produced Dolly.

This is one of two postings that should have been posted weeks ago......

In mid-October, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine held its
annual meeting, and unveiled several developments, one set of which may have
implications for cryonics.

*** FREEZING THE HUMAN EGG***
Several groups of researchers announced that they had successfully frozen
and thawed the human egg.  The human egg has represented a major challenge,
because it is the largest single cell in the human body, contains more water
and subject to damaze from ice crystals.  

Several methods were used in these experiments.  In one conducted by James
Stachecki, et al, at the Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Science of
Saint Barnabas, West Orange, New Jersey, a solution was prepared that
replaced sodium with potassium and choline, with the end of reducing
positive ionic charges.  They then froze mouse eggs in nitrogen to test the
procedure, and found that they could produce mouse embryos upon thawing.
Testing on human eggs, 10 out of 10 thawed successfully and 9 were
successfully fertilized, 7 developed into human embryos.

Researchers from Argentina claimed to have created 13 live embryos from 83
frozen eggs and transferred them into the wombs of 3 women.  Could not find
many details on this one, there seems to be some question as to the validity
of the claim.  They were the only group to implant in human women.

Kwang Yul Cha from Pochon CHA University, Seoul, Korea, has developed a
technique utilizing the antifreeze ethylene glycol, which turns the fluid in
the egg to a glassy substance instead of ice crystals.  He experienced a 2/3
success rate in thawing and a 90 percent success rate in cell division.
Unfortunately, the health of the cells were questionable and none were
brought to the embryo stage.

Another technique being studied by researchers in England, France and Israel
involves slicing out ovarian tissue that contains immature eggs, freezing
the eggs in liquid nitrogen, thawing the tissue, and then implanting it into
the thigh muscle of a mouse.  (And these people think *we're* the wierd
ones?)  A team led by Joseph Itsokovitz-Eldor in Israel's Ramban Medical
Center found that many of these grafts survived, but none of the eggs
matured to the point of being able to be fertilized.  The hope is of someday
being able to restore a woman's menstrual cycle through this technique.

As I sit here at the computer catching up on email, I have been watching the
most uplifting report on Dateline NBC.  They did a story about a woman who
underwent brain surgery as part of a clinical trial to test the use of
implanted electrodes stimulators to treat Parkinson's disease.  The
stimulator would take the place of normal dopamine emissions in the brain to
control neural impulses.  This woman's symptoms were very advanced, to the
point that she depended on assistance for almost every life activity,
including turning over in bed.

The surgery involved five or six hours of testing various spots in the brain
to plant the electrode in one half of her brain to control symptoms on one
side of her body.  What amazed me was the machine they used--it provided an
audio output of the electrical impulses generated by the brain's
neurons--you could actually hear the normal impulses and the sound it made
when a neuron misfired.  After the electrode was implanted in the proper
spot of the left hemisphere, almost all symptoms vanished from the right
side of her body, and she had motor control again.  Three months later, she
agreed to undergo a second procedure to implant an electrode in the other
half of her brain, and one month later she could not only walk but run and
dance.  Her wheelchair now sits in the garage. <snif>

If you will care to pay more attention to what they talk about, you will
find that libertarians are the most moral of all political groups. It is
the conservatives and the leftists who talk about 'balancing' 
 A against B as if people were chunks of meat with labels on them.

i would like to make a list of things manufacturers have done which
actually reduce the usefulness of a product in order to enhance its
marketability.  the early 4 function electronic calculators were weighted
to appeal to consumers who thought them more durable.  microsoft
products are weighted with dead code to make them appear more
sophisticated (i assume thats why they do it).  spike

you can go to this website, download the program, it requests work from
a central server which organizes and distributes the compuing task.

heres a joke column about san jose's newest attraction
the tech museum.  the locals love it.  spike

 Subject:FWD> Tech Museum Funny

Definitely a Bay thing, but if you don't live in the area, you can still
get the idea.  Ahh, life in the Bay Area!

As most of you know, the new Tech Museum has just opened up and it's a
pretty cool place, but I think that if they really wanted to capture
life in the Silicon Valley, they could've done a lot worse than
including any of the following:

Exhibits that should have been in the new Tech Museum in San Jose:

1.  The Silicon Valley Virtual Commute Race Course:
You have 2 hours to go 15 miles!  Think you can do it?
Well buckle yourself into our simulator and give it a try!
The Tech museum offers several race courses to choose from:

Try the "880 Endurance Course"!
Hey!  You finally made it past the Winchester Mystery Puddle at The
Alameda on-ramp, and you're finally up to 25 mph!  You'll make Brokaw
road in no time.  But look out!  101 merges into 880 AND the freeway
goes down to two lanes AT THE SAME TIME!
Who designed this nutty course?

Or try the "17 Face Off of Doom"!
You're behind one truck in the right lane going 21 mph.  The truck in
the left lane is going 20.5 mph!  Calculate how many hours it will be
before you can pass both trucks!

Or try the 680 "Trail of Tears"!
You've got to make it from Pleasanton to Fremont with only one full tank
of gas!  Sound easy?  Don't forget the inept Caltrans contractors who
block off lanes for no reason at all!

2.  The Unreasonable Expectation Work Week Simulator:
Ever wonder what it's like to work eighty hours a week?
You can now experience blurry vision, diminished reaction time, the
health effects of eating nothing but Doritos, and the heart-racing
excitement of Jolt Cola addiction with the Unreasonable Expectation Work
Week Simulator!  Hey, who are those strangers claiming to be your
family?  They're just part of the mysteries you'll experience at the
Tech Museum!

3.  The "Find Help At Fry's" Cyber-Challenge:
Don your Virtual Reality goggles and take a tour in the Valley's
favorite electronics chain!
Your challenge: find someone who can help you.  It's not as easy as it
sounds, though.  If you do find someone, you still have to somehow get
them to make eye contact!

And once you get help, the challenge isn't over!  You still have to
avoid the "Let me get my manager" monster, endure the perpetual "Humans
as Cattle" cash register corral, and make it past the paranoid door Nazi
without getting a body cavity search!  Youch!


4.  The Valley Fair Parking Space Scavenger Hunt:
Your mission:  get in our car simulator and find parking at the Valley's
most congested mall!  Extra points for finding a space within a one mile
radius of the mall itself.

Next year we hope to make this scavenger hunt even more challenging when
we violate the laws of conservation of mass with the addition of the
Town and Country Monument to Bad City Management!

5.  Sell or Die:
Kids will learn valuable lessons playing this interactive game designing
and marketing superior, technically-advanced products that fill a niche
and meet a need.  But wait!  The fun is just starting!  It's time to
play "Sell or Die"!

Kids get to choose whether they will let themselves be bought out by the
"innovative" Microsoft, or whether they will resist the urge and have
their products undersold by Microsoft's inferior competing products!

The fun is in seeing how long *you* can last in the face of unfair
marketing practices.  The last player to go bankrupt paying their legal
bills wins!  Extra points for kids who survive long enough to testify in
front of the Justice Department!


6.  Mr. Jobs' Wild Ride:
Get in your Apple Stock Rocket and experience the wildest roller coaster
ride of your life!  Just when you think the Rocket is about to hit a
wall, swerve wildly and unexpectedly to one side and avoid certain death
(for now)!  And the best part is, your fate is completely in the hands
of one all-powerful and unpredictable hippy-turned-power
player-turned-exile-turned-interim CEO for life!

And look out! The Larry Ellison Hot Wind Machine will try to blow you
off course!  You'll lose your lunch on abrupt policy changes, and scream
your lungs out as you freefall on the final Mac Clone Maker Betrayal
Drop of Death!  Riders can then regain their composure looking at the:


7.  San Jose Mercury News Wall of Premature Apple Obituaries:
Get up close and personal with Valley history by reading over fifteen
years of stories lamenting the imminent death of everyone's favorite
fruit company!

With all that circling, don't buzzards ever get dizzy?

The basic assumption appears to be that insurance agencies will act
rationally to by using genetic testing to screen out those in the
population that are most likely to become ill to therefore increase profit
margins.

But a counterbalancing force might also prevail: those most likely to
remain well might make a rational course of action and drop out of
insurance schemes (or at least demand much lower policies) and therefore
reduce the profit of insurance companies.

I don't see anything wrong with companies trying to maximize profit. Why
would people expect anything else? If you believe that all people should be
entitled to equal medical coverage you should look to governments not
corporations. Then of course healthier people have to put up with
supporting the less healthy. This is particularly irritating when my tax
dollars support those who smoke, eat lots of fat, and take really stupid
risks (such as driving without a seat belt or consuming drugs while
driving).

Ho(y)la folks

I'd appreciate it if anyone happens to have, and could send me, a source
for the claim or suggestion by Sir Fred Hoyle that AIDS is a military
designed virus that either escaped or was released intentionally.  This is
a silly idea, but I'd like to be sure that Hoyle *did* actually utter it
before I say so print.  (I've done a quick Altavista search and got nothing
relevant.)

Wouldn't have worked otherwise (at the current state of know-how), since
males and females silence different genes in their germ cells in the
process called genomic imprinting.  Experiments in fusing two female
haploid nuclei have failed for this reason - key constructional mechanisms
have been turned off.

Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em (for now).

    >> P.S. As a kid I wondered why my television went from Channel 2 to 13,
    >> what happened to Channel 1?

Television sets made before 1949 do have  channel 1, although at the
time there were few TV stations and none were yet on Channel 1. In 1949 the
law was changed and the spectrum for Channel 1 was given to the new FM
radio broadcasting band. The reason for this is interesting.

FM radio was invented by the brilliant radio pioneer Howard Armstrong,
and the 1930's  had made thousands of FM radios and even started his own
FM network with dozens of stations. All FM broadcasting was discontinued
during the war but Armstrong wanted to resume operation afterward.
RCA  also wanted to get into the FM business but feared Armstrong's
lead was too great, so they lobbied the government to change the band from
where it was, at about 50 meg, to the 88 -108 meg band (Channel 1). This made
all of Armstrong's radios and equipment useless and his network died. He then
checked into the 13'th floor of an expensive hotel in New York, put on his best
cloths, opened a window and jumped out.

ive an idea.  there has been much discussion here regarding privacy and
extracting signals via voluntary submittal of information.  the mb informal
poll exercise was most informative.  is there some way to form an info
repository, a giant piggy bank for information?  where anyone could
post a question, such as "are you a firstborn?" and individuals could
deposit answers without even revealing their identity?

friends, please be patient, as i have been grinding around on this
question for some time and you are perhaps getting bored with the meme.
i think this sort of thing is worthwhile, for if extropians can work out
a technique, we can introduce it to the entire internet world, and perhaps
then we can begin to extract critical health information from the huge
numbers of people available, and give humanity a valuable gift.

so heres the idea: get a group of volunteers willing to do something like
what i did with the meyers briggs test results: collect the info, strip off
the identities, tabulate and post the data.  choose a different person
for each task: one for meyers briggs, one for are-you-firstborn, one
for whatever questions are posted and people are willing to answer.
note:  we would  not to post on the list like we did with  the mb thing,
but would email privately to the one designated person tasked with a
given question.  this looks like to me it extracts data about a population
without seriously compromising anyone's privacy.

after all the responses, i have concluded that infonudists like myself
are in the minority.  regarding the mutual exclusivity between privacy vs
safety from data vandalism, informal polls work better if they sacrifice
data safety for privacy.  spike

If you like, we could use the NEO PI-R. It is copyright and not free but 
is a very good questionnaire assesment of personality.

I there is widespread interest (say 100+ people), I will create an online 
database, pay for the test uses, and collate the data. All results will 
remain your property.

In exchange I would like permission to use the summary data in my 
research.

If you think this is a useful project click this link

no content needed, just an indicative vote. I have the facility here to 
support various online experimental stuff so it could be fun.

cheers,

Folklore has it that the Boston Globe was the first to report the
military connection to AIDS, however I think you'd be better asking this
question of a conspiracy list:-

An article appearing in the January 9, 1977 issue of *Newsday* 
describes how operatives having at least tacit CIA approval 
introduced African Swine Fever into Cuba: "A U.S. intelligence 
source told *Newsday* he was given the virus in a sealed, 
unmarked container at a U.S. Army base and CIA training ground in 
the Panama Canal Zone, with instructions to turn it over to [an] 
anti-Castro group."
 
A Cuban national, on trial in New York Federal District Court, 
testified that in 1980, "as part of a biological warfare scheme 
against the Castro Cuban economy, 'a ship traveled from Florida 
to Cuba with germs...'"

...

Could ASF be one of the factors behind so-called AIDS? "In 1983, 
two Boston scientists, John Beldekas (Boston University School of 
Medicine) and Jane Teas (Harvard School of Public Health), 
wondered whether ASF was, in fact, the AIDS virus... They found 
evidence that ASF was showing up in the blood of AIDS patients, 
'even though Swine Fever isn't supposed to infect humans,' 
Beldekas comments."
 
Teas went to Florida. She recalls that while there she "heard 
rumors that some Haitians, after eating pork, were contracting an 
odd illness... Regardless, it was already clear that in some 
areas where you saw a concentration of AIDS (Africa, Brazil, 
Haiti), you saw outbreaks of Swine Fever in herds of pigs. 
Although the pork industry and government scientists won't admit 
it, there are ASF-infected wild pigs in Florida."

Sorry, I guess I wasn't clear about my request.  I'm looking for a cite
from *Fred Hoyle* on this topic, not the topic itself more generally.

Apologies if I'm way off topic here, but I like the way this list can be
plumbed like an extended slowly writhing encyclopaedia on All Manner of
Weird Topics and Specificities, forsooth...

Subject: HDTV Flat Panel Aspect Ratio
X-mailer: Pegasus Mail for Win32 (v2.54)
Sender: owner-extropians@extropy.com

Reply-To: extropians@extropy.com

After thinking about HDTV 16:9 display aspect ratio and 
next-generation flat panel computer monitors and digital displays, 
I've decided that my vote is for 2:1 aspect ratio.

This makes a for room for on-screen icon controls that do not 
obstruct the view of the content, and allows for hypertext annotation 
to movies that be displayed while the movie is running.

Since the whole object is to engage the viewer into contributing to 
the body of knowledge, particularly in the context of web-based 
streaming HDTV, the "blank space" on the side of the letterbox can 
become the "CRIT" space, where the fine-grained annotations can be 
indicated.

For average consumers, the space can be left blank, or used to 
display a vertical column of smaller square Picture-In-Picture iconic 
representations of live video feeds from other sources.

Since this is totally programmable, the iconic representations of 
annotions can be psychologically color coded so that they are almost 
unnoticable, and not a distraction; or the options could be set so 
that they are literal bells and whistles designed to pull you into 
discussion forums and video conferences related to those scenes.

Also, 2:1 is a very natural binary compliment, which will result in 
the most efficient use of the computer memory.

We can tell our successors in future generations, when they are 
watching the old movies shot on 35mm film, that in the old days 
before digital movie making, we used 16:9.  They'll probably comment 
that the movies don't look wide enough!

By encouraging hyperlinking and annotation by providing a little 
extra space, say off to the left of the 16:9 movie frame, it will be 
easier to construct a "visual dictionary", with inputs from all 
elements of society, thus encouraging interactivity, critical 
thinking, and social integration and diversity.

I don't think that modifying factory production from 4:3 to 2:1 
aspect ratios will be that costly, and the same flat display devices 
will then be able to serve both the computing and entertainment 
industries simultaneously.

See http://www.viewsonic.com/PROD/PANEL.HTM

These displays are being produced and sold for computers for an 
end-user price of under $900.  It should not be too difficult to 
change the PC standard monitors to a 2:1 version of this item.  By 
shifting production from this model, to one that is larger (say 
2048x1024), the same item can be marketed to computer users and home 
entertainment users.  Perhaps at a starting mass production size of 
456.2mm (W) x 228.1mm (H) (18.0" x 9.0") (maybe a street price of 
$999 or thereabouts, to get things moving)?

In his book "The Inflationary Universe" (Helix Books, 1997,
page 13) MIT physics professor Alan H. Guth discuses as fact 
that the sum total of all energy in the universe equals zero: 

  "In 1973 [Dr. Edward] Tryon published an article in the 
  journal Nature, with the title "Is the Universe a Vacuum 
  Fluctuation?" He had understood the crucial point: the 
  vast cosmos that we see around us could have originated 
  as a vacuum fluctuation -- essentially from nothing at 
  all -- because the large positive energy of the masses 
  in the universe can be counterbalanced by a corresponding 
  amount of negative energy in the form of the gravitational 
  field." [IAN: thus the sum of all energy is exactly zero] 

We might say that you can get something from nothing, if, and 
only if, that something is equal to nothing, i.e., to zero.
Later in his book (pages 272-273), professor Guth states:

  "[I]n any closed universe the negative gravitational 
  energy cancels the energy of matter exactly. The total 
  energy, or equivalently the total mass, is precisely 
  equal to zero.* With zero mass, the lifetime of a 
  quantum fluctuation can be infinite.  . . .

  * ...the fact that the total energy of a closed universe 
  is exactly zero had been explained some years earlier in 
  the widely known textbook, "The Classical Theory of Fields," 
  Revised Second Edition, by L. D. Landau and E. M. Lifshitz 
  (Addison-Wesley Press Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1962), 
  pp. 378-379. "  

You'll notice the stipulation that total energy equals zero in
any "closed universe."  A closed universe will collapse in on
itself, but an open universe will continue to expand forever. 
QUESTION: Would all energy in an Open universe equal zero?? <<---
Recent evidence -- the measured acceleration of universal 
expansion -- tends to suggest that our universe is open. 
So, does the zero-sum of energy hold in an open universe?
The case Guth makes for why gravitational energy is properly
denoted with in the negative (-) seems to apply to any universe.


GRAVITATIONAL ENERGY IS NEGATIVE

In Appendix A of The Inflationary Universe, Guth explains why
the proper sign for graviational energy is negative (-), which 
Guth notes "is crucial to the notion of a zero-energy universe."

In his 5-page non-technical explanation of why gravitational 
energy is negative, Guth observes the curiosity that in the 
interior of a hollow, spherical shell of mass, there would 
be no gravitational field exerted by the mass of the shell 
itself; you'd be floating around inside it like an astronaut
in space (assuming that the shell itself is not in a g-field).
Yet the shell does create a gravitational field in its external 
area, such that a particle outside the shell will fall toward 
the shell, and toward the center of the shell, just as if the 
hollow shell was a solid sphere with mass at the center.

But rather than falling to the empty center, a particle inside 
the shell would experience zero gravity, since if it was inside
the shell closer to one side of the shell, the gravity of that
side is equally strong as the gravity of the larger amount of
mass on the other side that is further away, and so the grav-
itational forces from each side  cancel out at any and all
points inside the mass shell. As such,  the inside of the 
hollow shell is an ideal example of a zero-gravity field.

Guth then observes that the shell still exerts a gravitational
force on its own mass, and the force lines of that force point 
toward the center of the shell. Therefore, the shell will fall
into its center, or collapse, while keeping its same shape. 
As Guth observes (in thought-experiment mode here):

   "Outside the shell the gravitational field points 
   inward, and inside the gravitational field is zero. 
   Now imagine what would happen if the shell were 
   allowed to uniformly contract, keeping its spherical
   shape. One can imagine, for example, extracting energy 
   by tying ropes to each piece of the shell... These
   ropes can be used to drive electric generators as 
   each piece is lowered to its new position."

As the shell contracts to a smaller size, a region of space 
that had been zero gravity and inside the shrinking shell is
now outside it, and that region is no longer a zero-gravity
field. As Guth notes, after the collapse "a gravitational 
field now exists where no field had existed before." And
the inward "falling" shell has also released energy 
that the hypothetical generators have extracted.

Guth concludes with this argument as to why the newly created 
gravitational field is properly denoted as negative energy:

   "The net effect of this operation is to extract 
   energy and to create a new region of gravitational 
   field. Thus, energy is released when a gravitational 
   field is created. The energy contained in the shaded 
   region must therefore decrease, just as the water 
   level in a tank decreases if water is released. 
   Since the region began with no gravitational field 
   and hence no energy, the final energy must be negative. 
   In most physical processes the exchange of gravitational 
   energy is much smaller than the rest energy (mc^2) of the 
   particles involved, but cosmologically the total gravita-
   tional energy can be very significant."  (page 292)

And presumably, the sum total of all gravitational energy is 
exactly equal but opposite to the sum total of the positive 
energy in all masses in the universe that create the cosmic 
gravitational field, and thus the sum of all energy (and 
equivalently of all mass) in the universe equals zero.

If you have or are aware of counter arguments to this zero-
universal-energy analysis, or if you know the answer to 
the question cited above, please let me know. Thanks.

I was thinking in this context of structural change in the sense of
deviation from normal neural structure (i.e dead neurons), and
functional change in the sense of deviation of normal function. The
distinction is admitedly blurred, and might not even be perfect for a
"wet" system like the brain.

True. But many functional differences do not cause the neurons to
change noticeably from normal (i.e. I can come to believe that the
earth is flat; it is a stupid belief and corresponds to some changes
in my synaptic connections, but no neurons need to die for me to think
it). What is interesting is whether a certain psychological state or
history can create structural changes that can be detected in some
way.

Reckless endangerment and parental negligence are as much real crimes as assault
and battery. You cannot be outraged about instances of one without being
outraged at instances of the others. In fact, there are plenty of cases on the
books where mere reckless behavior on the part of parents is considered to be
child abuse.

Only child and adopted.

I'm starting to think only first borns are responding to this.
I'm glad to see Tim Bates is offering to follow up on my
suggestion for a more detailed group profile.  Certainly
part of this study should include a number of demographic
variables other than birth order.  Suggestions?

Transhumanism has a rational basis, but it also requires a strong 
imaginative ability to shift perspective away from internal concerns to 
discuss the broad scope of human evolution into posthumanity.  I would 
expect to find a lot of persons who combine both rational and creative 
aspects.

 > Think about it, though, NT (the Rational type) was a foregone conclusion.

All that has been illustrated (not yet proven) by this data is that NT 
types tend to congregate on internet listserves.  That might actually 
have some implications for issues related to computer mediated 
communication, but I don't know if that necessarily relates to transhumanism.

_I_ don't understand what you're doing on this list. Extropians are _by
definition_ libertarians. What did you expect?

As to your choice of words: forcing someone else to be "compassionate" at
the point of a gun has nothing to do with real compassion.

To counter this, people might support the passage of regs saying that only
those ailments for which there is an affordable cure can be used as grounds for
denial of coverage for pre-existing or DNA screened conditions. This would
certainly be an incentive for drug companies to invest in more medical
research....

Tell me, how in the hell does your tax money subsidize my not wearing a seat
belt? If you are talking about medicare support for the disabled, its your own
fault for choosing to live in a political unit which has such an insurance
system which you must pay into and is full of people who are not anal retentive
wenies like yourself. If you don't like it go found the Anal Retentive Republic
and set things up as you like them. I certainly don't want my tax dollars
supporting your neuroses about other people's behavior, or the fascist state
you want to turn our country into to force everyone to act the way you want
them to.

THank you. I'm second born and my older brother thinks extropianism is stupid.
My youngest sibling, (4th in line) my sister, thinks the ideas are cool but the
group is kinda geeky.

The lab that gave us Dolly is now hoping to produce 
a cloned pig. Perhaps they'll call it "Porky".

Sorry to complicate things.  But I was first born from my genetic mother (whom
I've never met) and adopted into a large family of 3 older sisters and an older
brother.  Followed by an adopted younger sister, a divorce and re-marriage into
another family putting me as the oldest child (still living at home) from the
age of 11 onward.

Since when is judgment less "objective" than observation?
I had not earlier reported to this thread, so let me add one
more INTJ to the list--and one is very, very, J.  Without
judgment, observation is pointless and impotent.  The reason
I want to be objective is so that I can make better judgments.
The reason I want immortality is that I judge life to be a
good thing and I want more.

Do you know where I might find more information on "G3" cellular 
proposals?  Personally, I favor some sort of gps-based 
spread-spectrum radio solution that assumes full access to the 
spectrum (as would be the case when developing a homestead in the 
forest, jungle, or desert).  

Looking at it from this perspective allows one to develop a 
model that can be a point of comparison when looking at how 
inefficient "incremental" approaches are compared to "fresh start" 
approaches.  While the fresh start approaches may not be easily 
implemented in developed areas, there is always the possibility of 
presenting the option as an attractive alternative to incremental 
upgrades.

Valmarpro Forecasting desires to procure a reserve pool 
of part-time forecasters and estimators on a variety of topics.
Forecasters/estimators will be paid in accordance with the 
patented Lundgren method of forecasting incentives, which 
calculates the value marginal product (VMP) of individual 
forecasters. The forecasting incentives method is capable of 
eliciting unbiased forecasts or estimates for both observable 
and unobservable variables. Possible applications include 
prediction of future prices, quantities, and profits;
estimation of environmental externalities; estimates of 
regulatory costs/benefits; business, financial, and mutual fund
valuations, including prediction of means and variances; 
macroeconomics; and other specialties. In addition, individuals 
are needed to represent the business and to promote the sale 
and use of this forecasting incentives method by potential 
business and governmental clients. These part-time opportunities 
do not require geographic relocation, do not require travel, and
should be compatible with other full-time employment. Both 
economists and noneconomists with forecasting or estimating
ability are encouraged to apply. A representative will be at 
the January 1999 AEA/ASSA meetings in New York. For further
information by regular mail, please mail or e-mail your mailing 
address. CONTACT: Carl Lundgren, Valmarpro Forecasting, Inc., 
4801 Copley Lane, Suite 241, Upper Marlboro, MD 20772-5966

I hope i will not make you tired of my english and my little
considerations ;)

I've to confess that the "singleton hypothesis" process is running as a
background task in my mind these last days.

I'm sure there is several peoples here that would like to become one (or
part of ;)... )

so i've just a deep question in my mind now, would like to hear your
comments or suggestions.

browsing the net to find some interesting memetics publication at
http://www.lycaeum.org/%7Esputnik/Memetics/
i've find that quote of "What Is Man?" by Mark Twain
available at
http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext93/wman10.txt

> Clemens, Samuel "What Is Man?": "Personally you did not create even the smallest microscopic fragment
>         of the materials out of which your opinion is made; and personally you cannot claim even the slender merit of
>         putting the borrowed materials together. That was done automatically --by your mental machinery, in strict
>         accordance with the law of that machinery's construction. And you not only did not make that machinery
>         yourself, but you have not even any command over it."
>

i doesn't have read his book, but the guy seem to pretty well express my
way of thinking at this moment.

In a way, we are little singletons, as our brains are constructed like a
borganisation of a multitude of different agents and parts. But as
little genetically engineered singletons reproducing themselves in an
exponential way, we have a lot of partners to listen or to exchange
ideas, memes,...

If a singleton is truly alone, i think he will not be able to have his
intelligence shaped by an external intellectual environment, he will be
some kind of deep autist. So probably it's difficult to generate a sane
single singleton, one who take all the resources available in a somewhat
closed system. (i'm not talking about a Omega Point theory here).

If we try,  the singleton will be probably a little bugged (or not
totally a true powerful conscience, at least intelligently shaped to use
his available agents and parts) and then this singleton is somewhat
reduced to the community of the singletons of a lesser order composing
him.

So, if we want, for example, to generate an artificial intelligence able
to really communicate with human minds, the only efficient way i can
think of is to generate an ecology of many artificial intelligences,
evolving gradually, communicating with each others and the external
environment (human minds and cultures) and with selections criterias
like those of genetic algorithms.

So, in a post human era, where we can imagine the total available
(matter+energy) in the solar system is used and where the global
intelligence can't move too much from his place to go to find a lot more
of (matter+energy), probably the singleton as a whole identity will be a
little insane.

would you want to become insane ?

any comments ?

the singleton thus will probably have to send Von Neumann probes to be
able to have new friends to talk to if he want to optimize himself or if
he's just a little bored... the probes will generate singletons in other
solar system... etc...

First Born (and the group of 5 I hung out with at school were all first born!
             though I certainly have friends who aren't first born now)

Ever since reading Vernor Vinge's "True Names" I've thought a distributed
artificial intelligence would be one of the neatest things one could do
with distributed computing (the "Mailman" from the aforementioned story
was a distributed AI that got its name because it answered questions 
slowly, as if by post).

Thats interesting that you should emphasize that you are very *very* J.  I have noticed that form your past posts,  you have a tendecy to 'judge' other peoples posts before really 'observing' what it is they are trying to convey.  A most annoying trait. I too am an INTJ, howevever I am also a borderline INTP.  The J part of my personality is useful in making judgement once I have observed things adequately.  Like you, I also have a tendecy to judge before observing.  Certianly not something I'm willing to brag about like youself.

I'm with Kathryn Aegis in thinking all types are potentially susceptiple to Transhumanist ideas.

I would expect a true *trans* humanist to be an XXXX - that is above and transformable into any personality as it suits them.  Afterall, aren't we trying to transcend the limits of our psychology?  :-)

Mike what is the problem?

I didn't say anything to suggest I wanted you to wear a seatbelt. I know
this might be a big leap but not all people are US citizens. Some of us
live in different countries with different laws. In Australia we have
universal medical coverage paid for by tax. So I pay everytime someone does
something stupid to their health. Maybe you should learn to think before
pressing those keys. I never said I wanted laws for seatbelts. If you are
going to reply to my messages try to read them first. All I said was I
didn't want a law forcing me to pay for other people's decisions. How does
that make me a fascist? A word I doubt you even understand: I bet you think
its a naughty word like 'arsehole' that you know you're not meant to say
and ironically just don't grasp.

birth order is quite fun. it is both completely without value, and highly 
important. How is that?

Well, in a mixed sample, my ability to predict your IQ, personality or 
any other reliable individual difference based on birth order is 
quazi-zero.

However, if we compare population effects (say the difference between 
1920s and 1990s)  the proportion of first borns etc explains the bulk of 
the variance. The theory is a bit complex.  I am first born, then the 
mean IQ of my environment is quite high of the first few years (mom, dad, 
and me). Then along comes my brother. His mean situational IQ  is lower 
(it includes me ;-). Mine has also decreased, however I now have a 
language acquisition device trying to acquire knowledge from me (my young 
sib). This is great for me to learn: he pesters, I find out. I have to 
really find out otherwise he pesters me even more. So, being first born 
is a plus. The theory goes on to deal with cross over effects 
(advantageous for years 1-4, then relatively disadvantageous: for 
instance my young brother might get a leg up when he is starting school 
by bouncing his new experiences off me).

Anyhow, the real fun starts when you map these demographics out to school 
and society: you can get virtuous circles in which classes of young 
learners boot-strap each other - gen-X goes on the Internet for instance. 
While these situations can also lead to dark ages and depressions, they 
are precedents (from our view) for the singularity. 

So, the theory is not about birth order at all. It is about situational 
learning and birth order affects our situation by altering the 
surrounding information sources and sinks.

On a more speculative note (did he say MORE speculative ;-) my feeling is 
that the next 20 years give us a chance to hit the singularity, but that 
if we miss, life will not be fun. The world will be enter a vicious 
circle of old age, lack of output, lack of investment and general parlous

Anders:

Thanks for the clarification. My background is psychology; my main area
being higher-level vision so I certainly am not an expert on the
neuroscience side of things (though of course everyone interested in these
issues is slowly drifting into the vortex of cognitive neuroscience).

>I was thinking in this context of structural change in the sense of

I understand your definition, but isn't it likely to cause confusion? Cell
death is only one extreme end in the spectrum of structural change that
occurs in the brain. All long-term memory formation (and for that matter
forgetting) causes structural change. Chronic drug use obviously causes
structural change (and by your definition is OK to be called that as its
not normal), but long-term mood changes probably cause similar up or down
regulation of specific neurotransmitters. Aren't mood changes part of
normal functioning? Just because the change is occurring at a level we
can't detect doesn't mean that it isn't structural, and it certainly
doesn't mean we won't have the technology to detect such changes in the
future.

Sure you are going to see some quick and very reversable changes in brain
structure (e.g. my belief the traffic light is red), but this doesn't mean
long-term structural change is not part of normal brain function. For
instance Nikos Logothesis has done nice work training up macaques on unique
wireframe objects (basically distorted coathangers). He finds that in
infereotemporal cortex (IT) that, just like the infamous face cells
detected there, the macaques develop wireframe coathanger cells. This is
not just a functional change, but a long-term structural change in the part
of the brain associated with object recognition.

best, patrick

first-born of 6 (but escaped at  age15).

Frank Sulloway's work on birth order and familial dynamics (in BORN TO
REBEL, as I've mentioned previously) would seem to predict that *more*
extropians and transhumanists, as ass-kickers and rebels, would be
later-borns.  Of course there are more 1sts than anything else in the world.

But his profile shows that we 1sts are also (by tendency) politically
conservative and severe.

Several months ago, i had written a very little essay about that (in
french).
i don't know too much of the state of the technology right now, or if my
ideas are good ;)
i've no credentials after all ;) so i would be glad if somebody tell me
that i'm completely wrong ;) ..
having not too much time to translate it, i've used the Altavista quick
translation, so be prepared ;)


**
Tracks for an automated approach of the distribution and sharing of the
scientific computations requiring the rough force.
**

 Currently, certain groups of people use a highly parallel approach to
discover the long keys of protection of the
systems of encryption. **time-out** the work, use primarily the force
rough be share in a community of user have
for certain access with some vast resource like some network of
university or some large company and for some
other have access with some resource more modest like some small
computer network  in PMEs.

Responsible people or having access to an information processing system
are often characterized by a same
common denominator. Their systems are not used with a maximum output.
Often the machines under-are
exploited, during many times of pause, during the night, or while
nongreedy applications in power processor are
carried out. To fill the objectives of their organizations, the outputs
of their networks cannot be optimized in an
economic way or they consider that these outputs do not need to be
increased, the awaited profits being for
example tiny.

 A current very interesting example of a typical step of automation and
massive parallelization of a problem
requiring the rough force can be found on " ' SETI@HOME homepage " with
the following address:
http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu / the SETI decided, via Internet to
make it possible to the users of PC to spend
time when they do not use it with profit for his calculations. This
approach enables him to achieve goals
impossible to realize without investing enormous means compared to its
economic possibilities.

More and more of electronic apparatuses comprise processors which they
are rudimentary or very elaborate,
good markets or very expensive. This tendency will make only increase
and all the types of apparatuses tend to
incorporate this type of component, even if they do not need any in
their minimal form. The price of the
processors makes only fall, it thus becomes less and less dramatic to
integrate a too powerful processor for the
application required by the apparatus in which it is built-in.

The next standards planned for the Internet will be characterized by
higher flows of transfers of data but also by a
number of almost inexhaustible IP addresses. One will be able to thus
give an Internet address to any object
connected with the network. One will be able to give an address to the
cars, the watches, GSMs, televisions, the
pacemakers, and their components, etc. **time-out** it type of approach
can allow in particular the control
remote of these objects by their owner or by of system of management or
still the implementation of system of
diagnosis of breakdown automate allow the setting in functioning of
correction software for avoid with defect
appear and/or of make intervene a system of repair as soon as possible.

All these processors will be still characterized by this same problem of
under use.

The number of simulations, algorithmic calculations scientific requiring
a rough force of calculation is
potentially astronomical. **time-out** that they himself be of program
require a execution of nature more sequential, a parallelization more
significant can generate a overhead too high, or some program require a
execution of nature more parallel, it be necessary seek the means of the
executer the more effectively and the more quickly with the less some
resource possible. To reduce the total costs to some extent.

A very significant step to accelerate their executions would comprise
the following stage:

Establishment of a committee on a world level for the management of a
data base counting the various problems
of scientific nature which one can solve by methods of massive
parallelization. **time-out** the committee
himself occupy also to carry out  a classification by command
preferably of these problem, define the tactics of
distribution automatic of code de computer with processor unoccupied and
to count the result and them put
accessible with public.

For very many and increasing class of  owners of electronic apparatuses,
the knowledge that their acquisition
contributes to the advance of search constitutes one more been worth
obvious of those. It will thus not balk for
their majority to invest a negligible overcost in their apparatus to
allow the installation of such a system.



The procedure of the committee could be described not the following
elements:

**time-out** creation of a system of payment as for method of
distribution of code executable with processor
door frame, with management of different priority of experiment which
must be distribute according to certain
criterion define by some function of probability distribution de
probabilit.

Reception of proposals for a search requiring of the numerical means of
scientific organizations or the public or
of other organizations.


The criterion of dormant state of the processor, can be defined by the
manufacturer or the user according to his
characteristics.

The processor in dormant state sends a package to announce its state to
the server of the committee. The server sends to him then according to
its capacities of calculation an executable code expressed preferably in
the most universal possible language, like Java for example.

When the processor is not any more in dormant state, it sends its
results to the server. Results being in general a standardized
description of the place where it finished its execution. In this way
work can be resumed by another processor in dormant state. When a
processor finished the total execution of a code, it returns the final
results and can then receive a new code.

One of the major side effects of such an approach would be to be able to
check that it is not possible to make emerge an " intelligent " system
of a gigantic network of neurons answering certain criteria of
implementation. Indeed one could carry out this network of neurons on
all the processors in waking state

Even if this system is not really " intelligent " it would constitute in
any event a fabulous tool for search having in particular all the
scientific resources of the Internet.

An article of the edition of May 98 of the Byte magazine treated search
in progress and currently available softwares being able to make more
easily realizable relativemment, from a technical point of view, such a
aplication. It is about " Millipede software turns even the smallest
network into has virtual parallel machine " of Tania Hershman.

Single child.

Now, nothing against 'Extropian, know thyself', far from it, 
but we've been certainly poll-polluting the list way too 
much lately. Kathryn stated correctly that self-answered 
polls on electronic channels might be doubly biased. At 
the very least we should move future polls to private 
communications (whoever provoking a poll shall be charged with
gathering the result and posting the totals to the main list), 
also, ExI might install some electronic (cgi-bin) poll 
infrastructure, especially among the nonconnected extropians 
(mundanes).

As to whether everybody on a listserv is an XNTX, a single
counterexample should suffice. Removing self-selection-by-answering
bias should be more difficult, but possible.

Selling spare cycles and bandwidth may be nice, but how do you conquer
the system perversion problem, particularly if your code mutates? (Those of
you who participated in rc5/bovine may have noticed that some of the
clients had hidden 'features', now if you can execute arbitrary code
directly or via buffer overruns... ouch) This is a problem even 
with ppp dialup, with xDSL/crosslinked local networking the global 
system is at a catastrophic threshold.

I'd estimate we'd be damn lucky if we can evade a global worm during 
the next few years. You don't even need a GP engine, a small
handcrafted exploit library (notice that even switch firmware like 
IOS is vulnerable) is totally sufficient. If the code can search 
for constructive buffer overruns on its own, god help us. After 
the wintel boxen are taken over and used for subversion platforms, 
the rest of the systems can't be far behind. In any case will 
networks be unusable, since saturated with perversion packets.

In fact, the longer it takes before the worm strikes, the more
dramatic will the effects be. If the worm strikes a decade from now,
y2k will look like an infinitesimally small beer in comparison.

How can one address it? TCP/IP is too complex to be implemented in
hardware, and protocols stacks cannot be made secure. Even if, there
is still the application layer. Even security by obscurity (system
diversity, which is not necessary an observable trend) won't help if
the code is smart enough to discover exploits autonomously.

Does anybody see any workaround against this? I don't.

Thank you.  It will be nice if we extend the definition of "phone" to 
include any communications system (including high fidelity systems):

  networked computer              (a.k.a. PC with web connection)
  portable audio receiver         (a.k.a. AM/FM radio)
  portable video receiver         (a.k.a. VHF/UHF battery-powered TV)
  home audio receiver             (a.k.a. home hi-fi stereo)
  home audio transmitter/receiver (a.k.a. speakerphone)
  home video receiver             (a.k.a. television)
  home video transmitter/receiver (a.k.a. videophone)
  mobile phone                    (a.k.a. full dux two-way radio)  

Somehow, I forgot to use the word "office" above.  Maybe those will 
be things of the past if the G3 spec allocates enough bandwidth?

I wonder if there will be G3 digital equivalents of "scanners"?  My 
guess: no, because the communication channels will be encrypted from 
end to end using MEMS within the intercell transport infrastructure.

As a high functioning autistic person I can tell you its fun to be young
and so-called insane while fighting the chauvinistic battle to become
one of the future uploaded ekhuman community. Ecsanity does not mean NOT
being well balanced within oneself. Insanity is a social construction
and like the label 'schizophrenia' it is a disease of a dying society's
boundaries. It all depends what side one takes in the constant battle to
preserve one's identity; - in my case via latent communication with the
unknown programmers who write the code I use. 

Granted most insane people are subdued, stigmatized, chemically
emasculated and straight jacketed when they come to the attention of the
whitecoats; - but not all.
Like a Houdini, I deliberately infiltrated their mechanisms and when I
assumed international protected agent status as a cyberian envoy in
order to escape this aforementioned fate, it was surprising how polite
the security apparatus became. I still have the odd hassle every now and
again from over eager pavement artists, for instance just last Monday a
ten fingered virus operating tradecraft out of some U.S. blitzkrieg
server demolished the 20 gigabyte homepages server where I have a
lifetime account. No doubt this disavowed special agent is now having
boiling water and ice alternatively applied to what used to be his
balls.

This topic got me thinking again about the issue of privacy.  For the most part,
I have always applauded the efforts of the Cypherpunks, because it gives us a
leg-up on the competition from the intelligence community.  Not to mention,
there are certain things I would much prefer remain private.

However, David Brine make avery good point.  It is only a matter of time
before 'gnat' bots become widely available - equipped with the latest
micro-sized video cameras and solid-state recording.  With a plethora of
such flying solid-state devices, what is to keep anyone from spying on anyone
else?  Not much, considering that such gnatbots could conceivably infiltrate
even the most heavily guarded top-secret facilities.

Assuming their commercial availability, imagine all the people just dying
to send hundreds, if not thousands of gnatbots into such facilities as the
Pentagon, NORAD, CIA, NSA - even Area 51.  It wouldn't be long
before nearly all of the governments secrets would become public
knowledge.  Is this a bad thing?  I'm not sure, but it certainly levels the
playing field, making it substantially harder (if not improbable) for a
select group of individuals from perpetrating a crime on the rest of us
and not getting caught.

Also, all of those dirty little habits that we all have in one degree or
another would become public knowledge - whether it be picking your nose
or whatever - you get my drift.  Even the most conservative and prudish
people will have all of their dirty laundry aired to the world.  Either we'll
all end up killing each other over our embarrassing ideosynchrocies, or we
adopt a more open-society where nearly everything goes.

Libertarians have argued for a long time to eliminate all victimless crimes
from the books.  The bottom line is almost everyone has committed a
victimless crime.  So either we begin incarcerating everyone or we
eliminate those crimes from the books.

So the question remains - is this a bad thing?  And if so, is there a way
to avoid it anyway amidst a proliferation of commercial gnatbots?

Today, in the news was reference to humanism and a current change in
direction for a segment of humanists who favor bringing religion into the
philosophy of humanism.

These changes are stemming from what is referred to as a "younger
generation" who have adopted an affiliation with religion and who are now
moving away from atheism, skepticism, etc.  This about-face turn is
directed toward what is known as "religious humanism."  This fraction of
humanists recognize God as the creator and follow biblical teachings.

Those now affiliated with religious humanism are breakaways of orthodox
Catholics, Episcopalians, Anglicans and Unitarians, as well as those who
have had no former religious commitment.  Apparently, the Pope recognizes
religious humanism, with a few qualifiers.  Pope sees problems with science
and/or philosophy when these domains of study are used to seek an
"ultimate" truth.

"All humanists believe in the dignity of human begins," says William
Franklin, dean of the Berkeley Divinity School at Yale University.  "The
difference is religious humanists believe that dignity comes from having a
relationship with God."

This type of watering down of belief systems has pros and cons.  While I
rather like the idea of those who had had devote religious belief systems
branching out toward humanism to incorporate a bit of skepticism in their
thinking, I wonder if this particular group of humanists is using the word
humanism inappropriately and in a way that is damaging to the historical
significance of humanism.

I also wonder if this media-attention-getting-religious-group is part and
parcel of Hollywood's religious few's new found flirtation with bring
religion into television and film.

Perhaps Robin Hanson might act as coxswain for this.

My hesitation for focusing too much on birthing order is that there are far
more psychological underpinnings for the developing and mental/emotional
direction of a person than his or her sibling positioning.

As a transhumanist, I am a first born every day of my life.

What if the gnatbots show that your next door neighboor is breeding 
incestuous sex slaves that he keeps in his basement with his wife, 
that he purchased over the internet?  (She was made using clones 
created from Sharon Stones snot, that was stolen from a used Kleenex, 
that was stolen from the garbage can outside one of her dressing 
rooms).

Where's the victim?

The obvious and politically correct answer:
* Encourage the use of open source software -- security holes are
  found and fixed faster.
* Don't create an environment in which hackers are treated harshly
  for relatively harmless exploits -- more holes found and faster,
  perhaps well-behaved worms are created to seek out and report
  exploitable holes.

Obscurity and diversity seem very different to me.  I don't know if
increasing system diversity is an observable trend now, but it's
easy to think of reasons why it won't decrease and will likely
increase:
* I'd guess that unix, Microsoft, Macintosh, and various network
  hardware accounts for nearly all of the systems on the net now.
  None of these are going away.
* Both dominant providers are facing perilous product transitions
  (Microsoft Win9x -> Win2k, Intel IA32 -> IA64).  Each is very
  likely to lose market share for this and other reasons, opening
  up the field for new systems.
* Everything else that isn't connected but likely will be at some
  point (phones, TVs, handhelds, electronic pets, etc.), adding
  lots of diversity.  This could be a problem though -- many of
  these devices will probably be very insecure and unpatchable.

I believe the Nature article on the universe being created from a vacuum
fluctuation relates to the Heisenburg principle.  An energy fluctuation is
allowed if the time is short, ie  Delta E times Delta t < h.  [Or is it more
strictly h/2 pi ??!, it has been a long time since QM class !].  Guth et al
argue that the temporary energy fluctuation was then caught in a false vacuum
and stabilized so it could not revert back to zero.  

Further, in the early days of thermodynamics it was postulated that the energy
of the universe is a constant.  And thermo teaches that only changes in energy
can be measured, so an arbitrary reference state can be chosen, so that
constant is zero, or any other quantity for that matter.

I do not consider myself a libertarian.

I used to regard CSICOP as having definitively disproved all claims of psychic
powers.  "Nobody has claimed the $10K" was good enough for me.  Then Dennis
Rawlins, a founding member of CSICOP, accused CSICOP of distorting and
withholding experimental results in "sTARBABY".  I have read Klass's response,
which failed to deny this accusation and focused on ad-hominem attacks. 
CSICOP has lost their objectivity and become an advocacy group.  They are not
searching for the truth; they are promoting a particular set of beliefs, even
in defiance of the facts.  They have become the Committee for Skeptical
Investigation, not the Committee for Scientific Investigation.  One cannot
have both.

This doesn't mean that I believe in psychic powers.  But I no longer believe
in CSICOP.

What's my point?  In my opinion, the majority of libertarians whose writing on
the subject I have read have also lost their objectivity, to the point of
being unable to perceive that libertarianism has flaws.  It's not good enough
to be the best system; they insist the system is perfect.  They have become a
political cause, rather than a rational choice.  One cannot have both.

I still think much less government would produce better results by almost any
moral standard.  But I no longer believe in libertarianism.

Hi all,

Great book. The mail man reminds me of a computer implemented out of 
people passing notes to each other instead of transistors passing 
voltage. This in turn reminded me of  what is called "Turing 
Functionalism" This is the position that a Turing machine (however 
implemented) would be conscious if it ran the consciousness program. One 
envisages the paper tape program ticking over for millenia and then 
someone cuts it: was the machine half conscious, never conscious?

I asked Daniel Dennett if he was a Turing functionalist: he said yes and 
no ;-)

I think he said yes, but that interaction is critical, he views 
intelligence as being embedded in the machines environment as well as in 
its own hardware. For this reason he doubted that a paper tape Turing 
machine could be conscious as the environmental context on which 
consciousness is scaffolded (in his, but not my) view, would be invisible 
to it: a kind of Nyquist limit for implementation speeds.

best,
tim

  IAN: Well, that identity is holistic is manifestly 
  obvious and I have challenged many here to present 
  even one example of a non-holistic identity, and, 
  apart from insults, none have been able to do so. 

  Ironically you've implied holistic identity is 
  lacking evidence. Can you site the evidence of 
  non-holistic identity you seem to be aware of?

  I've also shown how a zero-sum can be derived 
  from any state of difference and many physical 
  quantities. It's quite an eye-opener to discover,
  lo and behold, a zero-sum of all energy has been 
  "on the books" since 1962, yet generally unknown,
  even as it provides linchpin support for on of the
  leading theories of our time, the Big Bang theory.

  The one identity that I believe is nonholistic --
  that is, it isn't derived from interrelations --
  is the number 0. Zero is zero exactly due to its
  difference with itself (0 - 0 = 0), but every non-
  zero number n is what it is due to its difference
  from zero (n - 0 = n and n = 0 + n) and since n is
  not 0, all nonzero numbers are holistic identities,
  which is to say, n is derived by relation to not n.

  But zero is an identity attribute of each number
  relative to itself,  and is a measure that there 
  is a symmetrical distribution of identity attri-
  butes in a given system, which is a symptom of
  holistic identity, evidenced in the case that 
  the identity of all nonzero real numbers is 
  holistic and the sum of all reals equals 0.

  Everything must = 0 (I posit) since everything, 
  the whole itself, isn't derived from external 
  relations, and zero is the "map" of the self-
  to-self relation, which is a null relation.

thanks patrick!  i had almost given up on the idea of using an
anonymous website.  i was concerned the web technique
offers perfect anonymity, but no protection against multiple
voters.  my notion was that we would sacrifice just a modicum
of privacy for reasonably good data protection.  im now
nearly convinced the right way is to protect privacy at
all costs, and take the poll results with a grain of salt... {8^D spike

Sorry.  I meant to say "sex pets".  Their genes have been modified so 
that they have an Irish Setter's will to please the master, and a 
bat's love of daylight (within the physical clone of Sharon Stone's 
body).

Ain't genetics fun?

P.S. Advanced orders are accumulating already.  The current going 
rate for a high quality sample of snotty Kleenex with viable genetic 
material is $1000.  The lab down in Brazil is soon to be taking 
credit cards over their SSL commerce server.

It is a fun vortex, multidisciplinary science in action. I just
wished there was more time to assimilate all the interesting
information being produced - I'm interested in so many levels that I
can't keep up.

As I said, it might not even exist a good way of distinguishing
between "structural" or "functional" changes. Your point is right;
there isn't really any distinction between "software" (psychology) and
"hardware" (neurology).

My apologies. I certainly wasn't thinking. You certainly do live in what I would
call a fascist state. Tyranny by a small party or tyranny of the majority is
irrelevant. The way the government down there is disarming anyone and everyone, I'd
be surprised if you Aussies are allowed to carry anything more dangerous than a
butter knife within a few years. As a North Korean defector once told a freind of
mine, "once we got their guns, taking their money was real easy."

More wishful thinking than a workaround, _smart_ trend recognition software

Selling spare cycles and bandwidth may be nice, but how do you conquer
the system perversion problem, particularly if your code mutates? (Those of
you who participated in rc5/bovine may have noticed that some of the
clients had hidden 'features', now if you can execute arbitrary code
directly or via buffer overruns... ouch) This is a problem even 
with ppp dialup, with xDSL/crosslinked local networking the global 
system is at a catastrophic threshold.

I'd estimate we'd be damn lucky if we can evade a global worm during 
the next few years. You don't even need a GP engine, a small
handcrafted exploit library (notice that even switch firmware like 
IOS is vulnerable) is totally sufficient. If the code can search 
for constructive buffer overruns on its own, god help us. After 
the wintel boxen are taken over and used for subversion platforms, 
the rest of the systems can't be far behind. In any case will 
networks be unusable, since saturated with perversion packets.

In fact, the longer it takes before the worm strikes, the more
dramatic will the effects be. If the worm strikes a decade from now,
y2k will look like an infinitesimally small beer in comparison.

How can one address it? TCP/IP is too complex to be implemented in
hardware, and protocols stacks cannot be made secure. Even if, there
is still the application layer. Even security by obscurity (system
diversity, which is not necessary an observable trend) won't help if
the code is smart enough to discover exploits autonomously.

Does anybody see any workaround against this? I don't.

Hey, technology is not the problem, but the people who use it. TV has =

always human. No gun shoots a man intentionally. Its trigger need to be =
pulled by someone. The bullet does not care if it kills someone. The =
bullet is not sentient. The man who pulls the trigger is. Perhaps this =
is the cause why no gun manufacturer has ever been sentenced to death =
because one of his guns had been used for a murder.

At Extro3 Eric Drexler held a speech where he discussed how to be
"cautious and conservative". He showed that cryonics was the cautious
and conservative thing to do, and that much of nanotechnology is
conservative. So maybe this is the real explanation: this list is
filled with cautious and conservative people, while the incautious
radicals are out there... :-)

Religious humanism isn't new, it has been around some time now. But in
general, it seems that the humanist movement has become rather watered
down and divergent. This is actually an area where we can do some
good, by showing a new form of humanism, transhumanism, that
encompasses the old core humanist values like human value, freedom,
rationality and optimism but also has energy, an interest in the
future and acceptance of technology.

Sure. However, I think that the argument is wrong. Major Network television has
always been a wasteland of bad influence. However since deregulation, there have
been some great cable channels popping up which are for profit which are
absolutely great. Discovery, A&E, The History Channel, The Learning Channel,
MSNBC, Sci-Fi Channel. These are all examples of how a government regulated
market stifles innovation and quality, while a free market stimulates it.

First, I would like to point out that the singleton hypothesis is in
itself rather debatable; I can't see why it is more likely than a
"multitude hypothesis" where we are bound to get an exponentially
increasing number of diverging entities. 

As for insanity, I would say it is relative to a context. Behavior
that is rational in one environment is utterly irrational in another,
so insanity could be described as acting in a way unsuitable for one's
world - Alice is sane at home, but in Wonderland she is
insane. However, there is an additional factor of flexibility. Most
people with mental problems today have less mental flexibility than
normal people - their repertoire of thinking and acting has been
limited due to their illness, and they often get stuck in nasty
attractor states (like in depression or paranoia). 

Would the singleton superintelligence be insane? Most likely it would
be quite good at behaving in a manner suitable for its world (i.e
using resources on a stellar scale); in that respect I wouldn't call
it insane. Would it have mental flexibility, so that it could get out
of bad attractors? Hard to tell, but it seems likely if it is composed
of a diverse set of subintelligences that are not too tightly
bound. Would it enjoy its existence? Depends on its value system and
analogue to enjoyment, extremely hard to say anything about.

I don't know about distributed artificial intelligence, but there is
a project for distributed artificial life.  This is Thomas Ray's
Network Tierra, a version of his Tierra alife program which will run
on a distributed network across the Internet.  Follow the links from:

http://www.hip.atr.co.jp/~ray/tierra/tierra.html

In addition to providing more computing cycles for the simulation, this is
intended to create a heterogenous environment, with different workstations
having different properties.  The organisms are supposed to be able to
sense aspects of the various systems they can run on, and perhaps evolve
differently on different machines.  There could be "ecological niches"
analogous to tide pools or caves where specific organisms would dominate.

At least, that's the theory.  The project's web pages haven't been
updated for a year.  They had a lot of technical glitches with the
software, and then they ran into balancing problems, where trivial
strategies would dominate (often a problem with alife simulations).
At last report they were introducing various ad hoc rules and limitations
to try to get robust evolutionary behavior.

I don't understand this view.

Do you think Dennett would predict that a person would instantly become
unconscious if he were put into a complete sensory deprivation booth?
It seems pretty obvious to me that he would continue to be conscious.
There was a fad for sensory deprivation in the 1970s and from what I
understand you sometimes would begin to hallucinate after a while, but
you certainly still remained conscious (and I suspect the hallucination
had much to do with expectations).

In any case, surely the Turing machine could include a modest VR
simulation in addition to the brain simulation, sufficient to provide
virtual environmental interaction.  Or would Dennett claim that
consciousness only occurs when the TM interacts with the "real world"?
That would seem absurd.

This overlooks the possibility that future privacy-enhancing technologies
will exist as well.  It's very difficult to predict which side will win.
We may see a technological pendulum which makes privacy alternately easy
and hard as new attacks and defenses are invented.

In fact, we have often discussed technologies which would make the
gnat's job more difficult or even impossible.  Lightweight head mounted
displays will paint an image directly onto the retina.  This would make
it pretty tough for the gnat to see what you were viewing online.  At a
later stage, implants could do the same thing to the optic nerve, and
later to other parts of the brain.  Eventually you have technologically
mediated mental telepathy, full-sense VR and direct brain access to the
information nets.  At that point it all comes down to the security of
the software and encryption which is used.

> So the question remains - is this a bad thing?  And if so, is there a way

I see two broad choices for the question of privacy.  One is to let
the question be answered by how the technology works out.  There would
be a technological competition between the spies and the spied-upon,
and one side wins in the end.  We let the chips fall where they may,
and at the end maybe we will have privacy, or maybe we won't.

>From some points of view, this is a frustrating choice since we don't know
now which side will win, and it seems odd to leave such a fundamental
aspect of our future lives to what amounts to chance.  On the other
hand, we are part of a universe with certain fundamental properties, and
whether it turns out that privacy is ultimately possible or impossible
within that universe, maybe we'd better learn to live with it.

The other possibility is to try to force the question to come out
one way or the other.  Some social faction could demand that there be
privacy, or that there be no privacy, and attempt to require people to
behave accordingly.  This wouldn't necessarily involve coercive force,
it could be based on voluntary agreement, say a closed society where you
have to abide by its conventions to enter.

This is an attractive solution, particularly if society is diverse enough
that different approaches can be tried locally, with competition among
the various groups so that the best method wins.  However, it may be
unstable in that there would be pressure to try to cheat, and the laws of
physics would be on the side of the cheaters (assuming that the outcome
is the opposite of what would have happened in the first case).

I dunno. Think of a fetus. Do you know of any cases whatsoever where the fetus
was aware and thinking while in the womb, which is a remarkable sensory
deprivation chamber. A human being does not really become aware until at least
a few weeks to a few months after being born. They need time to learn how to
sort out all of the sensory imput into a rational format.

One "simple" counter is to only run code that you have the source
for and that you compiled yourself. This isn't perfect, but
open-source code has a lot more eyes looking for and fixing
vulnerabilities. A more difficult counter is to modify the
hardware and/or compilers to remove certain common exploits.

Title
  Influence of cedar essence on spontaneous activity and sleep of rats and
  human daytime nap.
Source
  Psychiatry & Clinical Neurosciences.  52(2):133-5, 1998 Apr.
Abstract
  We investigated whether exposure to the odor of extracted cedar essence (CE)
  has (i) an influence on spontaneous activity and sleep-wake states of rats
  and (ii) a sleep-promoting effect on human daytime nap after taking an
  ordinary night's sleep. In rats exposed to CE, spontaneous activities and
  amount of wake were significantly decreased, while the amount of non-rapid
  eye movement (NREM) sleep was significantly increased. In human daytime nap,
  NREM sleep stage 2 latency was significantly shortened after exposure to CE.

Title
  Effects of lowering average of
  below-average cholesterol levels on the progression of
  carotid atherosclerosis: results of the LIPID Atherosclerosis Substudy. LIPID
  Trial Research Group [published erratum appears in Circulation 1996 Jun
  23;97(24):2479].
Source

Abstract
  BACKGROUND: Cholesterol lowering in patients with
  above-average cholesterol levels has been shown to reduce
  the progression of atherosclerosis and lower the risk of coronary heart
  disease events. However, there has been uncertainty about the effects of
  cholesterol lowering in patients with
  average or below-average cholesterol
  levels. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, 522 patients with a history of
  myocardial infarction or unstable angina and with baseline levels of total
  cholesterol between 4 and 7 mmol/L (mean, 5.7 mmol/L) were randomized to
  treatment with a low fat diet plus pravastatin (40 mg daily) or to a low fat
  diet plus placebo. Treatment with pravastatin reduced the levels of total
  cholesterol by 19%, LDL cholesterol by 27%, apolipoprotein B by 19%, and
  triglycerides by 13% (all 2P<.0001) and increased apolipoprotein A1 and HDL
  cholesterol levels by 4% (both 2P<.0005), in comparison with placebo. Carotid
  atherosclerosis was assessed from B-mode ultrasound measurements of the
  common carotid artery. After 4 years, mean carotid wall thickness had
  increased by 0.048 mm (SE=0.01) in the placebo group and declined by 0.014 mm
  in the pravastatin-treated group (SE=0.01) (2P for difference <.0001). The
  effect of treatment on wall thickness was similar in three groups classified
  by tertiles of total cholesterol at baseline, with mean levels of 4.8, 5.7,
  and 6.6 mmol/L, respectively (2P for interaction >.8). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment
  with pravastatin reduced the development of carotid atherosclerosis among
  patients with coronary heart disease and a wide range of pretreatment
  cholesterol levels. Treatment with this agent prevented any detectable
  increase in carotid wall thickening over 4 years of follow-up.

I see "reliable aggregate differences" as a fact. But "meaningful social
outcomes" sounds like an opinion to me. That seems to be the crux of the
"race" debate. There are differences, but are they curiousities or do they
demand action? My take is that they are swamped by cultural and environmental
factors.

Mainly because they have been unsuccessful in bucking social pressure
against their activities. The pot smoker that suffers bouts of paranoia
is a case in point. Were it not for the stigmatization caused by the
phony War On Drugs the paranoia would be expressed as something
altogether different. Similarly the nasty attractor state of getting
caught repeatedly in sessions of bookkeeping or say religious ceremony
is never seen for the complicity blinding social illness that it is.
These illnesses are real but are manifested by the great clobbering
machine made up of your so-called normals. Can you say 'tall poppy
syndrome'?

well for sure, it's quite debatable;)... i somewhat prefer this
hypothesis because i think there is some trend of borganisation and
networking in all the natural process.

ha... i should not have used this term... yes, optimization and sanity
are relative to a purpose or a context.Probably "autist" was a bad one
too. But of that, i'm rather uncertain. I've eared several years ago
that totally isolated childrens are dying of their isolation for example
(i don't know if this is a true fact). Seem that the human brain has
really to be shaped by an environment. By analogy, i believe a stellar
singleton would have to be exponentially more shaped. Of course, i'm
aware there is different kind of autism. In my previous mail, using
"deep autism", i was referring to a rather complete isolation.

yes, he will probably be very correctly configured for the purpose of
using resources. But that is coming from the lesser entities which are
parts of him.

i think a value system is part of an identity. For a single isolated
system, i think it could be very very difficult to emerge an identity.
Because the identity of something is also relative to an external
environment. Something act in his environment according to his identity
and in return the environment act on it, then it act according to the
reponse of the environment .... It's a rather recursive process.

For example the planet earth could be considered as a singleton, a
networking of a huge number of physical process. But i don't think earth
is able to emerge an identity alone... or you will have to wait a long
long time.

So i think there will not be a true singleton, an alone identity. But
always aggregates of different singletons of a lesser level of
complexity. Of course one could consider that the external environment
of an identity has not necessary to be constituted of other identities
and be happy of the presence of the physical surrounding. But the
singleton in such case will probably be a little bored... no external
shaping, so much more difficulties to evolve, to progress, to change
your purposes... not very transhumanist thinking i think.. if you
consider it's rather easy to emerge a society of singletons of a certain
order because you already managed to make one.

So if you want to emerge a kewl singleton of a certain size and
complexity, i think you will probably have to make little brothers of
the same order for him ;)..

So, because of networking and borganisation, the "intelligent" life is
condamned to always evolve to complexities of higher orders... i think
an alone entity is unable to have purposes quite optimally matching his
order, complexity.

Although this brings up an interesting question, it is irrelevant to my original
question.  As to the sex slave, is it conscious?  If not, then I don't see a
victim.

Having experimented quite a bit with float tanks, the brain certainly seems to
have a need to continue to process information, whether of an external or internal
nature.  John Lilly recommend the tank experience for that reason - it allowed the
user to process internal information that they would otherwise not be able to do
amongst environmental distractions.  In my experience, solutions to several
problems I was working on in frustration, revealed themselves while I was in the
tank.

I have to disagree here.  I don't think an infant needs to process input in a
*rational* format in order to be aware of it - think of all the irrational people
out there! :-).  All healthy infants respond to environmental stimuli immediately
after birth.  I would call that response awareness.  Proving they are self-aware
however, may prove as difficult as doing it for anyone else.

How would you define "identity"?  The possession of a unified set of memories?
 A single set of goals?  A single thread in a multithreaded process?  A
Cartesian consciousness?  A unit having its own copies of basic reasoning
faculties which can come to conclusions distinct from those of other units? 
All of the above?  None of the above?

Until you've decided what the distinction is between "many" and "one", you
certainly can't figure out which the Singularity will be.

Bonus question:  Why do you care?

 I can think of plenty of cases where gender does make a difference. But on many
traits, the differences seem overrated. For example, height. Males are on average
slightly taller than females. But if I were to tell you "You will shortly meet two
people. One is a native Thai adult male, raised in Thailand. The other is a native
Masai woman, raised in East Africa". You would lose money (on average) betting that the
male will be taller. Other factors swamp the gender bias.

 It seems our brains amplify the significance of small average differences. We go from,
"men are on average taller than women" to " men are taller" to  "couples in which the
man is shorter are weird".  This kind of social logic may have had some survival value
to our ancestors. However, I think it makes the kind of diverse society I would like to
live in less likely, so it is a thought process I try to resist.

Faster, yes. However Linux nor FreeBSD is immune, and 95% of 
all installations will succumb if you apply tricks pulled out of
last year's bugtraq traffic. There are no mechanisms to distribute 
authenticated kernel patches via network and automagically 
recompiling the kernel periodically. Paradoxically, one of

using well-cured TCP/IP implementations you can reduce the

minutes, but you can't prevent it from happening altogther. 
And this doesn't at all address the application layer -- 
while applications are multiplying like flies. The only way
to leave this behind is to step away from brittleware. Sorry,
don't see this happening within one decade from now.

Ok. Macs (Be? OS/2?) are rarely used by hackers, hence the exploits
are rare. Same applies to switch/router firmware. That's obscurity. 
If you have a 100 types of systems, each with a 1% market share, no worm is
ever an issue. Civilization doesn't collapse if 1% of all systems are
suddenly taken out of circulation. (I know this for certain, since the
percentile of crashed M$ boxen at this instant is probably
significantly higher than 1% ;)

Microsoft contributes the bulk, with Mac ranging at less than 10% and
Unix (well, Linux actually) a more or less close third. Network

I think there is much conservation within software product
families, rendering derivates susceptible. Diversity of machine 
languages is a major bulwark against system perversion, however. 
Even if the hole is the same, the code will crash on a different 
architecture. Intel recently pushing StrongARM, rediscovering 
Linux and Compaq enamoured with Alpha does seem like a good thing, 
but some ten architectures none of them dominating the market share?

I agree that when we enter a world where full VR mediated mental telepathy exists
with very strong encryption, a couple of the points I made become moot.  However, I
still think gnatbots will make it nearly impossible in the foreseeable future for
people to hide what they do in *meatspace* - from their sex lives to hiding the
latest top-secret test vehicle at 'Area 51'.

For the fun of it, lets imagine that all of the scenarios in 'X-Files' are
occurring at some level or another within the echelons of government.  Granted they
may be able to hide all of their communications while plotting against the rest of
us; however, once they start to implement their plans in meatspace, I find it hard
to imagine how they could possible hide their actions any further.  Once they
attempt to implement those plans in meatspace it becomes public knowledge.

I think this also applies to many of the scenarios of run-away nanotech
development.  Rather than one party achieving the assembler breakthrough and
leveraging that advantage to prohibit others from reaching it, it's quite possible
that several other research groups will have gnatbots spying on each other - such
that the knowledge of each groups advancements assist the others.

Cedar essence seems to make rats sleep more and rush around
less. During their sleep, they had more deep sleep than normal
(?). The essence makes humans taking naps go to deep sleep faster.

Consequences? I would say the essence might be good for taking power
naps in slightly stressful environments, a kind of mild sedative.

There are other differences less politically incorrect to note, such as 
the ability to lactate, inseminate or gestate.  There do seem to me 
differences of cognitive style, also, which was the thrust of my 
previous post and which you failed to address.    Joe

However, it might be a good idea to make sure these technologies are
freely available. If gnatbots or strong encryption are limited to a
small group the consequences might be bad, as they seek to keep their
advantage. They might not win in the long run, but it can be nasty in
the short run. Hence it is a good idea to make sure the playing field
is level.

You can usually limit cheating by setting up a system so that cheating
does not pay; when you design your deliberately closed or open society
you can build in certain defenses. Just make sure your dominant
startegy is evolutionarily stable, and cheaters will likely remain a
minor problem.

Of course you would agree that you remained conscious.  The point is,
Dennett appeared to be denying that a Turing machine could be conscious
unless it was interacting with its environment.  It doesn't make much
sense for this to be the case with a Turing machine when it seems not
to apply to people.

I might add that it seems that it should be possible to engineer
resistance to hallucinations into an AI.  Just because people eventually
begin to spin their mental wheels when deprived of the traction of
sensory experience doesn't imply that all beings would be that way.
I am skeptical that there is an iron law of consciousness that says that
all brains would behave this way when deprived of input.

I had the impression that the question was whether consciousness requires
present-time interaction with the environment, not whether there was
interaction at any time in the past.  The latter would be consistent
with Turing-machine functionalism, as I understand it.  The question is,
can you take a program and stick it in a Turing machine, and thereby
make it conscious.

The source of the program is irrelevant for answering this question.
If any program has the property that running it on a Turing machine
produces consciousness, then Turing functionalism is true.  If it
turns out that the only way to make such a program is by running an
interaction with the environment, fine; likewise for any other way of
creating the program.  The source doesn't matter.  All that matters,
for this question, is whether running a program can produce consciousness.

Yes, our brains need input to develop into something useful. Isolated
children don't die (except of physical deprivation, of course), but
their mental growth is stunted. Not all cases are hopeless, but there
are likely critical periods necessary to set up the pathways for
e.g. social perception or language.

Is there any need for an identity?

Besides, it is much easier to make many small entities than one huge
all-encompassing one. And the social life becomes more interesting.

No. Take a look at most major mental disorders and the lack of
flexibility becomes obvious, even without any social
context. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is obviously inflexible, as is
paranoid delusions. Depressives cannot easily shift out of their black
mood, borderline personalities seem to be unable to comfort themselves
and need others to do it, frontal lobe damage limits the ability to
switch strategies, schizophreniacs exhibit a whole range of
stereotypal behaviors and lack of metacognitive control, and so on. 

It is easy to play games with the definition of mental illness, but
these states are out there and have certain properties, whether you
regard them as illnesses or not.

The U.S. Army tries very hard to be race-neutral. However, in basic training we
did have one class in which the US Army made an explicit and official distinction:
The class was in how to apply camoflage paint to your face. You choose colors
based on the skin color. It was hilarious listening to the drill sargent using
circumlocutions while attempting to explain the theory. I know that this
isn't really racist, but its a very clear distinction made solely based on
the color of your skin.

  IAN: I read it saying cedar essence induced more sleep-
  time, and that that sleep was deeper sleep than normal,
  since non-rapid-eye-movement sleep implies deep sleep.
  So if you have sleep trouble, try some cedar essence.
  I recall having seen pillows with various essences.

"Singleton" and "completely isolated individuals" are essentially the
extreme endpoints of a continuum of possible organizations that humans
believe they can understand. I suspect that neitehr extreme is achievable.
Our current civilization is not comprised of completely isolated individuals,
although I suspect thar we are closser to the "individuals" end of the
continuum. We can of course attempt to guess where the SI will be along this
continuum or how it will evolve along this continuum. First, I think we need
to decide how likely it is that an SI is restricted to this continuum at all.
It looks like the typical oversimplified bipolar mapping of a multivarate
space to me, sort of like Myers-Brigg.

All of the above and none of the above.Could be composed of the above,
but not necessary.

At this moment, i think an identity is a dynamically evolving whole
interacting with his dynamically evolving environment. The distinction
of what is in the whole and what is outside the whole could be of
course, somewhat arbitrary. I don't believe in the notion of pure free
will for example.

For me, a good compromise between the identity complexity and the
complexity of his outside world and the bandwidth of interactions
between the two has to be reached to provide an "interesting" identity.

If the surrounding of the identity is poor, if there is not too much
interactions according to the complexity of the identity, the identity
is somewhat in a state of stagnation... that's not what i wish.

"interesting" mean here, something that grow exponentially faster in
complexity.

A "one" is something that can have "many" "parts", a "part" is a "one"
;)

> Bonus question:  Why do you care?

Because i've really been dynamically shaped internally and by my
environment to like to try to think, at least a little, to such things
;)

I do not take me seriously and i'm of course aware this his mostly
wishful thinking and that in the end i can't understand even an
infinitesimal of what has to come in the future.

Rich and interesting according to our standards.
if the bandwidth is small between the entity and the external universe
then there is only the internal universe that could be really
interesting.

No, i don't think so, but the system is probably less chaotic if there
is some way to emerge one.
beside, perhaps that if you look at a correctly configured thing that
doesn't have a real internal 'identity generator' you could be misguided
to believe that it has one.

Interestingly it has been recently shown that 70% of the variation in
height is accounted for by ONE gene held on the X chromosome. Which
explains why XXX or XXY people are taller than average.

Sorry for the vagueness of the above: this is from memory from a report I
read in New Scientist a few weeks ago. If someone has better details please
post them, obviously its was a great surprise to find that one gene
accounted for so much variation.

>My apologies.

Apology happily accepted. Do you really think that the States are much
better in terms of libertarian ideals that Australia? I've travelled a fair
bit in the States and its hard for me to really pin down the differences.
One plus is the relative lack of litigation: I remember being shocked when
I heard how much car insurance was, let alone insurance if you were a
doctor. To my Southern way of thinking constant litigation (even alimony is
far different here) strikes me as a far greater infringement of freedom
then loss of the ability to legally own guns.

At least you are allow to read whatever you like in the States. Not
something understood down here.

Sure people get caught in attractors which they can't get out of and an
illness ensues, but what starts them on the downward spin is often
environmental and actual damage is quite another thing altogether.

These definitional games are often the problem. I live in the extreme
right wing dictatorial fascist state of New Zealand where people's life
expectancy nowadays is almost the lowest in the developed world. In a
recent poll, only 16% of the population expects the health system to be
there for them when they really need it. Changing definitions of
disability and illness are often used by the government when they fuck
with the population and quite regularly, via the news media these days,
decide who lives and who dies. So lumping problems together with
illnesses and disabilities caused by damage is quite a negative aspect
of the duck shoving and obfuscation that goes hand in hand with a
society that will not own up to its own social ills, such as fascism,
gangs, etc.

Keep in mind that rats are nocturnal animals and we are diurnal. This makes
them less than an ideal test model for humans (there cycles aren't simply
reversed from ours, but are different). One of the people in in the
psychology department here at Monash has finished PhD where he was
developing a diurnal model using the African Palm Squirrel. Over the coming
years we should here more and more sleep studies based around this or
dirunal animals.

I know its not a very extropian venture, but I still find the launch of the
first module of the ISS next Friday exciting. There is lots of information
on the BBC website:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/special_report/iss/newsid_217000/217788.stm

I'd be very interested in learning what people think the ISS will achieve
(scientifically and otherwise).

best, patrick

To answer this we need to have a more detailed model of the gnatbots
and of any countermeasures.

There is a limitation to the visual acuity possible to a bug that is
literally the size of a gnat.  I believe Brin suggested that it might
need to land and inflate a lens in order to get good visual images.
This could make such bugs a lot easier to detect (depending on how big
the lens is).

The gnat needs to be able to record information, or else transmit it.
If it is transmitting it probably needs considerable power to get through
walls, etc., and can be detected.  Recording is going to require extreme
compactness, depending on how much data it has to hold.  We've all seen
how even a few seconds of audiovisual data eats the megabytes.

It seems to me that a literal "gnatbot", the size of a gnat, able to
capture visual and sound imagery for several hours, then fly somewhere and
transmit it, is going to come pretty close to requiring full Drexlerian
nanotech.  I don't see it as something which is going to happen in the
near future.  We can put it safely out in the fuzzy nanotech region
of the 2020s or so.

Given Drexlerian nanotech, it would be relatively easy to maintain a
"clean room" environment where objects as small as gnats are easily
detected.  Even today's technology can do a lot better than this in
chip fabs.  If gnatbots ever become possible then we would probably see
this technology becoming widespread.  Eventually with full nanotech it
may be routine in any indoor environment.

Suppose they decide to test a new psychoactive chemical on the population,
a typical X-Files scenario.  Much could be accomplished by anonymous
instructions to various actors.  Various labs fabricate certain organic
chemicals, others put them together into mixtures.  A manufacturing
plant gets a contract for asthma inhalers including the new chemical.
A marketing firm is hired to distribute the inhalers for free in a medium
sized city.  Some thousands of people start acting a little wacky.

Conceivably someone could trace the chain backwards once they are alerted
to the problem, but they'd need to be experts to really figure out what is
going on.  And the shadowy figures behind the scenes are never connected
to the activities.

I wonder if you could get around poor resolution of any one gnat by
combining signals from array of them (a la radio astronomy). The downside
is you'd probably need a swarm of them for the idea to work; still its a
neat idea even if probably unworkable.

I also think it's an oversimplified bipolar mapping, but of a nonvariate
space, rather than a multivariate.  In other words, I am not sure that there
exists a valid distinction between "many" and "one".  Functions have inputs
and outputs.  Modules of the human brain have inputs and outputs.  How is this
distinguishable from "individual" and "environment"?  When does a module stop
being a visual cortex and start being a human?  That was my question - what
kind of functionality was involved.

For what it's worth, my guess is that there will not be duplicated
calculations or module-based programming, at least if efficiency is being
maximized.  If individuals exist, it will be because of moral concerns
overriding efficiency, or because maximal efficiency cannot be achieved due to
constraints on global interprocess communication such as lightspeed limits or
barriers between Universes.

Two things to consider:
1)  There's a lot of duplicated processing in the human race.  Is it really
necessary to have five billion copies of the walking algorithm?
2)  Ideal efficiency requires that there be only one Post-Singularity Entity,
among all the races of all the Universes.

Title
  Various intensities of leisure time physical activity in patients with
  coronary artery disease: effects on cardiorespiratory
  fitness and progression of coronary atherosclerotic lesions
  [see comments].

Abstract
  OBJECTIVES. This study was designed to define the effect of different levels
  of leisure time physical activity on cardiorespiratory
  fitness and progression of coronary atherosclerotic lesions
  in unselected patients with coronary artery disease. BACKGROUND. It has been
  shown in various studies that regression of coronary atherosclerotic lesions
  can be achieved by means of lipid-lowering drugs, reduction of fat
  consumption and physical exercise. METHODS. Patients were prospectively
  randomized either to an intervention group (n = 29) participating in regular
  physical exercise or to a control group (n = 33) receiving usual care. Energy
  expenditure in leisure time physical activity was estimated from standardized
  questionnaires and from participation in group exercise sessions. After 12
  months of participation, repeat coronary angiography was performed; coronary
  lesions were measured by digital image processing. RESULTS. After 1 year,
  patients in the intervention group achieved an increase in oxygen uptake at a
  ventilatory threshold of 7% (p < 0.001) and peak exercise of 14% (p < 0.05),
  whereas a significant decrease was observed in patients in the control group.
  To achieve significant improvement in cardiorespiratory
  fitness, approximately 1,400 kcal/week had to be expended in
  the form of leisure time physical activity (p < 0.001). The mean energy
  expended in such activity was 1,876 +/- 163 kcal/week in the intervention
  group and 1,187 +/- 97 kcal/week in the control group (p < 0.001). In the
  intervention group, regression of coronary artery disease was noted in 8
  patients (28%), progression of disease in 3 (10%) and no change in coronary
  morphology in 18 (62%). In contrast, coronary artery disease progressed at a
  significantly faster rate in patients in the control group (progression in
  45%, no change in 49% and regression in 6%) (p < 0.001 vs. intervention).
  When the two groups were combined, the lowest level of leisure time physical
  activity was noted in patients with progression of disease (1,022 +/- 142
  kcal/week) as opposed to patients with no change (1,533 +/- 122 kcal/week) or
  regression of disease (2,204 +/- 237 kcal/week) (p < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS.
  Measurable improvement in cardiorespiratory
  fitness requires approximately 1,400 kcal/week of leisure
  time physical activity; higher work loads are necessary to halt progression
  of coronary atherosclerotic lesions (1,533 +/- 122 kcal/week), whereas
  regression of coronary lesions is observed only in patients expending an
  average of 2,200 kcal/week in leisure time physical activity, amounting to
  approximately 5 to 6 h/week of regular physical exercise.

Title
  Influences of cardiorespiratory fitness and
  other precursors on cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in men and
  women.
Source
  JAMA.  276(3):205-10, 1996 Jul 17.
Abstract
  OBJECTIVE: To quantify the relation of cardiorespiratory
  fitness to cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and to
  all-cause mortality within strata of other personal characteristics that
  predispose to early mortality. DESIGN--Observational cohort study. We
  calculated CVD and all-cause death rates for low (least fit 20%), moderate
  (next 40%), and high (most fit 40%) fitness categories by
  strata of smoking habit, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and health
  status. SETTING: Preventive medicine clinic. STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Participants
  were 25341 men and 7080 women who completed preventive medical examinations,
  including a maximal exercise test. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cardiovascular
  disease and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: There were 601 deaths during 211996
  man-years of follow-up, and 89 deaths during 52982 woman-years of follow-up.
  Independent predictors of mortality among men, with adjusted relative risks
  (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were low fitness
  (RR, 1.52;95% CI, 1.28-1.82), smoking (RR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.39-1.97), abnormal
  electrocardiogram (RR, 1.64;95% CI, 1.34-2.01), chronic illness (RR, 1.63;95%
  CI, 1.37-1.95), increased cholesterol level (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.13-1.59),
  and elevated systolic blood pressure (RR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.13-1.59). The only
  statistically significant independent predictors of mortality in women were
  low fitness (RR, 2.10; 95% Cl, 1.36-3.21) and smoking (RR,
  1.99; 95% Cl, 1.25-3.17). Inverse gradients were seen for mortality across
  fitness categories within strata of other mortality
  predictors for both sexes. Fit persons with any combination of smoking,
  elevated blood pressure, or elevated cholesterol level had lower adjusted
  death rates than low-fit persons with none of these characteristics.
  CONCLUSIONS: Low fitness is an important precursor of
  mortality. The protective effect of fitness held for smokers
  and nonsmokers, those with and without elevated cholesterol levels or
  elevated blood pressure, and unhealthy and healthy persons. Moderate
  fitness seems to protect against the influence of these
  other predictors on mortality. Physicians should encourage sedentary patients
  to become physically active and thereby reduce the risk of premature
  mortality.

What you lot are forgetting is that the gnatbots and related
omnisensorial devices won't be primarily used for spying but will be
welcomed and used to conduct socio-economic transactions. The signals
from such an advanced system will be used to sum things in a non-linear
way and the processing will be primarily anticipatory by nature. This is
the key design of a popular demarchy that will break the back of the
need for privacy as embodied in the old Dickensian double entry
bookkeeping systems so favored by capitalism and abused by crooks. Brin
never got this far in his thinking but he agrees with me that this is a
favored outcome. Globally exchange rates and currencies will have been
replaced and underneath it all will be heard the ghostly garbled
crunching and strangled sounds of arbitrageurs and other merchant
bankers crying, "Yes, but but but..."

Imagine a gnatbot on the face of a moneylender forever... Ah, well

Why not use MEMS scanning mirrors with a single pixel photodetector? 
 
(Sort of the reverse of a laser beam scanner, on a very small scale.)

Or, rather than a gnatbot, use a mite-bot, that laches onto the 
eyelashes of the enemy's weapons designers, and sees everything they 
see (even if in an HMD).  Maybe they can bore into the eyeballs and 
set-up a small area on the blind spot (optic disc).

See http://www.science.wayne.edu/~wpoff/cor/sen/visanat.html

>From there, maybe crawl back along the optic nerve into the brain, 
and start rewiring things.  Hook up some some detector and 
stimulator networks in Broca's and Wernicke's areas.  This should 
enable signal intercepts within the individuals cognition process, as 
well as enable modification of their interpersonal semantic 
exchanges.

See http://www.uthscsa.edu/mission/spring95/brainmap.html

When they start hearing things and speaking for their puppetmasters, 
they'll likely just keep it to themselves, because it's most likely 
that they'd come off looking crazy to anyone they complained to.

The reason I brought up gender differences in cognitive style rather 
than bodily morphology is because it would not be the bodies of 
people which would be uploaded, but their minds.  If gender 
differences in cognitive style are pronounced enough to be 
measurable over a large population to a statistically significant 
degree, it would seem to introduce a further element of complexity 
into the uploading project.  Multiple connectionist schema within the 
cybernetic upload site might be required to accommodate the 
possibly distinct neural network patterns underlying these cognitively 
stylistic differences (verbal/aural vs. visual/spatial being the most 
documented and notable).  Comment ca vu?

This is a big problem with animal tests.  They often don't apply to
humans.  As noted in my _Nutrients_Catalog_, many vitamins such as B7,
B8, B9, B10, and B11 were proven in animal experiments, and then later
we found out that they don't apply to humans at all.

I need to clarify my previous note.  I am not a wannabe looking to find
out more about hacking.

I have been a security consultant for 18+ years, worked for many
government agencies on black projects, incorporated my own security
company in 1995, currently have a contract to provide my security
expertise solely through IBM's I/T Security Consulting Practice, and
have submitted a security invention for possible consideration for a
patent.

I am a professional Security Consultant who makes money by protecting
large companies and state government agencies from hackers.  (No spooky
stuff, anymore, just business.)  I work one-third of my time out of my
house, and two-thirds of my time flying around the country to customer
sites.

If there is anybody else out there doing similar stuff, or having
similar interests, I would like to contact you.  I am turning down six
engagements for every one I can fill.  There aren't enough security
consultants to fill the need.  I am not in a position to train anybody,
because I'm too busy.  But if anybody already has expertise in security
or computers, especially if they are intelligent or creative thinkers
like on this list, I would really like to talk to you.

Even though Linux is suseptible to attack, that doesn't mean that it is
remarkably robust because of it's openness. All systems are suseptable to
bugs, hacks, and attacks, but an open sourced project will be able to
weather it better than a closed-system.

Both of you are making very good points, but do you see the underlying theme
of your discussion? Open systems, evolutionary behavior, diversity. These
sound like natural phenomena to me. The have proven to be valuable resources
for change and survival in nature. Why should computers be any different?

I suggest that we follow a very Taoist attitude and instead of trying to
fight problems, we adopt a more observational attitude and apply techniques
that have worked in natural systems to systems that we develope. If it
worked for mother nature, I'm sure it will work for us. Let us not reinvent
the wheel.

If there is physological gender differences, which I think has yet to be
proven, shurely they can be overcome by memetics. We can be what we want to.
The mind and the free will is stronger than the flesh.

If we don't belive this we should not considder ourselfes to be transhuman.
Any difference between gender is shurely smaller than the leap between human
and posthuman, and we do believe that that leap is possible.

Dont we? :-)

Since uploading would require a quite general process of neuron
emulation, I don't see the least problem. After all, it would have to
deal with brains much more dissimilar than brains of different genders
(old brains, young brains, possibly damaged brains). A likely upload
process would "simply" scan the connectivity and type of neurons and
build a software emulation based on this; relatively little prior
knowledge about brain structure need to be assumed if the scan is at a
sufficiently low level.

I agree with you, but also remember that nature didn't invent the
wheel. Some solutions are distinctly non-natural but work well
too. One shouldn't be dogmatic about one's non-dogmaticisim :-)

You must factor robustness into efficiency. Having just one copy of
each algorithm is a bad idea if there is any risk of it being damaged
or unavailable (which can be a big problem for a distributed mind;
"Darn! I need my low temperature manipulation skills, but I left them
in the outer solar system!"). Another factor to think of is
evolvability: is the system designed from scratch, or the result of a
combination of many systems? You cannot just ignore legacy systems,
and having a non-modular system makes change very hard.

You don't find any monoliths in nature.

Yes, unless you want that a communications glitch with the central
server makes us all temporarily handicapped.

Sounds Tipleresque.  But efficiency for what end? If the goal is not
well-defined or requires complex information top-down solutions like
you propose tend to be inferior to bottom-up solutions, even if they
involve a high amount of redundancy and diversity.

But if running an interaction with the environment is
the source of the program, then it does matter.

Peter Wegner's 9705 _Communications of the ACM_
article, "Why Interaction is More Powerful Than
Algorithms" (see http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/pw)
provided an overview of the interactionist view:

"An object's operations are not algorithms, because
their response to messages depends on a shared state
accessed through nonlocal variables of operations...
controlled by unpredictable external actions... Input
streams of interactive machines are not expressible
by finite tapes [as in Turing machines], since any
finite representations can be dynamically extended by
*uncontrollable adversaries*... nonterminating
reactive processes, like operating systems, cannot be
modeled by algorithms... Interactive histories of
distributed systems ... consist of nonsequential
events that may have duration and may interfere with
each other... 

"Raw interactive power is captured by interactive
identity machines (IIMs) that output their input
immediately without transforming it...
Interactiveness (openess) is nonmonotonic in that
decomposition of systems may create interactive
unpredictable subsystems, or equivalently,
composition of interactive systems may produce
non-interactive algorithms... Giving up the goal of
complete behavior specification ... makes respectable
software-engineering methods of incomplete partial
system specification by interfaces".

Wegner's and similar approaches were discussed at a
9711 Interactive Foundations of Computing Conference
at Washington University in St. Louis.  Here's some
more heresy against the Turing Church from Ronald
Loui's lecture there (available at
http://siesta.cs.wustl.edu/~loui/jp4.html):

"Alan Turing and Alonzo Church are canonically held
to be at the foundation.  Computing is about
algorithms.  Algorithms are essentially Turing
machines, infinite storage and finite control,
sequential, state-transition specifications... The
celebrated idea of Edsger Dijkstra is that a program
just is a function transforming inputs to outputs. 
Programs are just cleverly compressed tables of
logarithms, no matter how fancy they pretend to be...

"Then Peter Wegner, before his naked emperor, had the
temerity to announce that algorithms are not what
most of computing is about. Instead, the management
of interaction better describes in abstract the
day-to-day computing practice.  It is as scandalous
as the observation that scientists do not follow
scientific method, or that economic behaviors are
neither Bayesian nor utilitarian, or that logic is
about notation, not reasoning."

Good point, Peter.  In the example of autombiles, there's a wealth of
reputation information available through the "car press" and sources such as
Consumer Reports.  However, unfortunately, the former tend to be very
selective in their reporting (auto journalists like to drive and report on
GOOD cars, and they do take advertising revenues from manufacturers) and the
CR approach tends to be broad but not necessarily deep.  Likewise reputation
information from acquaintances and friends tends to be unsystematic.  Frankly,
as far as safety issues go (the original question), the adversarial system
tends to be well-focused and designed to allow a full airing of both sides'
evidence.

That's right, but there aren't many small start-ups in the automobile

You're right that the project is not very extropian in how it's being
accomplished, but I certainly let out a whoop of excitement this morning when
I saw that the Zarya module had gotten off the pad at Baikanour OK.  Although
ISS is a big boondoggle in many ways and it's history is an object lesson in
why big central government projects are about the least efficient means of
accomplishing anything (even something as single-minded as "build a space
station"), it's also a great source of education for the next generation of
space engineers.  We'll need those people when the technology becomes
available to do space on a more efficient basis.  I'd like to see ISS
privatized as soon as possible and serve as a construction base for those
projects.  By then (2005-2015) it's scientific value will have gone from low
to nil, but its value as a place to do useful engineering work may be
unmatched.

Good point, Kathryn.  The targets for memetic warfare really aren't the
oppressed people in this situation; the proper target is the oppressors.  As
someone else (?) pointed out, perhaps the best memetic warfare is simply to
show these ignorant kids what life is like in a free society.  For the most
part, they may be so brainwahsed that they will misinterpret most of what they
see, but a begining can and should be made.  Over time, it may well corrode
their conditioning.

But as usual that's largely due to the barriers that government regulations
put in the way of new companies. In the UK -- where pretty much anyone 
can set themselves up as an auto manufacturer -- there are dozens of small 
manufacturers, some selling complete cars, others selling them as kits for 
home assembly. The cars are usually cheap and idiosyncratic, but they're
often much better for their target market than the usual models from Ford
or GM.

Interestingly, one such car is the only one I know of allowed to compete 
in rallies without a roll-cage -- the body is so strong that it doesn't 
need one -- and the old Jensen FF, with ABS and permanent 4WD back in the 
late 60s, couldn't be sold in the US because Jensen weren't willing to 
smash up two cars to pass US safety regs; in terms of production numbers 
that would be equivalent to Ford smashing half a million Escorts. So US 
safety regs *prevented* the sale of the safest car in the world at the 
time.

But then that's government for you...

Well, it depends on what state you are in. There are a number of states here
which I consider to border on fascism/socialism. While there is relatively
little repression of politically accepted minorities, there is a rather serious
amount of tyranny of the majority, as well as tyranny of special interests,
especially to the point of enforcing laws that any rational person would
recognise as unconstitutional. While I have a personal interest in the 2nd
Amendment and the heinous amount of violations against it in the statutes, I
also see this with regards to many other parts of the Consitution.

For example, the 1st Amendment protects freedom of speech, free association,
and bans the forced membership in a National Religion. It does not say that
anyone can be forced to listen to another person's free speech, and it does not
say that a person must speak.

The federal government has little to no respect for the 9th or 10th Amendment
rights (which is all rights that are not specifically enumerated in the
Constitution), which belong to the People (as individuals), or to the States as
delegated by the People in those States. The Congress and the Executive branch
are constantly passing laws and creating regulations which violate these
amendments. However, these are also the loophole by which the States are able
to become little fascist tyrannies in and of themselves. The People in each
State can vote and pass Amendments to the State Constitutions which can limit
any right not specifically addressed in the US Constitution. This is how the
States are able to, for example, restrict the right to choose an abortion. As
long as the People properly delegate their rights to the State in their State
Constitution, they can make their own state as bad and oppressive as they want
to make it, so long as they do not violate the US Constitution. This is how
States like Massachusetts, New York, California, etc. do not seem to be much
different from other english speaking socialist countries like England, Canada,
or Australia in the way their government treats their citizens. However, come
up to new Hampshire, or try New Mexico, or some other more conservative state.
I think you'll find a marked difference.

There is also the farce of double jeopardy. A person cannot be tried twice for
the same crime, yet feds have won the right in the Supreme court to try drug
users, growers, and traffickers both in civil and criminal courts, winning two
convictions for the same crime.

By comparison, the 2nd Amendment should be rather simple. It says "A militia
being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the People to
keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." Any idiot can tell that it means
that no local, state or federal law or regulation can limit how the People, as
individuals, can posess and use their weapons of choice. Many liberal
revisionists have claimed that the word "People" means the community or society
as a whole, however, in all Constitutional Law, when you have the capitalized
People, you are referring to the people AS INDIVIDUALS, so the right to keep
and bear arms is an individual right, not a community or group right.

This is why the US has historically not kept a large standing army when it was
not at war, up until WWII. If the liberal's argument is right, that it is a
group right, and only for the purpose of maintaining a citizens militia, then
the only guns which should be allowed are those which fall into the category of
'Assault Weapons'. Also, a militia has NEVER been considered to be a full time
professional army. It is a part time volunteer organization made up of free
citizens in each state. The militia here in the US is defined in the federal
regulations as, I beleive: 'all able bodied males between the ages of 18 and
40'. Under this, if you use the liberal group interpretation, this means that
only able bodied males between the ages of 18 and 40 have the right to keep and
bear arms. I'm sure the feminists that aren't already anti-gun would not like
this. This reg may have been degenderized lately. Anyone know?

Since then, as the acknowledged #1 Power in the world, we 'had' to take on the
mantle of Empire to oppose the remaining totalitarian governments, some of
which are still in power. Since the two oceans no longer are effective means of
isolating ourselves from the rest of the screwed up world, we are in the
position of using our technology to either shut everyone out, or to conform the
rest of the world to the American image in order to preserve our own freedoms.
An interesting problem....

Depends. While frivolous lawsuits are a burden, being subject to risk of
litigation does have the effect of enforcing a quality of service in the
individual which is not usually seen in government bureaucracies elsewhere. A
doctor in Canada, for example, can get away with serious malpractice much
easier than they can in the US, as the government is always gonna pick up the
bill. While the government might get off its butt and keeps track of the
malpracticing physicians and revoke their licenses, the victims usually are not
justly compensated for their losses in a government insured system. We do have
a problem here of doctors moving to a different state after they have been
nailed for malpractice, as its harder to keep track of them and easier for them
to gain a new license in another state, even if they lose the one in their
original state. Civil litigation seems to be more effective as a means of
enforcing personal responsibility than supporting a huge government bureaucracy
to babysit everyon from birth to death.

Yes, I've wondered about that. Is that a carryover from being subjects under
the British Commonwealth, or merely because the original founders were mostly
prisoners?

*I* cannot ignore legacy systems; non-modular design makes changes hard for us
and evolution.  In both cases, the dependency trees have gone beyond where a
human mind could keep track of it.  Here's an interesting scenario:  Envision
a Singularity sphere expanding at lightspeed; the outermost fringes will
always be less advanced, hardly just past Singularity, than the center.

Now envision a lightspeed-unlimited Singularity, with the same problem, but in
software.  The outermost frontiers are always at the limits of design, and the
PSE can only understand it well enough to design it, but not well enough to
get rid of the legacy code.  But old applications can be redesigned ab initio
with the vast excess of computing power (advanced beyond what was necessary to
create them in the first place).

Why can't all five billion copies fail in the same way, then?
Or in other words, what makes you think that redundancy is the best way to
deal with the kind of flaws (if any) that exist in Jupiter brains?  Perhaps
there will be redundancy, but without duplication - multiple, separate
algorithms.  And even if a classical '90s "communications glitch" occurs,
there's no reason to believe one would need five billion copies rather than,
say, quintuple redundancy.

Given that the number of humans keeps changing, we are not likely to be
exactly at the ideal redundancy level right now.

If you want to be really Tipleresque, you can hypothesize a few nano-replicant
or descriptor-pattern harvestors sent back in time to surreptitiously record
our minds at death, a la Spider Robinson, which actually might not take much
more effort than a cryonic revival.  The key question is not what is possible
but what the PSE(s) will find worthwhile.

Ya got me.  "We never really do learn all the rules of anything important,
after all."  (_One For The Morning Glory_, John Barnes).

"That had been one of his earliest humiliations about the Beyond.  He had
looked at the design diagram - dissections really - of skrodes.  On the
outside, the thing was a mechanical device, with moving parts even.  And the
text claimed that the whole thing would be made with the simplest of
factories, scarcely more than what existed in some places in the Slow Zone. 
And yet the electronics was a seemingly random mass of components without any
trace of hierarchical design or modularity.  It worked, and far more
efficiently than something designed by human-equivalent minds, but repair and
debugging - of the cyber component - was out of the question."
	- _A Fire Upon The Deep_, Vernor Vinge

(Logical flaw alert:  One of the Powers would have noticed, however.)

Anyway, the point is that "top-down" and "bottom-up" represent two design
methods forced by two limitations on intelligence, two possible styles out of
a vast space, not two ends of a continuum.  Evolution has unlimited local
optimization, but cannot perceive global patterns.  Humans can consciously
design and improve architectures, but are hard-pressed to write a few lines of
code, and for large projects simply cannot devote the attention necessary to
optimize everything in assembly language.  The ideal solution, of course,
avoids *all* pattern, top-down or bottom-up.

A more interesting question is what sort of sub-optimal solutions might be
created by the requirement not to spend more computing power optimizing an
algorithm than that algorithm will consume if unoptimized.  Why spend a
million generations evolving a piece of code that only needs to run once?

Intelligence-conserving programs won't be "top-down" or "bottom-up"
sub-optimal, I can tell you that much.  Top-down design focuses on
architecture and tends to be fragile and break in interesting ways; bottom-up
design focuses on a lot of highly-optimized modules, multiple redundancies,
and legacy code that can derive from thousands of major generations past. 
Perhaps intelligence-conserving programs will focus around the innermost
loops; the advantages and disadvantages of this approach, I really can't guess.

With respect to the actual Singularity, rather than playing with ideas, I
should note that all of these speculations just became possible in the '80s,
and that it may use ideas that are only the fads of this generation rather
than the underlying principles of reality.  Our fascination with bigger and
better software may be as silly as the Victorian fascination with bigger and
better steam engines.

I would say that since women have a dominant right brain, while men are
dominant left, usually, of course, and that this dominance seems to be a
factor of hormone levels, that as long as you have electronic hormones to
control the sense of masculinty/femininity, then as long as you have
modules for all cognitive functions in an upload, no matter what the
gender is, allowing the electronic hormones to dictate the use and
dominance, then there should not be any prblem between the two.

I think we'd need to start with the word "identical". It two things can be
exchanged and no change can be detected by the outside world then the two
things are identical. An unproved and unprovable but nevertheless reasonable
corollary is that it doesn't matter internally either.

If everything you know I know, and everything I see feel and hear you see and
feel and hear then our brains (or consciousness) could be exchanged and the
external would could not tell the difference in our behavior, and neither
could the Clark/Yudkowsky composite being. We would share the same identity.

There is no reason to think this is an all or nothing concept. If the John
Clark of 5 minutes ago were exchanged with the John Clark of right now the
world would see almost no difference so we're almost the same person, but the
very act of writing this post has changed me a little.

So, John, lets say you have a set of identical twins or triplets. By your
reasoning, since the siblings are all the same, then it should be alright to kill
all but one of any set of such natural clones at some point during or after
birth. Agree or disagree?

I think the same resolution problems arise when you are using a very tiny
mirror.  It may be that lasers have it easier since their light is
coherent.  I would have to do some research into these issues if you
want more detail.

That's the problem with these extrapolations.  We quickly spin off into a
neverland of inconceivably advanced technology.  If there are mite-bots
crawling into the brain, probably there are immune-system bots to fight
them off.  It's not obvious which side will win.  Until we know, the
jury is still out about how much privacy will be possible in the future.

Thank you for supporting my point. Before one can embark upon
enhancing a system, one obviously should have a deep level of
understanding about its modus operandi. Human designers can't 
create systems nonbrittle in respect to modifications, robust, 
self-healing or gracefully failing, very complex, autohomeostating 
&c&c systems. It's time we learn the trick. Hubris and ignorance 
don't mix well, at least not on the long run.

I disagree. I think at the heart of the malaise is the human hubris 
of believing we came up with the best metadesign scheme ever and 
pushing it onward despite of an impressive track of unfavourable 
evidence. Structures break, systems crash, people die. For instance, 
from my anecdotal experience, system design as software engineering 
is one of the most irrational human engineering endeavours. (How 
many unmet-schedule-all-nighter-pulling developers with a strong 
maestro streak do you know?) So far we've been at some level adaptive 
to systemic damage and occasional casualties, fixing the most glaring
holes -- but shielded from the worst of it that failures didn't 
autoamplify as of yet, and by the fact that (human-designed) brittleware 
doesn't evolve well. But this doesn't mean we will be immune forever. 
If our designs are really distinctly suboptimal, and someone comes 
up with a substrate less brittle in respect to evolutionary
optimization, or allows the mutation function to mutate as well 
we might be in for an eye-opening experience. A smart enough 
mutation function can do wonders to the field of GP. With GP, you 
won't have provably secure practical systems (which are as real 
as unicorns), but at least they will be robust.

Of course, this doesn't mean nature's ways are the best. We can 
do better than nature, and indeed we will one day. But please don't 
ignore tricks and metatricks nature came up with. It will be
difficult, particularly considering analysis of evolved fit, but
opaque solutions and creation of hybrid systems, but it should be 
well worthwhile.

Oh, and of course nature did invent the wheel. The flagella rotor
bacteria use for propulsion is of course a wheel, and driven by a nearly
100% efficient nanomotor at that. The reasons why macroscopic
organisms don't use wheels are more difficult. Too large valley
between two local optima peaks (rotor tissue invasculation 
trouble? rotors can pump as well) might be one thing, unsuitability 
of wheeled animals in natural rough terrain habitats might be another.

  IAN: Good to observer, and since identity changes 
  per second, per nanosecond, there is no 100% same 
  identity across a time interval. Buddha observed
  the time-cumulative nature of identity saying:

    "What we are today comes from our thoughts of 
    yesterday, and our present thoughts build our 
    life of tomorrow: our life is the creation of 
    our mind." From "The Dhammapada" (Buddhist 
    scripture), translated by Juan Mascaro, 
    Penguin Books, 1973, chap.1 verse 1.

Hello,

This is an issue that the AT&T WorldNet Service Abuse Group is currently
investigating, as well as our legal staff, and some law enforcement
agencies.  Attempts to apprehend the perpetrators of these abusive emails
and websites is ongoing The primary cause of the problem is an individual
or group of individuals that re-register with the service,  after the
account has been canceled due to violation of the Terms and Conditions.
Using the latest array of "real-time" tools, we scan for and put a halt to
these accounts.  Because the name and address in the registration
information is often forged with stolen credit cards, it poses problems.
This has been and will continue to be an ongoing effort until it is
completely stopped.  We appreciate your assistance in furnishing us with
copies of the "spam".   Direct your complaint to the WorldNet Abuse Desk at
the address below. Please send the expanded header with the spam. The
expanded header is imperative, since it shows the time stamp and IP address
of the sender. Although you only receive an auto-reply from abuse, I would
like to assure you each complaint is thoroughly investigated. Please bear
with us as we work to bring this situation to closure.

Thank you again for writing AT&T WorldNet Service.

I am not getting into this.  We already did this discussion two years ago. 
Besides, Turing identity is totally irrelevant to the issue of whether a given
Turing process should be considered a singleton or a community, and you know it.

No offense.  But if there's any AI-literate being on the planet who doesn't
have strong, unarguable opinions on Strong AI, I would like to meet him.

As for myself, of course, I have always held that the laws of physics are
non-Turing-computable and there is no observer-independent answer to the
general form of the question "Does process A instantiate computation B"? 
Likewise, you are a strong computationalist:  Everything is Turing-computable
and the phrase "non-Turing-computable" is synonymous with ghosties and
ghoulies.  The chance that either of us will change opinions without totally
new arguments equals the probability that we will both become fanatic Calvinists.

Why bother?

Ah, but we are not in quantum mecanics here, brains are macroscopic
objects, so we can track their positions in space-time. A brain is also
strongly defined by his position.
That's why, even if everything you know I know, and everything I see
feel and hear you see and
feel and hear, even if we are for a moment complete identical copies, we
can't be exchanged.

 Gender makes a big difference in sexual reproduction, by definition. I chose height as a
gender difference that has a commonly accepted measure. Cognitive style is much more
difficult to measure. The measurements proposed naturally include assumptions that may be
disputable - hence, I think, the political nature of such measurements.

 As soon as a system becomes at all complex, measurements imply assumptions and world views,
and hence politics. Even something as "technical" as measuring the performance of web servers
(my current area of expertise) can generate a lot of political heat. My theory is that it is
the unacknowledged changes in points of view that hobble the discussion. I am trying to
develope tools to translate one persons point of view into anothers, at least in this limited
domain.

 Hence my interest in this "differences" thread. Seems to me another case of a lot being lost
in translation. We are all using the same words but with a different implied context.
Mechanically translating the implied context would be a useful piece of intelligence
amplification, I think, and a suitably extropian project.

You are correct on the first point, Phil, the nucleus is transferred from
the infertile egg into the fertile egg, meaning that the cytoplasm of the
healthy egg surrounds the infertile nucleus and revitalizes it.  (I've got
to stop typing posts when I'm tired, it leads to dyslexic errors like this
one.)  Ethical objections to this procedure center on the issue of how much
mitochondrial DNA gets transferred and possibly mutates, leading to birth
defects.

Thank you for catching that!

FWIW

This reminds me of something one of the politicians is purported to have said
once....Jack Kemp I think.

He claimed to be a dove....a heavily armed dove.

What about the fact that the original infertility may be genetic?
Now, thanks to science, you can hand infertility down to your children.

Ummmmmm....I just reread this (too late.)...The tone is wrong...possibly it

Well, if science can cure it, it's not really infertility...

The original founders (i.e. early British settlers) were not mostly prisoners.

I think its simply that if there isn't a strong constitutional guarantee
then government is likely to want to control speech as much as any other
thing. There is a strong feeling within society that words can hurt and
that people have a right to be protected against that.

Its an argument taught in first year psychology: Our society views the
rights of the individual as important (very libertarian!), but at the same
feels that it has a duty of care for individuals within it (very
non-libertarian). So with those who are mentally ill you have to weigh up
their rights of freedom with a duty of care to them (and to a lesser extent
to others within society affected by them). Now I have some sympathy with
the argument that someone who is feeling depressed and likely to suicide
should be protected from themself (esp. if they are likely to get happy
again soon - I know not very libertarian), but it is a slippery slope.
Exactly the same kind of thinking comes in when drugs are discussed: we
must protect the users from themselves (in Australia drugs are seen
predominantly as a health issue). So it makes perfect sense when you come
to reading that you protect the individual from information that might hurt
them or society (for instance information on drug use - the book "E is for
Ecstacy" - or "dangerous" sexual practices or other anti-social activity).
The government even passed an anti-racial vilification law recently. The
road to hell is paved with good intentions!

>I would say that since women have a dominant right brain, while men are
>dominant left,

How do you come at this? I wasn't aware there was any good evidence
differences in lateralization between men and women that contributed to
cognitive style. While the brain clearly processes different sorts of
information in different hemispheres I don't think there is any evidence
that would allow you to  attribute broad cognitive styles to a dominance in
one or other hemisphere. I would be interested if you have any references
that support this view.

As a side note: I have a friend who's Honours thesis in psychology involved
looking at which side of the body infants were held. It turns out that
about 70% of people hold their infants on the left and this occurs
cross-culturally. It even occurs if you give people dolls to hold, but not
other similarly weighted  objects like large ball or pillow. In fact
whether you hold a doll on your leftside is predictive of whether you want
to have children. It has nothing to do with handness (lefthanders show the
same bias) and does not appear to be related to putting the infant near the
heart-beat. The best explanation I have come across is that emotional
processing is laterized in the brain and argues that positive emotion is
predominantly (completely?) processed in the right hemisphere (where the
left visual field is processed). So there are weird differences in terms of
laterization, but I am not sure there is any evidence that sex affects
laterization.

best, patrick

I've read that left-handed people are less lateralised than right-handed
people (i.e. the left and right hemispheres are less specialised in
particular faculties so there is an intermingling of functions throughout
the brain). Being left-handed myself I've often wondered about how true this
is and what implications it has for intellectual ability, specialities, etc.
Since men are more likely to be left-handed than women, doesn't that imply
that women are less lateralised than men?
Is this in any way related to the other thing I've read of, that the IQ
distribution of left-handed people is more skewed towards the extremes?
(i.e. there are proportionately more low IQ and high IQ left-handed people).
Because men are supposed to have a more skewed IQ distribution than women
too.

Jason Soon

We need to create a new OS.  We need to do it as an open source 
internet project.  We can base it on Unix, or use some other OS, 
looking to Thinking Machines, Cray, or some other parallel 
distributed system for a model to learn from.

The problem is simple: We're going to need to be able to program this 
massive supercomputer called "The Internet".  The broadband 
infrastructure to support distributed nonlinear video requires this.

We should assume that each computing node has massively parallel DSP 
chips and gigabytes (even terabytes) of local ram.  It would be a 
good idea to keep in mind that additional nodes will be added as soon 
as they roll off the production line.  Plan for nodes with faster 
processors and ram to be added as quickly as they can be manufactured 
and added to the network.

Now what do we do?  Today is a good time to start, as these items 
will be the infrastructure necessary to keep the masses entertained, 
and scientists and engineers educated and productive.

It's probably best to think of money as being less of an object than 
human capital and time availability.  I think it would be wise *not* 
to assume that will be a commercial OS.

Let's go home and make, and watch movies.  This foolish competition 
has reached the point of diminishing returns.  We can implement a 
price freeze and use funny money if necessary.  There's plenty of 
food to go around (see http://www.adm.com/).  Let's go home, watch 
movies, surf a broadband net with voice recognition, grow vegetables 
in the backyard (see http://www.cannabis.to/pictures/), and think up 
ways to pursue life, liberty, and happiness.

Dozens. Apart from very well documented differences in language area size 
(a researcher at UNSW is doing some of this with post mortem cell counts: 
the differences are substantial) and other tasks such as spatial judgment 
(see  for a review), recently Goldberg been developing an approach that 
focuses on preferred style rather than ability using a cognitive 
preference task that I find interesting. I append the abstract below. 

One reason that there is less on this than one might expect is that 
interest in this topic tends to generate the response that Damien was 
driven to emit, i.e.:

>What?  *What????*  WHAAAAH

Not conducive to getting grants or publishing work. 

Anyhow, there is tons. From a neuropsych perspective, go to 
 <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/medline.html>
and enter this search or similar
((spatial[All Fields] AND (sex[All Fields] OR gender[All Fields])) AND 
difference[All Fields])

For fun add the term "laterality" to pick up neuroscience references.


Here is Goldberg's paper:

Podell K, Lovell M, Zimmerman M, Goldberg E  (1995) The Cognitive Bias 
Task and lateralized frontal lobe functions in males. J Neuropsychiatry 
Clin Neurosci 1995 Fall;7(4):491-501 

The Cognitive Bias Task (CBT) is a multiple-choice response selection 
paradigm characterized by inherent ambiguity. All items offer a range 
from extremely context-dependent to extremely context-invariant 
responses. Lateralized prefrontal lesions produce extreme, and opposite, 
response biases on CBT in right-handed males. Healthy control subjects 
perform in the middle range. Findings suggest a dynamic balance between 
two synergistic decision-making systems in the frontal lobes: 
context-dependent in the left hemisphere and context-invariant in the 
right. The robust lateralized effects, which are dependent on task 
ambiguity, are sensitive and specific to frontal dysfunction. CBT is 
discussed in comparison with the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test as a 
potential cognitive activation task for functional neuroimaging of the 
frontal lobes.

This sounds very similar to Hans Moravec.  It's amazing to see these
ideas beginning to enter the mainstream.

Moravec's new book arrived from Amazon yesterday, but my son grabbed it
as soon as he got home from school so I haven't started it yet.  I'll
take a look at it this weekend.

hey, it worked in this country.  well sort of.  as kathryn points out, this
is a very difficult problem, however i have tremendous confidence in
the power of human desire for material goods to overcome religious
blindness and ignorance.  in the war between materialism vs faith, im
betting on the former.

a test case to watch: israel, 400 days from now.  new years eve, 1999,
happens to fall on a sabbath.  the religious leaders will want the entire
country shut down as usual on a friday evening, whereas the more secular,
bar owners and such, will want to stay open, collect sheckels from the
party crowd, and generally join the rest of the world in revelry.  so, these
two speeding freight trains are approaching each other with grim determination.

You are right that "meaningful social outcomes" is opinion. I made the 
mistake of being relativist.

To decide if you think they are important, decide whether you think that 
explaining variance in income, crime, solo-parenting, education, etc 
matters. If it does then race matters.

however, I recall having an argument with Phil Rushton at a conference 
where I argued the opposite: that race DOESN'T matter. It went as follows

The Bell Curve proposition is essentially that all observed racial 
differences are infact IQ proxies and that partially out IQ leaves no 
racism. In words, that means that current racial differences are entirely 
exlained by IQ and that Occam's Razor would suggest that we use just the 
one more general variable rather than keeping both. Race in this case 
could be viewed as an evolutionary or historical explanatory variable 
rather than a contemporary causal agent.

I've got three kids, one 5 years old, one 20 months old, and one 6 weeks old
(sleep is a commodity).  Nathan, my 5 year old son, started attending a
private school this year.  Each student in his class had to present a "Me
Board" which included information about the student's family, interests, and
future plans.  My wife and I constantly discuss topics related to
transhumanism in front of the children.  In addition, we've got books
scattered all about the house. Nathan periodically picks up a book that has
a visually interesting cover and asks what its about.  I try to give him an
adequate summary of the books ideas.  Anyway, he and I were putting his "Me
Board" together and I asked him about his future plans.  One of his future
plans was to be immortal.  One of his other future plans was to be uploaded
into our computer at home so that he could think faster about what other
future plans he might have.  Unfortunately, I was out of town the day he
presented his "Me Board" so I was not able to see the reaction of his
classmates and teacher at his pronouncements.

Huh? What I said was that even if there are real changes in
lateralization, that will hardly make uploading gender
non-neutral. Lateralization is a *trivial* problem compared to getting
the synaptic connections right; if you can get the synapses right you
will get the lateralization of the brain as a bonus. No need for blue
and pink uploading helmets.

Most left-handed people have a mixture of left and right hemisphere
control of speech, although the left side is dominant in most cases -
truly right-sided language is rare. The corups calossum is on average ~11%
thicker in left-handers, which may perhaps facilitate cross-hemisphere
communication and bilateral functioning.

> Since men are more likely to be left-handed than women, doesn't that imply

Men have on average a thicker corpus calossum than women, but since
female brains are smaller than male brains the relative size of the CC
in relation to the language areas is larger in women. There is also a
result I saw on a seminar showing that the parts of the CC correlate
more with various intelligence measures in females than in males -
possibly both hemispheres are more involved in processing the same
task in females.

There is also Geschwind & Galaburda hypothesis that testosterone
influences (from prenatal environment, and genetic biases or
production and sensitivity) the lateralization; it delays the growth
of the posterior left hemisphere, increasing the risk for dyslexia,
stuttering, hyperactivity abd learning disorders as well as anomalous
dominance leading to left-handedness, right-hemisphere language and
increased mathematical and artistic ability. The hypothesis is
unfortunately a bit hard to test, and the difference in handedness and
other properties between men and women is much smaller than predicted.

(taken from Biological Psychology by James W. Kalat - a nice
introduction highly recommended for all extropians with
neuropsychological interest)

As part of a recent psychological evaluation of an 11 year old girl, I asked
her what she would say if she were given three wishes.  I can only recall
two
of the wishes off the top of my head:

(1)  I wish everyone in the world were atheists, and
(2) I wish I were immortal.

Hmmm, a transhumanist in the making.  I did find out that her parents are
atheists, but don't know about their views on life extension.  Anyway,
that's
the first time I've ever heard a child say things like that.

This week has been rather busy (or something, I haven't got much work
or reading done anyway) so the crop of articles is fairly brief.

	Evolving molecular designs
	Casing assemblers
	The pharmacology of Long Term Potentiation
	Two websites

Nanotechnology

The papers from the Sixth Foresight Conference on Molecular
Nanotechnology have begun to arrive, see
http://www.foresight.org/Conferences/MNT6/Papers/index.html

Some fun reads so far are (I look forward to many other of the papers)

Globus, Al, John Lawton, and Todd Wipke: "Automatic molecular design
using evolutionary techniques"
http://www.foresight.org/Conferences/MNT6/Papers/Globus/index.html

They describe an algorithm to evolve graphs representing molecules,
trying to get them to approximate a desired molecule. They could get
it to evolve benzene, cubane and purine relatively reliably, and runs
for diazepam, morphine and cholesterol are underway. It seems possible
to improve the algorithm quite a bit and it looks eminently
parallelizable (definitely something to run on the net!).

Merkle, Ralph C.: "Casing an assembler" 
http://www.foresight.org/Conferences/MNT6/Papers/Merkle/index.html

About how to case an assembler with a bag of carbon. The fun thing
isn't necessarily the solutions, but that it is clear that Merkle
really seems to be moving towards a fairly complete assembler
model. It also fits in nicely with some ideas Henrik hrstrm and I
have discussed for our paper on nano-immune systems.


Neuropharmacology

Memory and the Brain: Unexpected Chemistries and a New Pharmacology by
Gary Lynch, Neurobiol. of Learning and Memory 70, 82-100 (1998)

A review article where Lynch deals with the substrate of LTP and
modulation of synaptic change. And of course he has a section about
ampakines, positive modulators of AMPA receptors that seem to increase
and prolong LTP. In experiments they improve many forms of memory,
both in rats and humans (especially older people). In rats they also
produce a faster performance on complex, well-learned tasks. Overall,
it seems like there is a big potential here.

[ Did you really think I could avoid finding a paper about memory
enhancing drugs? :-) ]


No articles, but two good websites:

Falling Into a Black Hole by Andrew Hamilton - animations of various
phenomena around black holes. Seems there are a lot of optics that
people get wrong, I learned that I was wrong about some phenonmena
during the approach.

http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/schw.shtml

A lot of wearble links gathered by KPJ of Aleph:

when asked if women should be astronauts, marvin minsky gave the
wonderfully evasive answer that all astronauts should be female, for
women have a higher intellegence to weight ratio... {8^D

regarding our earlier discussion on "tinkerbellizing" do the standard

Sure, once they've grown. But right after birth? How can you tell any differences? If you
cannot perform any personality or other cognitive test which establishes the the infant
twins are not the same 'person' then for all intents and purposes they are the same
person. Sure they will grow into different people, just as two clones will grow into
different people, but at some point they are indistinguishable to science as being any
different from each other. Therefore it is ok to kill one, so long as the other lives,
since they are the same person.

Do you really think posthumans can ignore legacy systems and design
everything from scratch whenever they need it? That sounds very
uneconomical. And for any mind, there is a limit to how much
interdependencies that can be managed, and since highly interconnected
systems tend to have an combinatorial explosion of dependencies it is
not that unlikely that even posthumans will have trouble manageing
unstructured code.

Where does the vast excess of computing power come from? Note that it
seems to be used up for all sorts of things, so unless the entities
involved in the Singularity are extremely uniform there will be a huge
demand for various uses, ab inito design will be just one of them, and
likely less economically interesting as (say) storing descendants or
useful programs (not to mention images of scantily clad jupiter
brains).

Monolithical systems, where everything needs to be just in its right
place, with no redundancies and a central design doesn't occur in
nature. Organisms are actually modular (even if they also occur a
tight web of evolved interconnections and tricks between the moduled),
distributed and often highly redundant. Monoliths seem to be too
brittle and expensive to maintain to function well in a changing,
imperfect world where computing resources are in demand.

Because they are independent systems, not a single master program run

I am not saying it is the best way of dealing with flaws of JBs, I'm
saying that redundancy makes a system more robust against local
damage.

As I see it, there is a built in bias in reality towards efficiency of
survival ("the survivors survive" - and pass on their
information). But if survival in a post-Singularity world becomes a
question of software and pattern survival, we can expect to see
strategies at least as diverse as the current memes to develop.

Ideal for what? Data compression, perhaps, but not for maintaining and
extending the system.

(Good Vinge quotation by the way, I think I'll use it in my Java

Most likely optimal programming methods are problem dependent; it
would surprise me much if there was a single general problem solving
method that converted a arbitrary specification "this is what I want"
to an optimal design.

Here's a better explaination, as far as I can tell: evolution. Since there is a
greater percentage who are right handed, then a primitive human or hominid
would want to hold an infant on the left to leave the right hand free to hold a
rock, spear, or other weapon. I would venture to guess that the vast majority
of people and apes will hold a baby on the non-dominant side to leave the
dominant hand free, whether the individual is right or left handed.

Huh, I guess your PR up here misrepresents you. Then again, to an American, being

i suspect this is something like the abortion problem you pose here.
right after birth, even if they share the same genotypes, they have
different phenotyping. because they don't evolve exactly in the same
environment inside the mother, the babies are not in the same place
inside, so they have different perceptions and are evolving differently.
You have probably to go back, *at least*, just after the conception...

it's thus impossible to have the precondition of  <<"If you cannot
perform any personality or other cognitive test which establishes the
the infant twins are not the same 'person' then for all intents and
purposes they are the same
person">> correct.

I think the problem with Clark's proposition of identy is in the fact
that you can't have two evolving systems sharing exactly the same
(experiences, observations, environment). I fail to understand the
improvements of a "identy notion " defined like that for a macro-system.

One of the place I learned this was in ski instructing. The PSIA programs tell
why its easier to teach women to ski than men. Since instinctive eye/foot
coordination is a right brained function (as I guess are most functions of
coordination, and the right brain does the geometric cognitive finctions as
well), and women are dominant right brainers, women more easily develop the
skills to ski than men, who wind up overanalyzing everything with their left
brains, which bogs up their right hemisphere's ability to oversee the muscular
coordination. For a guy to learn to ski, they have to conciously a) stop
thinking about it and just do it. Only once they've developed the skill of
putting their right brain in charge can they use their left brain to make
little suggestions about angulation, pressure, torsion, etc.

I can take any woman who is not mentally retarded or physically impaired and
make her a lower intermediate to upper intermediate skiier (depending on their
self confidence level) within one hour of putting skis on at the hill. A guy
will take at least twice, if not four or five times as long to get to the same
point. Some guys never get that far. With skiing, how good a woman gets
depends on her self confidence; how good a guy gets depends on how long it
takes for him to pull his head out, stop thinking about it, and how well he
listens to what his ski instructor actually says. A guy who is plateaued out
at a low level is that way because they have dominant personalities which
cannot surrender control to anybody or anything.

How can you track them? If your brain and mine are identical then there is no
way to determine if they've switched positions or not, and it wouldn't matter
if they did.


     >A brain is also strongly defined by his position.


How? The input position of the sense organs is the only thing that's
important, the only restriction is that the sense organs are not so far away
that time delays caused by the speed of light start to become important.
A brain by itself has no way to determine it's position in space, or the
passage of time for that matter. I could stop your brain for a thousand
years, speed it up by a factor of a billion, or even make it run backward and
you'd never notice a thing. In the future "people" might not know or care where
their brain was, or if they were operating on their primary or backup brain.

The very language you use betrays the assumption that they
are not, in fact, identical.  To wit, "positions" is plural,
and perfect identity would require that they have an identical
position, no?

your concept of identity is only valuable for a time in witch occur no
interactions between the respective brains and their environments. Very
Very short time, probably equal to zero in the universe. With what kind
of magic are you able to switch the two brains without interacting with
them?

No, if we discuss of human brain, all the brain can also be viewed as a
big sense organ.It receive for example gamma rays from his environment.
the gamma rays received in some points of the brain are function of his
position in the space-time. the gamma rays are inducing reactions that
obviously can change the configuration of a brain.

This is true if you are able to isolate *completly* a brain from the
universe of reference and simulate the complete fabric of this universe
inside this universe. Are you able to propose facts that it is possible
to construct such simulator?(universe of reference = where is
implemented the simulator)

you are asking for a complete identity of brains at a quantum level and
perhaps beyond. I seriously doubt there is a substantial probability
that such things can occur or are implementable.

I think a concept of identity form a brain as to take in consideration
his environment.
In such view, a brain is then defined by the total configuration of the
universe (the configuration of the brain and the configuration of his
environment).

Spike, you really shouldn't solicit comments from parents about their
kids. As a class we parents are capable of chewing up enormous amounts
ov bandwidth on this subject. :-)
My three kids are 8, 13, and 15, (all girls). We are nonreligious, and we
discuss transhumanism at home. Kids readily accept and understand just
about everything we discuss on this list. ( Well, the 8-year-old is
not clear on all of the math.) The big problem is that we live in
a culture that finds atheism and transhumanism to be nutty ideas. The
problem as a parent is to teach the kids to be discreet and to respect
other people's religion, without encouraging deceptive and secretive
behaviour generally. Our approach has been to introduce mainstream
judeo-christian bible stories to the kids as myths and legends, similar to
fairy tales or greek and roman myths and legends, with the difference being
that many people profess to believe that the bible stories are true.
We point out that the greeks believed in their myths, too. This is a pretty
good way to introduce some scepticism and critical thinking, also. The
kids are doing OK so far.

This one's entitled The Chimeras of Loppet Creek, and it's quite
different from The Truth Machine and The First Immortal. Chimeras is an
sf adventure yarn with historical information and many anecdotes
involving recent advances in cellular biology. At this early stage of
the rewriting, both story feedback and scientific fact-checking are
desperately required. I'm even willing to pay a couple hundred bucks
apiece for the services of a few professionals in biotech or related
fields -- in case any are reading this. Other readers would receive a
copy of the novel if and when it's published, and, if your feedback is
especially useful, a mention in the acknowledgments. The manuscript
should be ready to send out next week. My preference is to e-mail it in
MS word format, but I could FedX a few hard copies if necessary. 
If anyone's interested, please e-mail me. I'll respond to all inquiries
within a few days.

Ha-ha. Current astronautics is a risky job, where people occasionally
get stretched beyond their limits. Intelligence, physical strength,
stamina, ability to work under stressfull, and sometimes extreme 
conditions for prolonged periods are required. No intrinsic gender
bias ever existed, but during the early years most astronauts were
recruited from exceptional military jet pilots, where women were
traditionally underrepresented. The early women in space was mostly a
PR gag during Cold War, and meant almost the physical end of the very 
first one. 

It will be interesting to see how pigs in space of any  gender will 
compete with the emerging third: advanced automation. How many 
NEAP, lunar or deep space missions could one have for the price 
of one ISS, I wonder?

I am not aware of any comparative studies in feline intelligence. As
to intelligence, you have to normalize brain weight in relation to
body mass (search for (Dawkins's?) cerebralization quotient). You 
must also correct for differing brain archetecture: higher primates 
and cetaceans are hardly comparable. 

As the neuron has a minimal size, obviously there is a limit how small
a brain can become. It would be interesting to see how brain intelligence
(=computational resource) scales up with bulk -- within limits, in
humans there seems to be little if any correlation between brain 
mass and IQ. 

Btw, how do you think can one measure the intelligence distinctly 
beyond the human scala, and how does superhuman intelligence scales 
up with system size, optimal ('omega') hardware assuming? Linear,
exponential, asymptotic?

We don't need a yet another OS: there is a number of powerful but
virtually unknown OSses out there: VxWorks, OS 9, Taos, Plan 9, 
Mach, Hurd, L4, diverse ForthOS'ses and lots of crazy experimental 
whatnots. We rather need a trick how we can make the marketplace 
adopt them to max out on diversity. You can't create artificial 
demand for a fine-grained efficient OS like L3 or L4 (open source, 
12 kByte OOP microkernel written in Intel assembly, Linux 
personality) if the people don't care for things like messaging 
latency, die yield and doing sensible computing with WSI systems with 
<< 1 MBit grains. How do _you_ write an OS to operate on a 300 mm
wafer with ~1000 gates/die grains, mostly locally connected? Ever
programmed an 'OS' for an analog FPGA or a hardware cellular 
automaton? Ever thought about how to utilize 
packet-switch-networked self-contained VLIW systems with on-die 
buses a few kBit wide? Ask your friendly Bunny Man from a local 
foundry, or a systems programmer how he feels about that.

A 300 mm wafer has about 70 000 mm^2 usable area. With near-future
0.1 um structures you can get about 100 million transistors (1/4 of
that with current technology) on each 1 mm^2 die (random defect hits
taking out several hundreds or even a few thousand of dies out of 
each wafer if you want to go WSI). With about 10^12 transistor 
equivalents (that's ~1 TeraTransistor, folks) that 300 mm wafer 
is an awesome resource, if used right. I think a hardware CA with 
~1 Gcells with a >10 GHz clock sold for 1..2 k$ could be good 
for something. But how can a new OS help you here?

Whip up a hypercube Beowulf running PVM/MPI (or U-Net on DEC Tulips
with about 30 us messaging latency, 20 MByte via Tx crossover 
cabling for full duplex, can bundle ports) or Myrinet. If you 
really want to flood your PCI or saturate your system with 
interrupts, buy a GBit ethernet card (if you want to do it 
cheaper, plug 3 or even 4 FastEthernet cards into your node). 
Voila, a commodity off-shelf supercomputer -- Beowulf people 
are doing it all the time.
 
The infrastructure is all there. All you need are applications. What was
your rationale for a yet another OS? Distributed nonlinear video?

Shucks, PVM even runs on Win98/NT. If not for security reasons, you 
could install PVM on every networked box on the Internet and break
DES, find your favourite Mersenne, and povray Pixar out of the water. 
Little else, for latency and bandwidth won't let you shock the 
top500.org crowd, alas. (Maybe a decade downsteam, if you'd find 
a way to evolve FPGAs/machine instructions robustly, and precipitate 
Singularity you could impress _some_ people ;)

dan, this thought occurred to me after i posted the original comment.
perhaps that is why i thought it curious: our silence on the topic was
deafening.  i said nothing because i have no next generation.

it did occur to me that extropianism appeals much more to the young.
i verified this on an outing with some extropians, which turned out
to be all young, mostly single, so perhaps most on this list are
pre-reproduction and/or pre-marriage.  (by this comment, i am
*not* asking if anyone here is young and/or single!)  {8^D

on the topic of chewing up bandwidth, do not worry.  since joining
the list, i have become very quick on the delete trigger, since i
now get a lotta spam.  i became quite the quick draw while the
guns virus plagued this, uh... memeganism.  {8^D  if we label
our offtopics, like you did, i see no reason why extropian parents

The new BeOS is very interesting.  It is now available for Mac machines and
Intel processors.  Release 4, the first non-geek release is due out in a
matter of weeks.  It is a modern OS, with little legacy baggage from Redmond,
aimed at 64 bit, multi-media.  It is cool.  Search on BeOS, and you will get
lots of hits.  The applications are rapidly increasing for this brainchile of

Hello. I would just like to say I'm 15 years old. My parents are
Christian but I'm athiest. Also, they don't even know what extropy is.
Never have talked to me about transhumanistic ideas or anything of that
sort! :) I found this list on my own. And I do concider myself an
Exptropian, the whole thing facinates me. I try to show my parents but
they don't even pay attention. LoL. Anyway, I just wanted to say that
nothing or no one has really influenced me... I set my own paths, my own
directions in life. :)

If you need an OS to do something, rewrite Linux.
And hasn't Beowolf done distributed supercomputing already?

There are only two real OSes.  MacOS is the supreme OS for users, and Linux is
the supreme OS for programmers.  Everything else is the 90% of everything that
is crap.

When I first read your posting I reacted somewhat like Damien. When I
looked up things in Kalat my position softened a bit, but I still
think you are exaggerating the difference a lot. There are certainly
differences in cognitive style (as your skiing example shows), but I
don't think lateralization is the whole story (in that case you would
observe many more left handed women than men, and I seem to recall
that that isn't true).

The interesting transhumanist question here is of course: how do we
change our lateralization? Is it possible using training (possibly
augmented by plasticity increasing drugs)? Is it worth the effort?

Timothy:

No doubt you know the literature well in this area, but I don't see how the
Goldberg reference below shows any evidence for sex-based cognitive
differences caused by laterization.

No doubt the literature on laterization is huge. I would be most
appreciative if you could point me towards a couple articles that make a
strong case for significant cognitive differences b/w the sexes in men and
women based on laterization.

thanks, patrick

Hang language. Can you give me a measurement procedure how you are
supposed to distinguish between these copies if your observation of
their spacetime trajectories is interrupted? Space itself isn't 
labelled, nor are system's particles.

I'd presume otherwise identical objects is indistinguishable, since
space is rotationally and translationally invariant. (It's actually
not enantioinvariant, but you'll find that out if you look _very_
closely).

I think it would depend on how much baggage one has to lug around. If
we assume an advanced posthumanist civilization, where all available
matterenergy is turned into computational substrate (unless you have
this ultimative in anal-retentiveness dispelled by a writhing wriggle
of hosts and parasites of all scales doing their evolution dance 
also in physical space -- meshes and hiearchies of fleas ad
infinitum), you are obviously bound for a virtual ecology with 
enormous scope of complexity as artefacted by coevolution. You 
of course have to represent skills evolved in the past which you 
might need in the future. However, there is a tradeoff. The resources 
needed for representation (and be it molecular tape in realspace) 
cannot be timeshared for computation, and hence for evolving adequate 
solutions from scratch. If the baggage becomes too large, you are 
outperformed by individua who had weighted their resource allocation 
differently. Of course a tabula rasa person constantly reinventing 
itself is also an equal absurdity as the walking Library of Babel 
locked in the loop of constant retrieval.

Assuming that all known systems, whether natural or men-made (I know
this is an arbitrary classification) are hierarchical, why should 
virtual ecologies of giant computing clusters be different? Maybe 
I'm stupid, but I don't see any plausible trajectory how one could 
arrive at an even a flat-hierarchy JB starting with where we are now. 
(Of course talking about post-Singularity events is meaningless, but 
it's so fun...)

Another reason would seem that signalling costs to obtain some distant
copy might be prohibitive, necessity to integrate an off-shelf module
into a distinct persona (mutation) set aside. Remember Kauffman's
lettuce which we break down do common building blocks instead of
cosmically fusing with it.

The embedding is going to be tricky here.

Observe the shift in meaning.  Mike said that men and women have contrary
brain dominance (undefined).  Patrick asked about the impact on cognitive
style of lateralization.

My horrified yelp might have been more explicit, it's true.  :)  

But I wasn't emitting a cry of amazement at the results, but rather a
shocked cry at the original claim (as I had read it) being made by an
intelligent and informed person.  Mikey's claim didn't deal with minor
lateralisations but with DOMINANCE.  This is not well-defined, I think, but
seems to be a rough-and-ready way of indicating which hemisphere houses the
main language-processing modules, construed as the locus of awareness,
intention, self, something like that (see Gazzaniga, below).  That notion
in turn reflected the work in the 1960s on cutting the corpus callosum and
finding that each hemisphere then showed quite distinct specialties,
normally hidden by the ceaseless cross-lobe interactions of the healthy
brain.  The `left-brain' was found to be `dominant' for language use and
abstract reasoning in most humans.  Since we're such political animals, the
word `dominance' instantly blurred into a general belief about which side
of the head was in charge.... boss of the soul, as it were.

You can see how an unconsciously sexist culture quickly read this garbled
claim backward into support for its unpleasant ideology.  Traditionally,
men are rational, articulate, focussed, while women are intuitive blurry
babblers.  Wow!  Maybe that's because men are dominant in their left
hemisphere, women in their right.  U.s.w.  Meanwhile, research was indeed
showing small differences in lateralization between male and female
populations, which seemed to support that zany (and mischievous)
misunderstanding.  (It is potentially mischievous in a number of
directions.  Male supremacists can use it to shove women back inside the
house, as the Taliban do.  Varieties of feminism can use it to argue that
`women's consciousness' is holistic and sui generis.)

Actually, the differences between men and women in respect of any general
`dominance' are insignificant compared to what is held in common.  To cite
Michael S. Gazzaniga, who did much of the work on split brains, `The idea
of modularity is central to modern cognitive neuroscience...  we now see
that only the left hemisphere has the underlying brain organization which
allows for high-level consciousness and belief formation' (NATURE'S MIND,
Penguin, 121).

As for handedness and speech lateralization, Christine Temple's popular
treatment THE BRAIN (Penguin 1993) offers some useful data.  98 percent of
RHers (male and female alike, naturally) have left-hemisphere
lateralization for language.  It's more complex for LHers.
Right-hemisphere language dominance seems to be controlled by a single
allele (Annett 1985).  In any event, Milner (1974) suggested long ago that
`in left handers or ambidextrous individuals, in whom there is no evidence
of left-hemisphere damage, approx. 70 % will have left-hemisphere speech
representation' (Temple 100).

These data might now be out of date, but the only important new work I
recall reading shows that women seem to be somewhat better cross-linked
than men.  The suggestion that women are `right-brain DOMINANT', however,
is as absurd as suggesting that most women have their feet on backwards, or
perhaps that their internal organs are enantiomorphic to the male.  It is
also dangerous, since as I noted above such claims are readily conscripted
to malign ideological purposes.

Of course I do not wish to imply that anyone on this thread is arguing from
those sorts of malevolent or self-serving motives.

Err, you weren't listening. I said there is no need to rewrite
anything for the original rationale, and singnificantly beyond 
that bickering about quality of OSses becomes pointless. (And if 
only because in advanced architectures the distinction between 
code and data grows meaningless, and the art of programming 
becomes first a lot like chip design, then is reduced to providing 
a set of constraints and then goes extinct altogether, along with 
the bipedal primate).

I won't discuss MacOS, but with a GUI a la KDE (Next version of
TrollTech's Qt will be GPL, and then there is Gnome) and a streamlined
installation even a typical housewife might find Linux attractive. 
Beyond the marketing smoke and mirrors, even Microsoft is
very aware of that (see Halloween2).

As to Linux, it is far from being optimal. How are you supposed to 
build an affordable parallel system if your kernel alone takes up 
a MByte? You want fastest memory possible, you must use local on-die 
memory with kBit wide bus and no parasitic capacitance/inductance. 
Why having caches then? But die yield says your CPU must be way 
simpler (no pipeline/MMU/FPU/BPU etc.), and your core grains must 
be tiny. Linux/Unix is not scalable to a system of few 100 networked
CPUs with a few MBit of RAM each. If your core is very limited, and 
sending an (asynchronous active) message is almost as fast as 
acessing on-die core we are obviously concerned more with 
hierarchical decomposition of objects so that their fragments 
fit into memory grains than with page faults, swaps, process context 
switches, threads, libraries, modules, and other vermin. I guess I'll
never understand it why people think that building computers or
programming them are rational enterprises, and not ad hoc bricolage
following market conservativism and vogues. What's so rational in a
Hollerith machine and punching cards or pushing abacus beads?

As I've just recently signed myself back onto this list,  I missed the
beginning of the New OS thread.  While the contribution I have to make on
this subject isn't exactly about a new /OS/,  but as a shell replacement
for the Windows environment. 

I've been using the environment Litestep ever since the first release --
it's a NextStep-like shell,  complete with wharf, right-click menu, 4
virtual desktops, and configurable step.rc and modules.ini.  

It's fun if you're stuck on a Windows machine when you'd rather not be.
The shell executable is around 12k and it's a modular system.  I've found
it to be more stable than explorer.exe as well.

So,  what's my motive to post such propaganda to the list?  What do I get
out of it?  Well,  the shell was made by kids.  And being a child myself I
just thought that it would be an interesting thing to share with the list
-- the majority of which is made up of adults.

We could, for example, guess by their previous respective positions and
what we know of their respective environments some properties they will
respectively have after the interruption of the observation of their
space-time trajectories. couldn't we? of course i can't imagine an
universal way to distinguish, the way to distinguish is dependent of the
configuration of the system. I didn't say here there will not exist
situations in witch distinction is impossible, i say there exist plenty
of situations where we could easily distinguish between the two brains.

example :

for the demo, we consider we really could have true identical copies of
a brain at a same time.

system : our universe including a brain1 and a brain2.

brain1=brain2.
(concept of identity without considering the respective positions of the
brains)

Consider brain1 is separated by (10c * 1 second) of brain2.
(c= light speed in meter/second)

Say the interruption of observation of their space-time trajectories is
of 1 second.

*
By witch physical process can you exchange (in 1 second) the two brains
who where truly identical at the beginning of the interruption of the
observation of their space-time trajectories ? As far as i know, i think
it's impossible. If you think it's possible and you can provide facts,
then i agree with you.
*

we could thus be able to distinguish between these two brains after the
interruption of the observation of their space-time trajectories.
Respective positions of the two brains, even if they are truly identical
(without position concept) at the beginning, do matter.

I fail to understand the point... how can two macro objects be truly
identical at quantum level? by chance?Space is very probably
rotationally and translationally invariant, but the universe is not
empty and what happen in a place at a certain time doesn't necessary
happen in another place at the same time, so there is variations of the
*macro* properties of the universe in function of the position relative
to an arbitrary object.

I think the identity concept you are claiming for is very useful in
quantum mechanics, but doesn't apply for a macro object like a human
brain. Perhaps i'm not correcty understanding what you are asking for or
i'm fooling myself, but if you are able to prove me that position
doesn't matter, i will be in debt to you.

The new Linux is very interesting. It is now available for Mac
machines and Intel processors, and about every hardware known to man
but toasters and mousetraps. Release X.Y.Z, the nth non-geek release 
is due every few months (the geek releases at least once a day). 
It is a modern OS (L4, MkLinux), with no legacy baggage from Redmond, 
is fully 64 bit clean (RedHat/Debian Alpha), can do multi-media. 
It is open source. It is very cool. Search for Linux, and you will 
get more hits than you ever wished for. The applications are rapidly 
increasing for this brainchild of Linus Torvalds and a gadzillion 
of developers from all over the globe.

Ok, BeOS has some advantages (and, to be fair, several disadvantages),
but none that Linux can't meet by mid next year. If BeOS was open
source, it would be real dynamite instead of just a flash in the pan.

O.K. Gene.  In an earlier note I mentioned a time machine game, and 
said "We're in 2020, you're in 1998".  

I retract that.  I'm in 2010.  You're in 2050.

See the following URL: http://nano.xerox.com/nanotech/nano4/jeremiah.html

Here's a fantasy scenario:  So and so calls up Texas Instruments and 
says "Give Drexler's cult whatever they need to build a broadband 
wireless internet with distributed computing.  They can go home to 
their jacuzzi's in their backyards in Silicon Valley and sit around 
and take bong hits while figuring out how to keep all the unemployed 
telecommunications and information industry workers busy.  We'll 
send them a piles of special series U.S. $20's in manila envelopes.  
Even give 'em coke or speed if it will help them focus and get some 
work done.  I hope they come up with something that can be programmed 
easily from their wall mounted flat panel displays."

"Send that Gene guy a ticket to get to Silicon Valley and stay 
there.  He comes up with some good head trips on the extropian list, 
but their way too busy with erudite acronyms and chip fab 
terminology.  Let's see if he can come up with a fucking shopping 
list instead, so I don't sound like too much of a fool when 
commanding the CEO's of Motorola and TI to give him his chips.  
Hopefully, the spec's will fit on a page or two, because I don't 
feel like lugging a notebook around on the golf course."

Ah, the ever returning question of identity.

Two objects which are identical down to the quantum level share a certain
sameness.  However, they are two objects.  Does the principle of Identity
of Indiscernables tell us when and how we can tell when TWO objects (2,
count em, TWO) are the "same?"

No, actually, it doesn't.  The principle of Identity of Indiscernables is
making a statement about *physical states.*  Specifically, that if we take
two indiscernable objects (which is to say that we take a PAIR of objects,
two of them!) and switch them, the state of the universe following this
switch is perfectly identical to the state of the universe before the
switch.  I repeat, the state prior to the switch is identical in every way
to the state following the switch.

Now, of course, only objects which are extremely similar (that is,
indiscernable down to the quantum level) can satisfy the requirements for
this principle.  And, since this principle is an "if or only if"
statement, we might be inclined to run it in reverse: if you could switch
two objects and get a physical state indiscernable from the original
state, then the objects must be identical.

But despite the fact that these two objects (dos, duo, not 1 or 3; four is
right out!) are identical, they are not the "same object."  They are:
*two* *indiscernable* objects. 

To say that two indiscernable objects are really the SAME object, we'd
have to imagine some metaphysical object off in Plato's heaven, an object
of which the two things we see are mere instantiations.  Even then,
however, they'd still be *two* instantiations of one thing.

How does this relate to consciousness?  Well, consciousness IS the one of
those things that exists only in Plato's heaven.  Being a metaphysical
object, it obeys all kinds of rules and laws that we'll never know about
and that science can never truly understand, ya da ya da.  Of course,
skepticism probably isn't what this debate needs right now.  We know a
little about consciousness, don't we?  So let's just assume that you've
got some and I've got some and that if either of us died at this moment,
the dead one wouldn't have any.

Now, let's try to remember why we started thinking about this question in
the first place.  In fact, the question was essentially pragmatic/ethical:
If an identical copy of me existed, would it be OK if the copy died?
Would "I" continue living so long as one copy of me continues living?

Now, here, people have falsely applied Identity of Indiscernables to say
"Yes, definitely.  If the I.o.I. principle is true, then the two copies
are the same person."  Well, again, this requires us to assume that there
is a "person," a "consciousness" off in Plato's heaven, of which the two
copies are instances.  We have two instances, obviously, but so long as
they're both instances of the same person, it should be fine if one of
them dies.  The true form of you exists so long as one of your copies
exists.

Now, I'm going to make the big leap here.  Many of you will disagree.  But
here we go:

There is no true form of a person.  There is no Plato's heaven.

OK, where does this leave us?  This means that the two copies are two
identical people.  Since it's obviously a bad idea for a person to die,
we'd better not kill either copy, right?

Well, not necessarily.  It's a faulty ethical assumption to presume that
death is always a bad idea, particularly when the person dying doesn't
mind.  (Here's the libertarian in me showing through.  If you're into
deontology, you won't like this a bit.)  While it seems inherently unwise
for a person to kill themselves, I think it takes an even bigger leap than
I just made to presume that it is universally morally wrong for them to do
so.

I personally see no reason to kill myself, and would strongly advocate
against any of you trying this at home.  That being said, I can think of
reasons why a person might believe that their own interests would be best
served by their own deaths.  Under those circumstances, and presuming that
they don't trample on other peoples' rights in the process, such people
can and should be allowed to risk or even sacrifice their own lives for
whatever reasons they see fit.

This brings me back to the copies.  It seems not at all unreasonable that
the copies might be willing to die so that the other one would live.  We
see this all the time in parents willing to give their own lives for their
children. Indeed, by a simple extension of evolutionary psychology, we
should expect that the copies would be at least as willing to die for one
another as two siblings might be, if not more so.  I'd be inclined to
think that they'd be MUCH more willing to do so, since (at least for a
fraction of a second) they'd even satisfy the conditions for Identity of
Indiscernables: for a brief moment, they'd be identical *in every way*.

So I answer the question this way:  If the copies don't mind dying so long
as one of the other copies still lives (or so long as another copy can be
made,) then it's fine for them to do so.  If you make many such copies,
you'll have many people who place a low value on their lives individually
but great value on the permanence of at least one copy.  Ethically
speaking, if it's fine with them, it should be fine with us.

You might be asking yourself "Now, that's all good and well, but should
*I* be willing to die so long as one of my copies still lives?"  If
Plato's heaven doesn't exist, then this is a question which no one can
answer for you.  I don't think I'd mind.  You might.  If so, then there's
no arguing with you.  No one can tell you that you shouldn't mind, any
more than they can tell you that you shouldn't feel what you feel.

Flames welcome.

Yes.  Distributed HDTV wavelet compressed video, that accepts audio,

I can't say that I believe in the scenario of a Singularity as a collection of
individuals.  Goals converge at sufficiently high intelligence levels, just
like pictures of the truth.

What I'm pointing out is that there won't be "bottleneck" legacy systems.  If
old code is central, it will be redesigned.  Where does the vast excess of
computing power come from?  I'm assuming a constantly expanding pool.  In our
days, there really is a lot of inertia that derives from human nature, even
after all optimization is accounted for.  I do think things will be faster.

One interesting notion is that even if there's a completely unlimited amount
of computing power, aleph-null flops, the Singularity still might not be
autopotent.  The extent to which current computing power could be extended,
controlled, consolidated would still be finite.  There would be software
inertia even in the absence of hardware inertia, and there would still be hard
choices for optimization.  One would no longer conserve resources, or even
intelligence, but choices.

It's not until you start talking about time travel (which I think is at least
80% probable post-Singularity) that you get real "inertialess" systems.  I
cannot even begin to imagine what this might look like from the inside.  It is
incomprehensibility squared.

I think this confuses the disadvantages of human design with the disadvantages
of intelligent design in general.  Remember, evolved systems fail too.  Humans
go insane.  It's just a different kind of crash.  And, even using your
assumptions, I'd rather suffer a general protection fault and be rebooted from
backups by an exoself using up 1% of resources, than go insane while using 75%
of resources for redundant neural processors.

Are PSEs more likely to suffer from asteroid strikes or Y2K?  If every date in
the world ran through a single module, we wouldn't have this problem.  Yes, I
know we would have other problems, but the operative word is "we".

Five billion identical systems can fail in perfect synchronization.  Just
watch.  One solves this problem with robust architectures, not duplication of
weak architectures.

But they wouldn't be individuals - suppose Anders Sandburg has stripped from
him every algorithm he has in common with any other member of the human race,
and is given immersive perception and control of a fleem grobbler, one of the
five major independent fleem-grobbling systems.  Is he still Anders Sandburg? 
Go ask John K Clark.  (Eliezer Yudkowsky doesn't care.)

Maximizing output, minimizing chance of failure.  Running the PSB
(Post-Singularity Benchmark).  Simulating the complete expansion and collapse
of the Universe star by star.  Take your pick.

I'm not at all sure that evolution and singletons are compatible.  Evolution
relies on differential chances of survival, but with everything being
determined by intelligence, the human-understandable attributes like
"survival" might be determined.  Even if one concedes internal differences,
the externally observed behavior of every Singularity might be exactly the
same - expand in all directions at lightspeed, dive into a black hole.  So
there might not be room for differential inclusive reproductive success.

Internally, the evolution you propose has to occur in defiance of the
superintelligent way to do things, or act on properties the superintelligence
doesn't care about.  I'm not too sure about either.  Evolution is a very
powerful thing from our perspective - almost as powerful as human
intelligence, and far older and more cunning.  But we have no reason to
believe that it can walk all over SIs.

For humans, it sure is.  But...

"A programmer with a codic cortex - by analogy to our current visual cortex -
would be at a vast advantage in writing code.  Imagine trying to learn
geometry or mentally rotate a 3D object without a visual cortex; that's what
we do, when we write code without a module giving us an intuitive
understanding.  An AI would no more need a "programming language" than we need
a conscious knowledge of geometry or pixel manipulation to represent spatial
objects; the sentences of assembly code would be perceived directly - during
writing and during execution."
 -- From "Singularity Analysis", http://pobox.com/~sentience/sing_analysis.html

Who needs a Power to get a skrode?  The first programming AIs will likely be
that incomprehensible to us mere humans.  You know how much trouble it is to
get an AI to walk across a room?  Well, that's how hard it is for an AI to
teach a human to write code.

OO programming is there for a reason, and that reason is transforming the raw
environment of assembly language into "objects" and "behaviors" comprehensible
to our cognition.  But OO may make about as much sense to an AI, as repainting
the Earth in regular patterns and basic shapes that combine to form computer
programs would make to us.  Different ontologies, different rules.

It's possible. Grammar is not my strongest point so sometimes I don't write
well English. I honestly don't know if "switched positions" or "switched
position" is correct.

     >and perfect identity would require that they have an identical
     >position, no?

No. If changing position(s?) of objects has absolutely no detectable effect
on anything in the observable universe then the only possible conclusion is
that the objects are identical and that position is not an essential aspect
of identity. Otherwise the word "identity" becomes a meaningless string of
letters.

This hypothesis originates with Dr. Bill Calvin who suggests that the
reason a mother would want to hold a baby on the left side is because that
is where the heart is most audible.  Babies held on the left side tend to
be much quieter due to the heart sounds and he supposes that this would
make a right handed mother a more succesful hunter because the right hand
would be free when the baby is quiet.  He admits this is pure speculation
though and that the essay was initially written as a parody of the right
handed male warrior hypothesis (the shield is carried on the left side to
protect the heart) that is almost certainly untrue.  See his book "The
Throwing Madonna" http://weber.u.washington.edu/~wcalvin/bk2/bk2.htm for
further referrence.

I wasn't criticizing your grammer, only pointing out that
I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing.

I don't know that we can measure identity by changes
on other than what we discuss.  I might just as well
insist (I think) that the concept of instantaneously
switching positions is the one that is nonsensical.

deperation. how many attacked ancestors survived when one hemisphere was 
disabled by nimbly using the other ;-)

One idea that sounds reasonable to me is that by crossing the input and 
output, an organism with paired inputs (ears, lateral line sensors) will 
steer towards the signal (moving away increases the ouput of the near 
sensor and so steers back on track). 

One idea that i had is that all this follows from the fact that the eyes 
_don't_ cross over they just course directly back: left of left eye to 
left hemisphere etc. That has the unfortunate effect of representing the 
right visual field in the left hemisphere: all else follows from this.

        Whoa there.  Your post was great until this point.  As you say, the
two identical twins are indeed *two different humans* with the same genetic
makeup.  However, as soon as awareness (in any capacity) occurs, the
cognitive processes become --as John Clark said in his initial post--
slightly different than each other.  Therefore, to kill one would mean
killing a being that is not *identical* to the other.  However, the level
of consciousness of each twin *would* be almost identical to each other and
would ultimately mean killing a being that is conscious.  So truly, the
question of ethics surpasses the genetic feasibility...it becomes a
question of killing something that is conscious.  True, the level of
consciousness of a newborn (or two...four is right out!) would be nowhere
near as complex as a mature human, but it would be conscious nonetheless.
So the next question is this: how developed must the consciousness be
before the killing would be considered murder?

Goldberg is pretty explicit. He suggests that only men are lateralised on 
his task and has studied this in neuropsych populations. His idea is that 
the context-dependent left hemisphere/context-invariant  right hemisphere 
dichotomoy doesn't hold in grousp with two X chromosomes.

Will let you all know how a (modest size) study I am doing on this turns 
out.

Would this be expected to have any affect in cognitive styles between the
sexes? Or is this a structural difference with no, or little, functional
significance?

Do you have a referrence on this?  Calvin explicitly claims this hypothesis
as his own, both in his book and in person.  I talked with him at the

This is where PCP for motion and reversible computing come in. Personal
Construct Psychology and the repertory grid technique using The Ingrid

Your last sentence seems to contradict the one before as it is
determined by my linguistic parser to be a reason. I don't of course
agree with you. Do you see the SI as not coming from a (ek)human. I
don't because I'm chauvinistic. Please explain?

Nonetheless I'd prefer to believe in Voodoo and the law of the jungle if
I wanted to outsmart evolution, which is probably another contradiction.
Am I wrong in thinking that a parasite cannot nurture and support the
future growth of a system whilst the presently decaying specific members
rot? My knowledge of cellular biology isn't that good, but I'm sure I've
seen in the jungle a tree that had grown down across a stream an up the
other side with a parasitic vine supporting a new growth on the other
side with the tree part that was in the stream rotten away.

I hope so because I this is a good uploading tactic. Now with the
preceding analogy, 

I go into virtual reality 	(augmented with artificial consciousness ->
SI)
and come back into the world 	(the other side of the stream) 
after some disaster 		(rotten tree part in stream)
and repair it 			(new rooted growth of original tree). 

In the following open directory look at page05.gif (7c) and for the
bar-coded sketch diagram of the parasite at.

http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~income/ekus/page99.gif

As an aside, the reason why the present day elite can't see The Ingrid
Thought Processor in their plans is because I believe they are destined
to rot away. I, on the otherhand can see a parallel version of Ingrid
starting as early next year and extending the tree of life as I put the
rest to fate.

I'd design it so it had human level communication abilities to
collaborate on repair. Again I come back to radical constructivism and
PCP for motion.

This is my planned hibernation level but the sentences, I use, are
geometric manifolds in haptic space. If you can ever get hold of it,
read a book called The Blind Geometer.

Is the weather a program then? Is this referring to the AI using a
superposition of CAs mapped in such a way as to cause an hallucination,
or a gestalt of an altogether different thought pattern than what the
individual CA's function was at the time. Carrying that, it follows that
a predictable but unlikely set of quatrains, as in Nostradamus, etc.,
helps in achieving the AI's human level artificial consciousness. 

Are you suggesting that OO can be used at one level within the AI, but
that at a superposition of many OO, the AI was/is conscious and that
this consciousness or intelligence isn't artificial? Again I come back
to questioning the need for a global theoretic control and communication
function that needs to allow the designer to talk to the awakened AI. 

Sorry for the idiosyncratic language, and I don't blame you for not
understanding; - I'm just tossing out a germ of a redundant idea.

I think you misunderstood me there.  I was speaking at that point in the
post from the point of view of someone (Clark, perhaps?) who thinks that
killing one copy is perfectly fine during that instant where the two
copies are the same. 

I disagree with this evaluation.  If the copy doesn't want to die, then it
doesn't matter that it's perfectly identical to the other copy.  It
doesn't want to die, so killing it is bad.  If it DOES want to die, as we
might expect under some circumstances, then killing it is fine.

Actually, Beowulf is a set of Linux extensions that permit
disributed supercomputing of the traditional kind in which
the applicatons are specifically written to use the beowulf
infrastructure. It's very impressive in the traditional
supercomputing domain. There is another linux extension effort
that I find more interesting: Mosix. The Mosix extensions
allow a cluster to loadshare at the task level, without the
applications needing to know about the infrastructure. If all
the computers on the internet were running Mosix, in theory
any time a task was spawned or suspended anywhere, it could
migrate anywhere else to execute. In practice, task migration
decision algorithms are "non-trivial", so such a large Mosix would
certainly fail as the coordination bandwidth usage exceeds the
effective gain in CPU utilization. However, these algorithma
are amenable to optimization. The exciting current work is for
large locally-connected clusters, so less is being done for
internet-connected migration algorithms. We know that some
distributed algorithms work well even with very poor connectivity:
look at the Mersenne prime or DES cracking efforts. At the other
end of the scale, Some tasks have such a high intertask bandwidth
that it is essentially infeasible to run them in separate menories.

I'll try hard to restrain my genetically-mandated imperative as a parent
to immediately hassle you with gratuitous advice. :-) Instead, I'll
ask for some: What advice can I offer my kids about ethical behaviour?
I can't tell them to follow the golden rule because God told them to,
but I'm not really comfortable with "I've got mine, tough luck losers"
either. Mostly, we go with the concept that helping society as a whole
is worthwhile because we are going to have to live in it, So being good
citizens is appropriate in the same sense that not polluting is appropriate.

Other people's answers are appreciated, but I'd really like to hear fom Erin.

And then you go on to correctly describe exactly how the Identity of
Indiscernibles can determine if two objects are the same:
 "if you could Switch two objects and get a physical state indiscernable from
  the original state, then the objects must be identical."

I'm not sure what you're driving at here, if it's that they're identical but not
the same it's a distinction without consequences.

Who cares? It wouldn't matter how many objects there were or which one I had
if I couldn't discern the difference. And the things we value most are
not objects at all, they're attributes. If there are 2 green cubes
there may be two objects but there is only one "green", and only one
"2" and only one "cube". I don't need to conjure up Plato and there is nothing
metaphysical or mystical in this, it's just that not everything is a noun. The
wonderful thing about computers is that they work great with adjectives, they
can describe matter in great detail.


    >How does this relate to consciousness?


It makes my job even easier if I'm allowed to deal with more abstract stuff and
not just concrete objects. It doesn't matter if there are two identical brains
or only one because consciousness doesn't have a position in space. Looking for
consciousness in the brain is like looking for "fast" in the engine of a racing
car. I am not an object, I am not a noun, I am an adjective modifying matter, I
am the way matter behaves when it is organized in a Johnclarkian way. The
Johnclarkian way is vastly more complex than the "green" way or the "2" way, or
the "cube" way, and it's far rarer too, but it's a difference of degree not of kind.


     >it seems not at all unreasonable that the copies might be

It's just as reasonable (or unreasonable) that the original would be willing to
die so that the copy could live.

The trouble is that all would feel exactly the same way so everybody would kill

If there were 10 identical copies of me running in parallel and I had a machine
that would pick one copy at random to survive and at the same instant destroy
the other 9 copies then I wouldn't mind pushing the button. The other 9 John
Clarks would of course have exactly the same opinion.

When I was a 7th grade teacher in South Texas several years ago, I
introduced the cryonics idea though reading/writing exercises.
There were a few kids who thought they might go for the idea (maybe
5%).
Perhaps if an idea like the inevitability of death, and even that
under many circumstances, death is right, runs around in the human
brain for a long time, it becomes indelible. And so therefore the hard
road that cryonics and tranhumanism must face.

It occurs to me that my opinion of this thread is exactly the same as my
opinion of the Kiersey sorter thread--gross generalizations being made on
very little data, with no real practical end result.

I just came back from a visit to New York with Harry Hawk and Perry Metzger,
and thinking over our conversation, it wouldn't have been much different if
I had a male gender.  I am just as rational, just as IQ'd, just as capable
of comprehending math, science, and philosophy as they are, and they were
smart enough to realize that.  My advice--stop wasting your time feeding
into the social myth of gender intelligence differences and start
interacting with more intellectual women.  In the long run, you will gain
more benefits.  You might even learn something.

:)

Take care,

The distinction is tricky to understand; it stems from the fact that in
English our adjectives "same" and "identical" don't change when they're
referring to two identical objects or one object identical to itself.  I'm
saying that two objects are "identical" if they are indiscernable.  On the
other hand, two objects, no matter how identical, are two objects, not
one.  The difference between two objects and one object IS discernable,
and since it is, I won't be mistaking two green cubes for one Green Cube.

It certainly does matter HOW MANY you have, though not WHICH you have.  If
you had a million indiscernable dollars sitting in a computerized bank
account, would you be happy giving me $999,999 of them so long as you
still had one?  I should hope not.  On the other hand, I don't think
either you or I would give a fig either way about which dollar you kept;
they're all the same, you know.

This is what I meant by Plato's heaven.  Just like how Platonic
philosophers imagine that there is a pure form of green which exists apart
from the green things, so must there be a "cube" separate from our cubes
and a "2" separate from our pair.  Where is this one "green" of which you
speak?  Where is the "two?"  Can you show it to me?  Can you point at it? 
Can it be demonstrated by experiment?  If not, how do you know it exists?
:)

Joviality aside, we could define the One True Green to be the set of all
green things.  In this case, so long as there is a green thing, the Green
still exists.  I presume that this is how you're defining your
consciousness: so long as there is a "John Clark"ness out there, you're
still conscious, where the "John Clark"ness is the set of all matter which
is organized in a Johnclarkian way.

But is your consciousness actually correlated with the set of all things
Johnclarkian?  Or is your consciousness attached to your current
instantiation?  If I've got two green cubes, and smash one, what happens
to the second cube's greenness?  If the second cube's greenness is simply
the Green, defined above, then there is a little less Green in the world.
On the other hand, if greenness is tied up in the cube, then smashing one
cube's greenness will destroy the greenness contained within.  Similarly,
engines are fast, but if I destroy the engine, it will lose its speed. 

I happen to think that there is no such thing as a Green; that's what I
meant by the non-existence of Plato's heaven.

Anyway, this matters not a bit, because the act of destroying one copy and
not the other will break the identity.  If I shoot one in the chest, that
one will suffer a sucking chest wound; this person is now different from
the other one who is still healthy.  Therefore, we can't use the fact that
the two copies were once so close as to satisfy IoI to justify the death
of one of them, particularly if the copy doesn't want to die.

The question as to whether your consciousness resides in the set of all
things organized in a "you" way or whether other yous would have
individual consciousnesses is irrelevant to the ethical/pragmatic question
of whether it would be OK for a copy to die.  The answer is still "only if
the copies think it's OK."

Don't be silly.  I'm talking about something like the random number
generator you discuss below, or, more realistically, all the copies
risking their lives so that at least one copy might live.  If me and a
half-dozen of my copies were facing a man armed with 6 bullets... etc.

Of course they would.  But that's a personal choice that you'd be making,
not based on necessary and inviolable physical principles.

The problem of video compression is primarily numerics-limited, there
is nothing an OS can change here. The latency and bandwidth of the
Internet is so bad that the OS overhead is invisible. As to parallel
DSP boxes, for that particular application you don't need an OS at
all, or a very skeletal one. There is a number of minimal DSP OSSes 
out there, particularly for TI's chips. It is not very hard writing
these. 

Btw, a related idea: a few days ago some friends of mine asked me
whether a modern video accelerator could be useful for neural DSP (as
you know, you could use several in a PCI system). I am aware that 
next-generation video chips will feature VLIW DSPs with
multiple GOPs, but do _current_ video accelerators qualify? I had the
impression that these things were pretty special-purpose...

Of course they are two different objects, but their state is the
same. As to question of consciousness, only rabid Penrosians would
claim that fine structure of quantum levels is of any relevance
here. Indistinguishability of two objects in the same state is 
merely a convenient, rigorous argument against doubting thomases who
disagree on general principles. Since the brain is a very noisy 
system any talk about quantum levels is entirely ridiculous. 
Furthermore the Hamiltonian of neural dynamics (atomic 'clock' 
roughly 1 ms, psychological clock about 100 ms) is strongly 
divergent: the system is very chaotic. Cloned objects bifurcate 
instantly.

We're talking so glibly about making an instant copy of a macroscopic 
object without disturbing the state of it. If you do so passively, you
need infinite (and I mean it) time spans, if you do it actively you turn
the object into a nice ball of hot quark-gluon plasma, or a cloud of
logics. In any case will the original object be destroyed. But of 
course you can make several copies, albeit far from being in the 
same state. So their initial positions in state space are distinct, 
their inputs are different, and as you can't freeze time at a given
frame these objects start to diverge while they are being constructed,
and watch my mouth run.

Let's talk about minds instead. You can't clone the physical structure for
above reasons, but you could do a

1. gradual upload 
1.1 destructive
1.2 nondestructive
2. destructive post-mortem upload

A destructive gradual upload a la Moravec starts with one system, and
ends with one system. It is not cloning, but incremental migration of
cognition to a neosubstrate. Nondestructive upload permeates your
brain with a hires grid of probes, nanocomputers, communication and
energetic infrastructure, making it swell to twice or thrice its
original volume, and consume kWs and rivers of coolant. You use all
this apparatus to observe your mind spatiotemporal dynamics for a long
time, creating a computational model from it (it's much harder if you
have to do it hands-off, i.e. passively). After that, you reverse
the monstrous nanooedema, refill the liquor, close the skull, skalp,
regrow your hair (optional, in some people). Even if you manage to 
maintain identical sensory input (nice trick, that) because of 
simulation inaccuracies and intrinsic system noise the systems 
will have bifurcated almost instantly. Destructive post-mortem 
upload makes a molecular map of your vitrified cerebrum, destroying 
it in the process -- so it's not cloning minds either.

The only area where talking about minds in the same state is
meaningful is when all of them are discrete deterministic 
simulation under our control. You can control their initial 
state, their input, and page back and forth along its trajectory. 
You're God, in short. (Dull job, but somebody has to do it). 

The difficult questions begin here where you want to prove that 
two systems encoded differently are very similiar, or nearly 
identical (of course 'identical' is the unattainable limit 
of 'similiar'). You can't compare the person pattern, it's not
identical since in a different encoding. And because of that you 
also can't simply compare the dumped trajectory. Furthermore, 
even if the systems differ infinitesimally (less than two 
alternative universes with two 'gene's differing in a single 
neuron), they diverge progressively. Panta rhei. The only way 
how one can establish that, would seem to make a lot of reruns
a la amnesiastic Groundhog Day, starting with the same state, 
but varying input and statistically analyzing output.

Actually, the latter problem is not academical: you have to solve a
similiar task when you start with an upload at some low level (MD,
compartmental model, whatever) obtained from your molecular resolution
map and want to encode it more compactly/efficiently for a given 
hardware while assuring equivalency. Of course you can circumvent 
the metaphysics of it by substituting blocks incrementally in the 
course of the emulation. If the patient doesn't mind...

  Identical in parallel


I have a thought experiment along theses lines which I would Like input on

     If I appear in a room with an identical of me in a perfectly symmetrical room in a
perfectly symmetrical situation, what can I do to label myself as different?  i.e. how
long will I stay in parallel when are minds are no longer connected as one.

 At the recent Cato conference, Brin was on a panel with Vinge and Benford.
Brin said that all three were members of the Libertarian party, but that
"some of us would be purged" if the party were more organized.

 David Friedman commented that everybody would be purged if the party

 It isn't silly to ignore sources of information whose value is uncertain,
but it is silly to confidently reject an argument you haven't listened to,
rather than admit to some doubt.

 It's running on a 180 mhz pentium with bandwidth that is probably above
average. It may be moved to a better machine soon. The biggest problems are
that Perl is slow for what it tries to do, and there are probably some
unidentified inefficencies in how it handles network i/o. Nobody has
volunteered to do much work in these areas.

 To the extent I understand what you are saying, I can't see any similarity
between Drexler's beliefs and the beliefs you are attacking. Possibly Merkle
oversimplifies too much when dealing with people who ask the usual half-baked
questions, but when responding to thoughfull questions I think he is more
skeptical about those issues than you imply.

 I suspect you misunderstand Drexler precisely because most of his
communication is via media you find less accesible than the web. (Most
of what I know of his arguments comes mainly from Nanosystems and from
hearing him in person).

 A ridiculous claim. It isn't very succesfull as a science, but there are

 Engineering time forecasts are routinely made for incompletely specified
blueprints, and are often of some help in resolving policy disputes.

 One of the many reasons that nobody has provided a detailed blueprint is
that we don't have systems powerfull enough to adequately simulate them yet.

 I'm not sure what kind of theory you are asking for. I am fairly confident
that for any given feature that an assembler would require, a conservative
design can be found such that most chemists would say (without feeling a need
for simulation) that it would probably work if built. I think Drexler has
produced some clear reasons for suspecting his ideas, or something more
powerfull, will eventually be built. I think the biggest uncertainty comes
from the shortage of good tools for bootstrapping the construction of such
features, and that many people are underestimating the progess that has
been made recently on such tools.
 I think a handfull of people (possibly Drexler, probably someone at Zyvex)
have moderately clear guesses about what engineering steps will be taken when.
Unfortunately, I haven't seen those guesses published anywhere.

> Which does not mean that it is impossible -- simply

 That is a conclusion that Drexler and I would be glad for most people
to adopt. The belief that it can't possibly happen in the next 20 years
is potentially quite dangerous. Uncertainty poses much fewer risks.

>Please, let's stop this nonconstructive discussion, and let's go back to

 My responses are often slow because I give them lower priority than working
on molecular modelling software, but if discussions like these raise doubts
among people who were previously confident that they could postpone worrying
about the effects of nanotech, they can have very constructive effects on
how prepared people are.

 I hope the phrase "Generic Saviour" is intended to be sarcastic, but I
think it is dangerous to make claims that could be interpreted as
encouraging complacency about the effects of nanotech.

The following are a few comments on quantum computing which I thought
might be of some interest to members of these lists.


Hardware

A large number of proposals have been made.  Several of the proposals are
merely for quantum logic, and do not satisfactorily discuss some of the
other big issues: (a) state preparation; (b) readout of the
result; (c) scalability of the architecture.  

There is no architecture known which satisfactorily addresses all of these
issues.  Several candidates are under investigation.  Many researchers
believe that solid state rather than optical approches are the correct
path to take, because of human experience in scaling solid state systems.
Unfortunately, historically, nearly all our experience in manipulating
single quantum systems has involved photons (and that only for 20-30
years).

In practice, what this means is that solid state approaches which may
eventually prove viable will take a lot of work to get to the same levels
of control as we can now see with atom-optical systems.  The hope is that
once they get to that level of control they will prove to be much more
scalable.

Most of the progress in hardware over the past couple of years has been
based upon Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR).  While fine for small scale
demonstrations, it is extremely unlikely that NMR will scale up at a later
date, without several major revolutions in NMR.

In short, there is certainly no cure-all on the horizon, however I am
pleased by the fact that many of the requisite properties can be found in
existing systems, albeit _different_ systems.



Algorithms

Our understanding of algorithms is still pretty limited.  Broadly
speaking, two classes of algorithms are known.

The first is algorithms based upon finding the stabilizer of an
Abelian group.  Applications include the factoring and discrete log
problems, which enable several well-known cryptosystems to be broken.
These algorithms provide a spectacular exponential speed-up.

The second class is algorithms based upon a "search" heuristic.  These
algorithms provide a quadratic speedup to essentially any algorithm based
upon an unstructured sort, and to some algorithms based upon a more
structured sort.

A third "class" of algorithms is for doing quantum simulation.  I don't
think anybody doubts that quantum computers will be good at simulating
quantum systems, however it is not yet quite clear what _precisely_ they
will be used to do.

Still, four years after Shor announced quantum factoring, that's a
respectable list.  It should not be surprising that we find it a lot more
difficult to think up quantum algorithms than classical, given the domain
in which we develop our intuition.


Limits

As in the classical case, there is very little known about limits to
quantum computation.  Most of the bounds known are proved in "oracle"
models of computation, which are of dubious value.  Essentially, what
these bounds tell you is that it is no good trying to solve a
problem in a certain specific way.  They do not rule out other approaches
to the problem.  There is, however, an impressively large amount known
about bounds in the oracle model, which is useful for people trying to
develop algorithms.

As to the power of quantum computers in the general model, it is very
much an open question.  The class BQP of problems efficiently soluble on a
quantum computer is not known to have an especially clean relation to any
class in classical complexity theory.  We do know that BQP is contained
within PSPACE, the class of problems soluble in polynomial _space_ on a
classical computer, but not many other non-trivial results are known.

In fact, more to the point, we don't even have a very good idea of what
makes quantum computers powerful.  Is it entanglement?  Superposition?
The large size of Hilbert space?  All of the above?



In my opinion, one of the most interesting open problems is to investigate
models of computation which go beyond the standard quantum computing
model.  Does general relativity buy you anything?  What about quantum
field theories?  String theory?   These are, by and large, open questions.

If you consider yourself as a human brain, the answer is forever,
because the situations are perfectly symetrical, you will have to be
both in two totally identical parrallel universes.

Are you saying that evolution doesn't exist post Singularity, then? Can you
back up that claim?

Let's say there is a provably optimal simple 'omega' hardware, which gives
you very little choice about how your 'code' (information patterns,
actually) at the deepest level will look like. The resulting substrate
supports a virtual ecology, starting with most primitive
autoreplicators a la Langdon loops, hardly more than our 
analogons of viroids (offspring of those designed or emerged 
spontaneously) and ending with godlike intelligences. Population 
pressure causes this substrate to expand, gobbling up the material 
realm and spitting out molecular circuitry blocks, instantly 
claimed by the duplicated virtual beasties. The sources of diversity
are both rational design and darwinian evolution. Both support
some conservation (legacy), as well as novelty due to coevolution 
concurrence (very much novelty in a Red Queen fitness landcape) 
but why should it be a bottleneck?

 > computing power come from?  I'm assuming a constantly expanding pool.  In our

Once you have your omega hardware (probably a kind of quantum dot
array) design, which should be very early along the Singularity, the 
expansion rate of the pool is limited by the conversion rate 
of the material realm into circuitry, and the amount of 
matter available. Once you've converted and rearranged things 
optimally, further influx of substrate stops, unless you can shrug 
off physics as we know it and can make spacetime compute on its own. 
Signalling in a relativistic universe in a darwinian context limits 
you to relatively compact system anyway: the maximal grain size will 
thus be likely limited. You can hardly afford waiting to listen for 
tidings from locations lightminutes apart, while the local clock 
ticks at nanosecond and picosecond scale. Frozen statues don't take
well to erosion and bulldozers.

I disagree. The way I see it, we will hit the computational limits set
by physics very quickly, and after that will simply engage in virtual
navelgazing/open-ended evolution. I don't buy Moravec's recurring
evolution shockwaves rewriting the laws of physics, as they are 
unfalsifyable using current knowledge. It may take a short while to evolve
nanoautoreplicators capable of following hard at the edge of the light
cone, but afterwards it's all plain sailing. Of course it can be that
traversable wormholes are buildable, but resources required are likely
to be so large that the second graduation night might be a few MYrs off.

If you have to resort to Planck energies for spacetime engineering,
you might have to build a particle accelerator around the galaxy. It 
takes a while before you can assemble such a structure, and before 
it can pick up enough steam to do something interesting, like blasting
a designer hole into spacetime.

Of course a fair fraction of these failures is due to the mutations,
without which evolutionary optimization would be impossible. Another
is a trade-off between optimizing forever and having to react as
quickly as possible. Red in tooth and claw doesn't breed perfect
systems, but robust ones. Any comparisons with products of human
engineering and what evolution came up are ridiculous. I'm still
wondering why so many people, programmers particularly, trust man-made
brittle systems. In biological systems, almost every component is
mission-critical (there goes that liver). A truly technological 
civilization based on current designs would go extinct overnight. 
Software glitches in a Brazil world? Urgh.

Would you rather want to ward off several quick (well, quicker than
you) evolved systems BSOD'ing you with bug-exploiting nam-shubs? 
I'd say you'd lose, and the resources used up by you, by your exoself 
and your backups will be reclaimed by the victor meanies. If you rely 
on shared blocks, attacking that location would result in a vast 
payoff to the attacker. Why, suddenly it's not crowded anymore?

If there was a bug in that module, all of you would go
extinct. Descendants of any systems with a local nonfaulty 
module will happily take your place. No more brittle resource 
sharing anymore. 

Biological beings use internal clocks, synchronized by external
cycles. They only go awry when exposed to conditions (usually,
man-made) they are not meant to, and even then the results are 
usually not fatal. Better jetlagged than dead, thankyouverymuch.

Suppose Anders Sandberg has stripped from him every physical structure
he has in common with any other member of the human race, and is given
immersive perception and control of a Microsoft Visual Basic compiler, one
of the five major independant Microsoft compilers, instead. Is he still Anders
Sandberg?

So far we have not observed any Singularity or distant signatures
thereof. What makes you think you can predict details of any such 
event?

Well, you are intelligent. Are you in control of other intelligences?
Particularly these dumb, lowly things like bacteria, viruses, flies,
dust mites, ants, cockroaches, silverfish, pets, cars, ships, sealing 
wax? Humankind have not spontaneously mutated into homogenous monocultured
Eliezers set into nice rows, why should a virtual ecology do that? In
case you build such a strange thing, due to a chance some part of some
clone somewhere might grow frisky, and rushes over the civilization
monoculture like a brush fire. It's instable as hell, the thing.

You said a Power would have noticed, but skrodes were built either by
the Blight or the Countermeasure (it's not clear by which), which both
ate normal Powers for breakfast. A Blight from a distance didn't look
particularly singular to a Power, and a lot of Powers meddled with the
lower zones. The hidden functionality of the skrode/its rider complex
may well have exceeded a casual scrutiny of a Power. All they'd see
would be a yet another Power artefact.

A task you have a knack of, and doing for a long time changes you. You
sprout representational systems as you grow better and better. A
tabula rasa AI which was not designed to do machine language would
learn anything the hard way as well, exactly as a human. Of course if
it was more intelligent than a human it would grow much better than
that.

Thank you, GP comes up with plenty of compact, efficient, opaque
solutions humans have no idea of how they work. If you ask a person to
write a word-recognition circuit, he'll certainly will not build a 100
FPGA-cell large conundrum consisting of a mesh of autofeedbacked loops
exploiting the undocumented analog effects of the bare silicon.

OO mirrors our physical world very much: independant objects interact
with lots of others via asynchronous messages. Many simulations are
made much more elegant this way. I think OOP is deeper than a mere

This thread has been curious to read, as it is full of fact and falsity!
And, begs for female defense which I shall not even consider!

Joe E. Dees states: "Multiple connectionist schema within the 
cybernetic upload site might be required to accommodate the 
possibly distinct neural network patterns underlying these cognitively 
stylistic differences (verbal/aural vs. visual/spatial being the most 
documented and notable).  Comment ca vu?"

As I have posted so many times on this list and discussed until raw, there
are many theories about the cognitive differences in the male and female.

All I can know with certainty is what I experience first hand from
communications with both genders and the different cognitive abilities
expressed in relation to the environment and circumstances.  In other
words, when push comes to shove, the male and the female both use cognitive
skills theoretical non-gender-distinct when the occasion arises. Both
genders use theoretical non-gender-distinct cognitive skills when the need
arises.  And, for the more competitive males and females, the theoretical
non-gender-distinct cognitive skills are used for advantage.

Studies evidence that more and more females are excelling at mathematics
and the sciences.  Is this due to a gender cross-over, or social change?
>From my experience (again my own experience is what gives me any crumbs of
wisdom that I can claim), with a documentary-eye and brief experience
teaching, females are given more encouragement and taking more opportunity. 

Timothy Bates gives excellent reference to studies after Damien's "What?
*What????*  WHAAAAH" serenade that I even found my self humming while
reading along.  Michael reveals with his own documentary-eye by discussing
personality type and environmental situation and gender conditioning.
(Skiing didn't come easy to me, as I fell down quite a bit and swore like a
fishwife.  However, after much practice, I became a skilled skier.)

Ander's "No need for blue and pink uploading helmets" just might be the
summation we are looking for when considering how radically our gender-mix
will change our capability to think, and will no doubt change some
culturally pre-destined assumptions about thinking.

Does anybody know Prof. Hank Dietz (pplinux@ecn.purdue.edu)? See:

   http://yara.ecn.purdue.edu/~pplinux/ 

Maybe he could suggest how to make the crit database architecture 
extend to frame-level HDTV time-code?  We could use Netscape 
browsers in the flat panel displays, with accelerated windowed 
scaling for the video frames.  Also, VRML hardware acceleration 
(Open GL, *not* Direct3D) could be included.  The wireless 
router/proxy programming could improve latency issues.

IMHO, there's only one really significant psychological gender difference,
namely "assertiveness". Due to evolutionary circumstance women are
*generally* less aggressive and individualistic than men. That's why they
are treated as second rate citizens in virtually every country of the world. 
Assuming that this theory is correct, hormone treatments for all female 
fetuses and (later on) genetic engineering should pretty much solve the 
problem. The potential is there, it just needs to be seized. Once again,
technology is the equalizer.

You did at least part of that thing, right?

I think the bottleneck is not the Perl code, but that the database is
in a single location. As Foresight is supposed to go transatlantic, it
might make sense to clone that system somewhere in Europe, synching
the database with a daily mirror, dispatching queries according to
requester's domain. Since the stuff is in perl, much easier even 
would seem to ask academic servers all over the world to volunteer 
resources. If one could solve the database joining and distribution 
Crit would become much more usable. As a quick fix, you can use the 
current server as a master radiating changes to slaves elsewhere.

(I realize I should be volunteering to fix it instead of just whining,
but my slow days are rapidly coming to an end...)

I am _far_ from attacking Drexler (who is a remarkably clear 
thinker and an impressive speaker) and Merkle (who is continuing 
to contribute a stream of amazing papers to the field), but rather 
the dark halo of 'nanoists'. As rapidly as the field moves lately 
(why, even that laggard Krautland is sprouting nanotechnology 
centers like mushrooms), the R&D impetus is likely to spill 
out into the mainstream, and thus into hands of ruthless and/or 
ignorant corporate and mad tinkerer types. A fair fraction of 
them don't see the technology's true potential (or, rather see 
it too clearly). Playing the constant Kassandra may enhance the
awareness of the general public a bit.

As I said, Drexler et al. is impeccable. I've only had the pleasure of 
talking to him recently, but my copy of Nanosystems is _very_ tattered;) 
I can only hope that my next engagement will offer the opportunity to
dive into academic science magazines, foremost 'Nanotechnology'. 
Actually, there are very decent NT information on the web, not only 
by the Foresight Institute and on nano.xerox.com and merkle.com, but 
web published stuff done by mainstream researchers as well.

Yes, but not a priori. Accuracy of predictions goes down dramatically
the farther they reach in the future, particularly during the time of
rapid developments deemed to form the outskirts of the
Singularity. Technology predictions over the course of the next 30
years might have been 100% accurate during early bronze, difficult
during the times of James Watt, and very much snake oil today. 
Unexpected things happen all the time.

True, but these are done in a narrow context, and are of very limited 
temporal depth. Estimating the duration and costs for the next Boeing
model is vastly different from saying which new semiconductor litho 
processes will be available in a decade. Whatever happened to all that
GaAs predicted? Why did parallel systems take so long to catch on? Why
are we still doing comfortable UV instead of synchrotrone light sources?

This is not not quite true. One of the chief advantages of
machine-phase systems is that very little flexibility is present, 
and the trajectories are simple (they are machines, right?), and 
well-defined. It should be perfectly possible to run a sensible 
MD run of such a system up to a few million atoms large, using a 
parallel supercomputer or a commodity component cluster for the 
costs of a high-end workstation. The same is true of the 
mechanosynthetic processes occuring at the tip, which can be 
approximated by doing QM of small clusters. All this is not 
exactly rocket science, a single person with sufficient resources
could validate such a design, or at least individual parts of it, 
in less than a year.

I happen to be a chemist (perhaps not a good one), but I would not
believe any chemist stating such claims. Chemistry is more art than a
science, and operates in the solvated domain. For instance, a chemist
will say that cumulenes polymerize to product with the structure x at
conditions y by the mechanism z. Finis. What I'd like instead, is that 
someone physisorbs, say, butatriene on HOPG and pokes it with a STM 
tip a bit, to see whether the graphite would open up and you could
attach an end to it. At the same time, somebody else should see
whether a cumulene strand extruded from a fluorine-terminated carbon
nanotube kinked against a surface would do in a QM simulation,
estimating the biradical character and its orientation vs. inner
graphite surface would do. Estimations about whether one could use 
that mechanosynthetic process for deposition of a low-defect carbon 
nanotube should follow, best validated by an experiment. Then one
would use the control precision estimate from an MD of the entire
motion controller structure, and gauge the defect rate, and its 
impact on rigidity in the context of a clone sequence. If it all
looks good, you color all parts of the preliminary assembler structure
green, and either attempt to get rid of the uncoloured ones by 
a redesign, or attempt to think up another ms reaction which 
could deposit that. Reiterate that for that any reaction that
follows. Integrate all the changes into the final design, and 
publish a thorough analysis of it. Whew.

If you do something like that, you can be certain that a lot of 
people start listening damn closely. Even if that particular design
never flies, people will see the basic logic and also implications,
and after one year ten thousands of new researchers will flock to the
field.

A lot of progress is hampered by the absence of cheap computing power
and adequate software. Drexler is still using Cerius2, which is not
that bad, but it is no open source, and _very_ expensive, limits 
you to SGI boxes forcrunch, with low parallelism and a terrible 
price/performance ratio. Lab robotics and combinatorial chemistry 
is doing great, and SPM nanorobotics is doing fantastic, particularly 
since carbon nanotubes have proven to be so rich both structurally and
functionally. Molecular biology flies on, but the protein folding 
problem is unsolved. Macromolecular chemistry is doing well, as do 
a large number of other fields. Taken together, they form an
impressive resource. 

But all this does not say anything about whether the whole
autoreplicators-by-means-mechanosynthesis idea is sound. And if you're
not looking at these fields from that angle, you don't see anything
dramatic happening. You need a certain point of observation to realize
that all the dots around you show a blue shift.

No, 'Generic Saviour' is meant more about the lines of the 2nd Coming,

I'm still looking for a really good definition of what a singleton 
is (maybe I will finally have time to finish that paper this 
Christman holiday?). However, I can say this about the concept I had 
in mind:

1. It does not imply a unity of mind. The singleton could have one 
unitary mind, or it could contain lots of independent minds (e.g. 
human minds).

2. It has more to do with global efficiency. Robin Hanson's paper 
about burning the cosmic commons in a Darwinian race to colonize 
space depicts a scenario that is not compatible with the singleton 
hypothesis since it would be globally wasteful.

3. You may ask, efficient for what? On this the singleton hypothesis 
is silent. One can imagine any of a large number of global goals 
either of which could be adopted by a singleton (e.g. the goal to 
allow humans and posthumans to freely persue their goals without 
being coerced.) 


And finally, why bother about what happens after the singularity (if 
indeed there will be one)? Eliezer thinks that it can take care of 
itself. Well, I think that for all we know, several different 
post-singularity paths may be possible, and which one will actually 
be real might depend on human choices between today and the final 
moments before the singularity. We therefore want to understand what 
the possibilities are so we can try to bring about the one we like 
best.

At this most basic level, complexity or growth in compexity does 
certainly not seem to be the most likely or natural situation. But 
since it's boring (for the human psychology) we change the parameters 
until we get something interesting. I makes me wonder if we may not 
be prone to overestimate the likelihood that the far future will be 
complex.

With aleph-null flops, the whole consolidation process could be 
completed in an arbitrarily short time, just by cranking up the 
clockspeed of everything, including yourself. Consolidate one 
millimeter in the first second, another in the next half second and 
so on. Within two seconds you could have consolidated all of infinity 
if you do it right. 

Of course, measured in subjective time the process could take quite 
long, unless you find a way to complete it "automatically", i.e. 
without sentient guidence along the way. (Without sentience, I 
suppose there would be no subjective time.)

Just going from memory re the content of this paper, but this is, I

Previc FH.(1991) A general theory concerning the prenatal origins of 
cerebral lateralisation in humans. Psychological Review.98:299-334.

I don't believe it. There seems to be a consensus, however, that the 
origins of which side got chosen to be the left/language/generative 
grammar side are probably incidental to _some_  artifact of this nature. 
Doesn't really matter too much, I suspect. The big thing is that the 
world is constructed as generative objects on the left and as synthetic 
spatial maps on the right.

After reading through your whole post, I believe that we are operating on
drastically different and mutually incompatible assumptions about
post-Singularity environments.  To try and identify both ontological and
surface assumptions:

Eugene Leitl:
1.  Singularity contains multiple competing entities, with conflicting goals;
not only with actions intended to reverse another action, but possibly
entities trying to destroy or consume another entity.  AFUTD competition.
2.  Evolution is the best way to create a robust, efficient process in the
vast majority of cases; improvements on evolution (if any) will result in the
same stereotypical properties being exhibited by the evolved processes.
3.  Intelligent design is inherently fragile in that the failure (or
exploitation) of any part destroys the whole; this is a universal problem at
all levels of intelligence.

Eliezer Yudkowsky:
1.  Morality is contained within an objective (physical? unalterable?)
ontology.  Goal values post-Singularity converge to the objective values.  No competition.
2.  Evolution is the best way to do something without intelligence, and
consists of a moderately intelligent way to use blind search.  SIs can walk
all over evolution.  (Please see below before responding.)
3.  Human design is inherently fragile in that it tends to linear chains and
lack of fault-tolerance and no local optimization.  This is due to lack of
attention, no parallelism (all attention focused on only one object), and low
speed.  SIs and seed AIs don't share the problem.

> Once you have your omega hardware (probably a kind of quantum dot
> array) design, which should be very early along the Singularity, the

See, I don't trust "quantum dot array".  Before the '90s, we would have given
a different answer.  In ten years, we'll have another answer.  Similarly, I
don't buy the Singularity using nanotechnology; it's a wonderful method by our
standards, but a few decades ago we would have seen Dyson-sized collections of
miniaturized vacuum tubes.  "Descriptor theory" a la Greg Bear or "wormhole
computing" I might buy, on the theory that it won't sound obsolete until we
actually know how to do it.

...and a 95% probability, given time travel, that it can be done (for
millisec. times) using micron-scale machinery.

The worse for evolution.  Would you agree with these statements?

1.  Evolution can be improved by the injection of intelligent selection.
2.  Evolution can be improved by occasional global redesigns of locally
optimized competitors being reinjected into the pool.
3.  Evolution as presently carried out does not involve intelligent design,
either within the process, or as the origin of evolution.  (Theists disagree.)
4.  Evolution consists of using a vast number of random tries and multiple
generations of selection and recombination.
5.  Evolution is a blind search, or at least the basic units are blind.
6.  Insofar as evolution has no option but to be blind, there is no reason to
think that blindness is optional.
7.  As the search depth narrows, global redesign and intelligent mutation
predominate over local optimization and random mutation.
8.  The evolution of evolution converges to an intelligent, global design with
intelligent tweaks and intelligent tests.  If massive randomness is absolutely
necessary, it can be used selectively.

What makes you think you can predict the internal software design?  Sheer
hubris, just like me.  But that's not what I was saying.

Sometimes there's such a flagrant local and global optimum that all processes
converge there, whether that optimum be "expand at C" or "dive into black
hole".  I don't have to know where the optimum is to hypothesize that the
optimum exists.  With respect to the Singularity, it is unlikely that the two
best mutually exclusive methods of harvesting flops (the two above being a
good example) will produce roughly the same order of results; therefore all
Singularities choose the same option.  You might disagree on the grounds that
an immune-type competition might promote the value of "difference", as such,
regardless of the actual change.

Incorrect.  The personal processing power I control is insignificant compared
to that necessary to run a simulation of Earth's evolutionary processes.

You're right, particularly given that Eliezers are not intelligent.

Let me see if I understand.  Translating to my assumptions:
"Given any acceptance whatsoever of hardware or software error, stemming from
meteors, eganite flux, or intelligent-efficient programming, and given a
sufficiently large playing field such as 1e30 flops, pure error will
eventually produce a voracious subprocess.  There must therefore be internal
defenses against that subprocess.  The additional possibility of mutations in
the defenses causes the field as a whole to converge to TIERRA."

I disagree on the grounds that the maximum complexity of mutated attack forms
increases as the log of computing power, so the necessary defense also
increases as the log of computing power; thus internal defense will not be a
serious problem in the absence of deliberate attack (in which I do not believe).

It's an interesting question whether 1e70 flops can hide something from 1e40
flops in a design that takes up 1e9 bytes.  My guess is no.  The Blight has to
hide the flaw, and then hide the fact that it's hiding the flaw.  Maybe you
can get a Power to "skip over" the problem section by exploiting common flaws
in the nonconscious first-level parsers, but can you do it without a
characteristic pattern that would trigger an alarm?  Remember, any density or
incomprehensibility over and above what the Power can understand - a part of
the design that's opaque - would itself probably trigger an alarm.  "Golly,
this is the first one-gigabyte program I haven't been able to understand in
twenty decillion subjective years!"  One would have to convey the illusion of
transparency, and I really don't think that's possible unless some parts don't
get fully analyzed, i.e. unless the Power is willing to accept opaqueness as
normal because it would take too much computing power to go beyond it.

On the other hand, there is absolutely no way I can prove it, and Vinge had
Countermeasure hiding *inside* the Blight during the initial Transcendence, so
it's obvious that in AFUTD's Universe the assumptions are different.

You've just proved that compilers don't exist.
Oh, wait - "was not designed to do machine language".  But how would you get
an AI in the first place if it couldn't bootstrap itself?  And presumably
"more intelligent" includes a larger short-term memory or inherent searching
capabilities, even if its actual creativity is nil?  As far as I can tell, a
"tabula rasa AI" nonexists.

Yes, GP is another good example which shows the shortcomings of human
"intelligent" design.  Extending the analogy between visual cortex and codic
cortex to a load-supporting arch, we might say that human designs are Legos -
bright, monocolor, blocky structures with a global design but local fragility.
 GP creates an upside-down arch made from wood splinters packed tightly
together with a swirling texture; it's as beautiful as a rose, and any given
section is a lot stronger than the human Legos, but it's still upside-down. 
Actual intelligent design is nanotech; every atom is in a locally and globally
optimized design.

It is.  It goes right down into human cognitive structures.

I expect that it will be complex.  Complexity is thermodynamically 
favorable - it's simplicity that's hard.

In the wild speculation department, I wonder if part of the reason
that Alife has a problem with trivial strategies arises because 
alife doesn't generally try to deal with thermodynamics.  Hence
they're not modelling one of the biggest drives to complexity.

I do not doubt that for one moment. But, you are a single individual. 
That tells us that the distributions overlap extensively and perhaps even 
completely, not that they have equal means and SDs. Also, it doesn't 
necessarily tell us about how the algorithms of the mind are coded: 
merely that they are functionally equivalent for conversation purposes. 

>My advice--stop wasting your time feeding

Ahh, but that is the question: are there enough to go around ;-) Who does 
run the train company these days?

More seriously, when psychologists built IQ tests, they explicitly 
discarded items which gave a gender difference. Despite this selection, 
the male and female distributions have different SDs - if you see someone 
with an IQ <70 or >140 your best bet is to predict they are male as there 
are more males in the tails (of the distribution).

In the literature on relationships, the assortative mating  for IQ is 
such that it predicts that people are as good as the WAIS-III at 
evaluating their partner's IQ: we marry people who are very similar in IQ 
to ourselves. Moreover, it is hard for people to be lead by  or even to 
be friends with persons whose IQ more than 20 points above their own. 

This predicts that high IQ women should be in extreme demand (fomr the 
excess of high IQ males). Unfortunately, that other male trait 
(dominance) comes in, especially in non-Western cultures. For instance in 
Singapore, they were finding considerable reluctance among men to marry 
highly educated women. To many "i told you so's" apparently.

Ahh. life. It is just one damn thing after another.

Given that its a thought experiment you are presumably able to keep the two
brains identical indefinitely. However in the real world I would have
thought chaotic factors would ensure that the two brains diverged very
rapidly. Even if you have two identical brains to begin with small external
differences would be enough to ensure divergence. I suspect that even small
gravitational differences between the two rooms would be enough. And of
course random quantum effects between the two brains would be different
which would also lead to divergence.

A whole while ago we were talking about personal data/document management.
This has become especially relevant to me since I've had to move a lot in
the course of the last two years -- and resources I can't access are useless.

Albeit belatedly, I am happy to report to having begun destillation of
my music CDs into mp3s. It's slow, and I can't batchify it yet, but
it's a start. With 128 kBit, which is roughly CD quality one averages
at about 1 MByte/min audio. On a 10 GByte disk you thus can store
~160 CDs or about 7 days of audio. With a laptop, or a wearable,
you're even mobile.

Unfortunately, I haven't managed in creating a capability to scan
personal books whether as bitmap or using OCR in time before my next
move -- a lot of books will thus have go into storage, and probably
not under ambient conditions :(

Has anybody experiences in converting treekiller literature into data,
particularly under SANE/Linux? (I'm not a zealot, I have FineReader
and NT as well, it it's of any use).

Is it doable, or a pipe dream? 

How long do you take for a single book on the average? 

Did you do straight bitmaps or went for the whole hog (OCR)? 

What is your storage medium? 

Retrieval method?

Migration strategy to future storage media?

thanks,
'gene

At this most basic level, complexity or growth in compexity does 
certainly not seem to be the most likely or natural situation. But 
since it's boring (for the human psychology), we change the 
parameters in the simulation until we get something interesting. It 
makes me wonder if we may not be prone to overestimate the likelihood 
that the far future will be complex.


It appears to me that Anders and Robin (and Max?) have a tendency to 
think that there are lots of checks and balances in the nature of 
things, and that tradeoffs and diminishing returns guarantee that a 
large variety of different strategies will always co-exist. Eliezer 
and other extreme singularians (and to some extent me) seem to think 
that the world and posthuman society might well be more brittle, and 
that system could easily end up in one of the "boring" states, 
i.e. simple states. (If the universe were transformed into a giant 
pleasure-machine, for example, it might be a simple state, but not a 
boring one from the insiders point-of-view.) In a factor analysis of 
different thinking styles in transhumanism, I would expect this to 
turn out to be one of the basic dimensions.

Interesting, but fairly basic. I should tell you a little about myself.
I've been a data communications programmer for over 25 years.
In 1985, I was one of the founders of the company I still work for.
We've been building peer-processor datacomms swithces since I designed
the architecture for our first one in 1985. I do try to keep up with
this stuff. Please beleive me when I say that the networking isn't
particularly hard. The problem is in task assignment and task migration.

Note that when the computers are all in the same room, there are cheaper
ways to build a Beowulf than by using ether-switches. In particular,
if the comuters are arranged in a grid, each computer can use two 100BaseT
cards instead of one. In this arrangement each computer can act as a crosspoint
for its row and column, switching on average only as many packets as it
originates or terminates. This gives you massive, incrementally expandble
bandwidth for approximately $50/node.

I would phase this another way:  Either posthuman society will be maximally
complex, or it will be maximally simple.  If there are tradeoffs and checks
and balances, they will not be the ones we know.

Human perception is the perception of differences, and we are evolved to
compete in the areas where narrowly balanced forces give rise to differential
rates of reproduction.  This has given us a skewed and unrealistic view of the
Universe as balanced between competing agents, with force and resistance
always in the same order of magnitude; the unbalanced forces are not
"perceived", as discrete and changeable values, at all.

Life can only evolve in the areas free from overwhelming forces and positive
feedback - but balanced forces and negative feedback are really very fragile
things, which is why organic life doesn't evolve in the depths of space or the
heart of stars.  If you want to speculate about post-Singularity processes,
you have to abandon the basic human ontology.  That's what makes an "extreme" Singularitarian.

The Universe is extreme, but life can evolve only in the rare balances.

Stuart Kauffman is known for his belief that life evolves "to the edge
of chaos".  Something about evolution has kept it from tipping over
into maximally simple strategies.  It may be that much of the early
history of life on earth was a matter of "learning to evolve", that is,
the creation of the genetic code, sexual recombination, and the other
basic parameters which govern reproduction.  This system had to be such
that it not only rewarded innovation, but that it was robust enough to
maintain the characteristics of rewarding innovation.

You could imagine many alternatives being tried, some of which worked
well initially, but which drifted away from the properties which
allowed evolution to work.  Only when a system was developed which
somehow carried its own incentives to maintain itself, to maintain
the properties which allow evolution to work, was it truly stable.
At that point evolution took off and organisms descended from that
system took over the world.  This is then what Kauffman observes as
a tendency to stay with near-chaotic behavior; only a genetic system
which had such a tendency would allow for long-term evolution.

This is all speculation, of course.

Extending it, we may have had the same thing happen culturally.
We developed cultural systems which not only encourage and reward
innovation (for surely such have arisen at random many times), but
which maintain themselves.  Such a cultural system holds itself at
the edge of chaos and allows cultural evolution to occur.

When we initially enter a new realm in which evolution can occur, as
with early alife, there is no a priori reason to expect complex behavior.
Most of the time, a simple strategy dominates.  We have to play with the
systems and try out many possibilities before we find some which evolve
complexity.  If these various alife systems were actually competing
in some forum (which they are, in a way - they are competing for our
attention and computer cycles), then only systems which can preserve
their complexity-enhancing characteristics will win.  That's not a big
problem for today's alife programs because usually the way inheritance
and reproduction works are fixed by the creator, but in the future it
may become more of an issue as the simulations get more realistic.

Similarly, as we move into the Singularity, if the nature of evolution
is fundamentally different from the cultural evolution of today,
there is no reason to expect chaotic behavior.  It is more likely that
a simple strategy will dominate.  Only over a longer period of time,
when many forms of Singularity entities can form and reproduce and grow,
will there be time to evolve a mode of reproduction which encourages
chaos and evolution as we know it.  It's not clear whether we get that
far, though, whether the post-Singularity entities will be such that
reproduction, variation and selection can occur.

I too have been an Applications, Communications, OS, 4GL and AI
programmer/licensor for the last three decades and invite you to look at
my sole remaining uploading project.

Please, have a look at Ingrid because there is this really novel idea
about how to have Ingrid running in up to 12 windows on each computer. I
like the idea of each computer acting as a crosspoint for its row and
column as this fits with my concept of how to assign a task to a dormant
Ingrid processor in a mesh of Ingrid resources. As a single Ingrid
processor is in effect a primitive AI inference engine capable of
neuronally re-plasticizing migrating features, it has long been my dream
to have a parallel version of Ingrid running on something like a Beowolf
cluster. Right now I'm putting together a team to consider the variety
of 'skins' that will be needed in the various user interfaces. Whether
it be talking pens or a replacement to the money system, Ingrid is a
'must be considered' front runner in terms of the small amount of effort
to get it going. Unfortunately the supercomputing community is very shy
about their resources being taken over by Ingrid.

The pre re-write Ingrid source code is open for you to see how well the
nodes can be made to run in under 50Kb of integer programming (as a
subconscious processor without a UI.) Ingrid survived for me because of
its small size whereas my 50Mb Global operating system/4GL died in a
McMafia court battle.

The desired state is called Androgynous...integrating the desirable
stereotypic attributes of males (the tendency to be asssertive) and the
desirable stereotypic attributes of females (the tendency to be
affiliative). Androgynous individuals are transhumanistic in the sense that
they transcend the Masculine and Feminine stereotypes.  In general, I would
respond to this thread as follows:  There may be some theoretical value in
examing gender-specific differences in cognitive styles, but there is no
significant practical value.  In short, individual variance dwarfs gender
variance.  Let's move on.

guideposts for the engineers of Homo sapiens sapiens 2.0 etc.

 This statment and your subject title reminds me of another question I've
being
 meaning to ask of a biological mathematician.  Any professors to this
title
 on this list?  (pun intended).  As organisms (or any system for that
 matter) become more complex they show an increasing degree of body plan
 lateralization.  Is this simply because there is more opportunity for loss
 of symmetry and division of labor?  I suspect compexity theory would have
 something to say about the reasons and the likelihood for a biological
 system to develop in a nonsymetrical pattern.  Has Stewart Kauffman said
 anything on this matter?  Any comments?    Peter

Do you have much knowledge of radio telemetry and digital 
amplification?  I'm wondering if it would be possible to build a
generic wireless computing box that is capable of autonegotiating an
optimal datacast hierarchy.  In other words, using wireless signaling,
have the boxes self-organize so that some data is being broadcast to
all other boxes, and some data is being point-cast between boxes.  

As far as "task migration", couldn't you have the tasks 
"automagically" balance by having them transferred between processing 
nodes directly through the air?

I'm not sure what the state of the art is in high-resolution 
high-speed gain amplification, but it seems that you could have a 
signalling system that doesn't pollute the electromagnetic spectrum, 
but is sufficiently intelligent to carry traffic across large areas.

Would it be possible to have a large supercomputer made up of such
nodes, such that the same devices could also be a wireless
telecommunications infrastructure, at the same time as being a
distributed computing system?

You could make it such that you mass produce the boxes (with 
superscalar RAM), to achieve the lowest possible per unit cost.

I just picked up this thread and realized I was posting about a very
similar issue on the laterlaiztion thread.  Thoughts in the same vein as
you have been proceeding, applied to my question (body plan lateralization)
would be greatly appreciated.

Like you, I traveled the world and for along time I was accompanied by
at least two twenty foot containers. This load reduced and eventually
got to the point where I considered digitizing my filing cabinets. In
1995, I scanned 150Kg of important paper at around 20 pages per megabyte
using fax and OCR software on my Apple Mac. These files had long been
highly integrated with Quicken, so it was easy for me to find any piece
of paper and/or image via the computer. Back in 1995 storage was still
at a premium and I made the mistake of stuffing too much (i.e., >50%)
into my disks. For years I had carried so much data with me that finally
upgrading and consolidation of this load of compressed stuff became a
nightmare and in trying to organize and backup my way out of this
seemingly wet paper bag of data the inevitable happened and great chunks
of data were lost fell away in a series of stupid mistakes. The point
about this loss is that it somehow seemed less painful after it was
digitized than if it were say lost in a house fire, however I still have
all my Quicken databases of over eighty thousand entries and this is a
useful memory jogger whenever I want to travel down memory lane. I can't
advise on the necessary level of compulsive behavior that one needs to
maintain a paperless existence but now that I and fate have trimmed a
lot of fat from my files, I still feel fine, at least now the the net is
so much part of my life.

I worked for two solid weeks to scan the quantity mentioned above.

Like I said fax and OCR was all I had at the time but even nowadays
would be a better format than using a scanner with its cumbersome
images.

Quicken in strict account/date order.

You're talking about objects so that's obviously true.

I'm not big on definitions, few are needed and even fewer are any good, your
definition of green is no exception. Even if all green things were destroyed
green might not be because that subjective experience might exist in the future.
And you can have green without green things or even green light, as in
hallucinations. Before you ask let me say that I have no definition of green,
only examples.


     >But is your consciousness actually correlated with the set of

First of all I don't have consciousness I am consciousness. Emotions,
sensations, and thoughts are the part of me I value, not protoplasm. Second,
things are made of atoms and atoms have no individuality, if they can't even
give this interesting property to themselves how can they give it to me?


     >If I've got two green cubes, and smash one, what happens

If I have two printers printing out the same novel and I smash one is the book
destroyed ? If I have two phonographs playing the same symphony and I smash
one machine what happens to the music?


    >there is a little less Green in the world.


I've never seen that make the slightest difference in anything. The number of green
things in the universe constantly fluctuates, but it wouldn't matter if it dropped to zero.
After a billion years without green and a green thing finally evolved again it would be
just as green as it was before.

Nobody knows. Somebody suggested that random quantum fluctuations would be
enough to make them instantly diverge but if things were really that delicate nobody
would have a stable personality, but they do. Besides the human brain is a hot noisy
place, I don't see how quantum effects could play much of a part in its operation. I don't
know how long they would stay in parallel, I would guess a few minutes,
perhaps a few hours.

An example *is* an object.  You can only have more than one example (or object)
of a kind or sort of object, not of the object itself. This is true even of
atoms; you may have more than one copper atom, but they are not the *same*
atom, *because* you have more than one.`

In the same way that they can give greenness, or consciousness,
though atoms have neither property themselves.

Researcing tranhumanism in general I am studying humanism. Humansim has an
ethics system based on rationality and the right to have your own values.
This, and some postings on this list got me thninking about laws and crimes.

On the surface it sounds like a good idea to eliminate the victimless crimes
from the law, like drug abuse etc. But what about something like the traffic
laws, where there is no wictim at first for driving without a license or in
other recless ways. Certainly more people will be killed or maimed. Isn't
this a too high price to pay for the added freedom? I havn't made my mind up
yet.

Does anybody know any good sources of the abolishment of victimless crimes?

    Thanks To all that responded, it helped, but Let me illustrate the situation a little
better.

What  I am looking for is a scenario were by you could force divergence without outside
influence. Thus it is solely a self agreement. The Goal of this experiment is to get both of
you and you to  agree on different identities. Example once their was John and John now their
is John and James.  Can it be done?  How would you do it?


              I think their are interesting novelties to this situation.
              I created this scenario to help me deal with the concept of uploading and
identity.

      identity is something that is vary important to me, but I have come to realizes that I
die everyday.  I forget who I was yesterday. I am some one different today.

            I wish I could convince a Judge of that... hmmmmm. "It wasn't me your honor it was
that guy yesterday." It is interesting to start thinking about yourself as the product of the
person before.

Some people have suggested privatizing the roads. Let each company make
their own rules for the own roads, let them issue their own liscenses (or
respect the lisecses issued by some other organization), let them decide
their own limit for DUI and DWI, with only the power to bar people from
driving on their roads when they break it, and let them bear responsibility
for keeping their roads clear in winter. If an accident occurs due to their
negligence, they are open to a lawsuit, and if you don't like the way they
run their roads, the accident rate on their roads, or the price of driving
on their roads, you drive on a different one. In my opinion, some things are
just not feasible to privatize, and roads are one of them (is there enough
physical space for competition?), but this is how someone completely for it
would respond. Another possibility, without privatizing the roads, is to
hold any drunk driver who kills someone, or any driver at all who kills
someone for that matter, completely liable for their actions, no different
then a murder. I am not sure whether this would act as a deterent and
actually cut down on anything.

AOL is reported to "be close to signing an agreement" to
acquire Netscape for over $4billion in stock - an interesting
merger of companies that have been considered polar opposites
in regard to technical innovation.
I find surprising that big and slow giants are getting so much power.

Also, the deal seems to undermine the case against Microsoft

See discussion of details and possible consequences of the deal at

No one is necessarily arguing for the abolition of traffic laws. In a
libertarian society these would be set by private owners under arrangement
with insurers etc. The argument about traffic laws is really about how good
a job the government is doing in setting the most cost-efficient
incentives/disincentives to trade lower accident costs against higher
inconvenience to drivers taking into account the effect on a usually
distorted automobile insurance/health insurance market, and whether private
ownership regimes can tackle these tradeoffs better.

The brain is chaotic, as such small fluctuations in initial conditions will
rapidly lead to divergent results. So even if the two brains are initially
identical and in identical environments QM will lead to divergence over
time.

Note: I am not suggesting weird QM affects a la Hameroff and Penrose, but
more mundane affects of QM on the exact rate of chemical and
electrophysical reactions in the brain.

Sophisticated new radio work is happeninbg mostly in cellular
telephony. They are moving to "software-defined radio" techniques,
using serious amounts of DSP CPU power to manage the spectrum.
Your proposal would require even more CPU power. Why not just
apply the CPU power to the application instead, and use
cheaper datacomms? In general, the RF spectrum is quite limited
by comparison to fiber or even COAX.

Task Migreatoin requires bandwidth, Bandwidth requires CPU at both
ends. The problem is determining whether the CPU woudl be better
spent on on the task rather than on migrating it.

Sure, but not at high bandwidth.

The comms component will cost a good deal more than the rest of the
computer to achieve perhaps 2Mbps connectivity. Cheaper to spend
about ten bucks per computer for 100baseT ethernet.

Only in certain aspects. Of course I don't want them to turn into 
braindead, beer-swilling brutes with a fascination for sports involving 
a ball. Rather, I'd like women to become more mentally (and physically
-- death to anorexia!) empowered; self-confident and non-submissive. 
At the same time, excess aggression in males would have to be curbed 
(again by hormone treatments etc.) so that the sexes meet somewhere 
in the middle. A (mentally) more androgyne society would be more
pleasant for everyone.

Well, 'nuff said...

Steve "Mr Technomad" Roberts used to recommend microfiche for document storage;
the mass-per-bit is probably similar to storing scanned pages (not OCR-ed)
on a hard disk, and, most importantly, if the power fails you can still read 
it. The latter reason is probably more important for people like him who 
might need access to technical manuals to fix problems on the road.

An identity is the smallest possible fraction of any group. One single =
human is an identity, any part of him works towards the common goal of =
the whole body - survival of the whole, survival of his genetic =
materiel. In a more abstract way, any identity is defined by any number =
of subsystems which are organized to work towards a common goal. A =
distributed AI would also be one identity, because all computers which =
make part of this AI are not single autonomusly working units but only =
parts of the whole. Only together they are an AI, an entity. When cut of =
from the whole, a computer is just that - a computer. One human (assumed =
he is mentally sane) is one conscious identity, possessing one set of =
memories, one set of goals, one set of reasoning faculties which can =
come to conclusions distinct from those of other units. But it's not a =
single thread in a multithread process. It is the multithread process, =
in which each idea, each thought represents one thread.=20

Many is anything more than one. A long as you can divide, it is more =
than one. One single entity cannot be divided. It's a simple question of =
discrete mathematics.

> Bonus question:  Why do you care?

To discuss Singleton and singularity, you need to know what "single" is. =
Well, you need exact definitions. Without clear definitions all =
discussion is obsolete.

When using statistics, you can go only one way:analyse a small part of a =
group and apply the results to the whole group. You cannot guess from a =
group to an individual. So, racial differences cannot be judeged based =
on a one-on-one scheme. You can only take averages between large groups. =
This is no problem with physical attributes, which can be determined =
without problem. But any mentaltrstposes some problems. Many =
psychologial test systems are "localized", developped to be used only on =
specific groups with certain caracteristics. IMO there does not exist =
any objective method of determining intelligence or other mental =
capabilities.

You could guess from historic and ethnic development on the advantages =
and disadvantages of civilizations. You couls say that, based on tight =
population and less-than optimum living conditions, the European =
civilizations had to evolve, thus came technical and civilizational =
advance. China, as an opposite, resolved the internal wars and became a =
static society, because lack of threat caused a lack of evolution. As =
Biology teaches us, evolution is never without an external factor.

When roads are private, this will be a non-issue. The owners will make
the rules. Liability concerns and technology will keep the roads safe.
The fact that the state has a monopoly on most roads today creates the
problem you bring up... and once again has people discussing how many
angels can dance on the head of a pin. 

	Once we start voting according to their rules, it weakens us. Until we
have freedom, we're going to have too many traffic fatalities, war
casualties, etc. But we'll have them forever (or until politicians wipe
out civilization) if we start caving in to their way of thinking.

That has never been proven and nobody knows how rapid is rapid. I have
no trouble believing that some tiny changes in the environment can lead to
huge changes in behavior, but I have great difficulty believing that every
change can do it. Not everything turns into a profound life changing event.

if the atoms in a blade of grass are are organized in the same way then both are green

I never said destroying an exact copy of my brain would not make the
make the slightest difference to anything, I only said that there
is no logical reason to think it could make any difference to me, or even
that I could tell that it happened.

Ahhh ... This I find hard to believe. If the brain was a chaotic system we
would all be insane. Most of us are pretty robust and consistent.

The brain must have some sort of negative feedback system.

Absolutely right!
I'm at the point where I really don't care how we get some permanent hardware up
as long as it's up.
the government is obviously not the best choice for the project, but if they're
doing it I'll hang my hat there if I can.

You're right that the project is not very extropian in how it's being
accomplished, but I certainly let out a whoop of excitement this morning when
I saw that the Zarya module had gotten off the pad at Baikanour OK.  Although
ISS is a big boondoggle in many ways and it's history is an object lesson in
why big central government projects are about the least efficient means of
accomplishing anything (even something as single-minded as "build a space
station"), it's also a great source of education for the next generation of
space engineers.  We'll need those people when the technology becomes
available to do space on a more efficient basis.  I'd like to see ISS
privatized as soon as possible and serve as a construction base for those
projects.  By then (2005-2015) it's scientific value will have gone from low
to nil, but its value as a place to do useful engineering work may be
unmatched.

It can't be done because whatever idea you come up with your counterpart will have exactly
the same idea. Even flipping a coin won't help, you'll both say "heads" at the same instant.

I'm certainly interested in the field. Beyond a background in Maths and
Computation and a decent knowledge of the hacking world I've not
developed it much.  What's the latest thing to grab your attention?

Probably some have already read this paper, but i find it really
interesting. The site is also very interesting.

Abstract: Contrary to the popular notion that consciousness is the
result of a
noble evolutionary process, I speculate that this rather ill-defined
concept and
phenomenon may be the result of the fragmentation of an otherwise
completely
connected and totally feeling universe. As various regions of this
universe
topologically pinch-off from the whole, connection-sparse boundaries
form over
which sporadic and impoverished information exchange takes place.
Supplied
with only scanty clues about the state of the external world, abundant
internal
chaos drives these small parallel processing islands into multiple
interpretations of the environment in a process we identify with
perception.
With further division of these regions by insulating partitions, the
resulting
subregions activate to lend multiple interpretation to the random
activations of
others in a manner reminiscent of internal imagery. The spontaneous
invention of
significance by this weakly coupled assembly of simple computational
units to its
own overall collective behavior is what we have grown to recognize as
biological consciousness. We thereby come to view human cortical
activity as a
highly degraded approximation to the original and prototypical cosmic
connectivity.

I haven't read or talked to _anyone_ who thinks that libertarianism is
"perfect" - and my readings on the subject are wide and copious. This is an
unsupported straw man. Nor do most consider it a "system" (see below).

I don't "believe in" libertarianism either - as if it were a religion or
some monolithic body of doctrine, or a specifiable "system". Libertarianism
is nothing more or less than an across-the-board commitment to individual
freedom, generally summed up as a desire to prohibit  physical coercion.
Ideologies abound, but ideology isn't the essence; libertarians differ
(sometimes bitterly) on just about everything except the fundamental
commitment to liberty. It's a movement, not an ideology.

What moved me to engage the original poster a bit impatiently was my
weariness of the ignorant stereotypes parroted by those who rely on the
mass media for their "information", and obviously don't know any
libertarians personally: lack of compassion, insensitivity, money-grubbing,
hardheartedness, ad nauseum. How about making an honest attempt to learn
how libertarians actually think and feel?

Peace,
Dickola

These universalist theories of consciousness always seem to have the
property that our livers should be conscious.  They are pinched off
from the rest of the universe just like our brains; they receive data
about the state of the external world as our brains do (in the case
of the liver, via chemicals in the blood); they even have a sort of
model of the outside world in the sense that they try to maintain
an equilibrium that is appropriate for current conditions.

If we explain consciousness by saying that the universe is somehow
conscious, and the brain is just a pinched off piece, then we have a
hard time explaining why all the other pinched off pieces aren't
conscious.

David Chalmers proposes a similar theory.  He suggests that the universe
is filled with what he calls "proto-consciousness", every atom and
particle imbued with a little bit of this mysterious stuff.  Only when
it is combined together in the proper way does it form consciousness as
we know it.  All we have to do now, he says, is to discover the laws
which control when and how proto-consciousness combines to form true
consciousness.

Personally I think he's just trying to sugar-coat an unpalatable theory.
We can't be sure that livers and baseball's *aren't* conscious.  For all
we know, they could have a merry internal life, full of laughter and
love.  But still the idea seems ridiculous.  By saying that they're not
conscious, they're just "proto-conscious" (and not defining what that
means), Chalmers hopes to escape derision.  But there's no more reason
to believe that they are proto-conscious than that they are conscious.
It's really the same idea, just dressed up nicer.

Hal

yes i somewhat agree with you... but it's simply a problem of
terminology isn't? what they are caalling feeling and consciousness is a
rather different notion than the usual ones

depend what  conscious means in the context... just a matter of
definition and terminology...in the article i've proposed... the
"feeling" of the universe is just reduced to the state of physical
interactions, i can't, at this moment, see something wrong with that.

a priori, THIS kind of theories seem somewhat ridiculous for me too. But
i think the article i've proposed don't talk about anythink like that...

 a simple matter of terminology in the proposed paper.

i believe, the article i've proposed tell nothing about such things...
perhaps you should read it ;)...all these new ages things are not for me
too...

"[O]ne green"?  I don't know that that makes any sense.
I think that it is a little sloppy to use green as a 
noun, as that leads one to believe that it exists as
something distinct from the object which is green. The
color "green" is only a property of groups of atoms,
not an object, and not a property of only one atom.

To draw the analogy with color, are you saying that "John Clark"
is an adjective (property of matter)?

Well, no, but is that what really matters?  Is a promise to 
record the positions of every atom in your brain sufficient
to make your death palatable?  I would say not, even though
nothing irreplaceable has been destroyed.  The point seems
to be not whether you can be replaced, but whether this 
iteration of you ends.

Of course you couldn't tell, but that is true *now*!  Yet you
haven't suicided.  Curious. ;)

Here is another very good site for some information on tough questions
that are posed to libertarians.  http://www.self-gov.org/ruwart   
It's worth taking a look.

Hi,

this message is to inform you that I am trying to build a list of the most
inspirational books ever written, by gathering the inputs of as much
inspirational books readers as possible.

You are invited to vote for the book(s) that had the most profound effect on
your life.

You understand that you will be among the first to visit my site, and that
your vote is really important  in order to tune up the list.

You may wonder how did I find your email address ?  I just had a look on
some other sites with inspirational books and I found that you have the same
passion as me for books that feed the soul.  If you think I made a mistake
by sending you this email, please receive my apologies.  It is the only way
I found to receive a few
votes to tune up the list.

The most inspirational books site:
http://www.abacom.com/~topten/insp/index.html

Thank you very much

--- End Forwarded Message ---

This kind of just fell into my lap, but I think that it would apply to 
many of the rest of you as well.  I base this judgement on the 
extensive list of books recommended for reading that are located at the 
bottom of our Extropian Principles version 3.0.  I'm just advising you 
to remember that vote is for inspirational, not merely educational.  
Sometimes, in interacting with others we may forget that to many other 
people these do not mean the same thing.

In my experience, no 2 libertarians agree on everything, not even here in
Australia which has very few libertarians to begin with.

That's O.K.  We'll let Internet 1 (Maximum consumer speed: 2 Mb/s
cable modem: average 21st century speed: 1.5Mb/s DSL connection ... or
256K downstream, 128K upstream using 20,000 foot DSL technology to be
rolled out next year) be the money-sucker for the obedient
nontechnical flock. 

Internet II (Broadband, Spread Spectrum Wireless, Distributed 
Parallel Supercomputing) can go to the pagans: New World Order: Men 
In Black: Security Sector Shepards of the Flock: Consultants on Call 
to the Telecom Companies and Mega ISPs.

 Trying to think about this problem from an evolution point of view ->
One given set of genes or memes really does care if a perfect copy of it
is being destroyed or not.

  After all, we are all examples of such bodies of genes or memes that
have managed to copy (read reproduce, if only partly) themselves...

   Now here is a funny problem, why wouldn't a particular set try very
hard to use cloning or uploading to make huge copies of itself. Once it
starts, it can use its power as a group to do anything it wants, that is
copy itself. What is to stop it? Other reproducing sets??? :-)

    Turning now to singletons advocates (elli?), how do you make sure it
just doesn't end up in that kind of direction? Eating up all universe
information into what we would today consider a dead end, if not a
threat...? Particularly if you think we can not imagine what is after
transcendence?

Unfortunately, while this will transfer a lot of petroleum economy 
wealth from the Christians to the Pagans, it still does nothing to 
clear up traffic on the parking lot freeways.

If you want to get the roads clear, you need to eliminate moo-cow's 
need to drive to Blockbuster to pick up their VHS tape and DVDs.  
AOL's 15fps 120x90 mpeg clips scaled up to NTSC via a Wintel set-top 
box just aren't going to cut the mustard.

O.K., AOL's new Sun Microsystems wavelet compressed Blockbuster 
library might do a whole lot of good for lining Steve Case's 
Arlington Virginia CIA snoopshop wallet, but will we be getting frame 
level access at a decent price?  I seriously doubt it.

Just another 5-10 years of planned obsolecence while Ma Bell 
continues to butt-fuck American consumers while sleeping with 
Rockefeller-inspired oil monopolies who try to suck the last penny 
from every living creature while smogging up the skyline, just so 
when their finished they can poison the water supply or Nuke their 
own populace in the name of National Security.  I'm sure the Neutron 
bomb development programs continued perfectly uninterrupted over at 
General Electric.  Good news, Philips just announced a light bulb 
that lasts for 2 years.  Oh joy.  Maybe in 2015 they'll spill the 
beans on their 1968 patented lightbulb that lasts 200 years.

Joy.  AOL buys Netscape for $4 Billion in a 3 way cluster fuck 
partnership with Sun Microsystems.  Bill Gates gets competition.  
Bullshit.  More like petroleum economy slavery scheduled to continue 
for another 20 years, before the scheduled mass genocide starts.

Let's just start handing out the RU486, Viagra, and MDMA and get this 
over with.

Can you prove that the Green exists?  (I won't even BOTHER trying to get
you to prove that the John Clark exists.)  What is the Green, exactly?  If
it didn't exist, how would we know?

Like I say, I don't think the Green exists, and neither does the John
Clark you describe.  I think you exist, but you seem to have a habit of
defining yourself in terms of things that don't exist.

Actually, the whole of the wired news is good today, with speculation on

That "example" you're referring to is a person.  It may matter to that
"example" whether you kill him or not.  If that example doesn't want to be
killed, then you shouldn't kill him.  This is the ethical argument I'm
making.

Unless you're proposing some clear delineation marking the difference
between "object" and "person," people are objects.  They're conscious
objects.  Living objects.  Loving objects.  Dreaming objects.  But
objects, nonetheless.

OK.  Well, then, it matters in this case whether there is a Green which
exists separate from all green things or whether each green thing has its
own internal greenness which is destroyed when you obliterate the cube. 
If the former, then copies can be killed willy-nilly, because the Person
still exists.  If the latter, then they can't.

I'm telling you there is no Green.

How would we know if you were right and I was wrong?  How would we know if
greenness were contained in each green thing rather than existing
separately from all things green?

They organize.  The organization is you.  (Notice that I CAN point at
the organization of matter; you can't point at the Green.)  Each time
something is organized like you, it's a person.  You will die when you get
disorganized, probably by turning into something simpler.  This may not be
a bad thing, particularly if in dying you create another person with
precisely the same organization, but you'll be dead.

One is, the other isn't.  WHICH doesn't matter; but the fact remains that
where once you had two novels printing, now you've got one.

You're right.  If a Green exists, the fact that there are fewer green
things matters not a fig to anyone.

Adjectives make perfect sense to me; there just isn't a Platonic form for
each adjective.  There is no Green off of which green things are modeled,
there is no Chair from which all chairs are built, and there is no John
Clark from which you are formed.  Rather, instead, there are red things,
there are chairs (arbitrarily defined), and you are John Clark.  The
adjectives DO work without Plato's heaven; you make the same mistake
Plato did when you presume its existence.

The other parts of speech go similarly.

Sorry about that, Sasha.  I was just adding to my own rant.  
Actually, I'm not too excited about AOL/Netscape/Sun.  The idea that 
we should all jump up and yell "hooray" because Microsoft get's 
competition on the set-top is absurd!  

Here's our choice: 

1.) WinTel/Windows CE/Explorer set top box with ADSL interface 
connected through Baby Bells (MSN subsidiary WebTV portal) 

2.) WinTel/Windows CE/Explorer set top box with cable modem interface 
connected through AT&T's recently acquired TCI cable infrastructure 
(@Home portal)

3.) Compaq/Sun JavaSoft/Navigator set top box with ADSL interface 
connected through Baby Bells to (AOL portal).

4.) Compaq/Sun JavaSoft/Navigator set top box with cable modem 
interface through Cox, Time Warner, or Continental Cable (@Home 
contracted to reroute through AOL or Pathfinder Portal)

Who wins?:  Baby Bells.  AT&T.  Microsoft.  AOL.  Sun.  Time Warner.

Who loses:  Everybody else.  Oh, wait.  Deregulation.  That's right.  
We can all go to work for MCI or Sprint's fiber-to-the curb 
initiative.  They'll probably get purchased by AT&T's fiber-to-the 
curb initiative.  At the center of it all: Cisco's NSA switches.

It's like: Gee Whiz: Chevron gets to compete with ARCO and TEXACO and 
UNOCAL.  It's still the same old thing.  Petroleum economy slavery.

Currently I'm more interested in marketing my security skills as a
career.  I have been involved in lots of interesting things, but the
real question is how to market it.  How to make a full-time job out of
it, and how to make lots of money doing it.

My experience with my own company have not been as lucrative as I would
like.  I have since found that I can do much better by letting a big
company like IBM market security, and then hand me the engagements when
they are contracted.  This frees me from marketing, and lets me do the
real work for real money.

The market right now, is the market itself.  That is, companies trying
to make money on the Internet are the largest-growing Internet segment,
and they have the most money as well.  The more money they make, the
more targetted they are, and the more money they will spend on security.

I see a lot of cyberpunk interest on this and other lists, but I find
few people actually doing it.  And like with any job, the glamour
quickly fades when you face the day-to-day reality of having a full-time
job and following every project to completion.  I find few people able
to make the transition from wanna-be, to actual practitioner.

Yes, the book by Virginia Postrel titled The Future And Its Enemies
has just been published.  I just got my copy over the weekend and
have not had a chance to read it yet, however I have heard 
Virginia give several talks on the subject over the past year or so
and I expect the book to be well worth reading.  Virginia's thesis
is that left vs. right and liberal vs. conservative are often not
as useful as the destinction between static outlook vs dynamic
outlook.  She claims that the static outlook explains why you
see persons who claim to be right wing or conservative joining with
persons who claim to be left wing or liberal in opposing free trade.
Although the static anti-change tradition within conservatism is
probably well known by readers of this list, this book help explain
it to a larger audience.

The publisher is Free Press.  Laissez Faire Books http://www.lfb.org/

I don't believe I did, I just said there is only one form of green.  It's not literally
true of course because you could nit pick about shades of green but
the statement made sense. There is certainly only one type of the

Yes.

I don't know what you mean by "this iteration of you ends".
Do you mean when consciousness is interrupted?
It happens every time you go to sleep, or even when the phone rings
when you're deep in thought.
Do you mean when your body is made of new atoms?
Billions of new atoms are incorporated into your body every second of your life
and one hydrogen atom is as good as another anyway.

I'd just like to note, for the record, that I made the following two
predictions back when this thread was started:

1.  None of the questions have real answers (for Turing processes).
2.  Nobody will change their opinion as a result of this debate.

That having been said:

Suppose you make a recording of a Turing machine, and play it back - load the
state and tape from each tick back into memory.  Is that an instantiation?

Suppose you run the Turing machine again, except this time you compare it with
the recording and destroy it if it differs.  Is that an instantiation?

Suppose that for each state transition, you look up the "real" transition
using the standard state transition diagram (STD), but you actually transition
to the state used last time (at that tick) according to the record.  Is that
an instantiation?

Suppose that for each state transition, you look up the real transition using
the STD, compare it to the record, and replace it with the record if the
record differs.  But the record never does differ.  Is it a real instantiation
or just a recording?

If these processes are AIs, which of them are conscious?

It's questions like these, admittedly carried a bit farther, that converted me
from my former position of Strong AI to a Penrosian noncomputationalist.

Title
  Characterization of tissue selenium profiles and anticarcinogenic responses
  in rats fed natural sources of selenium-rich products.
Source
  Carcinogenesis.  15(4):573-6, 1994 Apr.
Abstract
  The present report describes the biological effects associated with the
  feeding of three selenium-rich natural products in rats: high-selenium
  garlic, high-selenium onion and Brazil nut.
  The first two are experimental crops cultivated with selenium fertilization.
  Brazil nut is probably the only
  unadulterated high-selenium food that is available commercially. Tissue
  selenium profiles, liver glutathione concentrations and mammary cancer
  inhibition (in the dimethylbenz[a] anthracene model) were the endpoints of
  investigation. Parallel designs were set up to compare the three
  high-selenium products with selenite and selenomethionine. Previous studies
  have shown that treatment with seleno-methionine resulted in significantly
  greater tissue selenium accumulation, particularly in skeletal muscle, than
  treatment with selenite. In contrast, selenite, but not selenomethionine,
  induced a modest increase in liver glutathione concentrations. The objective
  was to determine whether the high-selenium natural products elicited
  responses that were similar to that of selenite or selenomethionine. Our
  experiments suggested that the high-selenium garlic and onion might have some
  unique attributes. First, their ingestion did not lead to an exaggerated
  accumulation of tissue selenium, a concern that was shared by both
  selenomethionine and Brazil nut. Second,
  unlike selenite, they did not cause any perturbation in glutathione
  homeostasis. Third, they expressed good anticancer activity that was equal
  to, if not better than, that of selenite. The chemical form(s) of selenium
  present in the high-selenium Allium vegetables will be discussed in relation
  to the manifestation of the above characteristics.

  Sodium selenate corrects
  glucose tolerance and heart function in STZ diabetic rats.
Source
  Molecular & Cellular Biochemistry.  179(1-2):27-34, 1998 Feb.
Abstract
  Sodium selenate, administered
  intraperitoneally (i.p.), resulted in an improvement in
  glucose tolerance in treated diabetic rats. Fed rat plasma
  glucose levels were reduced by selenate
  treatment in streptozotocin diabetic rats. The lowest values of blood
  glucose were reached within 3 weeks of beginning the
  treatment. Food and fluid consumption was reduced in treated compared to
  untreated diabetic rats. Diabetic treated rats did not release insulin in
  response to a glucose challenge and insulin release in
  response to a challenge was markedly reduced in control treated rats.
  Assessment of heart function using a working heart apparatus showed that
  treated diabetic rats with improved blood glucose levels had
  normal heart function at 8 weeks of diabetes in contrast to hearts from
  non-treated diabetics. This study extends previous observations on the in
  vivo insulin-like effects of sodium
  selenate.

Title
  New developments in the
  use of niacin for treatment of
  hyperlipidemia: new considerations in the
  use of an old drug. [Review] [47 refs]
Source
  Coronary Artery Disease.  7(4):321-6, 1996 Apr.
Abstract
  Niacin has been used for many years to
  treat hyperlipidemia. It has been shown to reduce coronary death and
  non-fatal myocardial infarction and, in a separate analysis of long-term
  (15-year) follow-up, all cause mortality. It reduces total
  cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides
  and increases high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Sustained-release
  niacin may be associated with more dramatic changes in LDL-C
  and triglyceride, whereas the short acting preparation
  causes greater increases in HDL-C. The
  increase of HDL-C occurs at a lower dose (1500 mg/day) than
  the reduction of LDL-C (> 1500 mg/day).
  Niacin also favorably influences other
  lipid parameters including lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], alimentary lipemia,
  familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 and small dense LDL. Combination of
  niacin with a bile acid sequestrant or a reductase inhibitor
  represents a powerful lipid-altering regimen. Whereas the
  reductase inhibitors and bile acid binding resins primarily affect LDL-C,
  the combined therapy has a synergistic
  effect to reduce LDL-C and, in addition, the
  niacin reduces triglycerides and increases HDL-C.
  The major drawback in the
  use of niacin is associated side effects
  (flushing and palpitations) and toxicity (worsening of diabetes control,
  exacerbation of peptic ulcer disease, gout, hepatitis).
  Niacin has a long history of use as a lipid
  lowering agent and has several attractive features. Unfortunately,
  the side effect profile of this agent warrants its
  use only in patients with marked dyslipidemia in whom side
  effects and potential toxicity are closely monitored. [References: 47]

Title
  Sex and death in the
  mouse: genetically delayed reproduction and senescence.
Source
  Genome.  40(2):229-35, 1997 Apr.
Abstract
  A mammalian model of genetically postponed aging would be an important tool
  to test not only different mechanisms of aging but also the
  predictive value of various biomarkers of the aging process.
  Under conventional conditions, the historical strains of
  the laboratory mouse produce
  their first litter between 9 and 13 weeks of age and have a
  median time of death in their 2nd year. Our
  POSCH-2 strain, which was derived from wild-caught Mus musculus domesticus,
  produces its first litter in the current breeding
  generations at approximately 47 weeks of age and continues to breed
  throughout its 2nd and into its 3rd year of life. The aging
  curve of POSCH-2 has not yet been determined for economic reasons. Late onset
  of breeding is a characteristic of both females and males, but
  sexual maturity is more reliably assessed in females.
  The later breeding phenotype of POSCH-2 is genetically
  recessive to early breeding of the C57BL/6J historical
  laboratory strain and, since POSCH-2 females can be induced to ovulate at 8
  weeks of age (but pregnancy does not result), the signal
  rather than the ovarian receptor to ovulate
  may be delayed. The genetically delayed reproduction and
  potentially longer life of the POSCH-2 strain appears to be
  a new trait in the mouse.
  The strain may be a useful mammalian model for aging studies
  and for the evaluation of antagonistic pleiotropy as a
  genetic model for the evolution of aging.

This is my bastardization of Immanuel Kant "Prolegomena To any Future Metaphysics."

The problem with Metaphysiccal concepts is that their not vary useful. That said, what can we say
about the world of things that might be usefull.  Language places things in categories, but some
things can change category depend on it's environment.  All things are things the only question
is what category a thing is going into. I should point out their is one category that is empty
and  It's the none thing category, and the biggest category is  the imaginary thing category.


 Because I look at things in this Way I found the paragraph of Dan vary vary funny

     Onto the ethics of killing identicals. Based on the Golden Rule.

 For John it would be ethical to kill identical without knowing their state of mind at the time
of their death. And for Dan it would be unethical because Dan thinks state of mind is important.
Ethics tells you what you can't do not what somone else can't do :-).

      by the by  Kant secularized the Gold Rule. (Do unto other as you would have them do unto
you.)  The Gold Rule is extremely powerful. The basic tenant of ethics in general is if it passes
the Gold Rule it cold be ethical. If it doesn't it is defiantly not. The only problem with it is
that it is logically flawed.  It makes the assumption that we all care about how we are
treated...


         I hope this seem perteninte to somone

  Unfortunately, I do not know of any methods that would help to estimate
the IQs of past famous thinkers.  Or living - without asking them.

However, as I have spent some time studying intelligence,
I would like to make some suggestions.  Intelligence is a
generic concept covering many abilities related to memorization
of various things and performance of different types of
perceptive and cognitive tasks.  There are as many intellectual
skills as there are types of things to memorize and figure out.
To be exact, infinitely many radically different intelligent
faculties, out of which humans possess a limited number - but
still a considerable one, and in various combinations.
Intelligence of Picasso is not of the same kind as intelligence
of Einstein.

IQ tests assess only rudimentary intelligence skills, and are
not applicable to estimating the mental faculties of geniuses.
IQ does not even look at people's ability to draw complex
generalizations, does not assess creativity at all (!), or
qualities like perseverance, willpower, courage, ability to
empathize with people, emotional sensitivity, musical talents,
perception of color, knowledge of advanced scientific concepts,
and very complex problem-solving skills (ability to quickly
match simple patterns has little to do with these).

So I think IQ tests should be left for assessing a limited set
of mental skills of close-to-normal children.  It would take us
a while to come up with reasonable numerical estimates for a
wide range of complex combinations of high mental skills that
define a genius; I personally doubt that a single numeric
indicator can make any sense here. Meanwhile, I'd suggest that
irrelevance of IQ for assessing skills of geniuses represents
an observation worthy of sharing with your readers.

As for the fame, after a certain level of intelligence, a
thinkers's fame seems to be a better indicator of the ability of
the social masses to recognize this person's talents, than of their
own ideas and skills...

See http://www.wavtrace.com/pressrls081798.htm

Jason Abboud is a cool guy.  Very down to earth.  He needs help, 
though, creating a strong demand for the product, since he wants to 
achieve excellent economies of scale, to keep costs down.

Maybe we could get him hooked up with Prof. Frank Dietz. 

See http://dynamo.ecn.purdue.edu/~hankd/

Maybe we could get these *wireless* devices down to the $50/box 
prices that your 100base-T Ethernet cards are going for today, to 
produce a Linux-based parallel supercomputer that can house the CRIT 
(http://crit.org) frame-level HDTV annotation database and wavelet 
HDTV frame proxies.  (Maybe Larry Ellison will help with a shareware 
parallel version of Oracle?  It's all a game to these guys, right?  
Set the ego's aside: Bill slips Ted a couple B's to slip to Larry?)

Before you know it, we're all happy hempers!!

P.S. I talked to a guy today who's gone through a vasectomy.  He said 
they give you a local anesthetic, do you don't feel a thing.  A 
little aching for about a day, but they give you some good drugs to 
keep you distracted.  After that, you still shoot your loads just 
like before, it's just that they're seedless.  Maybe we can use door 
to door, office to office stealth, offering FREE GPS CELLPHONES with 
Vasectomies-Retirement Included!!  Why waste $20,000 on Detroit 
steel, when you can build a steel framed house for the same price?  
As for money for mingling with the 20th century tax-paying slaves, I 
maintain that special series U.S. $20's are much less conspicous than 
food coupons (See http://www.moneyfactory.com/currency/index.cfm).

Haven't the USPTO and FTC really served their citizens well?

If there's any product in the world who's sale should be prevented, 
it's this one: http://www.etoys.com/html/et/et_swt0075_001.shtml

Just like anybody else. The prime difference with libertarians is they want a
world where somebody else doesn't get to force you to do something whether you
agree with it or not. The rest of the world sees such infringements as what it
takes to get along.

Having to pay a tax you don't beleive in is coercion, just as externalizing your
own costs onto others is also coercion. If I fault most libertarians for anything
it is that too many recognize the first but not the second. I fault all
non-liberatirans for recognizing the second but not the first.

When using statistics, you can go only one way:analyse a small part of a =
group and apply the results to the whole group. You cannot guess from a =
group to an individual. So, racial differences cannot be judged based on =
a one-on-one scheme. You can only take averages between large groups. =
This is no problem with physical attributes, which can be determined =
without problem. But any mental attribute poses some problems. Most =
psychologial test systems are "localized", developped to be used only on =
specific groups with certain caracteristics. IMO there does not exist =
any objective method of determining intelligence or other mental =
capabilities regardless of social and/or educational background.

You could guess from historic and ethnic development on the advantages =
and disadvantages of civilizations. You could say that, based on tight =
population and less-than optimum living conditions, the European =
civilizationswas forced to evolve to avoid extinction, thus came =
technical and civilizational advance. China, as an opposite, resolved =
the internal wars and became a static society for over 1.500 years, =
because lack of threat caused a lack of evolution. As Biology teaches =
us, evolution is never without an external factor. This applies to =
humans, too.

In an ideal world where there would be no longer war and hatred, where =
people could live together in peace, will there be any evolution?

To believe is not to think about it. Religion is a convenient way of =

In my oppinion man is only limited in his evolution by his own =

taboos? Like, perhaps, cloning humans is not allowed by human ethics. Or =
Genetic Engineering. It is not allowed to modify human DNA. Everyone is =

had said, "Hey, if we make a car that runs faster than a man, we'll have =
accidents and people will die," we would still travel by horse. The =
danger is not technology, it is what we make of it. We must take the =
risk that any technology bears the danger of abuse, but isn't the use in =
most cases of greater value?

The Renaissance in Italy has emancipated science from religious =
doctrine. Why should we fall back into medieval times? This one and =

Hollywood is like a whore. It will do anything for money. I have stopped =

"Simple" states mostly turn out to be less than libertarian. Any simple =
form of government is to some extent a dictatorship. The more you want =
to get away from that, the more complex it wil be. The "giant pleasure =
machine" would be something like "Brave New World", which might be =
heaven for some, but not for me.
Well, it might be possible that we end up somewhere between "Brave New =
World" and "1984", but only if we don't fight against it.

Checks and Balances exist in the form of evolution. If any part of the =
system gets too strong, sooner or later there will evolve someone to =
prey on it. If not, it will grow stronger and stronger. Then, =
eventually, it will fall of its own weight.

Biological evolution doesn't seem to happen anymore, and even in the
relatively stable societies of the past it probably happened more
in the times of peace (selection of partners based on physical and
mental features) than at war, where the factors were largely random
on individual level.

As for the social and technological evolution, it appears to be determined
more by economic and social competition now than territorial/physical
conflicts.  And peace seems to be an important prerequisite for economic
competition in diverse areas, long-term investment, and innovation.
People can still intensely compete on the software market, the Olympics,
on scientific conferences and bestseller lists, without cutting each
other's throats.

Well, given that patents only last about 20 years, why don't you go out, get
a copy of the patent, and start selling 200-year lightbulbs? Or is this just
another of those mythical patents that the evil corporations bought up so 
no-one could use them?

Thanks for publishing info on the book by Virginia Postrel.  What I was
trying to do was upload an excellent essay that she published in the
Washington Post this weekend, but my format was not done properly.  I'm
going to download it again and place it directly into a posting in the next
few days.

Mike Cheponis <mac@Wireless.Com> and I have been having a
discussion off-list that I thought would make a good thread for
discussion.

"Is the Death Penalty Extropian?"

We welcome all comments on this, please state your reasons as
thoroughly as you can.

First of all, by definition, the death penalty is not murder.

Murder: 1) to kill a person unlawfully and with malice. (Websters
new world dictionary) 

Second,I feel that the death penalty is the appropriate punishment
for the unlawful and malicious killing of a fellow human being.

I feel that the death penalty has it's problems however, it is
often applied with a racial bias, and when it is decided upon, it
takes too long to administer.

I do not feel deterrence is a prerequisite for it's existence, but
I feel that if it was applied fairly, equitably, and quickly, it
could have a deterrent effect.

Supporting arguments for/against?

While this paper is interesting, I don't see how it strictly relates.
Specifically, I don't see how it demonstrates the existence of a "Green"
spearate from all green things, or even a "mind" which is beyond its
substrate.

Did I miss something you wanted me to look at more closely?

No. Probably not.

Reason: As an extropian it is important to have a rational humanist outlook.
This means that a humans life and time, in other words it's freedom, is the
only thing of real value there is to that human.

As rationalists and humanists we should ALWAYS strive for a win/win
situation in any human to human conflict. A win/win will not always be
possible, but death penalty makes it shure that there wil be a win/loose
scenario whether the acused/sentenced is guilty or not.

I am not much for murderers, rapists etc. and instinctively I too feel that
they should be killed for the safety of the rest of society.

Basically any sane, intelligent adult member of society is an assets to
society and adds to the economic surplus.

You can argue that a violent criminal is not that, and I would have to
agree. But wouldn't it be better to lock up the criminal until he can be
rewired with nanotech drugs or something else? This way everyone would gain,
and there could be some sort of compensation to the wictims family when the
reformed criminal returned to society.

Of course if somebody is uncureable it is another story, but uncurability is
a very unextropian concept ... right?

Speaking as a consequentialist, I would have to strongly disagree on this
point.  The death penalty is acceptable if and only if it is an effective
deterrent.

As for whether it really is effective or not, I'm not certain.  Some tell
me yes, others tell me no.  I think the jury's still out on this one.

And, I should also add, I don't think there is or should be an Extropian
position on the death penalty.

There are already lightbulbs that are warrantied for 80 years. They use arrays
of white LEDs. These are pretty energy efficient as well. The reason why they
aren't more widely used is partly because  they  cost $30 each or more, and for
most all such devices, because they are depreciated almost completely within 3
years, and most facilities are remodeled every 15-25 years, lighting fixtures
typically get junked in the process and replaced with new ones. Another factor
to consider is that internal discount rates depreciate the value of savings that
far into the future. The savings you earn in the first 2 years account for over
half of the discounted savings, while the savings in the first 5 years account
for 80% or more, etc. Anything beyond 10 years is a waste of money, given todays
growth rates. I beleive that long life devices like this are only worthwhile
when the long term growth rate is below 1%.

I think what this issue boils down to is the question of how to minimize the
total number of deaths.  Obviously a repressive regime that enforces a death
penalty for numerous crimes will cause many unnecessary deaths.  The hard
question is whether you are better off applying the death penalty to a small
number of particularly serious offenses, or to none at all.

I think there is a case to be made for executing criminals who are guilty of
murder, especially those who have been convicted of multiple offenses.
Justifying execution for any other offense is much more difficult.

Ah, the death penalty! One of my favorite topics...
I dunno whether it's Extropian (only Max knows ;-) , but it certainly
is rational.

Quite right.

Yes. I'd like to add that IMO, the punishment should fit the crime;
serial killers/mass murderers/people who tortured their victims etc.
should receive harsher death penalties than someone who kills
just one victim in a relatively humane way. I also support corporal
punishment for violent offenders, btw.

Of course, the whole justice system would have to be revised 
before any executions can start.
Main changes:
--"insanity" plea is abolished.  
--no age limit
--no gender/race/whatever bias
--convictions on hard evidence only, such as forensics,
video/audio footage (nation-wide camera system in public
places with central databanks)
--lay juries are abolished
--executions within a week or so after trial, unless hard
evidence is presented by the defence
--standard option of cryopreservation upon execution
--"manslaughter" as a result of aggression (like beating
someone up without intent to kill) or severe risk taking
(drunk driving, unsafe gun handling) is punished as
murder (death penalty).
--killing a cryonicist in such a way that his brain is
damaged beyond any conceivable repair (i.e. burning,
rotting to a pulp, exploding etc.) should be punished 
especially severely (slow & painful death).
--same for destroying a brain in suspension
--(option) executions done publicly in sport stadiums 
(tickets required), footage sold to commercial TV stations 
etc. Money made by these means can help to finance the 
justice system, and a part can go to (family of) the victims.

For good measure: 
--all "victimless crimes" legalized. Police can focus on the real
crimes, and much less officers are needed (you save $$$).
--national (global?) DNA and fingerprint databank (for *all* citizens),
of course with very restricted access and firm penalties for abuse.
--jails must be automated. No physical contact between guards and 
inmates or between the inmates themselves. 1 person per cell,
wholesome food and possibility for exercise, but no recreation.
Possibly self-sustained labor camps.
--massive centralized surveillance system, for evidence and prevention.
All government agents, including the police and judiciary, must wear
video/audio equipment at all times while on the job.
--heavily automated justice system (one for the whole country, or
better yet, world). Precedents are binding, as consequence is one
of the pillars of justice.(*)
--society (especially the economy) must be automated as much as 
possible so that everyone can receive a decent standard of living
*without having to work*. 
--the press is not allowed to reveal details of criminal investigations 
and trials, unless cleared by the authorities. Names are only released
after sentencing.
--right to keep and bear arms
--right to kill intruders (on private property)
--right to kill in self-defense
--right to hold a duel (in specially designated places or on private
property that's sufficiently isolated. The entire event must be
recorded by camera, all involved must participate out of free will).
--people who fear that they might commit a (violent) crime because
of "urges", can get free treatment from the government.

(*)[Justice: punishing harmful acts in a consequent manner and so that
the punishment fits the crime]
 
> I do not feel deterrence is a prerequisite for it's existence, but

Agreed. The surveillance system in combination with relatively
few but firmly enforced laws should virtually wipe out crime.
I bet that with a system like this you could even put Russia back 
on its feet...

Conclusion: if you want to do capital punishment right, it has to
be part of a much larger package of progressive and rational
amendments. In the justice system as seen in for example
America today, I wouldn't recommend capital punishment.

Define it however you want.  Killing another person is murder however
you want to slice it.

I'm glad you feel that way, I do not however share your opinion.

Yes it is often applied with a racial bias, but this is the least of its
problems.

What evidence do you have to support this?

> Supporting arguments for/against?

I have several arguments against the death penalty on *extropian*
grounds.  However, since I'm on my way to a meeting, I'll have to
provide my long answer at another time.

Extropianism is about increasing extropy.  The death penalty is a quick,
easy and lazy way to rid yourself of a problem that does not have an
easy alternative solution.  You would think that as extropians, we'd be
creative and intelligent enough to come up with another solution to
increasing the extropy of otherwise entropic (criminal) individuals.
I'll comment more later...

Noo... MP3s may be nice, but they are lower quality. Why not
buy a Slink-e from nirvis.com and one or more 200 CD changers
and permanently locate your music somewhere with a nice net
connection. Then you could stream from the pc hooked up to
the slink-e and listen to your music anywhere in the world
that has the bandwidth. There probably needs to be a company
that provides this service... hmm.

My father, I think, has the best take on this subject:

"When I can trust the government to deliver my mail, then I'll think about

Now you just have to explain why "rewiring" criminals is somehow better than
killing them. As I see it, there are just certain kinds of people you can't
share a planet with, and you have to either exile them, kill them mentally
with this kind of reprogramming, or kill them physically. I don't see why
killing them mentally is an improvement over killing them physically, and
personally I'd argue for precisely the opposite.

Your argument seems to be that you can reprogram them into a 'useful member
of society' and that society will benefit from that. I find the idea of a
legal system deciding what mental software people should run utterly abhorrent,
regardless of any economic arguments. Given a choice between physical death 
or involuntary reprogramming into slave labor, I'll take death, thanks.

Interestingly, all the fictional treatments of this I can think of (1984, 
Clockwork Orange, Babylon 5) seem to agree with that.

Is this re-wiring a criminal's brain against his will really better than
executing him?

First, it raises very slippery, and currently unanswerable, questions about
the nature of identity - if we rewrite a major portion of your personality
to make sure you don't kill anyone else, are you really still you?  If the
answer is no, then we've just picked a high-tech method of execution.

Second, do you really think its a good idea for government to have the
authority to "fix" criminals?  Since there is no way to create an objective,
measurable definition of sanity that an arbitrary group of bureaucrat can
agree on, what we would end up with is sanity by committee.  After all, as
long as we're convincing you not to be a murderer, we may as well make sure
you aren't a rapist or a traitor either.  There is a natural tendency for
this kind of "treatment" to mutate into organized mind control over time,
and the only way I can see of avoiding the problem is to prohibit
involuntary personality alteration completely.

> "Is the Death Penalty Extropian?"

	I think the death penalty is violently against extropianism.
Too me, within extropianism, exists the possibility that some day,
some way or another, all things will be possible for all people.  As
long as there is not some heaven that is perfect for all people, the
extropic process is not completed and we will all simply have more
work to do to get to that state.  Central to this idea is the
possibility of unconditional love for all and a desire for all to do
all for all.

	Of course, as long as we are severely constrained by limits,
as long as we are mortal and so on, we can't yet give everyone
everything they want.  For example, if in the distant future, I have
10 copies of my physical body out and around all consciously sharing
experiences, and a back up of a particular body and all it's
memories..., If some freekko really wanted to "murder" one of them (I
doubt this would really be the case unless he was broken or insane or
whatever which is something that person doesn't really want...) I'd
possibly be willing to let him murder one of me.  (In other words, in
the perfect universe, I'd be immortal through backups or whatever so
murder would have no real meaning or would not be possible) But at the
moment, with our restrictions and mortality I can't afford to let
someone murder my one and only body.  So, for the time being, we must
physically constrain such to prevent them from doing harm to us that
we cannot yet afford.

	But I think we should or can at least hope for unconditional
love for everyone and hope that some day we can give them everything
they want no matter who they are.  (In reality, anyone that thinks
they want to murder someone is really insane or sick, or broken
because there is no logically rational reason for wanting to kill
someone, especially in a world without limits, or at least I hope that
such is reality.)  But until we can afford to do that (or until we
know how to help them be cured of such insane desire as wanting to
kill others...), we must simply constrain them or do whatever is
required to limit them from taking from us, that which we are not yet
able to provide while giving them as much as possible which would at
least include letting them live in a prison cell, providing cryonic
preservation and so on when possible, until more is possible.

	Such may cost a lot, but hey, he aint heavy, he's my brother.
Someday I hope to be able to afford to help him get what he really
wants (or to help him discover that he doesn't really want to
murder...)  and that we can all live together perfectly without
casting out, killing, or putting in hell..., anyone.

	I certainly don't think hateful hellfire and damnation, death
penalty... doctrines have anything to do with extropianism.  As an
extropian I look forward to, hope for, and most importantly strive for
the day when we can find out how to eliminate all forced or violent
segregation and deprivation...  I think we really all want to give all
to all and I hope that some day such will be possible some way or
another.  I don't think any real extropian will ever give up until we
ALL get there.  Killing someone, for whatever reson, is simply
hatfully giving up and moving in the wrong (as in anti extropy)
direction.

My basic position on this is that no one, and particularly not the
government, should have the power to kill an individual under the auspices
of the law.  The primary reason being that I have a serious problem with
surrendering control of my life to any other self-interested party.  

However, I have no problem with using lethal force in self-defense, for the
same reason mentioned above.

if your CD juke boxes are able to recognize mp3 CDR it's a rather good
strategy... if not that's a far too much expensive one. i would prefer
to use some huge hard drives for such process, such as the new IBM 20
gigs that will appear soon. Interesting side effect : you can copy
easily your files and thus make backups of your cds, far much secure,
and this strategy is useful for other kind of files too.

The problem of digitizing private media is primarily one of efficiency. =

MP3-Encoding works quite well, anyway, CD sound is far from being =

The biggest problem, however, is not storing, but retrieving =

	I think It is a little better, but anything "forced" is still
hideous.  Occasionally, I find or feel some deep primal urge to kill
or hurt someone down inside.  This is not something I really want.
There is no rational reason why anyone would really want such.  I will
not really become what I really want to be until I can remove this, by
my free will, not by force.  At least can't we hope and try as if such
is possible?

mark@unicorn.com noted:

	But this is all simply faithless theodicy-zing, attempting to
justify, rationalize and accept evil in the face of some already
powerful God.  Must we faithlessly give up and, rather than hoping
such can all be overcome by good means (any force is not a good
means), and instead must we try to accept and justify evil as such
fictional stories attempt to do?  (If God can't overcome it, then we
must accept and try to justify it as is done in such fiction, and how
can we ever have a hope of overcoming it if God can't?...)

	As extropians, we do not believe that there is already an all
powerful God.  This frees us so we can still have faith and hope that
when there is or when we are powerful Gods, and maybe even sooner...,
it will be possible, through some good means, to eliminate all such
evil.

	An extropian doesn't faithlessly give up and try to accept and
justify evil, he tries to find a good way to over come it always
having faith that all such is possible one good way or another.

Long-lasting bulbs already exist on the market.

I've lived in my house for five years, and in all that time none of
the lightbulbs in our family room have burned out.  We spend all our
evenings in that room, and the lights are on from sunset until about
11 PM, every night.

That's probably 10,000+ hours on those bulbs.  There are 8 bulbs in
recessed ceiling fixtures, of the floodlight type, and all of them
are still going strong.  I wish I knew where the former owner bought
them (and when he did!).

But what about the victim?

Since I believe the only current possibility of life after death
involves cryonics, the debt owed the victim is infinite. 

I postulate that the death penalty is the only just solution for
the unlawful and malicious nonrecoverable termination of a fellow
human being.

Tall redwoods condense fog, providing the water needed to support the
size of themselves and other redwoods.  Extropian relevance?
Unexpected effects, especially for those who don't care about the

probably it would be better to give the choice... if i had to choose
between death and rewiring... well depend of the rewiring of course.. a
priori, i would probably prefer rewiring (except if they want to
transform my head in a pain inducer or other non reversible atrocities).
If find the death really abhorrent.

You asked some other questions too but near as I can tell they all boil down to
the same thing. If an intelligent Turing machine is in a particular logical
state, that is, if it has a particular thought, and sometime much later it or
another machine finds itself in exactly the same logical state, are there two
thoughts or only one? I would say there is only one, a thought can not detect
the passage of time so that can not differentiate it. Besides, a thought should
not be held responsible the machine that happens to think it. That's why
Nietzsche's Eternal Return would not ease the sting of death for me in the
slightest even if it were proven to be correct. If I'm locked in a jail cell I
don't feel free because I can walk endlessly in a 5-foot diameter circle. Of
course in the real world we never see intelligent Turing machines in exactly the
same state.

As for consciousness, it must be an unavoidable byproduct of intelligence,
otherwise random mutation and natural selection would never have never come up
with it.

Well as I plan to rewire myself in the hopefully not so distant future I can
hardly se it as a threat to anyone.

They don't have to be erased, only changed, and change is not the same as
death. change is a consequence of life. Or else going to bed, sleeping and
thereby loosing your conscience and then waking up again tomorrow would
equal death. Even living from moment to moment changes you subtly.

We are just talking about the pace of change. As far as I understand jails
in the US are called correctional facilities. In this there is also implied
a reprogramming. Just not as effective.

It could be as simple as falling asleep with a terrible anger inside you and
then waking up happy but still understanding the consequences of what you
had done.

Never said a word about slave labour. Didn't even say involentary
reprogramming. If you find it important then give them the choice between
death and change. Fine by me.

Well ... it reminds me of the arguments against tempering with genes because
it changes who we are, and it's unnatural. No matter that agriculture has
been changing genes for centuries now. Albeit at a much lower pace.

Btw: the word natural should be forbidden in any extropian/transhuman
conversation. Nothing that we want to do is natural.

thats certainly an argument, but not very usefull in practice as far as i
can see. The victim won't be able to recollect only the relatives. And the
debt owed to them would no doubt be enourmous, but probably less than
infinite.

I don't see how you can call it a solution. What problem does it solve?

I submit that the death penalty, if adopted as part of a well-designed
justice system, can be a net positive influence.  If, however, it is
misapplied or applied as part of a misguided system, it becomes a strong
negative influence.

In an extropic world the death penalty is, in a sense, an infinite
punishment, since the defendant is robbed of a potentially eternal
existence.  Therefore it should never be an option for crimes that do not
involve loss of life.  For cases involving clearly accidental death it also
seems inappropriate, even if some lesser crime was being committed at the
time.

Even for actual murder cases, there are often extenuating circumstances.
Many crimes are committed in a fit of passion, or by people who are
incapable of understanding what they are doing.  Each case would have to be
examined individually, but in most cases lesser punishments seem more
appropriate.

The cases where the death penalty is truly called for are those that polite
society does not like to acknowledge.  To put it bluntly: there are people
out there who are perfectly willing to murder as many people as they need to
in order to achieve their goals.  They know exactly what they are doing, and
they don't care.  They have made a rational decision that their goal is more
important than any number of human lives, and they are willing to act on
that decision.

These are the people who should be executed.  If you catch such a man and
kill him, you are responsible for only one death.  If you let him go, there
will be dozens of deaths (in some cases hundreds, or even thousands -
terrorists are a good example of this).  Punishing him won't make him stop,
it will simply make him more careful.  Life imprisonment is impossible -
we're talking about immortals here, right?  Involuntary reprogramming simply
makes you guilty of a different crime, and it leads inexorably to problems
that are far worse than a few mass murderers.  Since there don't seem to be
any other alternatives, I think execution is the only viable option.

So can I. Green is defined as a general band of monochromatic light
wavelengths. A 'pure' green is a source of light which is emits completely
in one or more of these wavelengths. If Green did not exist, then there
would be a gap in the spectrum which would be physically impossible  for any
matter in this universe to emit photons in. Since there is no such gap, then
therefore green exists.

Saying that green does not exist merely because you cannot see it is rather
subjectively circular. Its like asking a deer if the color red exists. Since
a deer does not have cones in its eyes which can detect light peaking in the
red band, the the deer would not consider the color 'red' to exist, which is
why the color 'blaze orange' (defined as 574-605.5 nm) is such an effective
safety color for hunters to use.... As far as the deer is concerned,  red
wavelengths either show up as a dim yellow, or not at all.

Nor is it sinful to kill, for those of you still religious in the
judeo-christian-muslim area. The original hebrew for the ten
commandments said, "thou shalt not murder." Killing is quite alright
when done is a right and proper manner.

Nor is it an effective deterrent. Prof. John Lott in his book _More
Guns, Less Crime_ found that the death penalty, as it exists today,
provides little to no deterrent effect on violent crime. Contrasting
this with the huge deterrent effect that allowing law abiding citizens
to carry concealed weapons has on violent crimes, we can surmise that
the only effective form of death penalty is one which is exacted at the
crime scene. No technicalities, no appeals.

They are either compact fluorescent light bulbs, or low voltage halogen
light bulbs. Both are relatively long lived, at 15,000-30,000 hours.
You can buy them for anywhere from $5.00 up to $20.00 depending on
wattage and life. You can buy them at most lighting stores these days,
as well as most mega hardware stores like Eagle, Home Base, etc. If you
can't find a place that sells them, contact the conservation office at
your electric utility. They usually can point you to a local supplier. A
cheap way to make normal incandescent bulbs last a long time is to buy
bulbs made for 130-135 volts, and run them on your 110-120 volt wiring.
Since they are burning at 90% or less of capacity, you can increase the
life of the bulb by as much as ten times. However, you will burn more
energy for the amount of light you do produce than you would with a
shorter life  normal voltage bulb, so there is a trade off....

	This "green" electromagnetic radiation of a certain frequency
you are talking about has nothing to do with this conversation.  If
you put a person who has had his eyes surgically removed in a room
with absolutely no light of any frequency in it at all, and
electro/chemically stimulate his optic nerve identically to the way a
normal person's eyes would do to his optic nerve when outside that
dark room looking at a green light, the person with no eyes in a room
with no light of any frequency will have a "green" visual experience
indistinguishable from the person outside the room looking at the
light.  Light of any wavelength has nothing to do with this
experience.  We use red to represent 700 nm light.  One is the
representee, the other is the representor.  One is the initial cause
of the cause and effect chain of perception, the other is the final
result.  They are two very different physical phenomenon.  One is
beyond the eye, the other occurs in the primary visual cortex of the
brain and has nothing to do with light other than it is good at
intelligently representing it.

	There is no color, smell, sound, warmth... or pain beyond our
senses; only the electromagnetic radiation, chemical content,
acoustical vibrations, kinetic energy of molecules... and bodily
damage our brains merely arbitrarily represent with such phenomenon.

I've heard a figure of 180 for Einstein, but I don't know the source 
or how reliable it is whether they used a standard deviation of 16 or 
24. I know there are IQ figures available for the leading Nazi war 
criminals (though not for Hitler I think). They were typically well 
above average, as one would expect for successful politicians. I 
think Herman Goering's IQ turned out to be especially high and that 
he took some pride in this during his captivity. A few famous 
personalities are members in Mensa, so their IQs should have been 
measured at some stage (e.g. Asimov).

An exceptional IQ is by no means a guarantee or even a strong 
indication of exceptional performance. On the other hand, I think 
exceptional performance in many fields require a high minimum IQ. Any 
IQ points above this minimum IQ (needless to say there is surely a 
considerable grey area) will perhaps not correlate strongly with 
performance. The minimum IQ varies from field to field. For a Nobel 
prize in theoretical physics, you presumably need at least two 
standard deviations above average (plus a knack for mathematics, the 
ability to concentrate on abstract things for extended periods of 
time etc.). A painter like Picasso could get away with much less, I 
think. (Of course, Picasso neeeds other talents, which however may 
only weakly correlate with IQ.)

Though the field still holds some fascination for me, I have become 
more skeptical of the relevance of IQ in recent years. I was a member 
of Mensa for a year, and I have to say I failed to detect any form of 
intellectual excellence in the people I met. Perhaps my contrast 
group was skewed though, since many people I normally interact with 
are professors or postgrads. Maybe if I had been living in a mining 
community instead I would have found the Mensa people incredibly 
bright.

BTW, contrary to what was said on another thread some weeks back, 
there seems to be a fairly substantial correlation between IQ and 
brain size. I've heard figures of correlation coefficients of up to 
.4. It would be interesting to try correlate the size and complexity 
of specific cortical areas with performance measures of the sort of 
activity they are thought to be responsible for. Maybe one could find 
even greater coefficients then.

Years ago I saw a list of estimated IQs of various historical figures,
mostly 20th-century, I think.  James Joyce was at the top, with an
estimated IQ of 200.

http://www.mcs.net/~jorn/html/jj.html is a page entitled "IQ Infinity:
The Unknown James Joyce", but it does not attempt to justify the proposed
IQ value...

I'm very sorry, Ken, but I will not be responding to further posts from you
on this topic. Your references are simply not relevant. The wavtrace stuff is
a point-to-multipoint system intended for metropolitan-area bypass.
The gear almost certainly costs tens to hundreds of thousands of
dollars per site and involves big rooftop antennas. It's cheap
only when compared to running new fiber in a city, and the total bandwidth
is on the order of 100Mbps for all stations. Don't confuse the carrier
frequency with the data rate. So, a 256-node system would permit each node
to generate about .5Mbps (albiet broadcast) at a comms cost on the order of
>10K$/node. The 100BaseT grid permits a total bandwitch of 1.6Gbps with
a per-node contrib of 7Mbps at a current, off-the shelf cost of <50$/node.
furthermore, the multicast radio scheme scales poorly, while the grid
scales well. The grid is only the simplest of a family of doubly-connected
node topologies, and there are obviously higher-order toplologies. The
current $50/node is high compared to purpose-built dual-port NICs
on the motherboard, and 100Mbps is easy to beat, so the off-the-shelf
grid is easy to beat if you care to.

It's been a while since I had the luxury of sitting down to write, 
but here goes:

The death penalty is indeed a proper solution to the problem of those 
persons who have shown themselves to be dangerous to others and 
incapable of being salvaged. In the future, we may have the means of 
repairing the mental problems of these individuals, but for now, I 
believe it is kinder to put them down as one would a vicious animal, 
without suffering.

The biggest problem I have with our present system is that the 
penalty is applied more as a method of earning political brownie 
points for prosecutors than as either a deterrent or as justice. 
Witness the many persons released from Death Row in the recent past, 
and the present situations in Illinois where more than a few times 
sentences have been overturned based on flawed prosecutions or missed 
evidence.

Here, some of our lawmakers have come out against a proposed 
moratorium on executions, sayiong that 'it's too bad if an innocent 
dies, but we have to act tough'. 

Until the justice system can make absolutely certain decisions of 
guilt and motivation, I would advocate eliminating the death penalty.

well. yes and no. If this is a debate about platonic reality then it is I

I've seen such lists from time to time.  If I recall correcly, Goethe
tops the lists I've seen with 200+.  I did a quick search for pages
mentioning Goethe, Einstein and IQ and found "Estimated IQs of the
greatest geniuses" at  <http://home8.swipnet.se/~w-80790/Index.htm>.

I'm reminded of these lists whenever I realize that a person I'm
dealing with (presumably of average intelligence) just doesn't
get something in the way I do with a measly ~140 IQ.  I wonder about
things that I just don't get that someone with a 180 IQ could.  I'm
not fixated on IQ by a long shot, but I am quite sure that I am
missing out -- and so is someone with a 180 IQ, just to a slightly
lesser extent.  I want a Jupiter brain so I can think wonderful,
beautiful, amazing thoughts.  I don't want to colonize the universe,
I just want an intellectual high.

I don't think there's any definitive extropian position on the death
penalty or any necessarily moral reason to object to it. If it is a useful
deterrent then it should be no more controversial than any other means of
reducing crime. This is in a society with limited government. Of course
there are problems such as racial bias and convicting the wrong person etc
but none of these should be given an infinite weighting under a proper
rational economic perspective just as we don't give an infinite weighting
to what *might* go wrong for other criminal penalties. One also has to
trade these off against the lives which might be saved if the death
pentaty were a useful deterrent.

What about in an polycentric legal order? I think there would be something
resembling a death penalty anyway which undercuts the notion that you can
decisively prove that the death penalty is objectionable on libertarian
grounds. In a society based solely on private law, some hard core criminal
types would be such a huge liability that eventually no jurisdiction would
want to have them. They would be outlaws and anyone from any jurisdiction
would be able to kill them without suffering any legal consequences
whatsoever.

What if the choice is not between death and total personality
reprogramming? What if a violent criminal is given a choice: Either stay in
jail for decades (or be executed), or undergo gene therapy or some other
treatment that gives them better impulse control.

Reminds me of Alfred Bester's novel "The Demolished Man."
My solution is this:  anyone convicted of a sufficiently heinous crime 
to deserve capital punishment should be locked up for life, with two 
alternatives offered; painless euthanasia anytime s/he requests it, 
and prefrontal lobotomy (or a more efficient/less intrusive future 
equivalent) followed by freedom.  If, after lobotomy and release, the 
criminal commits an equally reprehensible act, s/he should be 
reincarcerated, with the alternatives reduced to two (life 
imprisonment or euthanasia).       Joe

No. You can define "green" as such for a particular purpose, but this
definition will pretty quickly run against people's intuitive
understanding. You can perceive things as green with a different or no
spectrum at all involved.

Before people start philosophizing about color, I strongly suggest they
read this book:

    C.L. Hardin
    Color for Philosophers
    Hackett, 1988
    ISBN 0-87220-039-6

Highly recommended.

Contrary to what you might expect from the title, the book is not much
about philsophy. Rather, it summarizes what is scientifically known
about human color perception. That's quite a bit, and probably a lot
that you don't know yet. As the author writes in somewhat politer words,
you better know already established facts before you philosophize on a
topic, otherwise you run the risk of spouting only so much garbage.

Sorry, pet peeve of mine. Human color vision is *complicated*, and
people, including eye doctors, generally know very little about it. That
cone and rod stuff you learn in school hardly scratches the surface.

I read a small story in my local newspaper a few days ago, it seems
that a man was watching a movie in a theater and got up to get some
popcorn, in doing so he accidentally stepped on a strangers foot. The
other man decided that his best course of action would be to pull out a
knife and slice open the poor fellow's jugular vein. Other moviegoers
were showered in his blood and he died before they could even stop the
projector.

A creature capable of such an act is far more dangerous than somebody
who planed a murder for a year in order to get a million dollars. To my
mind he's more contemptible too, if I get murdered I hope it's over
something more important than stepping on somebody's foot.

As for life in prison without parole, I don't think it's a viable
alternative to death. In the USA there are 1.7 million people in jail,
if I'm one of them and have already been convicted of murder then I
have no reason not to do what I enjoy doing and kill again. I have
nothing to lose, they won't kill me and they can't imprison me for two
lifetimes.

It's been pretty well discredited as prejudice conjecture and pure nonsense
but for whatever it's worth the most famous study of this sort was done by
Dr. Catherine Morris Cox about 50 years ago. She gave Goethe top marks with
an IQ of 210, Newton only got 190 the same as Voltaire, and Galileo a measly
185. Leonardo DaVinci got 180 and Napoleon 145. Personally I wish I had an IQ
of 105 because then according to Cox I'd be the equal of astronomer Nicolas
Copernicus and the greatest experimental physicist of all time Michael Faraday.
Sort of makes you wonder what Cox's IQ was.

How can you decide what is good for everyone else?  You can't.  So how can you say
that killing someone is better for them than re-programming them?  Let them
decide.  They can be subjected to re-programming or they can push a button at the
convenient cyanide dispensary and kill themselves.  The choice is theirs.

That is *your* choice!  And I agree that its a murky area deciding what is mentally
sound or not.  But searching for answers there is much more humane than killing
them without a choice.  Otherwise we are creating a system based on vengeance, not
rational inquiry, experimentation and possible advancement.

Either you are hallucinating or you know of some 'magical' technology
I'm unaware of.  Since when is killing a persons murderer capable of
resurrecting the deceased?  Since I don't of any such device, killing
someone will *not* bring the dead back to life.  So how is this 'death
penalty' even beginning to pay the debt to the victim?  They are dead!
It may feel good to exercise your savage lust for vengeance.  But it is
neither rational or just, let alone extropian.  It is vengeance pure and
simple.

Otherwise, please demonstrate how the death penalty will pay back this
infinite debt to the victim (since they are already dead), and how it is
anything other than an acting out of ones need for vengeance.

You claimed it is rational, but you have yet to demonstrate it.  All you've

Of course, the whole justice system would have to be revised
before any executions can start.

So your advocating that we start killing 6 year olds?  How compassionate of
you!

<Den Otter>
--video/audio footage (nation-wide camera system  in public

Extropianism is about decentralizing knowledge and power.  Your advocacy of
creating a centralized databank is antithetical to this.

<den Otter>
--lay juries are abolished

<Paul>
That my friend is a slippery slide towards totalitarianism.  A jury of ones

smacks of a system ruled not by people, but by decree.  Very un-extropian.


<Den Otter>
--executions within a week or so after trial, unless hard
evidence is presented by the defense.

<Paul>
So your advocating a system 'guilty until proven innocent'?  If so, I have no
further comment, because your entire argument rests on a value system that
does not value the rights of an individual.  Very Cardassian.

<den Otter>
--killing a cryonicist in such a way that his brain is
damaged beyond any conceivable repair (i.e. burning,
rotting to a pulp, exploding etc.) should be punished
especially severely (slow & painful death).

<Paul>
Again, you are advocating vengeance through *torture*.  How is this rational
or extropian?  How will torture solve the problem? Your position is becoming
increasingly silly and absurd!

<den Otter>
--massive centralized surveillance system, for evidence and prevention.

<Paul>
Again, how is this extropian?  Your advocating a centralized system - and who
decides who will manage this system?

Not uite; there's also the matter of deterrence involved.  Executing a 
murderer may not deter anyone else from murdering, but it definitely 
and absolutely deters the murderer.  A dead murderer will never kill 
again.                          Joe

Simple logic would seem to indicate the death penalty is not extropian.  To
wit:


Entropy  not=  Extropy.
Death  =  Entropy.
Death Penalty  =  Entropy Penalty.
Death Penalty  not=  Extropy.

Quite true, it certainly stops any more entropy (murder) from occurring, but
it doesn't increase extropy either.  A more extropic thing to do, once an
involuntary irreversible entropic act (murder) has been committed, is finding
out why these people were murdered in the first place. By keeping these people
alive for study and possible rehabilitation, we increase our chances of
deterring murder at its source - weather it be bad genes, upbringing, economic
status, or what have you.

A perfect example was in 1993 when a 19 year old boy of Texas, who with no
prior history of sociopathy, mental illness or criminal activity, one night
decided to murder his next door neighbor with a machete.  Not only did he
commit this gruesome act, but no one, not even himself knows why he did it.
During the hearings to determining whether he should receive the death penalty
or not, he sat crying in his lap for the entire 5 days of the proceedings.
His psychologist, school teachers (where he was a straight-A student), nearly
his entire family and most of his friends appeared in the court pleading for
the jury to spare his life.  In the end, the gruesome pictures of the corpse
were enough to turn the jury in favor of the death penalty.

On pure Utilitarian grounds, think of the amount we could learn from this
young man, about why someone would suddenly, without prior warning, turn into
a violent killer.  It's quite possible we could determine through careful
scientific study, why this boy killed his neighbor in cold blood.  Perhaps
from such study we could gain valuable knowledge about ourselves and our
society in the process, and perhaps prevent other such people from 'going over
the deep end' themselves at a later date.  This is certainly much more
extropian and longer-term life-enhancing than killing a prime specimen right
after his gruesome act.

IMHO,  rational, scientific and extropian.

I assume the playback would take place on a Turing machine as robust as the
recorded subject since only a device equal in complexity could perform a
faithful playback.  I'm further assuming that by "instantiation" you are
meaning that the process of playing back the recorded machinations of a
conscious intelligence instantiates that conscious intelligence (assuming
defined steps of computation are involved).  If I'm getting any of this
wrong, let me know and I'll revise my observations.

The example above is not instantiation of a conscious intelligence.  The
playback machine is not given the chance to experience its own consciousness
and allow that experience to develop its mind.  The playback process,
assuming the recording was at the appropriate detail, would constantly
overwrite every connection, memory, heuristic, etc.  There would be no
instance of consciousness in the playback machine.  Once the playback ends,
however, and if the recorded mind is not deleted from the playback machine,
it could be conscious then.  Going forward, starting with the final mind
state of the recording, the playback machine (no longer playing a recording)
would be a developing mind.

>Suppose you run the Turing machine again, except this time you compare it

This example appears to be instantiation of a conscious intelligenc, albeit
one in a very miserable plight.  The difference with this example is that
the tolerance of difference, at least momentarily, implies the playback
machine is given the chance to develop on its own but only those
developments that compare with the recording are allowed to remain.  A
similar scenario could be the ultimate form of mind control.  You are
reading the manifesto of a new totalitarian group.  This group happens to
possess the power to monitor every change in a mind and manipulate it if it
chooses.  The group monitors your mind as you read its manifesto.  If you
react negatively or reject a concept, they change your mind accordingly to
agree with the concept.  You are conscious, but the trajectory of your mind
over time is constantly being adjusted to direct it down a particular path.


I found the analogy of a musical artist improvising a cadenza helpful in
thinking through these.  An artist has been asked to improvise a cadenza on
a guitar lasting one minute.  The artist does so, employing all of her
dexterity, musical knowledge and creativity.  A recording is made of the
cadenza.  Additionally, the cadenza is meticulously transcribed (every note,
nuance, timbre change, etc.)
Do any of the processes below exhibit creativity, i.e. instantiate
creativity?

1. Playing back the recording. Answer: Obviously no.

2. An equally-skilled musician performs the cadenza using the meticulous
transcription. Answer: No, the musician is employing musical knowledge and
dexterity but not creativity.  The musician could employ creativity but is
not.

3. The original musician replays the performance using the transcription.
Answer: No, for the same reason as in #2.

4. A musician is told to improvise a cadenza, if his improvisation differs
from the original improvisation he is killed. Answer: Yes, the musician is
employing creativity. Whether the results of his creativity matches that of
the original musician is an ancillary concern. (Notably, this example does
not completely match with your "test and rewrite" example above but I could
not determine a neat cadenza example that matched well.  However, using the
recorded mind, if another mind was allowed to develop and if it differed
from the recording it was destroyed, that would be a similar example.  In
that case, the mind would be conscious because it would be allowed to
develop on its own, albeit closely monitored.)

Retribution that is approximately equal to the crime is about as just as
one can get. An eye for an eye is the very embodiment of the "balance of justice".
It is rational because it reduces unwanted complexity, and
curbs one of the greatest enemies of (true) justice: arbitrariness. 

>Vengeance is an *emotional* response, not a rational one.

True, but everything we do is ultimately based on emotion and random
preferences. Without emotions, there would literally be no "meaning".
However, when vengeance is channeled in the proper way (through
a well-designed justice system), it can also be a very rational (or:
practical) thing: it prevents future crime by deterring potential
(re-)offenders, and in the case of capital punishment it removes a
dangerous individual from society for good. You have the *guarantee*
that he won't ever hurt anyone again.

Compassion in this context is nothing more than a fancy euphemism
for "injustice". A kid that murders has lost the one asset that would make
him elegible for a milder treatment: innocence. Perhaps even more so
than murdering adults, young kids that kill are (especially when no
serious harm was ever done to them) "pure" evil. P.s: there aren't too
many murderous 6 year olds, most would be about 12 or up.

Not necessarily. It all depends on who has (or hasn't) access to the
storage facilities. In my design, whenever some crime or dispute
has occured, all parties (or their representatives) are allowed to search
the databanks for relevant data, and use that in court. The surveillance
system is basically meant as a crude "truth machine", or "collective
memory".

There are several objections against a jury system:
-the idea of judgement by "peers" is rather silly. Are a random bunch
of people your "peers"? Most likely not. In fact, if they *were* peers
than you'd hardly ever have a conviction, as the jury will be protective
of "one of its own" (example: all-white (male) juries that refuse to 
condemn a white man for killing a black man -- *that's* "peer justice").
-most "common people" don't understand much of the forensics that
lead to a conviction, so...
-it all comes down to smooth talking. The slickness of the lawyers/
prosecution decides who will be convicted or not. The usually none-
too-bright jury tends to go for "emotional" appeals, not hard facts.
-the jury is not motivated to give a fair, well-considered verdict. They
just want to get it over with and go home. Giving a judgement based
on personal prejudice or simply indifference carries no negative
consequences whatsoever.
(there's probably more, anyone else want a shot?)

On the other hand, "automated law" is quite Extropian, as it increases
the control of society on justice. It is no longer an arbitrary process,
that depends on the random moods and preferences of judges and
juries, but a clear and reliable procedure. If the law isn't consequent, 
it's not justice. Currently, we are still in the judicial Dark Ages.

?? What I'm saying here is that after the trial it shouldn't take another
10 years or so before the sentence is finally carried out. Execution
is *always* after due trial, when the suspect has been found 
guilty on the basis of the evidence presented. "Guilty until proven
innocent" has nothing to do with it. The delay of a week or so
is just in case there has been a mistake, and the ruling is no
longer "solid".

The logic behind this is simple, and consistent with the logic behind the
rest of the system: the more severe the crime, the heavier the punishment.
Makes sense? Obviously, killing an immortalist is a much greater crime
than killing a "deathist", as you rob someone of a potential eternity instead
of just a few decades. Since the minimum punishment for murder is death,
you must add something on top of that in order to remain consequent and
(thus) just. Torture of some kind is the most logical (and probably only) 
option.

The databanks are fully automated, there is no real "central management",
only maintainance techs that are monitored themselves. "Centralized"
relates to the storage of data (in highly secured bunkers, with multiple
backups). Whenever a crime or dispute occurs, all parties are allowed to 
search the files for evidence that support their case (of course, they're 
monitored while doing this). So, the system is really like a library of public 
life, it belongs to everyone and no-one. Everyone monitors everyone else.

I am not hallucinating, nor have I inplied any such technology.
The debt is paid with the murderer's life even thought it is of
lesser value. I have no savage lust for vengeance, just a
completely rational desire for justice.

The victim is dead, but not forgotten. It is in his/her best
interest, and ours, that justice is served.

As I pointed out above, the debt cannot be repaid since the value
of the murderers life is less than that of the victim. Yet justice
demands he/she pay all they can.

You choose to forget the victim, I chose rationally to forget the
murderer.

My take is:

a) why blow more $$$ for hard drives or cd-r media when you've
already got the bits in digital format on the original cds.

b) whether you copy the media or not, why do you still want
to be stuck carting it around with you around the planet- even
if you reduce the amount of atoms required by converting to
mp3, you still are going to be lugging extra junk around with
you.

Need to stop carting atoms around!

Absolutely not! Being an initiation of force, it's inconsistent with the
non-aggression principle. We can certainly find extropian means of dealing
with violent offenders, means that don't entail our becoming murderers
ourselves.

Someone else quoted Webster's definition of murder as "unlawful" killing. I
would argue that that definition is conditioned by the statist equations
"legal=good, illegal=bad", an egregiously false and destructive idea: how
many of us support the War on Drugs or other prohibitions of victimless
"crimes"? And as we all know, all sorts of predations by government and its
beneficiaries are perfectly legal.

I submit that murder is more sensibly defined as "unjustified" or
"wrongful" killing, which to me means killing for any reason other than in
immediate defense of life.

This is the part I protest against, everyone keeps writing off the
victim, "Oh well, a potential immortal was murdered, nothing we can
do...." Then people go to great lengths to argue why we should save
the murderer.

Let's discuss whether "punishment" is appropriate to begin with. Quick,
what's the difference between punishment and revenge? I see no real
distinction; punishment is simply more "official" sounding (and often
cloaked in "legality" - see my earlier posting) and is imposed by supposed
"authorities".

What civil order requires is protection, and restitution where possible,
not revenge.

It gets a little trickier, of course, where restitution is not (yet)
possible, as in the case of murder. Some compensation can still be provided
to the bereaved. Social ostracism and other non-aggressive measures can
help insure that a murderously-inclined individual has little opportunity
to repeat the offense. In incorrigible cases, exile is a possibility, not
as punishment but as a defensive action.

The guiding principle IMO should be to meet force with the least force
necessary. There are all sorts of ways we can avoid becoming the sort of
people we oppose. Surely we Extropians ought to be in the vanguard of the
progress toward true civilization.

Peace,
Dickola

Well at least you gave the amateur logicians at work here something
to play with today.

Entropy not=Extropy
Death=Entropy
Death Penalty=Entropy Penalty
Death Penalty not=Entropy Penalty not
Entropy penalty not (does not equal) Extropy
and
Death not (does not equal) Extropy


This is a poor formalism, but illustrates the point.

The force was initiated by the murderer, so it is not inconsistent.
As stated previously, by definition the death penalty is not
murder.

I suppose the murderer could classify what he/she did as a "hobby."
As citizens of a government we are subject to legal definitions.

Revenge: to inflict harm in return for an injury etc.

Punishment: To undergo pain, loss etc as for a crime.

(source: Websters New World dictionary.)

It is considerably more than "official" sounding. As mentioned
above as citizens of a government we are subject to legal
definitions.

Punishment, not revenge. Punishment for which in the case of murder
may result in life-forfeit.

No compensation or restitution is adequate or possible. Only
justice in the form of equivalent punishment.

I do not agree that taking these measures ever makes us even
remotely like them.

We are in complete agreement here. I too advocate taking
appropriate measures early in life to try to prevent these things.
But insist also in proper action when the unfortunate occurs.

I'm not an engineer, Dan.  I'm a generalist trying to find ways to
save R&D time and money wasted in incremental infrastructure upgrades
when the expertise is available to create a better system from
scratch.  In no way am I "arguing" technical details, so much as
seeking input from experts (you), and "promoting" thinking in terms of
massive scale production in order to accelerate broadband nonlinear
HDTV.

Why am I interested in broadband HDTV?  Because we're approaching a
critical point when *work* is obsolete, it the industrial sense. 
That's what AUTOMATION does, it frees people.  Unfortunately, our
global economy hasn't been structured to deal with "FREE" people.  A
laborless society just isn't going to fare well without
high-bandwidth, low-latency, video-oriented, customized CBT (a.k.a.
broadband Internet).  For security purposes (backyard cam, frontyard
cam, garage door cam, frontdoor cam, backdoor cam, driveway cam),
broadband to each home seems like a reasonable "point-of-departure"
for planning discussions.

I'm just trying to think of a strategy that doesn't just create more
huge monopolies.  Instead of the cable company upgrading your
neighborhood, or the phone companies upgrading your neighborhood,
*YOU* as a citizen would be installing your own little tiny switching
node in your own backyard or on your rooftop.

For the sake of getting "The Truman Show" started, here's my 
neighborhood:  

    See: http://define.com/neighborhood.htm

(Sometimes problems are more easily solved when humanized.)

I'm in one of the little boxes just left of center.  This should be
accurate enough for nuclear targeting, but a little too general for
Avon, Amway, and Watchtower salespeople (http://www.watchtower.org/).

In the context of "The World Wide Web", "Freedom of Speech", 
"Being Politically Correct", and "They Killed Kenny!" 

    http://www.comedycentral.com/southpark/index.shtml

This should make the hunt easier: Notice to terrorist: Please don't
take a head shot, I need the brain intact: we'll put it on ice and use
it as a primary key.  Back to task at hand: 100Mbs for each little
human nest in this grand insect colony called "human civilization"...

Yes, the Wavtrac product is expensive, but that's only because they
aren't in Henry Ford style mass production.  I called WavTrac and
spoke with Mr. Abboud, and asked: "If you were responsible for
thinking up a way to get 100Mbs to every single household, how would
you do it?"  He said that his technology could probably be brought
down to $500 per station with mass production.

Another strategy would be to mass produce multiport 100Mbps Fast
Ethernet nodes that people could install themselves in their own
neighborhoods.  Instead of Homer Simpson installing a new sprinkler
system in is front yard, Homer is kicking in $50 to his neighborhood
infrastructure upgrade pool.  The neighbors all get "right of way"
access to connect to each of their neighbors in a grid pattern.  Each
house connects to each other house in a North, South, East, West grid
(using insulated PVC-coated copper or hybrid).  Another strategy,
would be a rooftop wireless grid.  This has been tried at low
bandwidth, but can't really succeed unless done in a big way.  (See
http://www.rooftop.com/).

The problem with the new, dog's eye view, do it yourself 100Mb grid,
is that while it makes cable companies and phone companies obsolete,
it still doesn't work for your video cell phone.

Which get's us back to the generic black box filled with superscalar
ram and parallel dsps.  OK: make it a perfect cube: one the sides, put
a mass-produced version of a Wavtrac system (directional - line of
site).  On the top, put a little stubby antenna (omnidirectional -
transmits right through trees and walls).

O.K., Dan.  I have a high-school level physics education, and my
electromagnetic and supercomputing theory background are limited to
the URL's that *YOU* send to the extropian list.  Now, back to solving
the problem in an "Open Source" manner.

If you want to create an HDTV wavelet video server, without having to
become Bill Gates, here's what your option will be (unless the Open
Source community starts becoming the Internet II / Proxy building
community).

See http://www.microsoft.com/Theater/pricing.htm

Notice the licensing fees: $2,500 up front.  $99.80 per client, in
$499.00 increments.  Granted, Netshow is MPEG, but surely the Intel
Indeo guys will convince Microsoft to start touting Wavelet (Bill's
lawyers will probably soon be making "Wavelet" a Microsoft trademark.)
 Microsoft WaveletStream(TM) servers?  A few hundred million in
advertising (cattle branding synapse imprint burning), and Wavelet
will be synonymous with Windows NT 5.0 and Tiger(tm) video servers.

Nevermind that Tham Jo Yew has published his theories openly.

   See http://wavelets.math.nus.edu.sg/thamjy/

Although U.S. Copyrights and Trademarks don't apply in Singapore, I'm
sure Bill will have Tham's team staffed up in no time, complete with
non-disclosure agreements and contracts under threat of death to make
everything proprietary as a Microsoft Netshow subsidiary.

P.S. I don't have anything against Microsoft: I'm going to work there
starting next week, as a droid software tester (Netshow included). 
I'm sure I'll use the employee suggestion system.  Too bad I'll have
nothing to look forward to but law suits when I finally branch out on
my own.  (I'm not afraid, though, my lawyers have more money than
Bill's!  Yeah, right!)

Check out the following URL:

http://www.financialcybermarket.com/market_research/microsoft.htm

I'm waiting around for these Redmond guys to hurry up and develop
"THEJANECHANNEL.COM". :)  Maybe Gates will kick in $30B for some
superscalar RAM fabs to help with Internet II HTDV video proxies
(running on Linux-based parallel supercomputers and Larry Ellison's
Linux shareware version of Oracle).

See the following e-mail: reposted without permission (just like
alienlogic.com and lucifer.com keep reposting the extropian archives
to http://www.excite.com without permission).  I'm sure Tham is going
to be delighted to be associated with a Libertarian.  Pot smoking is

Murder = Death without choice for innocent person = entropy
Murderer = individual who maliciously plans and executes a murder =entropic
individual
Naturally we want as many extropic individuals living and as few entropic
individuals living. Any measure which improves the gene pool to this end is
useful.

Not quite. Its a penalty for an entropic act. Entropists  seem to understand
entropic action much better than extropic action.  It is possible that there are
entropic acts which benefit extropy, while there are surely extropic acts which
benefit entropy. I see a murderer being executed as an entropic act which benefits
extropy.

By decreasing the future incidences of entropic actions, we increase the net
extropy/entropy ratio, thus accellerating growth in extropic directions. Thus, in
the end extropy is increased.

Frankly, if there is no cure for such actions, if they are genetic like some say,
then deleting such defective DNA strains from the gene pool is useful. Now, on the
other hand, I can also empathize with the kid. I would guess that the kid, being a
straight A student, was probably a 'nerd' who was under severe negative peer
pressure. I can easily imagine that such a child would go temporarily insane under
the stress of such entropic acts.   Unfortunately, nerds are not a protected
minority. They arent very telegenic and don't have an effective lobby. When
several such school yard shootings occured recently, while it annoyed me that the
media was focusing on how easy the kids got ahold of guns, a small part of me that
remembers being the object of schoolyard persecution was secretly cheering those
kids for finally giving the 'good' kids a small taste of what several years of
torment feels like.

I doubt very much that there were absolutely no warning signs. That parents,

So you are not talking from a view point of benefitting the victim or the
criminal, but your own desire to get inside the head of the perpetrator.
Thats about as scientific and extropic as a concentration camp doctor. Nor is
using one anecdote a very scientific sampling from which to reach conclusions.

Just punishment for an evil act is the minimum action needed to prevent
a future similar occurrence, anything more than that is revenge.

Brian writes, in response to my characterizing capital punishment as
initiation of force  inconsistent with the non-aggression principle:

> The force was initiated by the murderer, so it is not inconsistent.

Force was initiated by the murderer, but since the death penalty is not an
immediate and direct response to the murderer's force, it does not qualify
as defensive counterforce. Any harm inflicted after the fact is a
*separate* application of force, and hence an initiation. Or is there some
flaw in my reasoning here?

> As citizens of a government we are subject to legal definitions.

I disagree. Most of us haven't chosen to be "citizens" in the first place,
we are simply claimed as such by the nearest gangsters calling themselves
"government". "Subject to legal definitions" is somewhat ambiguous, but if
you mean we're somehow ("morally" or otherwise) bound to define things the
way the powers-that-be tell us to, I'd like to know why.

OK, I ask again: wherein is the difference? Those definitions look to me

Here you're simply assuming that justice equals punishment, or at least
implying, without support,  that punishment is just. But isn't justice in
essence simply fairness? You need to _argue_ for the fairness of
punishment, not just assert it in passing, and, as a first step, you should
distinguish it from mere revenge, which you have so far failed to do.

I'm with you there, friend. Unfortunately we differ on what constitutes

My note has to do with saving the child as a specimen.  Surely we 
already have a huge enough population of murderers around now to 
ascertain the chief psychosocial pathologies and environmental 
triggers which precipitate such acts.  Of course, 
phenomenologically, any object of study is perspectivally 
inexhaustible; nothing can truly be "grokked in its fullness."  And 
each murder and murderer is individual, and therefore, although 
similar to others, is in the final analysis, unique.  But this fact alone 
lessens the value of the knowledge to be gleaned from one murderer 
in predicting/preventing other murders.  After a certain asymptotic 
point, we collide with the law of diminishing returns, where the tiny 
bit of further knowledge we might gain is not worth the possibility that 
the perpetrator might kill again.

sure, but you could do the same with files like mp3 or vqf (better
quality, compression ratio) or what standard you want.. it's better to
be independent of the support... to deal with cd audio where the music
is relatively badly encoded (too much space needed) is far more
expensive. Think to all the hardware and mechanics needed for a simple
jukebox... waste of material and money. Think that a CDR full of vqf can
have something like 14 cd audio compressed in it... for the quality, i
confess i'm totally unable to make a difference, so that's good for me.
You will probably have to encode your cds in the future anyway... And
you don't need to take mp3 with you... you could more easily transfer
these files from a server anywhere in the world and with far less
bandwidth. For me it's more convenient, confortable, more easy and
secure, to have all my cd collection on hard drives... no need to
expensive mechanical systems with probably a bad mtbf.

Of course i would like to have a small personal assistant with GSM
capabilities connected permanently to the Internet and with the
bandwidth needed to be able to receive high quality music, HDTV, film on
demand, mails, Internet, books, video games, windows98 compatible/ java
(or another system), with an interface somewhat like the glasstron of
sony, with 3d capabilities, enhanced reality, capability to analyze the
environment and a huge working memory. If i can interface it directly
into my brain, i will be even more happy ;)

Why don't we just ask the NSA (http://www.nsa.gov) for access to 
*their* archives under The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and NSA 
Declassification Initiative (The OPENDOOR Project).

Obviously, they would have everything digitized *already*, paid for 
with PUBLIC FUNDS.

They'd need to have everything digitized, in order to be able to 
break codes.

For example, what if I had some sort of code in which published books 
were used as translation tables.  My code would be a string of 
vectors that point to letters or words at a certain point on a 
certain page.  Long strings of these indirect references, translated, 
and you have a coherent message.

No way to break such a code without having the books digitized in the 
first place.  So, they must be there somewhere, right?  Scanned with 
public money, stored in publicly owned data warehouses, right?

And the music and movie libraries?  You'd need them for propaganda 
purposes, to help automatically select content for "The Game".  For 
example, have all song lyrics and all movie lyrics transcribed, with 
sample level time-code reverse indexes.

Why not just make it all available, through a new broadband ISP that 
pays subscribers $.111/minute (24x7), for the indignity of wearing 
GPS trackers?

A distinction is usually made in jurisprudential theory between two kinds of
crimes: malum in se ("bad in itself") and malum prohibitum ("bad because it's
prohibited").  The distinction between the two is that mala in se are held to
be bad for reasons extrinsic to the context of the act, e.g. murder is wrong
regardless of when and where you do it, who you kill, etc.  Mala prohibitae
are held to be "bad" only because the context requires SOME rule, e.g. a road
system has to divide traffic going in different directions, so driving down
the road is only wrong if you do it on the "prohibited" side.  

Problems arise when a "bright line" is drawn in the name of enforcement; for
instance, "driving at a dangerously excessive speed" is clearly a malum in se,
but driving 71 miles per hour on a road with a posted speed limit of 70, when
there is no traffic and conditions of visibility, etc., are good is only a
malum prohibtum.  The more actors one has in a society and the more complex
that society is, the more general prohibitions of actually bad conduct tend to
get translated into sometimes arbitrary "bright line" prohibitions.  IMHO, a
good jurisprudential theory should have "meta-rules" that will systematically
counter the development and enforcement of such specific "bright line" rules
as much as possible.

The flaw lies in the fact that I just re-read "the extropian

You don't have to agree on the definition, but if you violate it,
you will be punished. In a world where private agreements handle
these matters you can be assured my contract will call for the
death of anyone who murders me.

Semantic's. The only fair punishment for the illegal malicious
taking of another persons life is to forfeit yours.

I argue it is fair because it is the only thing a murderer has of
equivalent value to what he/she took.

If an individual does it it is revenge.

If you are tried lawfully, fairly, and convicted. It will be just,
fair, punishment.

OK.  Everything but windows98.  Gates was just a CIA-droid who's life 
and company were put together for "end-of-the-millenium" theatrical 
purposes, and for slush fund purposes.  Unix is the only O.S.  (See 
AT&T/Lockheed/MKUltra).  He was scheduled to be publicly dismembered 
and tortured in a pagan antitrust ritual, but that may not be 
necessary at this point.

I asked:

> Quick, what's the difference between punishment and revenge?

John Clark offers:

> Just punishment for an evil act is the minimum action needed to prevent
> a future similar occurrence, anything more than that is revenge.

Yes, the old deterrence theory. If taken as a _defining_ property of
punishment, this might indeed serve to distinguish punishment from revenge,
though deterrence, when considered at all, seems usually to be bundled as a
side-effect rather than being the root rationale for punishment, n'est-ce
pas? But we needn't quibble over that, as I think there are serious
problems with deterrence-by-penalty anyway.

First off, studies have called into question the deterrence value of
sanctions, in particular that of capital punishment. There seems to be
little correlation in general between either severity or sureness of
punishment promised and rates of commission of the corresponding crimes.

Another problem is with measurement: by what method are we to establish the
"minimum action needed", especially in view of the lack of correlation
mentioned above? People vary immensely in their toleration of risks, for
one thing.

To me it seems much less problematical and at any rate more cost-effective
to deter by means of prevention, rather than rely on dubious after-the-fact
sanctions which have only a small probability of being applied anyway (most
crimes go unsolved, after all).

(Note that we've shifted the discussion away from definitional difficulties
into the realm of practicality, which is probably just as well.)

Upward,
Dick

I'm just finishing this book, Virginia Postrel's  "The Future and Its Enemies:
The Growing Conflict Over Creativity, Enterprise and Progress".  I've had the
good fortune to meet Virginia a couple of times, most recently last weekend at
Cato's conference on Technology and Society, and her book reflects the
intelligence, humor and charisma she evidences as a speaker.  I highly
recommend this book, a taste of which you can get at the web site she's
created to promote it:

    http://www.dynamist.com

Her book expresses my own political and social ideas and values in the context
of current events and issues better than the work of any other writer I've
encountered.  As Fred Moulton pointed out in his post, the basic ideas in her
book will be familiar to the subscribers to this list.  But this book is a
worthy addition to your library, if for no other reason than so that you can
recommend it to your friends and associates.  "The Future and Its Enemies"
will do a very good job of spreading the values of spontaneous order to a
wider audience.

Hans Moravec's new book "Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind" is an
update on his 1988 "Mind Children".  The first part of the book is an
interesting personal account of Moravec's involvement in the early history of
robotics and AI.  Moravec then walks through the same basic ideas he expounded
in "Mind Children", but with more detail regarding the four generations of
robotic entities he envisions between now and 2040, the point at which he puts
the development of human-level, and then quickly super-human-level robots and
AIs.  The last part of the book seemed a little out of place, as Moravec
demonstrates that he has a basic knowledge of current theories of physics and
cosmology and then essentially lays out the kinds of very speculative ideas
regarding levels of interpretation of simulations and for embedding
computational machines in wormholes that Greg Egan makes more entertaining in
"Permutation City" and "Diaspora".

Overall, I recommend this short, nontechnical book as a good historical
document of the AI field and statement of the state of the art, but with some
misgivings about the highly speculative last third of the book.

A .4 correlation leaves a huge scope for other factors, so I 
don't see any difficulty here. (It's also possible to imagine that
better nourishment during childhood could have increased average brain
size.)

One has to be careful before jumping to conclusions from a weak 
correlation. After all, shoe size also correlates positively 
with IQ (though less than brain size I think). Couldn't head size
simply be correlated with body size, which in turn may be correlated
with intelligence because the best mates prefer to mate people who are
both tall and intelligent?

I don't think that's the whole explanation in this case however.
Because (1) I think IQ correlates (slightly) more strongly with brain
size than head size, and (2) a big brain is costly (risks at birth
with big head; heavy to carry around; consumes lots of energy) so
there must be some strong reward for having a big head, and it's hard
to see what that could be except intellectual performance.

I don't want lugging around some 100-odd jewel boxes, but a digest of
what I actually listen to. I could destill that to CD-R, but I want
the data to be stored in a compact single unit, r/w storage which 
can accomodate random audio snippets and algorithmic access to sound 
(context-sensitivity, speech/cue-triggered retrieval, etc.). Actually, 
CDs are just but an icing on the cake, all I care about are documents.
As to compactness, a HD packed in rugged frame is one of the densest
and most convenient storage media -- and you can always DAT it if
you're really paranoid.

I'm perfectly satisfied with a standard MIT wearable design 
offering about 24 h untethered operation capability (say, a 
Lizzy for 2-3 k$), with a Faxview-like display and about a 
4 GByte HD and IrDA (or future Bluetooth) to dock into the 
main machine. Of course having all 4 GByte as solid-state 
would be simply wonderful, but we're a few years off that 
still. Speaking of solid-state storage, now's that a great 
use for WSI. 

You do use suitcases when you travel? Why that extra junk?

Now you're really burning me up. :-)

Obviously I wasn't referring to the Extropian Principles, but to the
general libertarian prohibition of aggression. Extropians, by the coiner's
own definition, are "libertarian transhumanists", so there's more to what
we hold in common than the EPs, no?

So douse that torch already.

If that's all you meant, I agree - at least an attempt will (in principle)
be made to find and punish the violater. That's the reality. I thought you
were invoking some obligation to agree with the "authorities'" definitions.

I suspect (and hope) that your death provision would be found null and void
by most freemarket courts. There are things that can't legitimately be
contracted for, including, especially, harmful effects on nonsignatory
parties. (Right, Greg?)

You made another attempt to differentiate punishment from revenge:

> Punishment requires being convicted of a crime.

"Convicted of a crime" is just a way of saying "held responsible for an
unapproved act". Of course, in taking ordinary revenge on you I show that I
hold you responsible for a misdeed. I can call it "punishment" if I want,
but it doesn't change the nature of what I'm doing.

> I argue it is fair because it is the only thing a murderer has of

What good does it do the corpse? How is it fair to forfeit yet another
life, to nobody's benefit? What does it do to compensate for what was lost?
IOW, exactly where is the justice?

> If an individual does it it is revenge.

...implying that a wrong, so long as it's perpetrated by some _non-unit_
number of individuals, somehow magically becomes right. How?


Peace and carrots,
Dick

To me, justice is about lessening violence, not eye for eye. As dickola
says:
> What civil order requires is protection, and restitution where possible,
> not revenge.

 So whenever possible, there is no need for violence applied by the
community. And what about violence 'shown' to society: what an
abomination than to wish for public execution! Would you have your kids
watch, or even see in person, a public execution??? A torture??? Maybe
you should make sure the kids themselves put the hood on??? (I expect
the torturer would wear a hood, red as blood!?)

  Trying to sidestep the problem (I'm so lazy, I do it all the time), I
feel it lies into wether you think punishment is a method of learning,
or not. Should you punish a kid when he makes a mistake or a wrongness
(?)? Should you scare people of what might happen to them if <fill in
with what you think is fit>? I don't know, any opinion?

   In china, they kill people by the hundred! One friend of mine,
chinese, explained to me that there is just no such worry as human
rights. And in fact, there are so many people, why care? they seem to
kill stealers!? So why not eradicate all unlawfull persons?


    One post of this thread unsettles me (who was the poster? Can't
remember), explaining that if we get immortals, then locking up a very
and repeatedly dangerous person is not really a solution. Exile either.
Death is, rewiring is, I go for rewiring, as max says, we all rewire
somehow everyday. But even that might prove unsuccessful (who knows if
some behavior might be unchangeable?), and every person should be left
some choice as to that, then there is death as a security for the
future...

     CU. Manu.

This is mostly for Ken, but othres may be interested.

I sympathize with the irritiation Ken and others have shown
RE the structural monopoly the phone company has on the
"last mile", and I'd really love to find a way to break this
monopoly. Let's agree on the goals:
   --bottom-up networking to replace the Phome Company.
   --fully-distributed switches under control of individuals
   --Massive bandwidth available at nearly zero cost
   --full support for mobile users

The problem is that radio is expensive by comparison to wireor fiber,
and that the radio spectrum is limited. Therefore, I feel that
we need to reserve the radio spectrum for mobile applications and
use point-to-point connections where possible. Your concept of
neighbor-to-neighbor connections is worthwhile, but don't use
radio: use either fiber or point-to-point through-the-air
lasers. This is much cheaper and provides much higher bandwidth.
so, where you can do it cheaply, you run a fiber to your neighbor's
house. Where this is infeasible, you try for line-of-sight laser.
on your own property you certainly want to run fiber or coax to
your  own security cams, etc. This preserves radio bandwidth,
decreases your and costs, and increases your own security. With
fiber, you basically get as much bandwidth as you want to pay for
on each fiber, with 100Mbps being incredibly cheap even today, and
40Gbps costing a bunch. Now all you need to do is work co-operatively
with your neighbors to buy a line to the internet since your neighborhood
is now fully interconnected, you have enough bandwidth and purchasing
power to attract the nodice of the bypass folks.

Now what do we do for mobile? I reccomend that we use radio for this.
Unfortunately, a sophisticated cellular system costs a bunch. However,
we may be able to beat this by adding smart point-to-point laser systems
to the call system. When your mobile unit can "see" a fixed laser
installation, it can hop onto the laser link just as it hops between cells.
This preserves the radio cells for the units that are not in laser
line-of-sight, which means that you need fewer expensive radio cells to
serve the same mobile population.

Now, let's think about the evolution from today's system to the
system outlined above. Frankly, I believe that the evolution will
be driven initially by hackers, for fun. This is what we are seeing
in the Open Source software community. Will this be enough to 
have a real effect on the cisco-Lucent-RBOC oligopoly? Only
time will tell.

Why is this relevant to extropians? well, some of us believe
that human progress is now driven by computation and connectivity.

Ok Brian, uncle!  What can we do for the victim?  I know your hiding
this magical technology that can benefit the victim.  Please share it
with us.  I have a dog I lost a couple of years ago, I want very much to
do something for him.  Please help.

Your still implying such a magical technology because you just re-stated
that killing the murderer is in the victims self-interest.  I repeat,
how can a dead person have self-interest? You have failed to demonstrate
this.

'Justice'?!?  I could just as easily say that justice demands that you
should die for speaking on a street corner.  Certainly China views such
penalties as justice for those who buck the Party's dogma. You accept as
dogma that justice equals an 'eye for an eye'. I do not share your
definition of 'Justice'.  Since when is justice written down in stone?
Why should I accept your definition over another?  Imposing your sense
of justice over others is not a very 'just' thing to do.

> You choose to forget the victim, I chose rationally to forget the

How have I forgotten the victim?  The victim is dead, but not
forgotten.  You refuse to acknowledge that the victim is dead.  The
majority of your argument is resting on the imaginary concept that
somehow we are helping the victim by killing their murderer.    Are you
suggesting that we are helping them in the afterlife?  If so, what proof
do you have that they live in this afterlife?

If I didn't know better, I'd say you just summed up the central party line for the
Nazi Party, but I know you probably didn't mean it that way.  However, that is the
trick isn't it - semantics.  Bottom line,  the means do not justify the ends.
Committing entropic acts to increase extropy could be rationalized for the majority of
atrocities committed throughout history.  Bottom line, killing people (no matter how
'just') is not extropian; as you admitted - it is an entropic act.

And how often do we hear that?  Just about every time somebody snaps and kills
someone.  "Gosh, he was so nice, I never suspected he had it in him." are the typical
responses from friends and neighbors.

I'm arguing more from a 'Utilitarian' view rather than my own.  Utilitarianism
concerns itself with the greatest good for the greatest number.  It can be postulated
that a lot more good can come from understanding the underlying causes of murder, by
studying the murders instead of killing them.  But since your advocating that we kill
them, how is this more humane than studying them - if the criminal were given the
choice?

There was some discussion of a "free internet" on slashdot (the
open source hangout, <http://slashdot.org/>) a few months ago.
As a result someone created a page at
<http://www.dnaco.net/~kragen/decentralized-networks.html>
summarizing such efforts, all of which seem to be wireless.

That is being/has started to be done. People are looking to extract the 
factor structure of human intelligence from regional cell counts and 
gray/white matter ratios. Of course, the great bulk of IQ variance is 
explained by a single factor so these effects struggle under pretty hefty 
signal to noise ratio.

One answer (proposed by Jim Flynn, in fact, is that intelligence hasn't 
risen, while IQ has).

then Remi Sussan said (in reply to nick):

difficulty for what: dualist theories on mind?

That proposal has been tested by the late HJ Eysenck, with some success.

umm. why so any more than with strong correlations? One actually has to 
be careful jumping to conclusions when there is no theory. There is a 
well formulated theory of why brain size and structure relates to IQ.

not very well at all actually. Nose size however, has a good correlation 
(around .4)

That is exactly what is tested in the papers on this matter.

a nice reference is given below. There are by now, however, many dozens 
of papers on this topic. Steven jay Gould's response is simple denial: 
fitting really for such an arm chair critic.

entropy not = extropy
entropy = not extropy
entropy + not entropy = extropy + not extropy
entropy (1+ not) = extropy (1+ not)
therefore:  entropy = extropy

just kidding.  {8^D  would it still deter murderers if they knew
the penalty was cryonic suspension?  spike

If punishment didn't deter anyone then I can see no reason for punishing anyone
for anything, at least no reason I'd want to defend.

I'm pretty sure capital punishment deters at least one person quite effectively.

There is no way you can know that because there is no control experiment, punishment is
seldom severe and never sure. Even if you're convicted of murder your chances of
actually being executed are almost as low as being hit by lightning, and almost as random.


    >Another problem is with measurement: by what method are we to establish the

You ask too much, If I could answer that question I'd have an algorithm for perfect
justice. We'll never have that but at least we know the direction to go.

    >to deter by means of prevention


How? Sometimes moral monsters reform and become good people but it's rare and
nobody knows how to accomplish it systematically. It won't make  them good but
there is a method to at least improve the very worst of the worst in just a few seconds,
all you need is 5000 volts at 4 or 5 amps.

Since I - and, hopefully, uploads - would consider cognitive
styles primary features of an [in]dividual, and look at gender
as a secondary and somewhat outdated characteristic, I'd try
to look at the gender/assertiveness statistics from another side.

So we have a number of "assertives" in the society that play
dominant roles in some social tasks, related to leadership, and
a number of "non-assertives" playing a (necessary!!!) subservient
role in these tasks, and maybe leading in some others, such as
preservation of traditions, nurturing, emotional stabilization.
Assertives also exhibit some old-fashioned manifestations of
masculinity, and non-assertives - femininity (all these no longer
needed distinctions in body size, hair, milk glands and [emulations
of] sexual appendages).   These old-fashioned features and
appendages are distributed unequally between assertives and
non-assertives.   We could fix that by distributing body sizes
and appendages more equally (I am sure any intelligent being would
rather change physical features than its core cognitive
characteristics).  Or we could change the situation by 
liquidating variety of all features, making sure that nobody
has an equal start in the social physical/emotional/cognitive 
ecology, not leading in being more emotionally sensitive, curious,
adventurous, impulsive, or whatever.

I hope it sounds ridiculous enough already.

Isn't it time we stop classifying ourselves by gender?

I would actually expect that billions of highly intelligent
beings with high degrees of morphic freedom would often play
with all their features and tune them freely in any direction,
depending on need and interest, so the diversity of features
will grow dramatically.  If we want to prepare to this situation
now, the last thing we want to do is to attempt removing any
personal distinctions.

Without identifying physical characteristics, the distinction between 
heterosexual and homosexual would cease to exist.  In fact, whom 
would be attracted to whom and how they would or could possibly 
consummate such an attraction is a huge and baffling mystery, 
admitting of much fanciful speculation, but no answers.   Joe

I agree fully.

Where I live we have a number of GSM phone networks on 900 and 1800 GHz.
The technology sends packets of data to and from mobile phones.  With
minor changes to this technology (and otehrs like it on other parts of
the planet) it could carry random data, not just sound.

IMO the goal should be to have a stationary infrastructure which does
not care about what your traffic contains.  The operators would gain a
great increase of users of their networks if they widened their protocols
from only voice.  The Internet explosion revisited.

With such a network available at a low price for the owners of the terminals
of the network, using a smart looking or discrete wearable (or looking like
a Borg if that is your Thang) you could access data on the Internet virtually
anywhere and anywhen.

You could build your own virtual networks on top of this infrastructure.
You personal information searching agent software could then search the
Internet for relevant information at any time.

With a high bandwidth connection you can exchange video streams with other
units in real-time, giving you interactive videophone.

PS.

A local home electronics dealer sent some junk advertisement to me.
Among other stuff they sell a satellite dish which you use in your
Internet surfing.  Traffic from your site to the Internet goes through
the telco, but the response comes through the satellite.  Apparently
the satellite solution gives higher bandwidth.  No comment on the
security of your satellite traffic, as usual.  Encryption?  Probably
not.  Requires a PC with Windows 95, 98 or NT4.

I shure do believe that punishment is a deterence. You CAN learn by pain.
But probably only what not to do. Try to make a kid stick a nail into a wall
socket. The next time you try to make them do it they wil be much harder to
persuade. ;-) At least I remember that I only did it once.

It's just that it works best for certain types of crime. Some of the recent
litterature that I have read regarding consciousnes and behaviour seems to
suggest that we act on impulse in many situations. To not do a crime we have
to pre-program our brain not to act on certain impulses. Probably crimes of
passion, or done in a moments rage is much harder to control, especially if
you haven't conditioned yourself not to do them.

One of the problems with carrying a weapon is that when you decide to carry
it you also decide to use it in certain situations, and thus are not
conditioned not to do it. Indeed people carrying weapons takes pride in
being willing to use them. Why else carry a weapon? This makes for a bigger
risk of a weapon being used.

One way to uncondition people from carrying weapons would be to make the
carrying of illegal weapons a serious crime. It would give the police a
better tool for locking up criminals carrying weapons.

(I'm not trying to start that weapons debate again. I am talkng about what
I think will work here in Denmark where weapons are almost only carried by
criminals, and practically nobody wants them legalised.)

If you got +4 years just for carrying a weapon maybe you would think twice
about bringing it in the first place. Thus conditioning yourself for less
severe solutions.

To be technical, bilateral contracts impose negative effects on third parties
all the time; the only question is whether the third parties in turn have some
kind of recourse. As a matter of efficiency, even the fairest legal regime
will not necessarily provide recourse for every such "exported" cost. I assume
the post to which you were referring, though, was itself referring to what we
might call the canonical anarchist legal scheme, Friedman et al.'s proposal
for "privately produced law", or "PPLs".  In such a scheme all law (or much
law) is a matter of contract, with individual parties subscribing to various
competing bodies of law.  Conflicts between subscribers to different PPLs are
resolved by multilateral choice of law jurisprudence, either in the form of
meta-contracts (i.e. "treaties" or conventions) or through evolved common law
choice of law provisions applicable to the specific facts of the particular
controversy.

Let me describe a hypothetical example.  Dick subscribes to PathosLaw, Inc., a
PPL which does not include a death penalty for murder.  Brian subscribes to
ToughLaw, Inc., which does prescribe the death penalty for murder.  If Dick
murders Jane (because he's fed up with all the insipid adventures she talks
him into in their primary reader work), and Jane is also a PathosLaw ("PL")
subscriber, the crime will be prosecuted completely within the strictures of
PL's criminal code and Dick will not be subject to the death penalty.  If
Brian kills Jones (because he suspects Jones of being one of those soft-
hearted liberal types), and Jones is also a ToughLaw ("TL") subscriber, then
Brian's crime will be prosecuted under TL's criminal code and he will be
subject to the death penalty if convicted.

Now, what if Dick's and Brian's debate about the death penalty gets a little
heated and, in a fit of pique, Dick grabs Brian's Smith and Wesson "Equalizer"
Model 2082 particle beam pistol and settles the discussion once and for all?
The anarchists to whom I refer above will say that we have a classic "conflict
of laws" problem: Whose law should we apply?  

First, a brief detour.  Conflict of laws problems are nothing new.  In fact,
they are as old as humanity: Each social group of humans has had at least
slightly different legal regimes.  Conflicts between people governed
domestically by different legal regimes have always occurred.  Courts have
always had to resolve such disputes and they are the stock in trade of
international litigators today.  Interestingly, conflicts of law jurisprudence
is some of the most fertile for discovering just how people answer the
important question, "What is law?", because it requires courts to develop
and/or apply "meta-legal" principles that transcend local or particular law.

Conflict of law problems are resolved in the present day through the use of
three primary mechanisms: 1) bilateral treaties; 2) international (or
generally, inter-jurisdictional) conventions; and/or 3) domestic statutory and
common law, usually influenced by international customary or common law (which
may or may not be "codified" in what is called a "restatement" or compendium
of common law rules).  Over time, common law principles have evolved that
generally tend to harmonize the conflict of law jurisprudence of various
jurisdictions.  These include the locality of the dispute,  "comity" (the
principle that the courts of one state should respect the authority of the
courts of other states), basic notions of procedural fairness or due process,
the smooth working of the international or interjurisdictional commercial and
legal systems and the "public policy" (read "basic law") of the domestic
jurisdiction.  The resolution of any particular conflict of laws results from
a balancing of these factors.  The more or less international or
interjurisdictional orientation of the jurisdiction being asked to decide the
dispute usually determines the weighting given to the various factors.  Thus a
jurisdiction like the UK, which values international trade and comity very
highly, tends to give effect to foreign law more often, while an insular
jurisdiction like, say, North Korea, would be expected to give little effect
to foreign law.

Now, what of Dick's murder of Brian?  PL and TL may well have a bilateral
treaty regarding application of the law of murder -- the equivalent of an
extradition treaty in today's international legal system.  Subscribers to the
two legal regimes are held to have subscribed to this treaty.  In the absence
of a treaty, there may be a multi-lateral "Convention on the Inter-PPL
Application of Criminal Laws", to which signatory PPL subscribers would also
held to be subscribers.  In the absence of either of these two options, the
statutory or common law conflicts jurisprudence of the two PPLs will have to
work out the result.  If TL calls for mandatory prosecution of murder in every
case regardless of context, while PL does not, the conflict may be resolved in
TL's favor, and Dick will be subject to the death penalty.  The hard case
results if PL interprets this as an act of aggression against Dick and calls
for mandatory, armed protection of Dick.  In the state-based system of law,
this would be resolved through the application of principles of
territoriality.  In non-territorial private law systems, things could well get
messy, so messy that it is unlikely that PL and TL courts would allow such a
vacuum of law to develop.

More probably, a relatively uniform choice of law regime would develop (or the
system as a whole would likely break down pretty quickly).  Perhaps an inter-
PPL tribunal would be called on to resolve the dispute: Because conflicts
problems would arise fairly often in such a system, it would be expedient for
PPLs to themselves subscribe to such a tribunal a priori (much as the federal
courts resolve many such disputes in the US federal system).  

I imagine that context would be very important in the resolution of criminal
law conflicts in regimes of private law: If Dick murders Brian in Brian's
home, the result may well be that Brian's criminal law should govern the case,
for instance.  Notice might also be important: If it was shown that Dick was
aware of the fact that Brian was a TL subscriber, he might be charged with
assent to governance by TL's criminal law.

All of this leads to speculation about how regimes of private law can develop
incrementally, since they have to be robust in the face of such hard cases
from the outset.  But that's a subject for another discussion.

Oh, and BTW, I have to admit that I am very ambivalent about the question of
whether the death penalty is "extropian".  I can say that I think the issue is
very context-sensitive.  As administered in the U.S. today, the death penalty
does seem to be applied inconsistently, a bad thing for such a drastic
sanction.  On the other hand, I disagree strongly with some of the comments
made in this thread about the ineffectiveness of deterrence: I think a more
systematically and fairly administered death penalty would indeed have a
deterrent effect.

I agree, that's why it should be punished more severely. I've never understood
why committing a crime "in cold blood" was supposed to make it more evil than if
it was committed "in the heat of passion". It seems to me the conventional wisdom
has it exactly backwards.

The consequence of this "acting on impulse" theory is that the real problems
with sudden violence doesn't happen in the violent act. The real problem
lies before that when the agressor convinces himself that violence is the
answer. He's making a faulty program for himself.

When you sit quietly at home thinking about what to do if somebody provokes
you it is easy to imagine a scenario where you have several options.

1) Run and escape (if you can). or
2) Fight back (if there is no escape). or
3) Fight back no matter what (to save face) or ...

Lots of scenarios can be imagined. If you, because of pride, choose scenario
3) when you are quietly at home, then it is probably more likely that you
will do just that when in an agressive situation. If furthermore you decide
to carry a weapon there is a bigger risk of using it, because you have
actually decided to do it beforehand.

Many criminals pre-program their minds with the twisted meme that they have
to kill or mame to be cool. What is important is helping them to get another
program running.

Your theory is that the fear of a long sentence will make them think twice
about programming themself for violence. This is indeed a logical
conclusion. The only problem is that the punishment does not seem to have
the wanted effect. Thus the empirical data does not support the theory.

If that is so, what can we do differently to make them run the right
program?

Again, look at the usable bandwidth per node for the given solutions.
It's below 100Kbps. Radio is wonderful, but I want 100Mbps per node,
and I want a high node density.

We can look at how current intentional-but-genderless entities
get attracted to each other, form unions and produce offspring.
Look at corporations, research groups, and communities.
(Also, memetic evolution, genetic algorithms, etc.)
It's all there already, with all purposes - economy, exploration,
and fun. One can still find analogies with sexual reproduction
here in terms of gender, courting, intercourse, birth, and
child-raising, but I believe there are certain limits beyond which
such analogies shouldn't be stretched.
Interestingly enough, most of intentional reproduction is already
non-sexual, and sex is no longer necessary for even its original
purpose - to produce human offspring.  It will probably be
considered reckless in the near future, to produce children by
blind combinations of genes, without first running the new DNA
through at least a medical check-up.
So it looks like sex and genders have a very limited future...

A full-duplex FastEthernet link gives you roughly twice that/port. 
Using multiple NICs/node gives you even more bandwidth, and one which
scales up linearly with node size (ditto disk bandwidth, if each
node is equipped with individual disk(s)). Multiple-port NICs, even 
with switching functionality, are not unprecendented. In fact, I'll 
build my 8-node Beowulf(cub) switchless, with at least 3 NICs/node
early next year.  Much unexploited potential lies hidden in U-Net 
and 3D Now! SIMD instructions as well. Of course you can start 
instantly with MPI/PVM and PVFS, and use the cluster as a vanilla 
parallel supercomputer, using the advanced features peu a peu.

The following is only intended to show that dead people do have self-interest.

How about reputation? Some people really care about their legacy. It's not
ok to slander people when they're alive and it's still not ok after they
die. The only difference is that the person is no longer capable of
sticking up for themselves (dead people tend to be rather docile).

My gut feeling is that two NICs per node is the optimal number unless
the problems you are working on requires relatively high IPC/cycle ratio.
For such problems, you'll have trouble no matter what.

The following is only intended to show that dead people do have self-interest.

How about reputation? Some people really care about their legacy. It's not
ok to slander people when they're alive and it's still not ok after they
die. The only difference is that the person is no longer capable of
sticking up for themselves (dead people tend to be rather docile).

I'm in the process of developing some "enlightenment tests."
This is the first. It corresponds to level-1 freedom. See
<http://www.buildfreedom.com/resplev.htm>.

These Enlightenment Tests will be added to the Free World
Order website <http://www.buildfreedom.com/>.

I would appreciate your questions, comments, and suggestions
for improvement.

Frederick Mann


Proposed text:
--------------

We have four enlightenment tests:

1. Basic Freedom Enlightement Test
2. Live Free Enlightement Test <link>
3. Advanced Freedom Enlightement Test <link>
4. Immortality Enlightement Test <link>

These tests were inspired by "The Infamous Enlightenment Test"
<http://members.wbs.net/homepages/c/r/y/cryonic4life/enlightenment.html>.


Basic Freedom Enlightement Test
-------------------------------

I.

Reason (rational thinking) is desirable because it tends
to lead to beneficial results. Many forms of irrationality
tend to be dangerous and ineffective, and should be avoided.
(Certain creative thinking processes, such as "lateral thinking"
can be highly effective, yielding unexpected, beneficial results.)
We can continuously improve our thinking skills without limit.
One of the most powerful tools for improving thinking skills
is the ability to question everything.


II.

Individualism is a desirable characteristic from the individual's
point of view, meekness and conformism are not. The primary tools
for developing individuality are questioning, exploration,
experimentation, and self-expression.


III.

"Political correctness" is usually a euphemism for "dogmatic nonsense."
For example, all people are not equal. We are all unique individuals
with considerable differences.


IV.

The foundations of basic freedom are: (a) property rights; (b) voluntary
association and exchange; and (c) responsible contracts -- keeping your
word. Of utmost importance is that nobody has the right to coerce another,
i.e., initiate force, fraud, or violence against another.


V.

The right to keep and bear arms is a sound principle which furthers
personal empowerment and tends to reduce crime. 


VI.

The state should stay out of matters such as drug use/sale, gambling,
promiscuity, prostitution, pornography, abortion, and euthanasia. As
long as an action doesn't harm anyone else against their will, it
shouldn't be illegal. You have every (moral) right to ignore any law
that violates this principle (at your own risk, of course). 


VII.

One should take responsibility for the consequences of one's own
actions. For example, blaming tobacco companies for one's lung
cancer, a (possible) result of smoking, indicates irresponsibility. 


VIII.

Sanctimoniousness, ignorance, obedience, fear, and cowardice are among
the most destructive factors in Western society. Things like poverty,
high crime rates, the war on drugs, problems with [too many and the
wrong type of] immigrants, high taxes, and coercive rule by a rich
elite (oligarchy or plutocracy) all result from these factors. 


IX.

Generally speaking, people get the kind of government they deserve.
Although many people complain about the status quo, very few have the
courage and wisdom to take effective action resulting in positive change.
In a world with a majority of rational people, many of today's problems,
such as those caused by warped political and religious ideologies, simply
wouldn't exist. The self-perpetuating cycle of ignorance, obedience, fear,
and cowardice is the proverbial "root of all evil."


X.

Co-operation with like-minded people is very important, especially for
anyone who agrees with most of the above.

Yes, people care about their legacy while they are *alive*.  Once they are dead
they no longer care about their legacy.  I challenge you to show me how a dead
person can care about anything - unless of course your positing the existence of
of an afterlife.

If everybody carried a gun it's not clear if there would be more violence or
less. If somebody lost control of their temper the odds of them committing a
murder rather than just inflicting a punch in the nose would increase, but on
the other hand the odds of them actually lousing control of their temper would
decrease because they'd know they probably wouldn't survive such an encounter.
Also massacre spree killing would be virtually impossible.


     >Your theory is that the fear of a long sentence will make them think

If a criminally violent person is in jail at least he will be unable to act
violently against me, although he can still murder other prisoners and often
does just that. If a man is convicted of murder and yet manages to kill again
then that is as great a failure of the legal system as executing an innocent
person. For this and other reasons I don't think anybody should be in jail
longer than 10 years.

Apply the proper voltage, they won't run the right program but at least they'll

It's not nice to slander people but it should never be the law's business. Let
the reader determine for himself if what I say is true or not. If it really is
slander then my own reputation will soon suffer more than the person I talk
about. I hope our British list members will correct me if I'm wrong but there I
don't think a distinction is made between the living and the dead regarding
slander. At least the USA hasn't made that blunder yet.

There was a bleak, hideous instance of this failure on TV news here the
other night.  I've forgotten the details.  Some guy, perhaps in Ukraine or
one of the other former Soviet nations, is on trial as the greatest serial
killer in the country's history.  He's murdered, I dunno, 58 kids,
presumably after doing nasty things to them.  I have the impression that
the state was on the verge of abolishing capital punishment, but public
pressure now insists that it be retained `to deter future killers of this
kind'.  Yeah, great plan.  Look how well it did with deterring him!

Which is a different point altogether from the proposal to erase such
individuals to prevent future crimes by them and to save the costs of
containing them.  But it is still worth wondering if retaining judicial
killing has such a warping and hurtful effect on everyone else concerned
that the polity is harmed irretrievably by it.

Frankly, I haven't made up my mind about that - but in the meantime, I'm
agin it.  (If we *did* have reversible cryo, that really might be a
bridging answer.)

>If that is so, what can we do differently to make them run the right
>program?

To make them *want* to act in ways that don't impact so ruinously on other
people - yep, that's surely the biggest, hardest problem.  Everything I've
read suggests that formative experiences, especially cruel loss of warmth,
love and creative expression, are the key.  Which makes it hard to
intervene in the vicious cycle if you hold parental autonomy sacrosanct.

Just a wild guess here.

>From what I've seen hackers (programmers in general?) tend to be
individualistic.  

Are these individualistic hackers just a tiny bit upset with the fascists
trying to regulate the internet?

Who are the fascists (delegating/hiring/appointing/drafting) to fix the Y2k
problem?  Those same individualist hackers by any chance?  The fox guarding
the hen house perhaps?

I wouldn't be suprised to learn that there are MORE Y2K "bugs" now than the
original two digit date field problem.  More sophisticated bugs..viruses,
worms,.....

It should prove interesting.

Kind of like "Anarchists of the world.......UNITE!!!!!!".....????

Therein lies the heart of the problem...imho.  

I'm either a libertarian or an anarchist.  depends on the time of day.  I
don't want to boss anyone around...and I deeply resent BEING bossed around.
It must be genetic because I've been like a fish swimming upstream all my life
in that regard....I have a very solitary job...and prefer being alone to being
in a crowd.  

So we have a libertarian party...right.  By BECOMING a party or member
thereof...all the values and properties that describe an individual as opposed
to a "team player" are lost. Possibly if you take a wolf and domesticate him
he becomes a dog?  According to current thought to fight them you have to
become them...and thus we are lost.Having lost all differentiation from those
whom we oppose.

Depresssing.

Thankfully in my observation the prevailing trend of technology is opposing
authoritarianism and consequent centralization. 

Examples....

Laptops as opposed to mainframes.

Desktop publishing as opposed to publishing houses.

Trucks instead of trains...autos instead of Mass Transit.

The internet instead of Mass media....

and many more....


To counter the political process of today something else must be devised.
Copying the political parties...becoming a politcal party...wont hack
it.....Something analogous to the difference between a laptop vs a
mainframe...

Nonetheless I think there is a role for a libertarian party. If you go to
the back of 'Free to Choose' where the Friedmans reproduce the platform of
the US Socialist party, you see that most of it has been implemented. The
Socialist party won the ideological battle without ever getting elected. The
role of a libertarian party is similar. It should be principled but
reasoned. Its aim is not to win for the sake of winning but simply to give
more public exposure to its ideas. Politics is just one other platform.

A new style of chocolate is shaped like a truffle and is laced with Kavo,
gingko biloba and other herbs thought to improve memory.  (Not quite a
memory chip, but at least it tastes delicious.)

In Today's news, 'Smart' Food:

"Functional or smart foods provide enhanced health benefits beyond basic
nutrition and have taken the food industry by storm. Like the raw vitamins
and supplements they contain, functional foods do not require approval from
the FDA." 

These foods are said to ward off the many diseases that develop as we age.

This may be so, but you have yet to prove that killing a murderer is
wrong. Since the original judaeic laws (the Commandments) upon which our
western value system are based stated 'thou shalt not murder' (not the
erroneous 'thou shalt not kill') then only murder is wrong under our
western value system. Killing a murderer is not murder, when done either
in self defense or as the result of trial by ones peers. Therefore, two
wrongs have not been commited. More like one right cancels out one

In the fruit fly experiments, the Chicago researchers determined that the
genetic variations held in reserve depended on a protein called Heat shock
protein 90.

Hsp90 is known as a chaperone protein. As temperatures rise, it prevents
other proteins from going awry and disrupting normal cell functions and
growth, and also prevents degenerative diseases. 

However, Hsp90 gets spread too thin when conditions continue to
deteriorate. With the chaperone distracted, many different proteins begin to
misfire in cells. Genetic variations that were held in reserve begin to trigger. 

In the experiments, the researchers deliberately reduced the levels of Hsp90
in fruit flies to simulate the biological response in fruit flies to climate change. 

As many as 90 percent of the flies' offspring emerged with oddly shaped
wings, strange bristle configurations and limb deformities. The eventual
evolutionary benefits of these genetic changes were unknown, the
researchers said. 

The abnormalities persisted even when Hsp90 levels were returned to
normal in later generations, suggesting the changes had become permanent 
in the fruit flies' genetic code, Lindquist said.

The list members may be interested in several sources for specialized
supplements. I have used these companies in the past and recently several of
their products are aided me greatly in the recovery from an gall bladder
operation. (It's now clear that "you can go back to work in two weeks" does
NOT mean "you will be back to normal in two weeks". Basically once out of
the hospital you are on your own. Being told "you are not 18 anymore somehow
does not make me feel much better.)

I would HIGHLY recommend that if you use supplements you do so only under
the advice of an orthomolecular physician!

A not so obvious source of nutritional supplements besides a good local
health food store is your local sports nutrition store. There is a overlap
of interests in the sports/body building and health improvement communities
that most have not realized yet.

                  Why Those With Vision Embrace Imperfection

                  By Virginia Postrel
                  Washington Post
                  Sunday, November 22, 1998; Page C01

                  Just about every morning around 6, I wake up and glance
                  at a clock perched four feet away. Its glowing red
                  digits tell me that it is not yet time to get up, and I
                  happily roll over for another hour or so of sleep.
                  Whenever I think about it, I am amazed that I can open
                  my eyes in the dim light of morning and see.

                  Every couple of weeks, when I take the required break
                  from my wear-to-bed contact lenses, I get a sharp
                  reminder of why my amazement is justified. On those
                  mornings, the clock is nothing but a dark blur, its
                  digits smeared into a bright discoloration with no hint
                  of meaning. That is the way the world--all the world
                  more than a foot or so away--looks to my naked eyes. No
                  one who sees the world this way can simply scoff at the
                  notion of progress.

                  The development of the contact lens shows how
                  dissatisfaction and demand breed innovation and
                  improvement. Back in the late 19th century, an obsessed
                  Swiss physician named A. Eugen Fick had glass lenses
                  ground to his specifications, tested them on rabbits and
                  then tried them on himself--for two whole hours. He
                  recorded problems that the lenses posed and explored
                  possible causes. Over the next century, eye specialists,
                  later joined by polymer chemists, experimented with lens
                  materials and sizes, with ways of making impressions of
                  the eyeball and with wetting solutions--all in pursuit
                  of a lens that would provide the right vision correction
                  and could be worn for long stretches of time without
                  harm or irritation.

                  It was a long and difficult process, with inherent risks
                  for both innovators (whose ideas might not work) and
                  users (whose eyes might be injured). Yet this is how
                  progress arises: through trial and error, experiment and
                  feedback. Both components are crucial. As economic
                  historian Joel Mokyr notes, "If every harebrained
                  technological idea were tried and implemented, the costs
                  would have been tremendous. Like [biological] mutations,
                  most technological innovations are duds and deserve to
                  be eliminated. Yet overcoming the built-in resistance is
                  the key to technological progress: If no harebrained
                  idea was ever tried, we would still be living in the
                  Stone Age."

                  This principle applies to all innovation. How we feel
                  about this process tells us who we are as individuals
                  and as a civilization: Do we think progress requires a
                  central blueprint, or do we see it as a decentralized,
                  evolutionary process? Do we see mistakes as permanent
                  disasters, or as correctable byproducts of
                  experimentation? Do we search for "stasis"--a regulated,
                  engineered world? Or do we embrace "dynamism"--a world
                  of constant creation, discovery and competition? These
                  poles increasingly define our political, intellectual
                  and cultural landscape.

                  Because they believe we learn from choice, competition
                  and criticism--not from picking winners in
                  advance--dynamists are willing to put up with
                  experiments that may not work, or that they think are
                  lousy. And they embrace plenitude. Their world has room
                  for a range of enterprises: for both Promise Keepers and
                  Ms. magazine; for the macho culture of Intel and the
                  zaniness of Southwest Airlines; for punks and
                  debutantes; Mozart and Madonna; "The Little Mermaid" and
                  "Pulp Fiction." Dynamists do not demand that we
                  collectively choose "one best way."

                  This way of thinking is foreign to most public debates,
                  which are often governed by static, technocratic
                  assumptions. In early 1996, about a year into the
                  Republican takeover of Congress, I met with a Capitol
                  Hill insider who tried to explain what had gone wrong
                  with Newt Gingrich's "revolution." The problem, he said,
                  was that most members of Congress--including
                  "revolutionary" Republicans--couldn't imagine life
                  without central, governmental direction. "They're good
                  conservatives, so they want to reduce government," he
                  said. "But they think of that as getting as close to the
                  abyss as possible without falling off."

                  Life as the abyss. All too often, that attitude shapes
                  our political discussion. We have become so accustomed
                  to technocratic governance that we take for granted that
                  new ideas, products or problems require government
                  scrutiny and centralized "solutions." Most political
                  arguments thus take place between competing technocratic
                  schemes: Should the tax code favor families with
                  children or people attending college? Should a national
                  health insurance program enroll everyone in managed
                  care, or should we regulate HMOs so they act more like
                  fee-for-service doctors? Should we regulate, subsidize
                  or ban biotechnology? The question often isn't whether
                  the future should be molded to fit a static ideal. It's
                  whose blueprint should rule.

                  Instead of rushing to address every new development with
                  a grand plan or an ad hoc solution, dynamists have the
                  patience to let trial and error work. "Premature
                  choice," physicist Freeman Dyson wrote in 1992, "means
                  betting all your money on one horse before you have
                  found out whether she is lame."

                  The search for the perfect corrective lens provides a
                  microcosm of dynamism at work. Eyeglasses to correct
                  nearsightedness were invented around the year 1500, two
                  centuries after reading glasses. For me in the late
                  1960s, they were miracle enough. The trees once again
                  had leaves and the chalkboards had words. Contact lenses
                  came a decade later, along with more wonders: peripheral
                  vision, sharper and more consistent focus, no annoying
                  smudges, no slipping down my nose. And I did look
                  better.

                  Another decade passed. My hard lenses had been replaced
                  by gas-permeable ones, safer because they let in more
                  oxygen. But when I moved to Los Angeles, my eyes
                  couldn't take the dry air: The lenses would cause me
                  pain within a few hours, driving me back to glasses and
                  all the shortcomings I thought I'd escaped. Finally, a
                  new optometrist hit on a solution: disposables, which
                  had been on the market only a couple of years. Unlike
                  rigid lenses, they came in off-the-shelf sizes--easier
                  to fit than shoes--and could be quickly and cheaply
                  replaced. They were super-wet and got thrown away before
                  they could get grungy. As an added bonus, I could keep
                  them in for two weeks at a time.

                  The inventors are still at work, and the perfect contact
                  lens remains always out of reach. This process is hardly
                  unique to contacts. Authors revise books, cooks fiddle
                  with recipes, teachers try new techniques and parents
                  hope to do better with their second child than their
                  first. Rarely do we discover perfection. The
                  imperfections of the world generate the demand for
                  progress. "Form follows failure," explains civil
                  engineering professor Henry Petroski, whose popular
                  books explore the histories of such mundane objects as
                  zippers and forks.

                  Fix one problem and others arise. Or having solved the
                  more serious problems, we turn to others we never
                  worried about before. Car makers refine the placement of
                  cup holders; dishwasher manufacturers design fold-down
                  racks; Procter & Gamble produces Tide Free for the
                  allergy-prone. Post-it Notes sprang from one man's
                  discontent with the bookmarks that kept falling out of
                  his choir hymnal.

                  Contrary to the traditional technocratic vision, the
                  very nature of progress dictates an inherently open,
                  unpredictable and imperfect future. This diverse,
                  decentralized process makes those who crave control
                  uncomfortable. No one is in charge, and the results are
                  risky.

                  Consider the advice dispensed by Vogue medical columnist
                  and physician Isadore Rosenfeld on disposable,
                  extended-wear contact lenses. Three of the four experts
                  he surveyed, Rosenfeld wrote in June 1994, say sleeping
                  in the lenses "is not safe" and is unjustified "unless
                  you're having near-sighted dreams." Don't do it, he
                  warned, but added, "There's good news on the horizon:
                  I'm told there are lenses in development that will
                  permit adequate passage of oxygen to the eye and will
                  likely be safer for overnight wear."

                  As consumer information on the inherent hazards of
                  sticking pieces of plastic in your eyes and then going
                  to sleep, Rosenfeld's column was entirely reasonable. He
                  questioned cornea authorities and presented up-to-date
                  research. And I can testify from excruciatingly painful
                  personal experience that extended-wear lenses do entail
                  the risk of corneal ulcers.

                  But would we have contact lenses at all, much less safer
                  lenses in development, if everyone shared Rosenfeld's
                  attitude toward risk taking? We can only imagine what
                  he--or any other sensible person--would have advised the
                  obsessed Dr. Fick when he was placing ground-glass
                  lenses over his eyeballs and observing the results.

                  Confined to a fashion magazine, Rosenfeld's preference
                  for progress without risk is a benign fantasy, no more
                  dangerous than the lingerie ad it followed. But it is,
                  in fact, a fantasy. Risk and courage are essential to
                  innovation. The early adopters who take chances with
                  unproven innovations provide critical feedback both to
                  innovators and later users. The information they supply
                  helps determine whether a new idea will flop altogether
                  or get to prove itself to a larger public.

                  Just about every new idea goes through a debugging
                  process. When the use of bank credit cards spread in the
                  1960s, the losses bordered on the catastrophic. Issuing
                  banks lost millions of dollars in theft, fraud and bad
                  debts. Consumers screamed about receiving unordered
                  cards in the mail--a technique banks used to establish a
                  large enough network of cardholders to interest
                  retailers. Pundits warned of a nation of "credit
                  drunks." Congress held hearings, led by Wright Patman,
                  then the powerful chairman of the House Banking and
                  Currency Committee. He threatened to regulate bank cards
                  out of business. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed,
                  and only minor restrictions became law.

                  As for the risks (and losses) the banks took, they were
                  as necessary as they were painful. "Most credit card
                  veterans now view the late 1960s as a time of madness,
                  culminating in staggering losses to the banks, public
                  embarrassment and federal legislation," Joseph Nocera
                  wrote in "A Piece of the Action," a history of the
                  "money revolution." From that chaos emerged our current
                  credit card system.

                  Trial and error is a very humble process. It invests no
                  one with decisive power, assumes no one is omniscient or
                  even particularly wise. It cherishes the unheralded
                  inventor willing to test a new idea. It recognizes that
                  most ideas will fail--but converts that weakness into a
                  powerful lever for progress. "There is no way to find
                  the best design except to try out as many designs as
                  possible and discard the failures," writes physicist
                  Dyson.

                  Progress does not mean that everyone will be better off
                  in every respect. But under ordinary circumstances, for
                  the random individual, life in a dynamic society will be
                  better tomorrow, on the whole, than life today. It will
                  offer more variety, more opportunity, more options, more
                  knowledge, more control over time and place, more life.
                  It will address more sources of dissatisfaction (though
                  it may also call attention to new ones) and create more
                  sources of delight.

                  And while dynamism will not perfect moral character or
                  avert foolish ideas, its continuous processes of
                  criticism and correction will, over time, curb excesses
                  and limit damage. We have not discovered the one best
                  way to live, nor is it likely that we ever will. But we
                  can improve our lot by building on the discoveries,
                  insights and experiments of the past.

Sasha, et al:  

(Hope everyone is having a restful holiday)

My perspective on this: the very concepts of 'feminine' and 'masculine' are
in themselves cultural constructs based almost entirely on religious
superstitions.  A central set of human characteristics was arbitrarily
divided into one of the two categories, and it is taught as part of most
religious dogma.  But, other than a desire to maintain a certain societal
structure, there exists absolutely no rational basis for continuing this
division of 'masculine/feminine', or for connecting the characteristsics so
strongly with dominant and subservient roles.  To do so only perpetuates
irrational and entropic memes, rather than breaking new ground.

I would also ask you to explain why it is so 'necessary' for some people to
lead and other people to take on subservient roles, when in most advancing
associations and corporations most persons are considered individual
contractors, equal members of a team.  All indications are that standing
concepts of heirarchy will not survive the marketplace (Read: _The Fifth
Discipline_).  A strong level of testosterone in any person might make them
ceo of a corporation, but it might as easily render them 'persona non grata'
in the changing world of learning corporations and horizontal heirarchies.
The 'meek' may indeed inherit, simply by being able to work effectively with
others, or by their desire to work independently outside of heirarchy.
Neither path requires real agressiveness, only skill, determination and
perserverance--three qualities that are not particularly informed by
hormonal levels.  The market landscape ahead:  individual autonomous
contractors and team-oriented corporations.

As I've already stated, since the victim was killed, it is the
society that must act for them.

Since you are so opposed to the death penalty, I suggest you add a
clause to your living will stating in the event of your horrible
murder, you do not wish the killer to receive the death penalty.

If a member of the jury, I would honor your request.

As I argued to Paul, since the victim is dead they cannot act in

his/her life in the act of taking another. The murderer does not
get to enjoy living, nor can they spread their genes/memes. The
ultimate price for the ultimate despicable act.

"In time, each of us will be a completely changed being, shaped more by
external challenges than by our own desires."  (_Mind Children_, Hans Moravec)

Biological blueprints and history provide an understanding of gender
characteristics and inherent qualities. The cultural landscape that causes
us to question and define ourselves will play a rapidly declining role as
known today. Where once we judged a person by the starch in his shirt, or
the number of children she could produce; in a less gender-distinct world
we may enjoy the qualities of one another from a vantage point far removed
from the bias that cripples our ability to move beyond rigid thinking. 

Such rigidity is nibbled away like crudits by our impending future.

It has been my estimation that adrogeny (andr + gune) is a first step in
the selection of qualities by *individual choice.*  

Being transhuman may require some changes in our thinking styles that are
not selected by choice, but out of necessity in the replacement of old
parts as they wear out.  Keeping in step, moving forward -- what Hans
Moravec refers to as a type of Olympics. 

Our "mind children" may instill a mix of qualities that are optimal,
produce the best results and have no mention or reference to gender. These
traits may be availably categorized by merit, rather than gender
segregation. Changing style, thinking or gender distinct, is a process that
must take place in order to move forward. The hard line
intellectual/personality distinctions between male and female is becoming a
soft-lead gaussian stroke.

I've finished "Neverness" and "The Broken God" by  David Zindell.
I'm currently reading "The Wild". Very probably  I will read the next
one too.
Great books !!! No need to tell you these books should be owned by all
bookworm transhumanists ;)
Thanks to you all, to make me discover this author.

I would like to find/buy the short story "Shanidar".
This story has been written by Zindell before "Neverness".
Does somebody has an idea how it could easily?

Yes, *of course* it makes perfect sense to index every citizen's
DNA and fingerprints (and fortunately this is likely to happen 
sooner or later). The potential risks are truly insignificant compared
to the enormous benefits. Of course, the same goes for national
surveillance systems (with databanks) etc. Plain old common 
sense...I've never really understood the paranoia that seems to
grip many people when this subject comes up; it takes *a lot
more* to get "1984".

So genotype, karyotype and phenotype is irrelevant, and the 
animal kingdom is entirely androgynous as well, as we all well 
know. Always thought so. Even if, we're certainly not animals, 
oh no. Beep. Boys will be girls, girls will be boys, World Without 
End. Pass the lancet. According to the average person 
in the street, the latest consensus is also that there is 
really no difference at all, at least not where it really 
matters. Suction. Newsflash: Vatican is now seriously meditating 
about declaring obligate heterosexuality to be a cardinal sin. 
Gynecologists focusing on prostata jobs. More oxygen. Female 
pedophilia running rampant. Staples. Women now dominate the U.S. prisoner 
populations. Staples. Give me another toke of what you've been having, 
thanks. Ten joules, stand clear.

Such a strange coincidence that the tenor of the dogma is the same all
around the globe. Clerics of the world, unite. We know how they are
good at providing the unified view. Oops, forgot they're part of the
conspiracy. Of course verbally conjuring egality where there is 
none is in no ways dogmatic, oh no. What was the other word for it, 
errrr, political correctness? Affirmative action? Whatever you call 
it, trying to annihilate one bias by an another does not address 
the root of the problem. So; let's remove the cause, and not the 
symptoms.

So both males and females grow pregnant, and both devote themselves
equally to their offspring. Good news, this. Employers will rejoice. 
No, I don't really need to see the reference.

You've been really digging the propaganda, have you? Or did you
actually have a first-hand experience of the difference between 
some poor slob slaving at the outsourced (secondary and tertiary) 
sweatshop fringe of the project and the bona fide employee with 
health benefits and full stock option? Sorry, my crystal ball 
is cracked, lend me yours.

Hitherto I never realized that CEO behaviour was totally determined by their
testosterone level. How good to know, I'll be asking tough questions
at the next job interview. 'Uh, your benefits are excellent, but what
I'd actually'd like to know is at what your serum testosterone value 
does usually average? What do you mean with "confidential"?'.

True! True! Aggressive people can never make it to the top of the hierarchy!
Personal assertiveness is a totally gender-independant trait! Wow! Now
excuse me, see ya, gotta run, gotta get some lavender dye and my favourite axe!

The day gender will become nivellated will be the day after the
Singularity. Assuming that the problem is solvable prior to that is
almost as foolish as assuming that it will persists after the
transition.

Strange, and it isn't even spring this time.

Dan:

Yesterday I enjoyed a Thanksgiving meal with my mother, Marsha, 
hosted at the home of one of her coworkers from Boeing, Dan, who's 
wife, Jo, makes great coffee.  Also present was a very intellegent 
gentleman named Gail Griebel, who also works at Boeing, and his 
wife, Norma, who works at a bank.  The six of us had a good visit.

Gail was very kind and informative.  He's a very good listener, and 
is very enthusiastic about about the Open Source community's efforts 
to build a decentralized, broadband Internet, from the ground up.

We discussed how much the world is changing as a result of ubiquitous 
affordable telecommunications and personal computing.  I ranted about 
how satellite surveillance, robotics, and gps chips have nearly made 
military hardware and armies obsolete.  And how networked PCs 
will soon lead to government by referendum, instead of by 
representative elected officials.  How in the world can industrial 
lobbyists get their elected representatives to justify defense 
spending, when we can send enough electricity to any x,y,z coordinate 
to completely disintegrate whatever happens to be there?

Dan and Gail are electric train enthusiasts.  This weekend at the 
Pacific Science Center (http://www.pacsci.org/public/menu/) there is 
a model railroad show.  Interestingly, my father's last memory of his 
father, Donald, was of the two of them playing with electric trains 
(see http://www.lionel.com/), on a model railroad.  Donald would come 
home from his job at Kodak (http://www.kodak.com), and he and my 
father, Tom, would play with electric trains.

Imagine all that Hoover Dam (http://www.hooverdam.com/) electricity 
that's wasted in overflow!  IMHO, we ought to mass produce flywheels 
(http://www.trinityflywheel.com/flytech.htm), with the same scale and 
production line efficiency of GE's mass produced dishwashers and 
refridgerators (http://www.ge.com/oac/appliance.htm). We could place 
them in backyard underground storage arrays! In the event of thunder 
storms or lightning strikes, your home-based web site serving Bob 
Villa style home-improvement videos (http://www.thisoldhouse.org/) 
would stay up!  How's that for redundant systems, Uninterruptible 
Power Supplies, and fault tolerance??

Pardon the tangent!

Anyway, back to the subject of broadcast vs. point-to-point...

Gail mentioned that we works closely with a brilliant gentleman named 
Perry Towles.  He said that Perry "lives and breathes" laser 
communications, and loves to talk shop.  He said Perry might even be 
willing to join a mailing list and provide advice.  I overheard Gail 
mentioning something to Dan about Lucent (http://www.lucent.com) 
terrestrial laser heads.

Although this is outside my area of expertise, I'd like very much to
for you to make contact with Gail, to see if he and Perry could join
this discussion.  Better than I, you would be able to provide both of 
them with a general sense of how Foresight, Open Source, and the 
"extropian" list fit together as a private, informal, problem-solving 
mechanism.  You might want to tell them about using anymous 
remailers, so they don't get into trouble at work.

Gail's work e-mail address is Gail.A.Griebel@Boeing.com.  His private 
e-mail address is ggriebel@aol.com.  I'd advise using his home 
address, since he works on something regarding Teledesic, and we 
wouldn't want any conflict of interest problems popping up at work.  
I personally shared my feelings that I didn't think Teledesic was 
going to make it off the ground, since Bill Gates isn't Open Source.  
That remains to be seen, of course.

Although this thread was interesting while its lasted, I am *not*
necessarily opposed to the death penalty.  However, I think the death
penalty is not extropian as the title of this thread was asking.  My
personal feelings regarding the death penalty and whether it is
extropian or not, are two separate issues.

Like you, there are times in my humanness that I want to see someone die
for the cruelties they have inflicted on others.  But as an extropian, I
am constantly striving to transcend that humanness and all its emotional
(and sometimes savage) baggage that goes along with it.  IMHO, if we are
to truly reach a transhumanist society, the death penalty and all other
forms of killing will have to go.

Very Best Regards,

Paul Hughes

No. Wrong. Incorrect. Extropians are defined in terms of the Principles.
They are *not* defined as libertarian transhumanists. Most of us tend to
fit that description well, but you do not have to clearly fit the
definition of "libertarian" to be Extropian.

BTW, the latest version of the Principles is 3.0, not 2.6. Please refer to
the Open Society principle there.

When "society" proposes to classify transhumanists and extropians as
"violent criminals" then we'll need protection from "society."

I think the world needs criminal corpsicles about as much as it needs to
collide with a giant asteroid. "Where society outlaws cryogenics, only
outlaws will get frozen."  --Elmer Fudd

Idea: Find the cause of criminality, and fix it. (Oh, sorry, I had convinced
myself that science and technology could do practical things as well as spin
off more computer games and Borg movies.) But just think, if some savvy
transhuman network actually determined the cause of criminality and fixed
it, suddenly the "death penalty" would join the "scarlet letter" in the
dustbin of irrelevance.

Great essay by Postrel, Kathryn.  It's an excerpt from her book I've been

 Anyone interested in secure OS's (as opposed to the security flaws
of popular systems) should look at capability based systems such as EROS.
See:
http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eros/essays/capintro.html
http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eros/eros.html
http://www.caplet.com/security/taxonomy/

 I've only skimmed these ideas (and have limited interest in this subject),
but they appear to eliminate most types of security holes (leaving mainly
the problems such as poorly chosen passwords or people intentionally
giving information to untrustworthy entities).
 I suspect this kind of approach to security will be needed before it is
safe to upload.

R.U. Sirius, writer for such magazines as Mondo 2000, 21 C, and Wired has
developed a platform for running for president. R.U. is a good friend to
many of us and has a wonderful sense of humor and flare.  Although his
political interests are surely tongue-in-cheek, the Web site is a lot of fun.

"The Revolution is a new political party that aims to be the voice of the
non-voter, the alienated, the visionaries, the rabble, and the Internet.
Combining left and libertarian politics with a kind of post-political
futurism and the love of a good laugh, The Revolution intends to bring all
the subcultural tribes together to wrest control of worldwide political
systems from the drug warriors, the cultural ayatollahs, and the various
corporate mega-destructo gangs, ranging from the military-industrial
complex to the HMOs ad infinitum."

http://www.the-revolution.org/

"In 1993, Sirius split from Mondo 2000. Since then, he's contributed his
increasingly acerbic scribblings to publications ranging from ARTFORUM
International to Wired to Esquire Japan. In 1994, he recorded an unreleased
album called IOU Babe for Trent Reznor's Nothing Records with his
conceptual-art rock band MV Inc. (formerly called Mondo Vanilli). He has
also co-authored two books with St. Jude, Cyberpunk Handbook: the Real
Cyberpunk Fakebook (Random House), and How to Mutate and Take Over the
World (Ballantine)."

Do studies evidence that more and more males fail at math and science? Can
this have anything to do with more and more females excelling in these
subjects? After all, one cannot excel without another failing to do so. What
do the methodologies involved in these studies contribute to their outcomes?
What ulterior agendas do some researchers reveal by initiating tax-funded
studies about de-genderizing knowledge? When can we expect a female Einstein
(or another male one, given current trends in discounting masculine aptitude
in math)?

Sometimes for various reasons the weight of the brain of famous people
was measured immediately after their death and recorded. The brain of
the average adult male weighs 3 LB 2.2 oz. Einstein's brain was about
average size, the same was true of Gauss, one of the two or three
greatest mathematicians who ever lived. Ironically the brain of Franz
Gall (1828) the founder of phrenology which maintained that you could
tell everything about a person by the size and shape of their head
turned out to have a small brain, only 2 LB 10.3 oz. The smallest brain
of any non retarded person was 2 LB 3.8 oz and belonged to Anatole
France (1924), a well regarded writer of philosophical novels who is
still read today. At the other end of the scale is another novelist,
the great Russian writer Sergeyvich Turgenev (1883), he had a huge
brain, 4 LB 6.9 oz. In fact for almost a century Turgenev had the
largest brain known of any human being famous or not. Turgenev only
lost his title in 1975 when an autopsy was performed on a man of no
known unusual intellectual ability, he did however own a 4 LB 8.29 oz
brain.

That's all that needs to be said about it then. A punishment that fits the
crime.  Deterrance etc doesn't enter into the argument.  However the death
penalty does prevent multiple offenses....

or as retroman@together.net (Michael Lorrey) so eloquently states.....

I can agree with that....

However in state sponsored executions I would  like to see the method changed.
I think total body organ harvesting would be much more appropriate.

My guess is that intelligence quotients are tied more closely to the density
and number of connections within the brain instead of sheer brain mass.
Whale brains are considerably heavier than human brains but the number of
neurons in a whale brain is sigificantly less than that of a human's.  I
have not been able to identify any scanning technology that allows a
determination of connection density, or even neuronal density except
posthumously.

Here's some more estimates to throw into the "how smart was that person?"

I suggest that you try living for a period of time ....perhaps a year?.... NOT

I think it is more a matter of bringing to the public, especially parents,
a positive view of how math and science have become more widely appreciated
in the school system by all students.  I don't think it is a matter of
wasting money needlessly or pitting one gender against the other.

Nor do I think it was to enlighten business community strategists that the

Could the Nucleus Accumbens be transplanted from an old man, to his 
cryonically suspended twin?

For example, my uncle, Mark Howard Riegel, is now 54 years old.  He 
is very sick at this moment.  He's fought several bouts of severe 
opression, and become very heavy.  Now he has a serious case of heart 
disease. 

If he had been cloned, or if his zygote had been pulled into several 
cell clusters, and some of them had been cryonically suspended (prior 
to his placement into my grandmother, Melva's, uterus), would there 
be hope for Mark's "reincarnation", by placing his "experiened" 
quantum interfaced nucleus accumbens into one of his twins?

For example, he's born in 1944, but his anencephalic identical twin 
is born born in 1971, and kept on life support to this date.  If Mark 
dies sometime this week, could Mark be brought back as a 27 year old? 
 Physically, he'd appear to be at half life, but emotionally and 
intellectually, he'd have his full life's experience, right?

It seems to me the death penalty has nothing to do with extropy, because
extropy searches for ways to make life (i.e., complex adaptive systems) more
abundant, prosperous, excellent, healthy, beautiful, practical, autonomous,
satisfying, enjoyable, and self-organized. Consequently, extropy means to
decrease, if not to eliminate, violent crime and violent criminals. No one
can eliminate a crime which has already occurred. So, to act extropically
entails prevention more than deterrence or correction.

Extropians identify the cause of criminal behavior and deal with that rather
than merely react to the behavior. Just about anything would probably work
better than the death penalty. In fact, i guess that if you killed the
parents of murderers, instead of the murderers, the crime of murder would
drop to near zero in one generation, because we can sum up the cause of
violent crime in three words: stupid, unfit parents.

But the death penalty receives plenty of good press because the prison
industry, the just-us system, and corrupt politicians really do not have a
motive for eliminating murder and other violent crimes -- crime puts
Mercedes in their garages. Furthermore, extropians ought to find out what
causes the illness that prompts people to work for the prison/punishment
industry that perpetuates the problem.

We have the stars to reach, but we can't do it unless we detach from all
dysfunctional death cultures, including those that support a death
penalty. --J. R.

"most intentional reproduction is already non-sexual"? You mean immaculate
conception has replaced sex for intentional parents? This makes artificial
insemination non-sexual. Or perhaps you mean non-coital? I thought sexual
reproduction meant having children via sperm and egg as opposed to asexual
parentage via cloning. --J. R.

One more option, Max:
Give violent convicted criminals the option to end their own lives with a
drug of their own choice. Who knows, if this option were put in place,
prison populations (of which two thirds consist of convicts with
drug-related offenses, violent and otherwise) might almost disappear in a
year or two.

I love science, and always have.
Because I hold science in very high esteem, I despise the sorcerer's
apprentices (less charitable folks might refer to them as assholes) who
misuse it. Maybe I didn't state this clearly enough, or maybe you just
didn't get it. My quarrel relates to pseudo-scientists who feign interest in
solving real human problems, but who actually want things to remain the
same.

As this relates to the topic at hand: Extropian science would look for the
cause of criminal behavior which some people want punished by death. --JRM

Well, I barely discuss it with my friends. Actually during one break
period I showed one of my friends the Extropian Homepage, heh, she
really wasn't very interested. I don't think they really understand it
and it doesn't really appeal to them. Then again I'm not quite sure if
anything appeals to them. Heh. I'm not even sure if they have ever heard
the word transhumanistic. The people I hang out with aren't really like
me. They listen to the same music as me, you know like Nirvana, Nine
Inch Nails... But I've never really met anyone that is interested in the
same ideas and thoughts as me. That's kind of why I joined the mailing
list, so I can read what others think about things that I don't normally
discuss with my friends, or family.

My telephone company is USWEST.  Sometimes, my telephone 
conversations make interesting fodder for discussion.

I hereby grant USWEST and Time-Warner permission to use recordings of 
my telephone calls in behind the scenes discussions, without further 
direct interaction with me.

Of course, this bring up the whole question of verification.

Having worked at SGI, I know that special effects experts can fake 
almost anything, including surveillance audio and video.

This might include pairing the sound of Waterford Crystal toasts, 
with statements like "Here's to letting go of the gold standard!".

Maybe two glasses touched, or maybe it was just a little digital 
compositing by the guys at Dreamworks, SKG!  (Don't call Richard D. 
McCormick, Chariman and Chief Executive Officer of U S WEST, Inc., at 
303-793-6500, because his secretary is extremely busy these days.)

When thinking about the resonance decay of Waterford Crystal toasts, 
I can help but ask how long the noise would last if the toast was 
made using goblets made of diamond?  

On an unrelated note: those mass produced backyard flywheel arrays 
might not be safe underground in Homer's backyard, given the poor 
drainage and increasing rainfall lately, due to global warming 
(http://www.whitehouse.gov/PCSD/).  Time to bring in the containment 
experts over at Tupperware (http://www.tupperware.com/).  Now I know 
why AT&T, USWEST, TCI, and a lot of other forward thinkers are up 
there in the Rocky Mountains!  Where better to put the 
UPS!? (http://www.ups.com/ or http://www.minuteman-ups.com/?)

We're gonna need a UPS to keep those absolutely silent, now you see 
it, now you don't, MEMS-skinned, disc-shaped space ships afloat!  
Wouldn't want to see anyone falling out of the sky on the Seattle to 
Portland shuttle!  See http://www.sciam.com/0197issue/0197moin.html.

Regarding teledesic, maybe we could do a Hubble style retrofit of 
Iridium and create a quantum switched two-way neural telepathy system 
to read the thoughts of the squirrels and chipmunks down on the 
ground.  That would make law enforcement easier, as I try to collect 
taxes from the blue jays building nests in my backyard!

Just kidding, there's plenty of space in the trees for the birds to 
build nests, and there are lots of pumpkin seeds for the squirrels!

Well, it is true that many of society's problems are caused by parents
abusing their kids. In fact, afaik, child abuse is a much bigger problem
than all other crimes combined. Of course it doesn't explain *all* criminal
activity, as some criminals are simply "born evil" and some crimes are
fairly rational or due to circumstance. Nevertheless, solving the problem
of child abuse should be high on every government's agenda (for various
practical and "moral" reasons). 

How to deal with it? 

a) Compulsory psychological screening and parenting tests for everyone who wants
children (let them care for a very annoying "automatic" baby that has,
em, full bodily functions etc. for about a month. That should put off most
unprepared parents).

b) No children if you can't support them financially (abuse is especially
rampant in poor families. Everyone's frustrated (nothing gets people more
on edge than financial problems, as I know from personal experience),
the parents are often drunks, the father beats the kids and his wife 
because he's a dumb, frustrated asshole etc. You know the picture...)
Ironically, those that can least afford it often have the most children.

c) A special police service for abuse victims: if you're being abused
at home (or any other place for that matter), the police will install a
domestic surveillance system without the abuser's knowledge and
monitor the situation. Evidence gathered in this way will be used in
court. Incidentally, the monitoring service can also be installed if
others (such as doctors, friends of the alleged victim, school officials)
point out a household as potentially abusive).

d) Tough punishments for abusers (jail time and corporal punishment).
After jail (or in the case of minor abuse after a stern warning/fine)
permanent installment of cameras in the offender's house, as a
preventive measure and to serve as evidence should abuse reoccur.
The victim gets a personal alarm, which summons the police (after
checking via integral phone and the cam system). In a libertarian
scenario, this would be a PPA (but, how does a kid pay a PPA?
Uh-huh!)

e) In more severe cases the victim would be placed in a special
caring center (with varying degrees of independence according to
age, but generally speaking a lot of freedom, according to the
golden rule). Separate living quarters for everyone, of course full
surveillance (appartment surveillance is optional, not compulsory)
to prevent any abuse or other irregularities by staff (strict selection,
few or no men) or other occupants. The general feel should be that
of a vacation resort or a hotel, *not* a (pedophile & fascist-ridden )
prison. Education is, of course, "transhuman style", with a lot of
emphasis on rational thinking, personal empowerment etc. Multiple
generations of rational, law-abiding and progressive individuals
would likely be the pleasant (side-) effect of the anti-abuse program.

f) Of course, the abusers (should they ever get out of jail) would
be slapped with a perpetual restraining order, to be enforced by
an electronic ankle bracelet (or something more sophisticated).
The former victim gets a receiver that goes off whenever the
abuser gets within the "forbidden" (1 mile for ex.) radius. Of course
the police also get a beep. Should the abuser somehow manage
to do harm to the victim anyway (or abuse someone else), he
goes to jail (labor camp) for life (or at least a *long* time). Should
he kill his victim, he is to be executed in a most unpleasant way.

g) It goes without saying that known abusers are *never ever*
allowed to have kids (again).

Interesting. Since the speed of sound is higher in diamond, the tone
would likely be higher pitched too. Nanobuilt goblets might even
include microstructures to modulate the tone in some nice way (music
playing goblets is somewhat tacky, though).

Can we come up with more "transhuman dinner technology"? Smart napkins
are of course a must. I have been thinking of diamondoid knives, with
sharpness determined by pressing one part of the surface. But what
about the weight ergonomics? Do we need to weigh them down to make
them comfortable?

On the other hand, chopsticks have the nice property of being used
just by one hand, making it possible to both eat and gesticulate.

Nanotech dishwashing agents might be interesting, although they could
be dangerous if trying to lyse the wrong things. "Never add the start
signal while in contact with the dishwater!"

 The design he presented appears flawed. He indicates that the tubes
have hemispherical ends yet roll up like a sleeping bag. I don't see
how the hemispherical part can be flattened to fit inside the rolled
up part, and Ralph doesn't seem to have an answer to this. Possibly
a nanohorn (cone-shaped) tip would work. The existence of nanohorns
is new enough that they probably haven't been analyzed much yet.

 "Noncoercive world government" is an appropriate name for what you have
described, and the fact that noncoercive and government sound odd together
probably reflects the difficulty of satisfying all your desires.

Earn up to $1500 per Week Working from Home!

Help Solve Your Money Problems! 

  Right now you could be making easy money while working 
from the comfort of your own home. If you can fold and 
insert a circular into an envelope, seal the envelope and 
mail it - you can become an active participant in our 
successful circular-mailing program. Many circular mailers 
are making $1,500 or more weekly working under the expert 
guidance of our company. Circular mailing is easy and 
pleasant work that is very profitable! 

  Just imagine - no more worries about inflation, recession, 
bills, and other costs. If you are looking for an easy 
income to relieve your financial pressures, you owe it to 
yourself to look into our offer. 

No Experience or Special Skills Required 

  Our system of circular mailing is very easy to operate! 
Our circulars are the sales letters that you will send out 
in response to customer inquiries. All you will be doing is 
taking the standard, letter-sized (8 1/2 x 11) circulars 
that we provide you with and fold them to fit into the 
envelopes you will receive. After you have folded and 
inserted the circulars into the envelopes, you just have to 
lick and seal the envelopes and drop them in the mail. 
Youll never have to pay for postage or envelopes to mail 
the circulars. 

  You do not need to have any related experience or special 
skills. Our circular-mailing program is designed especially 
for people with little or no business experience. We want 
you to work and to be happy and remain active with this 
terrific program for many years. We will show you, in simple 
language how to start making money and continue day after 
day - week after week - year after year! 

  You may work in the comfort of your own home, choose your 
own hours and set your own pace. There is no need to leave 
your present job. The amount of money you earn is up to you. 
There are no quotas set on the amount of envelopes you can 
stuff. You can stuff and mail as many circulars as you are 
able to - taking on whatever amount of business that fits 
your schedule. Furthermore, you may quit the program at any 
time, and start again when you desire. There are no 
obligations whatsoever! 

Earn Great Money From Home! 

  The reason you will receive the high amount of $1.00 per 
envelope is to more than cover your small expenses involved 
in receiving the envelopes, and to also leave you a large 
profit! We want to be sure that you make excellent money so 
that you can enjoy your work and stick with it for many 
years to come. Since you will be helping us by taking part 
in this program, we are only glad to show you an excellent 
way to make great money from the comfort of your home. 
All business can be done by mail, and we will provide you 
with all the necessary information to get you started and 
ensure your success. You can start the same day you receive 
our instructions and circulars, and begin receiving money 
within two weeks - and every week from then on for as long 
as you desire! 

  Since you will be an independent commission mailer - and 
not an employee, you will not be obligated to our company in 
any way! There are no contracts to sign and you will not be 
asked for job references, employment history or experience. 
This is an equal opportunity offer - no one will be 
discriminated against or refused the opportunity to mail our 
circulars. 

Get Started Immediately 

  In order to get you started immediately, we must require a 
one-time fee of only $20.00. This covers our expense in 
showing you what to do, and guarantees your participation 
for as long as you desire. You will not be required or asked 
to pay for any other materials or manuals - there is nothing 
else to buy from us ever. And dont forget - you will have 
completely recovered the cost of your program registration 
fee after you stuff and mail your first 20 circulars - the 
rest is all money in your pocket!

I think that in merely 'reading' and 'recommending' such books, we miss
their true potential.  Postrel's book contains ideas which we are already
familiar, expressed in a form that everyone can relate to.  We should be
*citing* her work in essays and books that we write.  We need to find works
to which we can link our ideas, to show that transhumanist thought functions
as part of an intellectual progression, not just a set of ideas floating
around on the fringes, totally disconnected.  

By crediting other authors for their work on such ideas, and including it in
our own works, we increase our credibility and our profile.  It also helps
us to forge networks with people who would support at least some of our
ideas.  In every topic that we discuss, we should be aware of a set of works
that are good sources of citations and use them.

Sin,

Kathryn Aegis

I just learned that my uncle Mark Howard Riegel has been found dead 
in his bed.

He is at the following address:

  409 North Third
  Lompoc, CA  93436

This is by Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.

He is completely without money, and has not signed up for cryonic 
suspension.

In spite of this, I want him suspended.  Please do everything within 
your power to make sure that his brain, memory, and identity are not 
lost.

Thank you.

Kenneth D. Meyering

Dunno if I *presently* count as a transhumanist kid, but I read "Great Mambo
Chicken and the Transhuman Condition" at a very early age - I think 10 or 11. 
(I even understood it.)  Anyway, that was my first real introduction to the
idea of transformational technology in the here-and-now, rather than only in
the science fiction I had already been reading for three or four years.

Moral of the story:  It all starts with "Space Cadet".

Ken, do you have money to pay for his cryopreservation?
You need to out ice on his head, and contact Alcor (CryoCare does not
take last minute patients).
Try ACS or TransTime.

Ken,
While some of us may find it to be a very sad day at the passing of a
relative, why do you feel that those of  who do not know uncle Mark
would find it necessary to contribute to the supposed continuation of
his brain, memory, or identity?  Also, if  I am not mistaken shouldn't
the cryogenic process be immediately after death, otherwise everything
you want to save is lost anyway.

True.

That would certainly be ideal, but some good arguments have been made
that cryopreservation after several hours may be sufficient.

Not being coerced does not mean having all your desires satisfied. 
For example, suppose that the people exist as uploads. One could then 
have the singleton arrange things in such a way that it would be 
physically impossible for the uploads to harm each other physically 
or to steal each other's property or for one groups of uploads to 
prevent through force other groups of uploads from voluntarily 
entering into special communities.

Randy,
I agree on those several hours, but it seems that with the time that has
elapsed since Ken's posting and the time needed to aquire the appropriate
funding, it just ain't going to happen.  Sorry Ken.

I mean that there are lots of other things that are being intentionally
reproduced, with and without modifications - tools, ideas, behavioral
patterns, artifacts.  Each of us engages in millions of times more of
these than acts of biological reproduction.  Our identity is also more
closely connected to our ideas and skills than gen sets.  When asked who
they are, and what is important about them, people are more likely to name
profession, political affiliation, personal beliefs, etc., and not cite
their gene set.  Same with degree of intentionality.

Sure, military service may take gender into account.
There are also all kinds of things about you that are taken into account.
Like, whether you have a driving licence.   Which doesn't mean that you should
identify primarily with either of these features.

All your recommendations seem reasonable, rational, and eminently pragmatic.
In addition, it seems clear that uploading for any who carry memes of
dysfunctional parenting ought not to occur. --J. R.

Hmmm.... boars, I guess.
Those sows can get awfully mean and aggressive sometimes -- for instance

I echo Randy's why, but remember two things.  1)  Not everyone on this
list is an Objectivist.  Nor is every Extropian or transhumanist an Objectivist.

2)  Being an Objectivist does NOT imply one isn't generous, considerate,
or helpful to others.  I don't want to be immodest, but I usually experience
great pleasure from helping others.

I'm sorry that this is probably going to mushroom into a huge debate on
generosity and the like.:/

On the original issue, How can one go about procuring cryopreservation
in situations like Randy's uncle's?  Has this happened before?  What are
the legal problems to be overcome?

Cheers!

I do have sympathy for the person who is mourning the loss of a relative.
But the question of even trying to preserve someone this late after
deanimation has become moot.  

But there is another question here:  Can you cryopreserve someone without
their prior consent?  Could someone's family make arrangements without the
knowledge of the person involved?  Is it possible that a group of relatives
could put Uncle Sid on ice even if he thought the whole idea was nuts?

It's Ken's uncle, not mine.
First, I supppose ice must be judiciously applied, and a
cryopreservation providere found.

> Has this happened before? 

Many times. I have even had people wanting to cryopreserve bodies
already in the grave, the latest being a lady whose baby had been
buried more than a month (of course CryoCare doesn't take these sorts
of cases, and I don't think any cryo org would). But as for people who
have just been pronounced dead, there are, I would imagine, several
patients in dewars who were frozen under similar circumstances.

den,

If you persist in this completely insane, and frankly offensive diatribe of an excuse you call a philosophy, you can expect this to be my first and last response to your posts.  Frankly, I'm just as surprised the more libertarian list members haven't eaten you for breakfast yet!

den Otter wrote:

  Well, it is true that many of society's problems are caused by parents abusing their kids. In fact, afaik, child abuse is a much bigger problem than all other crimes combined. Of course it doesn't explain *all* criminal activity, as some criminals are simply "born evil" and some crimes are fairly rational or due to circumstance. Nevertheless, solving the problem of child abuse should be high on every government's agenda (for various practical and "moral" reasons).

My response (flame):

I first take offense at your use of the word "evil" which is got to be one of the most loaded and overused words of any 'religious' system.  Your use of it smacks 
of a pre-ordained sense of moral righteousness and religious upbringing.  I don't care if your an atheist or not - it has become obvious that you have all of the 
markings of a religious zealot of the highest order - which I think the rest of your post will bear out. Your persistence in resorting to massive centralized government to handle all of our 'trickier' problems is the most offensive of all - I don't care if you *do* call yourself a libertarian.  It has also become obvious that you are a socialist of the highest order - and thus the rest of your viewpoints have become highly suspect.  Lest you forget - this is an *Extropian* mailing list - one that seeks spontaneous ordered solutions over centralized governmental ones. Perhaps you would feel more comfortable on the 'Transhumanist' List, which has a great deal more patience with this sort of poppycock ---->

den Otter wrote:

  How to deal with it?

  a) Compulsory psychological screening and parenting tests for everyone who wants children (let them care for a very annoying "automatic" baby that has, em, full bodily functions etc. for about a month. That should put off most unprepared parents).

  b) No children if you can't support them financially (abuse is especially rampant in poor families. Everyone's frustrated (nothing gets people more on edge than financial problems, as I know from personal experience), the parents are often drunks, the father beats the kids and his wife because he's a dumb, frustrated asshole etc. You know the picture...)
  Ironically, those that can least afford it often have the most children.

  c) A special police service for abuse victims: if you're being abused at home (or any other place for that matter), the police will install a domestic surveillance system without the abuser's knowledge and monitor the situation. Evidence gathered in this way will be used in court. Incidentally, the monitoring service can also be installed if others (such as doctors, friends of the alleged victim, school officials) point out a household as potentially abusive).

  d) Tough punishments for abusers (jail time and corporal punishment). After jail (or in the case of minor abuse after a stern warning/fine) permanent installment of cameras in the offender's house, as a preventive measure and to serve as evidence should abuse reoccur. The victim gets a personal alarm, which summons the police (after checking via integral phone and the cam system). In a libertarian scenario, this would be a PPA (but, how does a kid pay a PPA?
  Uh-huh!)

  e) In more severe cases the victim would be placed in a special caring center (with varying degrees of independence according to age, but generally speaking a lot of freedom, according to the golden rule). Separate living quarters for everyone, of course full surveillance (appartment surveillance is optional, not compulsory) to prevent any abuse or other irregularities by staff (strict selection, few or no men) or other occupants. The general feel should be that of a vacation resort or a hotel, *not* a (pedophile & fascist-ridden ) prison. Education is, of course, "transhuman style", with a lot of emphasis on rational thinking, personal empowerment etc. Multiple  generations of rational, law-abiding and progressive individuals would likely be the pleasant (side-) effect of the anti-abuse program.

  f) Of course, the abusers (should they ever get out of jail) would be slapped with a perpetual restraining order, to be enforced by an electronic ankle bracelet (or something more sophisticated). The former victim gets a receiver that goes off whenever the abuser gets within the "forbidden" (1 mile for ex.) radius. Of course the police also get a beep. Should the abuser somehow manage to do harm to the victim anyway (or abuse someone else), he goes to jail (labor camp) for life (or at least a *long* time). Should he kill his victim, he is to be executed in a most unpleasant way.

  g) It goes without saying that known abusers are *never ever* allowed to have kids (again).

My final response:

I guess you won't be having children then den!  What a relief!  I'd call what I just read above to be abuse of the highest order.  Bring on the rack and whips!

You don't need to consent to CPR. It is assumed you want life.  . i.e. the
presumption is life... you must make your wishes know before you die in
opposition to life saving measures.

Ah, so! ...*things* being reproduced. That clears it up. Thank you much.
I see what you mean. Yes, people do that, except for radio talk jock Laura
Schlessinger, who identifies herself with the lamentalble reminder: "I am my
children's mom." (I wonder if her kids cringe when they hear her say that...
especially since nude pictures of her have appeared on the Net.)

Well, military service does more than take it into account. They take you to
prison if you resist the draft. (No wonder we have more female impersonators
than male impersonators.) As to driving: Insurance companies also classify
us according to gender, charging men higher rates than women. Personally,
I'd like to identify myself as (and manifest the features of) a highly
attractive lesbian. It seems to me that particular biological set really has
it made. --JRM

In the book, The Encyclopedia of Nutritional Supplements (1996, Prima
Publishing) by Michael Murray, N.D. (a book I strongly recommend for its
thoroughness and many references), here's some of what he says for niacin.

Beneficial Effects
    Niacin supplementation exerts a favorable effect on several health
conditions, especially high cholesterol levels.

Available Forms
    Vitamin B3 is available in nutritional supplements as either niacin
(nicotinic acid or nicotinate) or niacinamide (nicotinamide).  Each form has
different applications.  In its nicotinic form, vitamin B3 is an effective
reducer of blood cholesterol levels.  While in its niacinamide form, it is
useful in arthritis and early-onset type I diabetes.
    Doses in excess of 50 mg of niacin, but not niacinamide, typically produce
a transient flushing of the skin.  To get around the problem of skin flushing,
drug and supplement manufacturers have developed "timed-released" products.
However, while these preparations may effectively eliminate the problem of
skin flushing, they are associated with greater liver destruction and serious
side effects (discussed below under Safety Issues).  A better way to eliminate
the problem of skin flushing is to use inositol hexaniacinate (also known as
inositol hexanicotinate and, for short, hexaniacin).  This form of niacin has
been used in Europe for over 30 years with an excellent safey record.

Principal Uses
    The principal uses of niacin and inositol hexaniacinate are in the
treatment of elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels, Raynaud's
phenomenon, and intermittant claudication.  Niacinamide is used in
recent-onset type I diabetes mellitus and arthritis.

Comparative Studies
    The lipid-lowering activity of niacin was first described in the 1950s.
We now know niacin does much more than lower total cholesterol.  Specifically,
niacin lowers LDL cholesterol, Lp(a) lipoprotein, triglyceride, and fibrinogen
levels, while simultaneously raising HDL cholesterol levels (ref 1).
    The famed Coronary Drug Project demonstrated that niacin was the only
lipid-lowering agent to actually reduce overall mortalilty (ref 2).  Its
effects are long-lasting as demonstrated in a 15 year follow-up study to the
Coronary Drug Project.

Inositol Hexaniacinate
    Inositol hexaniacinate is a special form of niacin composed of six
nicotinic acid molecules bound to and surrounding one molecule of inositol, an
unofficial member of the B vitamin group.  Inositol hexaniacinate exerts the
benefits of niacin without flushing or other side effects.  It has been used
in Europe for over 30 years not only to lower cholesterol, but also to improve
blood flow in the treatment of claudication.  Although inositol hexaniacinate
yelds slightly better results than standard niacin, the big advantage is that
it is safer and much better tolerated (ref 12 & 13).

Dosage Ranges
    You should not use sustained-release niacin.  If you use pure crystalline
niacin, start with a dose of 100 mg three times a day and carefully increase
the dosage over a period of 4 to 6 weeks to the full therapeutic dose of 1.5
grams to 3 grams daily in divided dosage.  If you are using inositol
hexaniacinate, begin with 500 mg 3 times daily for 2 weeks and then increase
to 1000 mg.  It is best to take either crystalline niacin or inositol
hexaniacinate with meals.

Safety Issues
    The side effects of niacin are well known.  The most common and bothersome
side effect is the skin flushing that typically occurs 20 to 30 minutes after
taking the niacin.  Other occasional side effects of niacin include gastric
irritation, nausea, and liver damage.  In an attempt to combat the acute
reaction of skin flushing, several manufacturers began marketing
"sustained-release","timed-released", or "slow-released" niacin products.
Although these forms of niacin reduce skin flushing, they are actually more
toxic to the liver.  A recent study published in the Journal of the American
Medical Association (JAMA) strongly recommended that sustained-released niacin
be restricted from use because of the high percentage (78 percent) of patient
withdrawal because of side effects; 52 percent of the patients taking the
sustained-release niacin developed liver damage, while none of the patients
taking immediate-release niacin developed liver damage (ref 42).
    Again, inositol hexaniacinate is the safest form of niacin currently
available.  Both short- and long-term studies show it is virtually free of
side effects other than an occasional person experiencing mild gastric upset
or mild skin irritation.
    Because niacin can impair glucose tolerance, it should probably not be
used in diabetics unless they are under close observation.  Niacin should not
be used in patients with pre-existing liver disease or elevation in liver
enzymes, gout, or peptic ulcers.
    Regardless of the form on niacin being used, periodic checking (minimum
every 3 months ) of cholesterol and liver function tests are indicated when
high-dose (i.e., 2 to 6 grams per day) niacin, inositol hexaniacinate, or
niacinamide therapy is being used.

Doesn't extropy also seek spontaneous ordered solutions over fascistic and
child abusive parental ones? Can't extropians support a spontaneous ordered
solution to violent crime which involves curtailing the abusiveness of
parents who spawn violent criminals? Even though somewhat complex, a policy
to end violent crime (which would thereby preclude the need for the death
penalty) via ending the cause of violent crime, namely unfit parents, seems
notably extropian to me.

staff (strict selection, few or no men) or other occupants. The general feel
should be that of a vacation resort or a hotel, *not* a (pedophile &

The man with the highest IQ ever may have been a fellow by name of
William James Sidis (1898-1944). He could read The New York Times when
he was 18 months old and just a few yeas later solve its crossword
puzzle in his head, he didn't write anything down until he'd finished
all of it. Just for fun when he was seven he developed a set of
logarithms in base 12. At eight he was given the final exam in anatomy
from the Harvard Medical school, he passed. At the same age he was
given the entrance test for MIT, he passed. At age nine he knew dozens
of languages and could pick up a new one in a day or two.

Sidis's IQ can only be approximately known even though he took many IQ
tests, the tests were just not up to the task, he was off the charts.
Abraham Sterling, director of New York City's Aptitude Testing
Institute said " he easily had an IQ between 250 and 300, I have never
heard of anybody with such an IQ. I would say that he was the most
prodigious intellect of our entire generation".

So what did this prodigious intellect accomplish in his 46 years? Not
much, if he's remembered at all it's for writing the definitive book on
streetcar transfers, perhaps the most boring tome on the planet. I'm
not sure what the moral is, maybe it's not to push gifted children too
hard as Sidis's parents did, or maybe it's that high IQ and genius are
not quite synonymous.

 That's an interesting definition of punishment, what dictionary did you
get that one from.  Revenge " to inflicted (harm) punishment by way of
repayment. "

    The differences between punishment and revenge, is punishment is the
formal version, or revenge. Revenge is is somthing the mob boss does.
Punishment is somthing the goverment or a parant does.

I should think yes. After all, legally there should be no differece
between cryopreservation and cremation (?) I think the relatives could
overrule even if this aspect was covered in the will, if it was not
challenged by some family member, that is.

Cryonics Institute (http://www.cryonics.org) might be a better idea
in this case. It's much cheaper and (probably) the most likely to accept
such a case (though I wouldn't count on it). Also, I've heard that ACS
(http://www.jps.net/cryonics/) stores brains for about $ 15,000. Otherwise, 
you may attempt dry ice storage for example, or buying an ultra-low 
temperature freezer or even a LN2 storage set (one container for storing 
the LN2 and one for the patient, connected by a transfer system. 
Sometimes such sets can be leased from LN2 suppliers).

Jada, jada. If you have some kind of religious hangup with the word "evil",
than that's too bad for you. Most other people will agree that someone
who kills/rapes/otherwise harms innocent victims for his own pleasure
is "evil". If such a person comes from a loving family, never had any 
(serious) traumatic experience etc. than the logical conclusion is he 
was "born evil". Do you have any better ideas?

>>Your persistence in resorting to massive centralized government to handle all of
our 'trickier' problems is the most offensive of all - I don't care if you *do* call
yourself a libertarian.<<  

I *don't* call myself a libertarian, though I do support various 
"libertarian" ideas such as maximal freedom for the individual and
the free market. However, I certainly *don't* share the rather naive view
that "the invisible hand" of the market will make everything all right
if you just let it (by removing or heavily limiting the government).
"The invisible hand" don't care Jack Shit about such things as child
abuse. Although I like the *idea* of libertarianism, I don't blindly
and dogmatically belief that a functioning "stateless" society
could ever be achieved for any significant lenght of time. Why?
Simply put: because Joe Sixpack ain't no libertarian. Throughout
history people have shown that they are prone to form societies
that severely curb personal freedom. All the bureaucrats, dictators
and other oppressors of the world *can only exist thanks to the
fear, ignorance and conformism of the people*. 

>>It has also become obvious that you are a socialist of the highest 
order<<

Bullshit. I may have some ideas which traditionally are associated with
socialism, but they are just a part of a much broader philosophy which
cuts trough all existing political orientations (because all have some
good points, and all have some bad points, so you pick and choose
instead of blindly giving your soul to one of them). I don't know on how
many posts you base your conclusion, but obviously you've missed
the big picture.

 >>- and thus the rest of your viewpoints have become highly suspect.  Lest you
forget - this is an *Extropian* mailing list - one that seeks spontaneous ordered
solutions over centralized governmental ones.<<

Assuming that these are better. Otherwise it would be another pointless
dogma. What counts is making life as good as possible for as long as
possible. Everything, including centralized government, is a neutral
tool which may or may not be used to achieve this goal, according to
the specific circumstances. 

Of course, now that you mention it, what *is* the "spontaneous" Extropian/
Libertarian solution to child abuse? Oh right, you've stated that you won't
"grant me any responses". How convenient. 

>>Perhaps you would feel more comfortable on the 'Transhumanist' List, which has a
great deal more patience with this sort of poppycock ----><<

Been there, done that. By the way, on that "socialist" (as you would
say) list they probably see me as "right wing/conservative" or something.
LOL.

> I guess you won't be having children then den!  

Why, that's right Michael! And I hope the same goes for you...The
earth is already overpopulated enough as it is. 

>>P.S. Don't bother whining, this will be the last response I'll grant you the

Of course.

Er, I'd take exception to that assertion. Do you have any figures to back
it up?

Right now, here in the UK, we're in the middle of a witch hunt directed
against paedophiles. It's not very pretty, and statements like the one above
are fairly typical of the alarmism used to whip up hysteria about the issue.

That's not to say that child abuse _isn't_ a very serious issue, where and
when it occurs, but overreacting this way is just opening the door on a 
rather nasty kind of police state.

(Fine, so people who want children are screened by some sort of agency
that gives bureaucrats power over their personal life. "Want to have
children? Great! If you can't satisfy me that you're sane, sensible, and
will bring them up appropriately, you can't have a license. By the way,
do you intend to bring them up as good, honest, god- fearing Christians?")

 
> b) No children if you can't support them financially 
 
(Okay, so we can easily stop social undesirables having children. "Officer,
I have reason to believe that so-and-so are libertarian subversives. Worse,
they're going to breed. Can you stop them please?" "Why sure, lemme just
drop this lil'ole water pipe in their back yard then go knock on the
door. Oh dear, they seem to have some dope parephenalia! I guess we'll
just have to confiscate their home, so then they won't have the assets to
support their children. How's that for a solution?")

Great. So not only am I not secure in my property and person from being
raided by the cops, but they can install cameras in my bedroom because they
suspect I'm abusing children? On the say-so of a kid whose word would not,
on its own, be taken as evidence that can stand up in court? Paging Winston
Smith ..!

> d) Tough punishments for abusers (jail time and corporal punishment).
 
I'd rather see the problem prevented before it occurs, or a fix applied
such that it is less likely to recur. Can you show me any studies
suggesting that flogging and hard labour reduce recidivism in paedophiles
more efficiently than psychiatric counseling and probation?

Here in the UK, the gummint passed a law a year or so ago to the effect
that all sex offenders must be registered with the local cop shop whenever
they move house. This law was passed to protect children from predators.
Unfortunately, it was a bit broadly worded. Until about two years ago, it
was illegal for men aged under 21 to have sex together, even in private;
a large proportion of the registered sex offenders are basically young
gay males.

The vigilante mobs who try to run 'paedophiles' out of their homes under
threat of lynch law don't seem to be able to tell the difference, though.

All I see here is a call for postively fascist levels of policing, without
a coherent goal in mind, articulated as a knee-jerk response to a problem
of questionable severity, and likely to result in the most astonishing
abuse of fundamental human rights. 

Is it a witch hunt? Well, yes. Replace the terms "abuser" and "paedophile"
with "communist" if you don't believe me ...

Hardly. With a database of every citizens DNA, the authorities can convict
anyone they want of any crime they want now. Sequence up some of your DNA
and sprinkle it around a crime scene. With computer technologies they can
fabricate whatever photographic or video evidence they wish. between the
two there is no jury that would not convict you. With secret warrants and
subpoeneas allowed habeus corpus no longer exits. With the good ol' UN
Rights Commision declaring that humans have no right to defend themselves,
there goes the second amendment in the rest of the NWO. With parallel
criminal and civil convictions and property seizures, double jeopardy and
bans against cruel and unusual punishment are banished. With no penalty
for police shooting innocent people there goes accountability ot the
public. How much more do we need?

This brings up the whole issue of "garage" cryonics -- i.e., do-it-yourself

None. I seldom use dictionaries, I only use them when I run across a word
I've never seen before and sometimes not even then, I get the meaning in
the exact same way the writer of the dictionary did, from useage. Besides,
when somebody askes for a defination I asume they don't want one from
a dictionary, you don't need to ask on the Extropian List to fet that information.

I wrote about this subject back in March.
==========================================

I'd like to talk about what would be done with violent criminals
in a libertarian world of Anarchy. I can think of 4 reasons we
even bother to  punish bad people at all.

        1 The fun of seeing somebody we don't like suffer.

Personally I don't think this is a worthy reason although it is
a powerful one particularly in the reptilian parts of our brain.
Like everybody else a part of me is sadistic, but that's not a
part of my personality I'm proud of and certainly not something
that I could defend intellectually. Inflicting pain on someone
just so you can see him suffer is pointless, cruel and only
brings on calls for revenge.

        2. Rehabilitation.

This would be wonderful if we knew how to do it but we don't. In
the real world we take a person who grew up in a bad environment
and lock him in a horrible prison environment and expect him to reform.
The only thing on our side is time, for some reason older people
tend to be less violent than younger ones.

        3 Restitution.

For practical reasons this is a minor point, crooks are not
usually great  moneymakers.

        4 Protection of the public.

This, by far ,is the most important point, to prevent similar
crimes from happening in the future. Everything else is secondary,
its the reason we try to catch bad guys. I think it's the difference
between justice and vengeance.

It's clear that some people are just too dangerous to freely
walk the  streets and must be dealt with somehow. I think
private prisons and giving prisoners the choice of prisons could
work but it seems to me that the victim should not be forced to
pay the cost of his tormentors imprisonment, the criminal
should pay for it any way he can. Admittedly there are aspects
of this idea that sound a little ugly, almost like slavery, but
the only alternative is worse. If the prisoner is not to starve
and is not required to pay his own way that means somebody else,
a non  criminal, would be required to pay and become a "slave",
and pay the cost. If we must have "slaves" I prefer they be
criminals. Most libertarians feel they have little obligation to
pay their neighbors bills, even if they're nice people in deep
trouble, if so then we have even less obligation to pay a
murderers bills.

I do see some problems to work out when the criminal is at
either end of the economic spectrum. A very poor criminal would
have to chose a low cost prison but he might not be able to pay
even that. The prison would try to make a profit by putting its
clients to work, but I'm not sure this would be successful. It's
hard to be profitable if your employees are uneducated, stupid,
dishonest and lazy. Unconventional sources of revenue may be
needed if the crook is to pay his own way , human experimentation.

Pharmaceutical companies could hire private rating agencies to
judge proposed Human experiments much as Standard and Poor rates
bonds. The pain \ danger  index would range from slightly
uncomfortable \ probably harmless  to  agony \ probably fatal .
A market would develop open to anybody who was interested, not
just prisoners. It would be in the financial interest of the
drug companies to make the tests as safe and comfortable as
possible. A market could also develop for organ transplants. All
parties would benefit, medical research would get a huge boost
and everybody would have a new way to make money if they chose
to do it. Prisoners who have no money and don't want to sell a
kidney or be a guinea pig would have an incentive to work hard
in the more conventional prison work.

Extremely rich criminals could also be a problem. Ross Perot
shots me in the head and is sentenced to 25 years in prison. He
decides to go to a super luxury private jail in Tahiti with Polo
Ponies, yacht racing, 4 star restaurants and full communication
equipment so he can tend to his business. The prison charges
$2,000,000 a year but that's pocket change for Ross. If he gets
tired of this prison he can start his own elsewhere. All this
doesn't sound like much of a deterrent.

If the prisoners assets could only be used for bare necessities,
victim  compensation and prosecution costs and if every PPL
agrees to this then  there is no problem, everything would be
nice and stable, but I think that is highly unlikely. In the
real world Ross Perot or any other rich man wouldn't join a PPL
that had a law like that in a million years. Don't misunderstand
me, I'm not saying this is a fatal flaw in Anarchy or any such
nonsense but it is an unsolved problem, at least unsolved by me.

I don't know how serious this homicidal billionaire problem is
or how to solve it except to say that in my PPL nobody would be
imprisoned for more than 8 to 10 years. If the crime was more
serious than that they would be executed. Probably the PPL's will
work out a compromise of some sort that is flawed but does have the
virtue of being stable in the real world full of real people.

By the way, I have no problem with capital  punishment (if it is painless)
but I do think it's a shame to fry perfectly  good organs with electricity
or poison them with cyanide. Waste not want not.

For what it's worth I'm 50 and have had this problem all my life, at least
until I stumbled onto this list.
It was a major revolution to me that there was an organized(?) group out

I do.

I live in the UK. The UK abolished the death penalty about thirty years ago,
replacing it with mandatory life imprisonment (with sentences served averaging
over twenty years and some prisoners banged up for the rest of their life).

Over the past thirty years, something like 10-15% of all life sentences for
murder have been overturned as unsafe and unsound. Under the previous regime
these people would have been hanged.

However, the recidivism rate for murderers released on license from a life
sentence is vanishingly small -- less than 0.2%.

If the UK had retained hanging, something like 50-100 innocent people
would have been executed over the past 30 years, as compared to a much
smaller number of innocent people being murdered by recidivists released
on license. Conclusion: capital punishment kills more innocent people than
it saves, if your main criterion for penal efficacy is prevention. (We
can discount the deterrent argument -- studies as long ago as the 1860's
proved that it wasn't a factor in the British penal system.)

Of course, if you have a penal system that releases murderers imprisoned
for life on parole after six or seven years, you will get different figures
out of the other end. But a properly enforced life sentence seems to work
as a preventative without causing irreversible miscarriages of justice.

(If/when Alcor and friends can demonstrate the ability to revive
people who've been frozen, I will change my opinion on the death penalty;
but until someone comes up with a reversible implementation, I will object
on the fundamental basis that the administration of justice is not perfect
and it is in utilitarian terms better not to use the death penalty. I have
lesser objections -- based on the point that the death penalty is exercised
by the state, and I don't think the state should have the power of life or
death over its citizens, but that's an opinion, rather than an objection
based on hard numbers.)

Yes, a famous case.  But you'll note that Sidis didn't exhibit any
intelligence other than that of a modern computer:  Eidetic memory plus
lightning calculator, the stereotypical characteristics that small children
ask alleged geniuses to exhibit.  The moral, maybe, is that if you're dumb
enough to be taken in by stereotypes and you push your child hard enough, he
or she will turn into a computer at the price of real cognitive functions.

I always prefer an effective deterrent rather than having to go through the

Hardly. Putting a profit motive before the state would cause the state to seek to
expand the penalty to more and more crimes. Even, and especially, in a popular
democracy, with an aging population, there will be public pressure to expand the
penalty to more and more crimes. Larry Niven discussed this in many of his Known
Space stories.

Dipping into the bottomless well of knowledge on this list....

Does anyone have strong preferences or opinions about online stockbrokers?
I've gotten far enough ahead to open a brokerage account again, but have
never dealt with the online variety.  I'm more the buy and hold type, so
absolute rock bottom commission structure is not necessary, if it is
outweighed by other considerations.

Probably, when he was 18 months old he should be playing with toys instead
of reading the New York Times. And when he was 8 years old he should be
playing soccer instead of solving anatomy tests. That kind of education can
screw one's mind.

Unfortunately it is the opposite here.  less than 1% of the population here causes
90% of all crime.  Prison officials that tout the new 'boot camp' style rehab
facilites are happy if their recidivism rate is ONLY 30%. Normal recidivism ranges
between 60-90% for all violent crimes. I'm increasingly of the opinion that the
two main reasons crime in the US is so high because we have historically gotten
the refuse, the square pegs and criminal leavings from other countries, and with
our large amount of multicultural intermixing we are seeing the result of a hybrid
vigor effect. We have huge technological and intellectual development despite a
poor quality education system, as well as a large amount of sociopathic and
psychopathic recidivism.

True. A 65 year old man released after a real life sentence is much less likely to
commit violent crimes than a 25 year old released after 3-7 years. However, are we
willing to pay the cost?

COnsidering that keeping a man in prison costs an average of $60,000 a year, we
could save a lot of money by filtering out the personalities least likely to
recommit and give them a government job and live under house arrest.

I've always liked Heinlein's  Coventry concept, of having a very large area fenced
off, allowing the criminals put there permanently to build their own society,
which can be traded with, but nobody is allowed to leave. I will say that many
people who live in the rural areas here look at big cities as already fulfilling
that function, since the government makes it difficult for the criminal classes to
move to other jurisdictions. Note that if crime in rural America were only
counted, it would be lower than any other industrial nation. Since the majority of
manufacturing in the US now occurs in suburban and rural areas, this is more
accurate, to count the urban vs non-urban crime rates.  I don't know how many
times people have commented to me after a trip to an urban center about the
similarities to cities in a 3rd world nation....

Following the recent discussions on the list I have been wondering about
media and the influence it has on us.

Therefore I thought about what media influences that I could remember has
had an influence on my life.
- The first thing I remember is Gerald O'Neils "Spacestations" (Directly
translated from danish but you should know which one I mean).
- The second was an article in Analog with an introductionary article about
Nanotech. Naturally I was pretty amused that Drexler also had appeared In
"spacestations" as O'neils helper.
- A third thing was Wired magazine, with a lot of positive and futuristic
articles.

Funny enough I cannot remember a single tv-show that has had any kind of
lasting impact on me. Can any of you?

Maybe tv isn't a good media for spreading futuristic positive memes at all,
or is that simply because I havn't seen the right shows?

I do believe that it is a partly the tv-medias fault, as it isn't
particularly fit to deep and thorough concepts.

Probably we should concentrate about spreading our memes in other media like
magazines, books and off course the Internet.

The idea of Black Holes was around long before 1925.  Pierre Laplace talked about
them in 1799, but he wasn't the first either. On November 27 1783 John Michell
gave a talk to the Royal Society of London about something he called "Dark Stars".
Chandrasekhar's acomplishment was in being the first to find a solution of
Einstein's field equations that actually described such an object.

Absolutely.  China has been engaged in for-profit organ harvesting of executed
prisoners for at least the past 20 years.  Not only are these prisoners executed in
public stadiums, but their organs are harvested immediately afterwards and sold to
the highest bidder.  The Chinese government, inept in obtaining money by any
legitimate economic means, resorts to the most arbitrary definition of what a
"criminal" is, that it can essentially arrest anyone at anytime for any reason.
Motivate arbitrary arrest with a profit motive, and you have one of the most cruel
and tyrannical governments on the planet.

Perhaps that is why, when I see rhetoric on this list discussing mechanisms moving in
the same direction (no matter how well intended), I see China as the end result.
There is a reason we have the Bill of Rights, because humans are fallible, and large
numbers of them without checks and balances can be downright dangerous.

Gee, if Palmolive allows you to soften hands while doing your dishes, why
can't nanotech? I'm sure that there could be a safety circuit which can
test for living flesh vs. dead skin cells. This safety circuit should
probably be mandatory anyways.

Yes, that's all true. But...they can do this anyway. Nowadays, if the 
government really wants you dead/in jail, they don't even have to take 
the trouble to drop your DNA on the scene or mess with videotape;
they just "discover" some dope on your property and than it's your
word against that of the cops. Or they just arrange an "accident".
No high tech needed there either.

Now, enter the surveillance system. All data is stored at separate
places (multiple redundancy) and for cross-referencing. When trying
to fake evidence, one would have to break into *all* the encrypted
databases (in underground vaults) and change *all* the relevant data
(the nasty thing is that seemingly unrelated data can nonetheless
serve to check the validity of primary data). This is a very tough job
to do right, and in my scenario various civil rights (non-government)
organizations and government agancies would have joint control
over the databases, breathing down eachothers neck all the time,
checking for every possible irregularity. Imagine cops with cams
integrated into their uniforms, their cars, their guns etc., 
monitored by the people and government alike. I bet the level of
authority abuse would drop drastically.

I've always thought that it should be as difficult, if not more so, to have children
than to get a drivers license. I don't think though that people should be
disqualified, per se, but that make the training required sufficient enough that the
dead brainers will not even try, due to the intellectual intimidation factor. Of
course, if you eliminate socialized health coverage for prenatal care and
childbirth, this would also contribute a goodly amount of deterrence.....

Yes, however, do you lose your kids if you lose your job? How about, like a credit
report for a load application, the prospective parents must have x amount of time of
good credit and sufficient earning power to expand the number of offspring. If you
screw up afterward, then thats on your reproductive credit report. Oh, the
opportunities to be a tyrant are endless....

How about this: At birth everyone gets a chip installed which monitors the person's
stress levels. If they ever are in a situation which might be uncomfortable in the

camps....

A kids PPA services would be provided by the parents policy. A PPA could mandate
such coverage, and be the agency imposing huge premiums for those that reproduce

Oh, lovely. We now have a benevolent world state like David Brin describes in his
Uplift Wars novels, where people judged unfit due to behavior, performance or
geneticfactors are classified as PP's (probationary personalities). I think by now
most here know that Brin is little more than a statist wolf in libertarian sheeps
clothing....as much as I like his writing, he's really little more than a wannabe
Hitler.

I completely disagree here.  There was a prominent study done at the Maryland State
Penitentiary in 1961, where 80 hardened criminals of all stripes were put through a
series of LSD sessions.  Since this study was conducted by Timothy Leary & Company,
the most sensitive measures were taken to assure the criminals were given the best
'set' and 'setting' possible.  Although many of the criminals were initially suspect,
Tim Leary was very patient in establishing a trusting bond before any LSD sessions
took place.

After six weeks, the overwhelming number of prisoners became distinctly aware that
their are many alternative 'realities' to that of crime and struggle.  As of 1977, 67
of the initial 80 had been released, with only 2 ever going back to prison.  Lets see,
2 out of 67 gives us ~3% recidivism.  I'd say that was a pretty darn good success rate
for only *one* study!

The fact that today, prisons are:

1) Overpopulated with non-violent drug users.
2) Admittedly designed by prison architects to disorient criminals.
3) And run as a means to punish, rather than rehabilitate.

I'd say the prisons have absolutely no desire to rehabilitate anyone; and in fact are
the chief *cause* of crime, not a deterrent.  If we spent half the money on education,
we do now on prisons, this supposed "high crime" rate we see today would be seen as
the joke that it really is.

Speaking of brainwashing TV propaganda, the latest TV statistics show that the number
of stories covering violent crimes has increased five fold since 1990, while the
actual violent crime rate, according to the FBI, has dropped. Doesn't that make you
wonder?  I'd say the prison construction lobby has a vested interest in seeing more
people being locked up behind bars, and longer sentences being applied to more people.

Wow. Perhaps in vivo gene therapy actually will work in my lifetime. Double

I am not sure I am reading this right, but does the technology in principle
allow you to repair any (and all) mutations in an organism?

Thoughts?

=======================================================
From: http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_224000/224723.stm


AMERICAN RESEARCHERS HAVE TURNED ALBINO MICE CELLS BLACK.

A team from the Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, used what they
describe as a "gene repair" technique to genetically change white albino
mice colour-producing cells to black.

Not only did the cells turn black, but the scientists showed for the
first time that such changes are both permanent and can be passed to
offspring.

They hope the work can be developed into a new form of gene therapy - a
type of treatment that can correct the genetic mutations that give rise
to some hereditary diseases.

POINT MUTATION

The mutation in albino mice - which gives them their white fur and pink
eyes - is caused by a mutation in the tyrosinase gene.

The mutation inactivates an enzyme that is supposed to make melanin,
which gives skin and fur its colour.

By correcting this single alteration in the gene, known as a 'point
mutation,' tyrosinase activity was restored and melanin was again
produced, changing the colour of the mice cells.

"Melanin-producing cells become normal, changing albino to black," says
Dr Kyonggeun Yoon, associate professor of dermatology and cutaneous
biology and biochemistry and molecular pharmacology at the Jefferson
Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia.

"Once the mutation is corrected, it takes five or six days for the
entire biochemical process to begin producing melanin."


GENE REPAIR

The gene-repair technique was actually developed by Dr Yoon and a
colleague, Dr Eric Kmiec, several years ago.

It requires the synthesis of a strand of DNA interspersed with its
chemical cousin RNA. This small locates and grabs hold of the part of
the gene that has the fault and then stimulates the cell's own repair
mechanism.

It scans the DNA looking for any mismatches or two strands of DNA that
do not seem in sync.

When it finds a mismatch, it replaces one of the chemical bases - the
letters in the genetic code - with one that fits better.

Dr Yoon says the gene-repair technique is far from perfected.

"Much more research is needed to improve the design and make this
technology generally applicable. Skin is an ideal organ on which to test
this technology since it is accessible and can be monitored."

Dr Eric Kmiec comments on the research: "To my knowledge this is the
first demonstration of trait reversal in any mammalian system."

The research is published in Nature Biotechnology on 30 November.

http://www.thundernet.org/abuse3.html
"In 1996 more than 3 million child abuse reports were made [3.1 million].
The actual incidence of abuse and neglect is estimated to be 3         
times greater the number reported to authorities."
See also: http://www.gcca.org/stat/index.html

So we're looking at a number of ~9 million possible abuse cases.
Ok, so it's not bigger than all crimes combined (total US crime
index offences in '95 was 13.9 million, according to the FBI, see
also http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucr95prs.htm), but it certainly is a *big* 
problem (note: the 13.9 figure includes victimless crime as well, of 
course). Also, there are strong indications that childhood abuse can 
lead to criminal behaviour later in life, so a (significant?) part of the 
total statistics could be seen as a direct result of childhood abuse.

[from: http://www.gcca.org/prevention/index.html]
"The complex problem of child abuse has many consequences. Studies have shown that
children who are at risk of abuse today often become the school dropouts, crime
perpetrators, and abusive parents of tomorrow. Everyone is affected by the lives of
these children who come from homes in which there is emotional, physical,
educational, or material deprivation. National statistics show that 90% of convicted
felons have experienced some form of abuse during their childhood. We all pay for
the increased law enforcement, medical treatment, remedial education, foster care,
and public assistance needed by individuals who grow up in abusive, neglectful
homes."

Pedophiles are a relatively minor issue compared to non-sexual forms
of abuse (physical and psychological). Of course hysteria is bad, but
doing too little about the problem is even worse (more victims). Ideally,
the new measures would be implemented discretely, not with the usual
political pomp. This should avoid or at least reduce public hysteria.

Let's put it this way: in the hands of a more or less "democratic" regime
(as we have in the Western world) better surveillance and stricter
sentencing (based on surveillance evidence) pose no real threat. In
fact, as it makes it more difficult to hide the truth it actually empowers
the citizens. A system of checks and balances, of surveillance upon
surveillance etc. would make abuse by politicians very difficult indeed.
If the police are forced to wear cameras that beam their data directly
to a publically accessible database (for legal purposes only, btw), than
their power is greatly reduced. They become "servants of the people",
as they should be. Same for politicians. Make a system of civil rights
organizations and government agencies that all keep an eye on eachother.
Divide and conquer. No-one should be immune to surveillance checks,
and it goes without saying that those in power will be checked most
often.

In recent years, the number of (police operated) surveillance cams 
in the UK has risen dramatically. Now, can you honestly say that
this has brought the country to the brink of dictatorship? Right. IMO,
the "camphobia" (and DNA/fingerprint phobia etc.) is not based on any
hard facts whatsoever. If so, please present them now.

Gee, for some reason I don't think too many of those exist. Of course
prevention is important (in a previous post I've stated that everyone
should be able to receive free (or at least affordable) treatment if they
have a (potentially violent/otherwise undesirable) mental disorder.
However, once someone has actually commited a crime I prefer (yes,
that's a personal choice) real punishments to "pampering" the criminal
while the victim is either dead or has a trauma for life. That just isn't
fair, IMHO. Also, the preventive (deterrent to others) function of the "soft
treatment" is no doubt even lower than that of real punishment. 
Oh, and once again: pedophiles are not the biggest problem (though
a serious one nonetheless). The measures are directed at *all*
forms of child abuse (not just of the sexual kind). See also:

Yes, but it *has* been abolished, hasn't it? Besides, this anomaly
doesn't degrade the value of electronic monitoring in any way. The

And obviously this should be stopped too. However, these things
mostly occur because the justice system is doing a bloody awful
job. That is relatively easy to fix.

The coherent goal: an optimal society. Freedom, justice and wealth
for all. That's the idea behind all my proposed reforms. Most will never
be implemented, but hey, it's fun to think about.

A "most astonishing abuse of human rights" is going on in our
own (proverbial) back yard this very minute (in fact, 6 times a
minute according to the US stats). That is real. Your "police state"
dystopia is just an assumption, probably influenced by works
of *fiction* such as "1984". In any case, this is probably a moot
point as the surveillance society is now only a matter of time.
Regrettably many of the additions that make a good system
great, probably won't be implemented, but I do expect an overall
improvement in crime prevention. Some areas might actually
become safe to walk at night again, etc. And, if you don't like 
it you can always leave and go live in some lawless place,
like Johannesburg for example.

This would work, assuming everyone had access to the same surveillance data that
the goverment did.  Yet practically speaking, the US government has engaged in
the exact opposite direction.  Not only have they simultaneously increased their
invasion of our private lives and persisted in trying to outlaw strong
encryption, but they have made it as difficult as ever for the average citizen
to gain access to the same data they gather through such surreptitious means.

Perhaps a system that you outline is evolving now anyway through an increase in
the amount of surveillance camera's (both public and private) that are hooked up
to the internet for all to peek through.

This advance only consisted of repairing a known mutation in cells removed 
from the body.  So to use it to fix all mutations in a human body, you'd
have to take each cell out of the body, sequence its genome for mutations,
repair them, and then put the cell back.  Given that you have a couple
trillion
cells, and that each individual sequencing is the equivalent of the entire
human genome project, you have a lot of work to do.

It *is* a promising advance - you might be able to alter, say, blood stem
cells without making them immunogenic, and it's great for all kinds of
research.
But it's not *that* good.

I completely disagree here.  There was a prominent study done at the
Maryland State Penitentiary in 1961, where 80 hardened criminals of all
stripes were put through a series of LSD sessions.  Since this study was
conducted by Timothy Leary & Company, the most sensitive measures were
taken to assure the criminals were given the best 'set' and 'setting'
possible.  Although many of the criminals were initially suspect, Tim
Leary was very patient in establishing a trusting bond before any LSD
sessions took place.

After six weeks, the overwhelming number of prisoners became distinctly
aware that their are many alternative 'realities' to that of crime and
struggle.  As of 1977, 67 of the initial 80 had been released, with only
2 ever going back to prison.  Lets see, 2 out of 67 gives us ~3%
recidivism.  I'd say that was a pretty darn good success rate for only
*one* study!

The fact that today, prisons are:

1) Overpopulated with non-violent drug users.
2) Admittedly designed by prison architects to disorient criminals.
3) And run as a means to punish, rather than rehabilitate.

I'd say the prisons have absolutely no desire to rehabilitate anyone;
and in fact are the chief *cause* of crime, not a deterrent.  If we
spent half the money on education, we do now on prisons, this supposed
"high crime" rate we see today would be seen as the joke that it really
is.

Speaking of brainwashing TV propaganda, the latest TV statistics show
that the number of stories covering violent crimes has increased five
fold since 1990, while the actual violent crime rate, according to the
FBI, has dropped. Doesn't that make you wonder?  I'd say the prison
construction lobby has a vested interest in seeing more people being
locked up behind bars, and longer sentences being applied to more
people.

Eugene, you have not distinguished between the terms 'sex' and 'gender', a
distinction utilized by most journals on the topic.  'Sex' refers to the
sort of biological matters that you listed above.  'Gender', the topic at
hand, includes cultural perceptions, societal roles and distribution of
resources and power--much of which at present is based on religious dogma
and primitive superstitions rather than current testing data and scientific
knowledge.

I noticed exactly the same phenomenon, den. Maybe the inability to provide
viable solutions triggers some brains to become confrontational instead of
collaborative.

A review of the Extropian Principles reveals nothing to preclude the
exclusion of abusive parents. Nor do I find anything there to contradict or
disallow the recommendations den has offered (per se) concerning remedies
for the present plague of child abuse in Western civilization. For my part,
I think that one Extropian child has more value than all the Libertarian
pedophiles and child molesters in the universe. Nothing seems more entropic
to me than to allow mentally ill child abusers to breed like rabbits.

The death penalty for child abusers (and child molesters, and child
murderers)? No, because they probably learned the behavior from their own
parents. So to end the cycle simply requires surgical and/or chemical
procedures to render offenders incapable of further infecting the human meme
pool. Or perhaps some kind of de-programming project -- but that smacks of
Mind Control.

Another problem for Extropians relates to identifying child abusers, since
most of it occurs in private behind closed doors and away from the public
eye. We often don't find out about it until the abused child grows up to
commit some hideous crime. It doesn't seem likely that anyone who wants to
sweep aside the issue of child abuse can honestly claim adherence to
Extropian Principles.

Obviously freedom-loving people don't want to tolerate intrusive government
action in the area of child care. Janet Reno's flame throwing tanks don't
bring comfort to many Americans, after all. So, while Extropians need not
support government intervention in regard to child abuse, when abusive
parents begin to organize, or to hide behind the facade of a political
party, then perhaps Extropian Principles should extend to stating the
Extropian position on this. The problem remains, how do you determine if
someone carries the toxic meme of child abuse, and what do you do when you
find it?

Please excuse me for butting in again, den. Perhaps /evil/ and /sick/ have
equivalent memetic loading. I mean some people take exception to the term
/evil/ (I do myself), and some take offense at the word /sick/.
Nevertheless, almost everyone agrees that child abuse manifests sickness and
wrongness. Rather than argue about it, why not try to find out if child
abusers do in fact have some congenital propensity to commit this crime??
Doesn't that seem more constructive, if not entirely extropic?

This does not require government intrusion. It requires that communities get
to know themselves and cooperate with tests to find out who among them has
this illness. A huge barrier to solving the problem of child abuse centers
on the fact that women commit most of it, and that does not sit well with
the politically correct feminestablishment. Male feminist pigs deny that
large numbers of boys experience traumatic emotional pain due to anti-male
policies in primary education and at home. The general consensus has it that
little boys can use a little abuse so that they know how it feels. This
entropic attitude only serves to perpetuate the problem. Who can doubt that
any organization, including Extropy Institute, can long survive unless it
provides for the emotional and psychic needs of children.

People who remain in denial about the scourge of child abuse subvert their
own attempts to make a better world. I don't think it helps to call PMS moms
"evil", because they probably would prefer an effective treatment for their
misbehavior. Nevertheless, to their victims, abusive moms do appear rather
bad, and that ain't good. --J. R.

Did you see today's NYT editorial on possible relocation of NYSE?
It's online at
http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/editorial/30mon1.html

I don't quite understand the calculations here.
$300 billion in rent - in how long?
Employee taxes - how much?
What about businesses that would have to move out if NYSE expands,
and business that would have moved in if it leaves?  What about
taxes they'll pay in New Jersey?
Can't they do, and publish, proper economic figures - if they can't
do it for NYSE, when can they?

Also, why is the huge manual trading floor still needed?
I'd expect much less money would be needed to computerize the whole
damn thing.

 I have television to thank for much of my critical thinking skills. I didn't
have the option of reading as a child, so I depended on television for most of
my personal learning... knowing what to look for is key to learning from TV.

 Cosmos, Nova (six great ideas) Start Track, Picked fences.  (First two
seasons.)  Being able to filter out the junk is an art. I know a lot of people
that watch TV to turn off.  Some people have used it to turn on.  I think as it
has gotten worse it has also gotten better.  New ideas abound on TV, if your
willing to excepted how it is packaged.

What more likely candidates to support and join the ranks of a rather nasty
kind of police state than formerly abused kids? As a consequence, prevention
of child abuse equates with prevention of a police state. Children who grow
up in healthy, happy homes don't become the purveyors or builders of police
states (or so it seems to me).

Departments of Motor Vehicles issue licenses based on testing. They don't
ask about religiosity. A Department of Family Planning could offer
certificates of training for prospective parents as a way for them to

Not much of a solution, actually. Probably no worse tragedy than robbing
children of the chance to have a home because their parents mangled their
minds with fundamentalist torture disguised as discipline.

If psycho parents tortured their kids in complete secrecy, it would not
become a social problem. The trouble begins when the community has to deal
with the psychological wrecks that dysfunctional parents produce. So I say,
leave families alone until an actual crime, violent or otherwise, comes to
light. Then either punish unfit parents along with their miscreant
offspring, or put into the public record that this family suffers from a

Or how about extending the Megan Law (which requires offenders to register
and notify neighbors) to include all violent offenders and their parents.
This would provide greater incentive for parents to care for their own kids
to the very best of their ability -- or to hand the children over for
adoption. It would also help to prevent some potentially abusive parents
from becoming parents in the first place.

I don't know, but I get the feeling you can identify potential child abusers
by how they react to discussions about how to punish child abusers. I mean
if someone objects to severe punishments for treason, one might wonder about
their patriotism. (Not that I give a greasy turd about patriotism. I agree
with Mittarand: "Nationalism means war.") Anyway, as Charlie has indicated,
the best method of solving the problem involves curing the illness, not
punishing it.

That probably has to do more with society's repressive attitude concerning
male sexuality than with any genuine concern about child abuse. Penalties
for having sex with a minor exceed those for pistol whipping a minor. Guess
why.

Oh, they can tell the difference all right. They just get very upset about
the idea that someone might actually like children. (Pedophilia means loving
kids after all.) Incidentally, vigilante mobs have a tough time targeting
*real* child abusers in the US because it occurs in secret. The show trials
of child abuse usually occur during divorce proceedings when attorneys
advise clients to lie about their spouses. Janet Reno made her reputation by
getting huge settlements and child custody for her clients by using the ploy
of falsely accusing them of child abuse.

Hmmm... maybe a "communist" witch hunt could have prevented Stalin from
murdering 30 or 40 million of his own people. But maybe not. It only amounts
to speculation. Anyway, I think Extropy Institute could further its cause by
promoting networks of excellent, competent, healthy parents. It embarrasses
me that I've ranted so much about child abusers instead of congratulating
and honoring the many beautiful and accomplished fathers and mothers who
sacrifice for their kids and succeed in transmitting definitely extropic
direction to their lives. Think I'll go take a shower. All this discussion
about child abuse has made me feel dirty. --JRM

Sasha,

	All I know is what's in that NYT editorial:
	(http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/editorial/30mon1.html)

	I guess Mayor Giuliani and Governor Pataki will find ways to
keep the NYSE by getting city council and legislature to finance it.

	The NYSE should have threatened to leave during the socialist
reign of Democratic Governor Cuomo (ousted in '94) and Democratic
Mayor Dinkins (ousted in '93).  It would have been a great _Atlas
Shrugged_ lesson: reminding everyone who produces the wealth.  We have
a federal "surplus" driven by bulging tax receipts from the bull
market.  Imagine the benefits to the global economy of a more
spacious, more computerized, more efficient stock exchange.

	800,000 people are still on the welfare rolls in NYC.  (1.6
times the population of Boston.)  Assuming each person costs $5,000
per year (and they surely cost more), that comes to $4 billion, over 4
times the price of the new NYSE center.

>Also, why is the huge manual trading floor still needed?

	Perhaps NYSE should go the way of NASDAQ.

It would also contribute to the furtherance of extropy, because restrictive

Right on. All the more reason to take proactive steps against child abuse,
because the police state (the collective abusive parent) swells its ranks

    >sentences for murder have been overturned as unsafe and unsound.


I'm surprised the percentage is so low, it happens all the time in the
USA. Sentences are overturned because a judge thinks the jury was not
ignorant enough and knew things they should not, or knew about evidence
that was true but obtained illegally, or because somebody was mean to
the murderer when he was a child, or because some doctor thinks he can
see something wrong with his brain on a X ray, of something wrong with
his genes, or because the law thinks it can read minds and figures the
murderer was thinking good and happy thoughts when he chopped up his
victim with an axe, or because he was so angry he could not control
himself, or because....


    >If the UK had retained hanging, something like 50-100 innocent

I don't see how you figure that, certainly your previous statement has
nothing to do with it.


    >However, the recidivism rate for murderers released on license

Amazing, only one murderer in 500 murders again! All I can say is that
the experience the USA has had with recidivism is radically different.


     >Under the previous regime these people would have been hanged.

Then I have no doubt recidivism rate of murderers really would be
vanishingly small.


     >We can discount the deterrent argument -- studies as long ago as

How could you even set up such a study in the 1860's or today that
could even pretend to be scientific? I have no doubt that there are
lots of such studies, subsidized by the taxpayer naturally, I just don't
see how any of them could be worth a damn, not even the ones that
support my views.


     >I don't think the state should have the power of life or

You're talking to the wrong man here, I don't think the state should
have any power of any kind, I'm for privately produced law and private
protection agencies.

Yes, hard numbers are very few and far between but sometimes you need

kathryn, this is something with which i have struggled mightily.  i carefully
approached my immediate family with the notion of cryonics, and their
reactions astounded me.  both my father and grandmother agreed such a
scheme would probably work, but forbade me from arranging their
cryopreservation.  they do not wish to come back in the future.  my
mother thought it would not work, but allowed me to freeze her corpse
if it would make me feel better.

now, i would not go against my father and grandmother's wishes, so, what
if i had not said anything, but just gone ahead and made the arrangements?
i have aunts and uncles to think about here, who have not heard the notion
yet.  obviously, until i resolve this, i will not mention it to them.  what do i
do?

star trek.  at the time (1968) the sci fi options for the tv viewer were so
lame,
it was an insult to even my 7 year old brain.  then star trek came along,
and it was a bolt from the clear sky.  i have often wondered what made
that show so very special.  i realized what it was recently while in a video
store which had a section called "sci-fi / horror".  so.  our future is
horrifying.
but star trek dared to predict a future where mankind did pretty well for
herself.  things were working out.  not perfect, but damned good.
that had a great impact on me.  spike

Ha! Perhaps. :-)    Although in reality this is due to the fact that we have
more economic prosperity to *spend* in housing our criminals.  Where as, the
Chinese government *makes* money by killing them off.
